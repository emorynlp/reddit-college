  "title:": "My advisor says I'm not doing anything, but when I ask what I can do to improve or what they are expecting as results, they refuse to tell me",
  "text": "So yeah, I wrote a longer post but I didn't get any responses on it. You can check my profile. My advisor asks for vague things, I do my best to deliver, and then they say I didn't do anything. When I ask them what it is then that they want from me or what they are expecting, they don't respond and they just shake their head at me.\n\nI really don't know what to do, and I'm honestly considering quitting grad school. My first advisor would make snide remarks about me in group lab emails and had no work-life separation (would get mad if I didn't respond to her late at night... I'm talking like 8-11pm).\n\nI feel like I just got really unlucky with advisors and maybe these are all signs to drop out.\n\nEdit: master's thesis program",

You might find it helpful to speak with the graduate advisor/coordinator for your program (you should have one, and they should be a first point of contact if you're having trouble with your research advisor).",

      "text": "So, proviso here is I don't know your country, field, or stage of study.\n\nBut a PhD or postgraduate research project is a self led project. It's not a situation where you sit back and do what you're told.  You are supposed to be developing the skills in research design and management.\n\nWhile you're supervisor might provide a basic idea,  your job is to turn that into a fuller design and activity. If you have specific roadblocks they should be able to help. But they're not there to handhold you through every step. It's not about what they're expecting - it's about what you are expecting and then trying to achieve.",

      "text": "A lot of the challenge in research is translating big deliverables into sequences of smaller, accomplishable tasks. Think about basic (maybe even wrong) approaches to the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, and then iterate. Eventually if you spend enough time with the problem, you\u2019ll have many ideas of how to fix it.",

      "text": "My advisor was like this too until I started basically requiring him to give me real feedback. I would come into his office with the paper I had written that he didn't like printed out and made him go through it with me line-by-line. Then I realized that most of the critiques he had were either with minor formatting things or the structure of my writing. I also started keeping a better record of what he was asking me for and would email him after we discussed something in person to have a paper trail.",

      "text": "Point 1: in a master's program eventually you're expected to solve problems on your own and bring new ideas to you supervisor. It's important to find things to do to fill your time so you have things to bring them\n\nPoint 2: it's possible your supervisor isn't paying enough attention and keeping good records of what you do. It isn't a bad idea to document your productivity. (For example you could just write down: Today I read two papers, ran x experiment, cleaned glassware, analyzed data from yesterday's experiment, and started making buffers for tomorrow)",
