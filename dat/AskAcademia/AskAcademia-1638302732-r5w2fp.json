  "text": "Application season is upon us, so please pardon yet another application-related question.\n\nMy applications are due starting Jan 2nd for MA programs. I asked professors on Mon, Nov 22nd if they would be willing to write letters for me. Since I've been out of school for a while, I contacted them by email and included a bit of info to refresh their memories. \n\nOne responded with a 'yes' within 2 hours, and the other two did not reply. I am wondering if/when I follow up? I know Thanksgiving probably created a huge backlog of emails and professors are busy as it is. \n\nOn the other hand, if these professors feel too much time has passed or don't remember me well, I have to ask someone else. We're getting to the point where it may be too close to the deadline to ask others. I wake up with anxiety daily and check my email to start the day off disappointed.  It's hard to focus on a SOP and other materials if I may not be able to get the letters. \n\nI know generally people only ask those who would definitely write one, but as I've said, I've been out of school a few years and I didn't see myself going for a graduate degree when I was still in undergrad. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice.",

You wrote the Monday before Thanksgiving, and now they are back on campus and trying to get through to the end of the semester before another holiday break. There's maybe 3 usable weeks in that time, and they're already overloaded with things to do.\n\nYes, send a very polite follow up. But start lining up other options.",

              "text": "The problem is that it's basically December already, and most of the month is filled with administering and frantically grading final exams, the holidays, and prepping for the upcoming semester. You emailed right before Thanksgiving, so you're right that your email likely got lost or pushed to the bottom of the to-do list.\n\nYou can email once more, but you should apologize for asking so late and you should be prepared to hear that they don't have time. This is the worst time of the semester for everyone.",
