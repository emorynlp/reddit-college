Whatever you do, make it consistent throughout the paper.\n\nI would say just use Latino or Latina (whichever is appropriate for the gender context). Those are the preferred terms used by the Latin Americans and Latin American-descended people in my life. But, an academic journal might not accept using those terms anymore. Unfortunately, academia seems to have neglected to center the voices of Latin Americans when imposing terms to describe them. The Latin Americans in my family won\u2019t use Latinx or Latine because those words make no sense according to the grammatical rules of Spanish. They actually laugh that US Americans have tried to impose these words on them. Despite the protestations of a vocal few, \u201cLatino\u201d is already gender-inclusive according to Spanish grammatical conventions. My impression is that, outside of academic circles seeking US connections, Latinx/Latine are not really used in Latin America.\n\nIn summary, I wish people would consult the people they are referring to and honor the rules of their language when making up new labels for them. That could have avoided all this Latinx/e/@ mess.",

Does Latino include all these groups except for Spain? What about the Caribbean islands (I suppose that\u2019s just Caribbean but where would a non-Spanish speaking person from Puerto Rican heritage lie? Would they be Latino but not Hispanic? Does race matter when describing Latinos?)",

Latino does not specify a language so people from Brazil, Haiti, and Guadeloupe are all Latino. Puerto Rico's primary language is Spanish and it is located in the Caribbean, so Puerto Ricans would be both Hispanic and Latino. Hispanic and Latino are pan-ethnic terms, so for the official definition of \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" the race of the person doesn't really matter, but it's complicated. Many Hispanic and Latino people see being Hispanic and Latino as a racial identity, because their ancestors dealt with diaspora or they currently are discriminated against. \n\nIn my case, I am multiracial. I have a lot of confusion when I have to fill out paperwork because I'm native (but the tribe I'm descended from lives in South America), black (but I will never have to experience the colorism that Afro-Latinos deal with because my skin is lighter), and white (but I've dealt with horrific racism growing up, especially directed at my kinky hair and darker skinned father). I don't know which boxes to check, and everyone has different opinions. I use the term Latina because it's really the only place I fit. It's all super confusing and personal whether someone chooses to use Hispanic or Latino. One of my Mexican friends dislikes the term Hispanic because, she doesn't want to be known for the people who colonized her. One of my black friends rejects the term Afro-Latina because of the colorism within the Latino community. I also have multiple friends who really don't care whether you call them Hispanic or Latino.",

It\u2019s definitely a term that was made up without input from the community it tried to describe and has become quite controversial despite it being so easily picked up by academia. Latinos is gender inclusive but I have swayed towards using Latin Americans as it was already an established and used English term for describing people from that region while also removing the -o and -a that seems to be problematic for non-Spanish speaking people concerned about gender inclusivity of the Spanish language. Kind of begs the question why this term was made to begin with if gender inclusive words to describe this population already exists but I suppose it\u2019s a fad. A shame really as transphobia in Latin American communities is a big problem and it has very little to do with wording. One would wish they would do more to combat transphobia than trying to make up a completely useless word and then force it down their throats? Almost seems more harmful to the cause than helpful which is sad because I do think trans rights is a worthy cause. I just disagree with the strategy and terminology chosen.",
