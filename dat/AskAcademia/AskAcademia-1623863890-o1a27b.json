  "text": "My gf has been working as a graduate research assistant for about a year now. Her PI tasked her with a paper and much more work. In the end the work was bearing too much on her and she decided to quit abruptly. The problem is there is a paper that is practically finished but the PI is threatening to deny her authorship and may only put her in the acknowledgements  even though she did all the data collection and wrote the majority of the paper. This seems highly unprofessional to me but I am not in the field of acadamia. I would like to know others opinion on this.",

However, if she wrote large portions of the paper (and if she has some kind of proof, like time stamped past versions, a document with an accessible editing history, emails, etc) she should fight for authorship. If this threat was made in writing, I would save it in case. Here\u2019s what I would do if I were her and had proof I wrote a significant portion of the paper:\n\nFirst, talk to PI. Get as much of this meeting recorded or in writing as possible. Document everything via email. Try to keep things as amiable and professional as possible. Explain that, seeing as I wrote a large part of the paper, I am entitled to authorship regardless of my future contributions. Bring up the professional organization authorship guidelines if they exist in my field (most fields have these. E.g., as a psychologist, I\u2019m beholden to the ethical authorship standards of the APA). Also politely showcase my proof that I wrote the paper if PI is unreasonable. If PI won\u2019t listen, go to step two. \n\nStep two: go to department head or chair. Show proof of PI\u2019s threat, proof of my work on paper, proof of meeting with PI, and a copy of professional organization guidelines. Record or get in writing everything in this meeting as well. Explain that removing my authorship is unethical. If this person pushes back, explain that, if this were to happen, I would have no choice but to report the behavior to the professional organization directly. (Such a report would be a big problem for the PI and possibly the department itself). \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, report everything to the professional organization itself. \n\nFair warning, this plan would burn some bridges. It also might result in the paper simply never being published. The PI can\u2019t publish without crediting the writer as an author, but they can just not publish the paper at all.",

      "text": "This is unethical but, as you are seeing, does sometimes happen.\n\nWithout knowing all of the details, here is my rough recommendation of how to proceed:\n\n1. Have a discussion with the PI to discuss order of authorship. Your girlfriend can note her contributions to the projects, aim to get a sense of other people's contributions after she left, and ask for fair inclusion. In general, if a person did all of the data collection and wrote most of the manuscript, they should be first or maybe second author. There are a whole range of reasonable reasons to be lower in the order of authorship (e.g., she did data collection for one of several studies to be included in the manuscript, her work had issues and needed to be redone, the writing was insufficient and someone else needed to re-write the manuscript, etc.). It would help to have a better picture of everything. Still, so long as the manuscript contains her original work and ideas, she should be listed as an author.\n\n2. Hopefully Step #1 works. If it doesn't, it's worth elevating to someone at the university. The department chair or faculty liaison to graduate students may be worth having a conversation with. It's possible that they can provide some perspective, broker an agreement, or read the PI the riot act. If your girlfriend's graduate student assistantship was part of a graduate student union, it may be worth talking with a union rep, too. The ombuds office on campus is an anonymous resource for talking through concerns like this, and may be familiar with campus-specific resources for navigating this kind of concern.\n\n3. I hope that some sort of arrangement can take place before the paper is published. That said, if the paper is full of your girlfriend's original work and is published without her listed as an author, it is worth contacting the editor of the journal it is published in. Any evidence that demonstrates her contributions is worth saving in order to show to the editor in the event that this is necessary. I don't know what would come out of contacting the editor, but hopefully this is something they would take seriously.\n\nWhile the authorship of papers sometimes changes as the paper evolves (people join the team, leave, take on new responsibilities on the project, etc.), threatening to drop someone as an author as a retaliatory measure is never okay. If they did the work, they deserve the credit, period. I'm sorry that your girlfriend is going through this, and I hope she gets an agreeable resolution.",

      "text": "As noted, this is VERY field specific.  For my area (life science), most journals tend to follow the ICJME recommendations, which I follow.\n\nIn this specific case, there are some areas for caution, mainly because the person was employed as a \"research assistant\".  Being employed to collect data does NOT entitle you to authorship - it is your job.  What generally is the underlying concept is an intellectual contribution to the work. So, a contribution to analysis or interpretation moves the same work into an intellectual contribution, and then eligibility for authorship.\n\nIn ICJME, there are STILL a couple of hurdles.  Off hand you need to contribute to revising the manuscript- AND approving the final version. A case can be made (on the hard side I admit), that without input on those areas, authorship has not been achieved.\n\nI would be quite concerned by someone just walking away, as that leaves all sort of difficulties.  Not the least there is a long way to go from a draft to a final manuscript.  There are all sorts of ways forward.  The PI could easily keep the data, and throw away the writing and start again.  The PI could simply toss the data.  \n\nFor the gf of the OP to go in hard would most likely be a mistake.  The PI is probably feeling damn upset, and is unlikely to respond well to threats.  I would offer an olive branch, and see if a solution can be negotiated that is satisfactory to all parties.   A \"sorry for walking away\" might be a good start.",

      "text": "If she collected the data and write a majority of the paper, then authorship of some sort should be warranted. However, because she left before it was submitted she cannot expect her position in the author list to remain wherever it was depending on how much is left to be done. For example:\n\n* Did she analyze the data she collected?\n* Was she involved in subsequent editing of the paper after she left? You can write the initial draft but manuscripts often go through numerous rounds of editing.\n* Will she address reviewer comments once those come back? \n* Will she do reviewer requested experiments? It's most likely that the reviewers will ask for more experiments. \n* Will she edit the manuscript to address reviewer comments?\n* If the paper is rejected, then it will probably have to be repackaged for another journal which means more editing, revisions, etc. Will she be involved in that?\n\nThese are just a couple of things that come to mind. She most likely deserves authorship, but things like what I listed above will most likely determine her order of authorship.",

Unpopular opinion, but your gf is also in the wrong to just up and quit a project. She probably deserves authorship but without more information it's hard to know. Also, writing a manuscript could be meaningless if it just gets rewritten. I've been shoved off manuscripts before- I changed labs and my former PI had another graduate student repeat all of my experiments and I did not get so much as an acknowledgement on the paper, even though the experiment was my idea and I designed the protocol. There are a lot of politics in academia.",
