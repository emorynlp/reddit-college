  "text": "I work for a company as a writer, and basically my job is to write people's college papers for money. I will not name the company, but it's one of the better-known ones that provide this service. I fell into this job during grad school when I was desperately poor and it's been so disillusioning knowing that stupid, lazy people can essentially just purchase college degrees.\n\nI hate my clients passionately. They are lazy, demanding, ignorant morons who often cannot even succeed in copying and pasting their assignment instructions from the syllabus. They aren't supposed to submit any identifying information, but because they're stupid and lazy, of course tons of them do, so I know their name, their professor's name, their university, etc. My question is, how would you respond if you got an anonymous email that basically said, \"Student So and So has acquired the services of \\[company\\] to cheat on their paper, just wanted to let you know.\"\n\nI would probably be immediately fired if I ever did it, but my God do I want to. It's not just undergraduates, either. It's grad students, professional students...students in medical fields. Ugh.",

      "text": "That actually happened to one of my friends in grad school - he was teaching an undergrad class, and one of the undergrads cheated on his homework and then refused to pay the person who did his homework for him. The person who did the homework contacted the university to out the student, and we failed him. Put us in a bit of an awkward position though, as the person helping him cheat was a grad student at a nearby university and working for this company was definitely a violation of the honor code there. We didn't report him, though.",

Instead, interviews focus on personality, \"team orientation\", and other soft skills.\n\nCheating on these assignments takes otherwise equal students and lets one get ahead in the interview queue or even land the job.\n\nMaybe the dumber one gets outed later, but by then the student who was passed over has already missed out on a job opportunity.",

At least in engineering your knowledge and problem solving skills are also tested during an interview, if it is for a technical position.\n\nGrades and diplomas usually do not matter to much - what matters are projects you've worked on and (work) experience + knowledge you have that correlates with what the company is looking for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a hard time believing that \"team orientation\" and \"personality\" is the main criteria for an accounting position and all thats required to pass the interview. I don't know much about accounting - but given that wrong accounting may lead to serious fines for companies, it would be wise to check the applicants knowledge a little bit. Grades don't say shit about applicants knowledge and most companies worth their time should already know about that.",

You obviously need technical competence, but being a professional services industry, having good client-facing traits is important. Too much money on the line for a staff auditor to come into a Controller or C_O's office being a total a-hole. Head on over to /r/Accounting and ask about interview procedures. They'll let you know. It's crazy man. They're competing for these kids so much that they wine and dine them, but just assume their GPA is representative of their technical competence.",

I had to pay bills and looked online. I was looking into writing freelance articles and stumbled across academic paper writing.\n\nAside from the ethical issues, it's a pretty cool job. Most of the paper topics I was ignorant about before picking up, so I was getting paid to learn. The downsides are that Uvocorp is a Russian company, so I often got phone calls at 3-4AM with customer requests, the work was unsteady (summers off, basically), and it's not something you can really put on a resume and talk about. Stupid customers are obviously an issue, but most of my customers rated me an A and were appreciative of the help.",

A scaffolded assignment can still be outsourced, and I can't possibly engage with all of my students on this level. It's not an issue of wanting, it's an issue of time. I often teach classes with upwards of 150 students. I don't even know all their names, never mind their individual writing styles. Even if I did know their writing styles, a shift in style is hardly a bulletproof case to present when it comes to proving plagiarism. Or maybe it is at some institutions, but I would *hope* that it isn't, given how subjective that process would be. \n\nMy comment wasn't meant to remove all responsibility from professors - there are absolutely assignments that are easier to cheat on than others and we can work to create prompts that are more interesting to students and more difficult to plagiarize - but rather to resist placing all responsibility onto a lack of awareness or effort. Not to be defeatist, but cheaters will cheat. Taking on that inevitability as a failure of my pedagogical approach would drive me straight into burnout land. I'll do all I can to prevent it, but there's no such thing as a plagiarism-proof assignment that isn't performed on the spot in front of the instructor, and so long as grades play a significant role in determining things like funding and future income, some students will cheat.",

It's not an issue of wanting, it's an issue of time. I often teach classes with upwards of 150 students.\n\nIt's a scaling issue, to be sure. By contrast, though, at my SLAC our first-year writing courses are capped at 16 and my upper-division humanities courses are capped at 25. When I'm teaching research seminars they are typically 15 students. So it's not only possible to know the students, their writing styles, and their capabilities, it's *expected*.  As a department chair I end up involved in 100% of the academic misconduct cases in our department (a few each year) and they are almost always obvious cases of simply plagiarism...in 20+ years I have not seen a case of a student buying a paper and I doubt it has happened due to the process. With major things-- like senior theses --we read 3-4 drafts plus all the other supporting elements along the way (annotated bibs, outlines, etc.) as well as requiring an oral defense. It would be extremely hard (and costly) to fake all of that even if it were possible. Plus we basically expel anyone with two significant academic dishonesty \"convictions\" under our honor code, so the stakes are pretty high.\n\nBut with 10X the number of students? Likely impossible to prevent. I'm glad I no longer teach in that sort of environment, but I recognize the model I do work under won't scale to work with even 90% of the nation's college students.",

At my SLAC (and likely most others) doing so is an *expectation* of all faculty-- you wouldn't get tenure assigning the sort of cookie-cutter, easily plagiarized stuff that was standard at the R1 I taught at before coming to my current institution.

The first giveaway was the fact that the writing didn't engage the texts at all. The second giveaway was when I checked the Word doc properties, the name of the employee at the paper mill was given as the owner. I found them easily on facebook and they had \"liked\" their employer's page on facebook and interacted with it. The student ended up getting suspended for a semester, having the incident documented on their transcripts, and failed the class. Also, it turned out they had gotten caught before as well.",

Cheating is \"FUN\" here. It's a joke to most. \n\nI had a class in undergrad and ended up getting a C in while a group of 10 or so students cheated on the exam by copying the top student's answers. They all got A's, the professor left the class in the middle of the exam and they started taking pictures and switching papers, etc. I reported this to the department via email. The professor called me in the next week and yelled at me, saying it was none of my business and he's allowed to give out grades however he wants and that I've made him look bad and stupid. He told me I was lucky to receive the grade I did. I was so scared that I started crying right then. Never again. \n\nI had a lot of negative experiences with this, but I guess it is what it is. The schools here don't care. There are services that literally sell thesis and dissertations, ready-to-go, in the middle of the streets. There's a black market for these kinds of stuff, and everyone knows it, and not many care. I've never seen anyone get in trouble for cheating in all my years of schooling. \n\nThis is one of the reasons I respect the US schools more, because cheating should be avoided at all costs but... sadly, at least where I am, it's a joke and a fun activity and part of education!",

I think the student and professor's time tends to get crunched at the end of the term and that leads to students cutting corners to tick the boxes off the rubric, and the professor has dozens of papers to grade and makes sure the student just did the bare minimum so they can tick the boxes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy favorite writing course was a microbiology lab where we had to write a paper for two experiments we did. The whole term centered around those two experiments. We had to write 3 drafts and then a final. It was exhausting having to rewrite the papers 4 times, but in the end I learned more than I had in any other writing course where I wrote the equivalent amount but did not get as much feedback.",

Unpacking it a little, I guess my thoughts are that I don't think you should take this argument outside of legitimate spheres. As in, I was promised a \"social contract\" where if I jumped through all the hoops and put all of the work in, then there would be something out there that I could earn a stable enough living off of at the end of it. Academia was presented to me (and is circulated in wider society) as a perfectly legitimate skillset that I could reasonably expect to live modestly on with some kind of career in teaching/research etc. Which to me distinguishes it from other arguments of \"i'm good at y so I should do bad x\" in the case where the thing you're good at is selling drugs, etc: Nobody in a position of legitimate authority is taking little Timmy and telling him that if he works really hard at selling sweets then one day he can be a drug dealer. \n\nWhen I talk to some of my PhD friends about what I make, their jaws hit the floor. Compared to their (precarious, unstable, temporary) teaching hourly pay, it's a world of difference; I can live off it without loans. My family don't have much money so I can't ask them for financial support while I try and search far and wide for a job that relates to my field. I had a professor for my UG who had to move to Latin America for four years just to do something related to the PhD he'd spent years getting. He now works in learning and teaching in a field unrelated to his research. Post docs are being rinsed dry by a crumbling academic system and some people can't afford to be rinsed like that, and I think the specific conditions of academia, how it's sold as a legitimate career path but is actually *so* and *increasingly* exclusionary not because of differences in skillset but because of differences in money-power, is disgusting. \n\nSo while I agree we should be mindful of slippery slope type stuff, I am never going to be ashamed at doing what I'm doing considering that it's only because academia is in such a dire, underfunded state that I would even consider it. I've already been locked out because I'm not rich, so the whole idea that me helping rich UGs do better is somehow unfair just strikes me as ironic rather than a source of cognitive dissonance. \n\nI worked hard to pursue a *legitimate* career path--and I'm going to use those skills to make money doing something I love (you might be surprised at how many people actually buy essays as learning resources, or ask for a marking service, or ask for help and guidance with their already-written papers), even if it's not exactly how I imagined it.",

It wasn't a hard assignment, but most of them just couldn't put an argument together. There was no A -> B -> C going on, just a bunch of loosely-connected letters mashed together. I went through multiple drafts with my students and gave them example papers, but still they just couldn't handle it.

I probably made my point too quickly - my thinking was that it's not that you need this step from secondary school to university (I know in some countries there's even a step in between - e.g. France or Quebec's CEGEP system), it's that US high schools teach at too low a level. Which I guess leads structurally to a need for more advanced courses in high schools - whether that's CC, AP, IB... But yeah, schools being governed and funded so locally makes it hard to reform pretty much anything, I suspect.\n\n(The German and Dutch systems are no cure, by the way - selection takes places after primary school, in Germany that's at age ten. A large number of students - used to be 75%, now about 50% - are tracked into vocational training rather than university at a very early age. As a consequence, secondary school is more rigorous - although as you can imagine, expansion has led to declining levels - but the trade-off is a rather severe disadvantage to to many already disadvantaged groups).",

                                          "text": "This is tangential in this thread but I agree with you about community college classes in high school. I think that some of the kids enrolled are too young to understand some of the things they're asked to and that school administrators pursue dual-CC programs for the wrong reasons. I graduated from a poor rural US high school five years ago. The school didn't have the resources to offer AP or IB classes so they partnered with a community college from one of the state's larger cities so that students could take online classes to at least have some option for \"advanced\" courses (which, I'll be honest, I don't think is all that bad of an idea). \n\n It was a decent community college and I personally enjoyed the courses I took, but I was an academically inclined student who ended up graduating from a four-year university. It was nice to have some variety since the high school, which graduated about 25 seniors a year, only offered the most basic graduation requirements like English I, II, III, algebra 1, biology, chemistry, health, government, etc. I never would've been able to take a Spanish, psychology, art history, and an advanced writing course in high school if it weren't for those dual-credit classes. The problem was in the school administration's handling of those courses and the students they allowed to enroll. \n\nPretty much everyone who worked at my school including the faculty and administration had been first-generation college students from blue-collar rural families themselves. Rural schools, in my experience (all 14 years of my pre-K-12 education), don't tend to attract talent from elsewhere. The people that work in the schools, basically the only jobs in town you need a university education for, are people from that town who went off to college and then came back home. They have what I call the \"working class\" view of college. People with this view see college more as job training and a ticket to the middle class rather than as education. Our principal's view when I was in high school was that we just have to get the kids as many credits on paper as possible so that they'll be closer to a degree so that they can get a good job someday. There was no emphasis on them actually learning anything or doing well or acquiring the skills that undergraduate education should improve like ability to think critically, teach yourself new things, and manage time. \n\nThey began offering this program while I was in high school. At the beginning of this dual-credit program, only academically high-achieving juniors and seniors could seek approval to take them, and that honestly worked pretty well. Kids like me were able to take some courses that were significantly harder than what the high school offered as college prep, not to mention the variety. Pretty soon, though, that working class mindset won out and they were allowing low-achieving freshmen to take those classes and there was even talk of allowing seventh and eighth graders into them, which I think the college itself had a problem with or it might have actually happened. \n\nThese students hadn't taken English I yet and didn't grasp the concept of capitalizing the first word in the sentence and were suddenly thrust into a sophomore-level undergraduate writing course. Not to mention that they were fourteen years old in a class designed for adults. The particular English class that I took had a lot of writing assignments based on current events. I took it as an eighteen-year-old senior. I had some of my own opinions about politics and could think about the issues we wrote about with the mental capacity of a young adult, at least as well as an undergraduate. I think that in most cases, if a fourteen-year-old has a political opinion, they're most likely just parroting what their parents say. I don't think most kids that age even understand what things like abortion even are (given that they'd not even had high school sex ed yet), let alone be able to think critically about the arguments for or against. The point of thinking critically about issues and then writing logical arguments about them was completely lost on some of the kids I knew. They may have the credit for that class on their college transcript, but they probably would've gotten a lot more out of it had they taken it a few years later with the critical thinking skills and general knowledge of the world of an adult. (Which I don't think is all that fair to people they're competing with out in the world for jobs, internships, etc. who took a similar course as an actual undergraduate and probably actually learned something). It's the difference of having a credential on paper versus actually possessing the knowledge and skills the credential implies. \n\nI remember in those classes from the discussion board assignments that there were more high school students than actual undergraduates enrolled. There were some undergraduates that actually were primarily enrolled in the community college, but over half the class was high school students from rural schools radiating out about two hours driving time in every direction from the metro area where that community college was located. There were kids from every school that we played sports against. They were milking dozens of rural high schools in our area. They were a public non-profit college, but dang were they engaging in what I consider to be predatory practices targeting rural schools. They must've been getting a nice stream of revenue from the high school students. Our high school paid for students to take the courses, so there was no cost to students. They had to be rolling in the dough that originated from school taxpayer dollars rather than student financial aid (found them another tuition revenue honeypot, basically). I think behind the scenes they were probably marketing to the administrators to enroll more students.",

On one hand, some of our students graduated at 18 with BAs and BSes, and I think that's incredible. We need more systems for high-achieving and gifted students to actualize their potential. On the other hand, I am concerned about treating high school as a thing to \"get through\", and I wonder what they miss out on. I can't speak to the \"change of environment\" aspect because I was in a biased position: I had some of these students as a high school teacher as well as an adjunct, so they had a strong familiarity with me beforehand. My wife went to CC, though, and in hearing about it it felt like high school+.\n\nI read once about a school that had philosophy/logic as part of its core curriculum for all four years of high school, but I can't remember the name. I would love for this to become the norm, but I don't even know of any curricula. If you do, pass it along.\n\nUnfortunately, if you look at IQ spreads across majors education majors are near the bottom. Teaching tends to not attract the brightest among the college graduates. The NYT (IIRC) recently wrote a report stating that most elementary school teachers are uncomfortable teaching math because their own math skills are weak. It would then make sense that most of the students aren't entirely prepared to think well as they get older. The people who take on those jobs tend to be interested in nurturing the young, not imprinting logical thinking on them.\n\nAt some point there's just a lack of excellent people to pick from. /shrug",

Sure, but it's gonna be expensive and you need to find someone who actually knows what they are doing.

I guess you could make that argument about any shady operation, including the hitman in my analogy. I don't think needing money justifies immoral behavior, but I understand it. What I don't understand is how someone who willingly participates has the gall to judge the people who buy his illicit services. That's just outrageous. Honestly the hypocrisy is more offensive than the fact that he gets paid to help people cheat.\n\n> What about the other, other half of the problem, in which schools do not pay a living wage to TAs or adjuncts, and/or do not materially prepare students to earn a living wage after graduating?\n\nThis strikes me as whataboutism and is immaterial to the conversation.\n\n> As a participant in this system, Do you have the moral authority to judge, either?\n\nYes!?! Believe me when I say I've gotten my fair share of modern academia's unloving dick. I am no fan of the system... but I never considered helping people cheat for a living.

If I do have proof it can get messy and ugly.\n\nIn an undergraduate course with a hundred or more students I feel like an assay is too complicated to detect and then again you'd also care less. In a more specialized course or grad level course you should be able to tell if the student's knowledge and language match the paper.\n\nIn the smaller classes when I knew a student cheated I graded their paper a lot more harshly and screwed them over in a million little ways which brought their overall grade a bit lower than what I believed they would get on their own. If I would have gotten an anonymous email I would have been forced to report it which would have led to probably nothing with a very slight chance of being kicked out of the University.",

It's really not that hard to avoid if you're remotely thoughtful about pedagogy and ensure your writing assignments require not only incorporating substantial analysis of the assigned readings but also of class discussions.Moreover, it's quite easy to discern when a student submits a paper that is not in his/her own voice, unless the have hired a ghost writer for every single in and out of class assignment the entire semester.\n\nHuge classes make this possible-- and make it attractive. So do lazy professors who create assignments like \"Write 2,500 words on \"Leaves of Grass\" by November 1st\" then reuse the same assignment year in and year out, having TAs grade them in a cursory fashion.\n\nSo sure, cheaters suck. But so does lazy teaching. Chicken/egg?",

I also work in an essay mill (browse this sub frequently and made a throwaway just to comment) and if you dislike your clients so much then you should just quit intead of whining like you're better than them.\n\nFWIW I've experienced the same kinds of people you have. But I've also encounted ESL students who are really struggling and see no other way to fulfill their degree requirements. A lot of them are entitled and irritatingly rich, but you're glossing over the fact they've been courted by Western unis as cash cows, probably gone over with a lot of pressure from family to do well and found themselves in a country where they don't know the language and where they're provided with inadequate ESL support. This doesn't excuse the cheating but it does help to explain it. \n\nIMO you need to have a look again at who you should be angry at. Isn't it sad that universities are accepting these people who are so un-acquainted with HE culture they don't know how to copy and paste course requirements? Don't you think some of the blame lies with successive amounts of marketization, of treating students as consumers, of university management letting any international rich kid in regardless of skill level because they often have to pay the fees up front? \n\nAnd, you know, stupid and lazy people have been purchasing their educations since private schools were invented. Essay mills are a difference in degree to that system, not in kind. If you've got this much contempt for your clients, just quit.",
