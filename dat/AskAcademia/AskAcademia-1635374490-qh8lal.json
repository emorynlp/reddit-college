  "text": "Hello, I am a 2nd year medical student in the United States, and I have been having a dilemma lately. When I was in my freshman year of undergrad, I did something dishonorable and cheated on an online final exam for an elective. Although I got away with it, I severely regretted my decision, felt really bad about myself, and vowed never to cheat again. After that exam, I have taken all my exams honestly and resisted the urge to cheat ever again. \n\nLately, now that I am in medical school, I have suddenly started to remember this incident, and being fearful about it. I know it is unlikely, but since the test was online and I left sufficient proof that I cheated, I feel I could get caught now, 6 years after the incident. \n\nThis class was for an elective that was not a graduation requirement, and my undergraduate school does not expel students for a 1st offense, so I believe the most likely outcome if this was caught would be that I would retroactively have my grade changed for the class. \n\nMy question is, if this was caught somehow by my undergrad school and my grade changed, would this be sufficient grounds for me to be expelled from my medical school? For reference, my medical school is not the same school as the one I did my undergrad in.\n\nOnce again, I know what I did was wrong, and I regret my decision I made as a dishonorable, immature, and weak-willed freshman. I sometimes find it hard to sleep reminiscing about that event, and wish that I could go back in time and fail the class honestly rather than put my integrity at stake. \n\nThank you for your answers.",

I'm just wondering in the scenario that I am caught, would I also then be kicked out of my medical school, because that is scaring me a lot, even if it may seem unlikely.",

You've learnt from it. Use it to make you a better doctor and also later a better leader who creates a culture around them where people don't feel forced to cheat.",

There's zero percent chance.I can barely remember the names of my students from 5 years ago, and I have never, ever bothered to look through old exams looking for cheaters. No professor does that. Why would we do that? We're trying to catch THIS semester's cheaters. Ain't nobody got time for that!",

      "text": "The good news is that you realized you did something wrong and have changed your behavior. The more prominent a person you become, the more people will look into your past for any missteps. My advice is don't run for political office. You can let this go. There is nothing much you can do about it at this point. If the guilt and worry is driving you crazy, you could ask to speak with someone in the registrar's office of your undergrad and let them know that \"a friend\" has this situation and what would be the outcome if they wrote a letter of apology admitting their error. It is possible they would change the grade. The risk is that everything since then is based on these grades. The undergrad program might not make a change and be shocked at your honesty. I have no idea how they would respond.\n\nWould you still get credit for taking the class and still have a passing grade? Would you still have your undergrad degree without this class or with a lower grade? The originally recorded grade affects everything downstream, including your medical school admission.\n\nIf I was in charge of your university, I would not expel you. I would love to have all students take honesty this seriously.",

      "text": "If you've already graduated with your degree from undergrad, the university revoking it might be technically possible, although exceptionally rare and difficult for a single instance of cheating that wasn't caught earlier. \n\nAnd if your undergrad degree isn't revoked, there's virtually no chance of your medial school expelling you unless you tell them yourself. The degree itself can't say whether or not you've cheated at all, just that you've passed your required classes and the grades (for a transcript).",
