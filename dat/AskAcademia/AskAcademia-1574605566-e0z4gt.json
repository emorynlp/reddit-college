  "title:": "Would Dr. Ross Geller survive in today's academic environment?",
  "text": "Let us examine the evidence. By Dr. Geller's own admission, he:\n\n* Gained a prominent position in industry despite not having published a single paper during his PhD studies\n* When he did start publishing, wrote and published papers that have been \"widely discredited\"\n* Received very poor student feedback, even beyond his content delivery not being 'edutainment' or dry material\n* Took an incredibly lax attitude towards grading, providing insufficient student feedback\n* Allowed students to flatter/manipulate him into providing extensions, such as claiming they 'love' him\n* Failed to attract grants or other funding, due to:\n* A negative reputation among his peers, particularly those on grant committees\n* He directly broke university rules by dating a student significantly younger than him, and a student that he had direct academic responsibility for. He attempted to hide this relationship from his peers\n* Demonstrated poor time management skills, often being late to classes and lectures, instead spending his time rollerskating around the city\n\nAnd yet, Dr. Geller achieved tenure in a prestigious institution at a relatively young age. How would Dr. Geller fare today?\n\nEdit: Typos, clarity, expansion of points",

How would Dr. Geller fare today?\n\nTbh mostly it amazes me that Dr. Geller managed to get tenure without ever being tenure track. He's hired on as a visiting professor and then 4 (?) seasons later is granted tenure without ever apparently being hired full time.",

Which means that's the number that the US government has _approved_ for our using for government grants (NSF, DOD, etc.) in particular. And we are not allowed to use a lower number than that with them.\n\nIn practice our Office of Sponsored Programs will sometimes reduce or lower that rate if the funding body is not the government. For example, for a grant I have with a large non-profit foundation they agreed to use the foundation's preferred rate (15%, still higher than yours!). And for small grants (which Ross's grant would qualify as) they would probably be persuaded to waive it altogether if it came from a non-profit source (if I could convince them that the work would probably lead to a larger grant down the line).\n\nWelcome to the fun world of American university overhead!",

The only real issue is that it's really rough to get funding for doctorates. So very few students with bright ideas get the chance to pursue them, which is a real shame. That's more down to society undervaluing research regarding human society than anything else. Really very little we can do about that.\n\nI can still relate though. It's much easier for us to get doctorates approved when it's the 9th million take on guilds in the Low Countries.

      "text": "I understand we're all in the middle of our own pity parties here, so I added a laugh track.\n\nIt's like, are we going down the rabbithole of Ross's personality and why it's unfit for academia here, or are we just talking about the stringency of today's system and wondering if our ideas to kick down the door are worth sharing on Reddit? (Cue laugh track)\n\nCause when it boils down to it, the former is more appealing to talk about light-heartedly because... At some level it kind of hurts for me to admit that Joey and Chandler have personality and career shape that *doesn't* look like Ross's whitewashed academically pure ideal of what a good young 20-somrthing should be, and yet not only is he not a good academic, he uses his 3 inches of extra intellectual height as manipulative conversational tools in almost every episode of friends. To subvert Rachel, to convince Joey he's hopeless, or to convince Chandler that he knows less than Ross about love and dating.\n\n Everything is a measuring stick with Ross and that's why he's got a worse aftertaste than *any*. *Of*. *The*. *Other*. *Characters*. Period.  I mean when I was in my early 20$ and watched it for the first time... I wanted to be him! Anyway, the extra cheesiness actually stems from the Rachel-Ross and Monica-Ross conversational  axes, where he's acting gentlemanly af, and it's tough for me even as a 30 year old to cut through his bull in *those* conversations, where he is dialing his white knight to 110%, in just one viewing of the show? The characters *take* you somewhere with the stereotypes each time you watch it. I actually find the show sexier at 30 because of their habits and the good scripting, its supposed to make you insecure but also a little bit \"dubious\" about the whitewashed junk you've just listened.\n\nAnyway, back to boohoo.",
