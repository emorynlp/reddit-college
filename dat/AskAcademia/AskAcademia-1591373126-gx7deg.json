Your school will probably have activities to network with other grad or professional students (like medicine and law) too. \n\nBeyond that, the same way you'd meet new people otherwise. Join local organizations or rec sports leagues, attend meetups, etc. I met my SO through a board game meetup, and met previous dates through sports I joined and by attending sports/events in my city.",

      "text": "Female PhD student here. Husband moved continents to follow - it was a pretty radical change in that we sold pretty much everything, quit secure jobs, sold cars, etc. For him, it meant leaving his home country (US) and state for the first time (I had already moved countries to where he was four years earlier and was ready to leave).\n\nFor us, it\u2019s worked really well, but I think that has been dependent on a lot of things: the nature of my PhD program (in the UK) is quite flexible; my area is within the social sciences doesn\u2019t keep me tied to strict lab hours or anything of that sort; I have WONDERFUL supervisors who are very trusting and supportive (quite a big one I think). But mostly, I think it\u2019s comes down to me having a pretty balanced approach to the whole thing: I never envisioned the PhD to be all-consuming or to take over my identity, and I\u2019ve really quite enjoyed getting involved in side projects and think it\u2019s really important to have a life outside of work. I have LOVED the control over my own time and the flexibility that this has afforded (it honestly makes me dread going back to any sort of work like I ever did before where I felt completely intellectually stifled and numb). \n\nI think this has all helped my relationship because I am overall in a much better place than I was when I was unhappy with what I was doing, and I have been able to share some amazing experiences with my SO stemming directly from studying where I do and having new networks. He ended up also getting his masters (something he never, ever had even conceived of), working in some amazing places, and meeting some amazing people. Of course, we\u2019ve had challenges too, but it\u2019s all part of it and we have some amazing stories to tell. \n\nI think it also comes down to general personalities and dispositions and having a strong partnership in general - my SO is a very easygoing and adaptable person, so even in the face of a lot of uncertainty we have grown a lot together - and grown closer - during this time. \n\nSo maybe more than posing the question as how you \u201cdeal\u201d with a relationship during a PhD, you could try to re-frame this as in what ways could your relationship grow and change and adapt during that time. Best of luck!",

For my PhD for example, I had timepoints for mice or cells at night, on weekends, etc. My relationship was long distance at the time but there were weekends where we had to cancel our plans because of lab.\n\nPlan well, communicate, definitely try to make time for your SO, and find someone who can understand that you will sometimes have other obligations with your time that people with \"normal\" jobs won't.",

That being said, you have to also be okay being with someone who might have things come up.\n\nTo be clear, for me, relationships with people who were not passionate about something did not work out for me.\n\nPlaces to try and meet people.. get a hobby!!

We make it a point to OVERcommunicate our schedules and plans. I am thankful that I work in a lab that emphasizes healthy work-life balance, so it\u2019s been easier than it is for some to make time. But the pressure will get to you and there will be weeks when you just don\u2019t get to spend as much time together. We try to have a date every week and we make it a point to not work on weekends if we can at all help it. If you\u2019re living with a partner, it\u2019s especially important to communicate and share the load with housework, because there will be times you can\u2019t pull \u201cyour weight\u201d.\nAs far as getting married, we\u2019ve had a long engagement (2.5 years in total) and we\u2019re planning a small wedding which helps a lot. Giving yourself time and planning ahead are key. I\u2019m trying to get almost all of the planning near complete by this December because I\u2019ll be doing my qualifying exams in the spring. We\u2019re getting married during the school year, but I have the flexibility to take a lighter semester around my wedding and we plan on putting off our honeymoon until a break. \nTL;DR: It\u2019s possible, but not without really doing the work.",

We met online because we're both pretty introverted and were not the type to regularly frequent parties/bars, etc. I was also new to the area, so I didn't know anyone around here. Getting into a good schedule and being open and honest with your SO about your time constraints is really, really important. At the beginning, we worked it out so that we had at least 1 \"date night\" in the middle of the week, and then would spend most of our weekends together. We held to this schedule pretty solidly for the last 4 years. I do benchwork and work with animals, so there have been many occasions when I have had to work on the weekends, or go in to check on something  quickly in the lab. There have also been many occasions when I have had had to cancel on plans because things in the lab took longer than I anticipated. However, if there was something I knew I had planned with my SO on a weekend, then I would make sure to plan my experiments around it. And if I was planning an experiment with a specific timepoint on a weekend, then I would make sure to let him know in advance, so he could plan to do something else and not wait on me (basically a free night to hang out with friends he hadn't seen in awhile). The key is keeping communication between the two of you open, and always letting the other know if something has come up and causing you to run late/have to cancel. He needs to respect your work and efforts in your studies, but you also need to respect his time as well. Both are equally important!  Just over 4 years later we've moved in together and are now engaged, so this worked out for us. It's definitely a learning curve at first, but for the right person, it's worth the effort (and honestly, it didn't feel like something that actually took all that much effort for either of us).",

If you're with the right person, then they can be a great support system as well. If a relationship feels like too much work and it's not fulfilling for you, I think that means you're either with the wrong person or you're not ready for a relationship at the moment. \n\nOne challenge was that I didn't anticipate reconsidering my career goals after being in a serious relationship.  When I was single, I was open to getting a job in any geographical location as long it was a tenure track position at an R1 university. Now, I'm open to different positions as long as it's geographically close to wherever mine or my boyfriend's family is.

The way I operate is that I always like to be busy and I like to travel but when I\u2019m home, I only want to work, watch tv, play video games, or learn. It is just the way I am. If I ever divorced, I will not live with anyone \u2014 sure, I can find someone but each person leaving on their own. \n\n Now, with this disclaimer, I will ofer my point of view and see if any of it helps. \n\nFirst, if you think life after phd will be a lot easier, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 You will probably be busier \u2014 the only difference is the uncertainty if you would get your phd or not \u2014 but it is no different that being uncertain about getting tenure or being fired from a job \u2014 of course, once you get your phd, all the rest seems a lot less stressful because no one can take your phd away (maybe the could but in general no). \n\nSo, with this in mind, you could be in a relationship during your phd and even have kids if you want. Relationships add stress to life \u2014 at least to mine but of course the joy of a family is also amazing. \n\nI think it depends on you. I\u2019m always working with the mindset that I\u2019m behind \u2014 but that\u2019s my way of working. I love what I do and I\u2019m glad to be in academia today \u2014 who knows if this would be true now or later .. But I\u2019m here today so I enjoy it. \n\nI do spend time with my kid. \n\nActually, Covid has been a great problem for all of us but the one thing that I like is that my partner is not asking me to go out. \n\nNow, for me it worked like this \u2014 my ex-partner broke up with me and found a younger person with a bachelor and marry \u2014 they are very happy and I\u2019m happy for them. \n\nI found my partner and a year before my defense we married, and before that it was long distance which was also ok for both of us. Then, when I had six mon the s to my defense or less, we started expecting our kid. My kid was born after my defense. \n\nSome people find confort with having a partner in academia \u2014 I think that may be useful \u2014 I think that\u2019s not a bad idea \u2014 but if your partner is not in academia should understand if you are going to academia or research, selecting the city where to work is not as easy as when you don\u2019t work in academia or research. So, that needs to be discuss before. \n\nIt seems that you don\u2019t have anyone now, right ? then what\u2019s the rush ?",
