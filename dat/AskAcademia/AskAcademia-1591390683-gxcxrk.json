  "text": "Long story short and some details intentionally vague:\n\n* PhD student\n* invited to present at prestigious conference\n* conference organizers asked me to pay travel expenses and then submit reimbursement\n* conference cancelled (COVID), said they can no longer reimburse\n* this is where I fucked up: I need the money badly. I got the final \"no\" at an especially bad moment in my life. I sent an email that explained in gory detail that on top of everything else going on, my mom ODed and my younger sister is in foster care, and angrily demanding they reimburse me. I know I am in the right but that it was not the right way to handle it.\n* conference organizers didn't even reply to me, forwarded the email to my PhD supervisor and director of graduate studies and told them to \"address\" my \"misbehavior\"\n* PhD supervisor said he is \"disappointed\" and we need to meet with graduate school to discuss \"corrective action\"\n* I have talked to the ombudsman's office and they are pretty supportive and helpful\n* what I really need help with is: I regret that email so badly. I regret unloading all my pain on people who have nothing to do with it and more than that I regret airing my dirty laundry so that now the whole graduate school knows it. I know my PI is not really a nice guy, and I don't expect any sympathy from him. **How do I look these people in the eye knowing that everyone now thinks of me as a trashy loose cannon instead of the promising young student I was a few weeks ago?**",

Know that they don't make up the entirety of the academy and that folks like that should be avoided.\n\nAlso, long term, you'll be fine if you keep your head up and do good work.

Being a PhD student is the equivalent of being a teenager as a professional and you make all sorts of mistakes. There was a PI at one of my institutions who, as a grad student, cut out pictures of dicks from porn magazines, made and xeroxed a \"connect the picture\" game with photos of all the faculty on one side of the page then put it in the mailboxes of all the faculty.

They'd be a bit less likely to badmouth you or do something else petty if they thought you were getting formally reprimanded in some way.\n\nIn reality, I'd stand beside you and **try to find some funding source to help you recoup those losses.** Has it not occurred to your advisor to do this? You still need the money!\n\nThe only way I could understand your advisor's response is if he **1)** cares a lot about his ego and sees all students as extensions of that ego\\* and **2)** if you threatened to harm those people. The latter would be pretty inexcusable, but *I'm not sure what the hell \"corrective action\" even means for graduate students.*\n\nIf you've already expressed remorse once to the organizers and your advisor, then try to forget about this nightmare.\n\n\\*While students do somewhat reflect on us as researchers, most of us understand that every once in a while you get someone who's a difficult case (**not you**).

Delta's default position at that time was to offer airline credit instead of a cash refund. I did not want or need $2000 Delta bucks, I needed $ in my bank account. My department told me to request a real refund, but if Delta didn't come through, they would reimburse me anyway. My dept also reimbursed my visa fee even though obviously I didn't take the trip.\n\nLuckily Delta gave me the actual refund. But my dept handled it the way this conference should have handled it: politely ask if you can recoup your costs from the vendors and offer to reimburse anything that doesn't get refunded.",

      "text": "Yes, getting angry was your mistake, but them refusing to reimburse is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nOk first things first, check directly with the hotel and airline, assuming you booked with them directly.  Many airlines are offering refunds and they legally have to if the flight was cancelled or changed by more than an hour, which is very likely given how many flights have been cancelled.  Check first and then call them and tell them you want a refund due to flight [number] changing from [original departure] to [current departure].  Don't give them any backstory- they have to refund you.\n\nNext check with the hotel.  Hotels are being remarkably flexible and should at least give most of your money back.  They're not as bad as airlines for sure.\n\nThe above only applies if you booked directly with the airline and hotel.  If you didn't, contact whatever travel agent you used.  If you gave the organizers money for them to book it...well don't do that again and you are kinda screwed.  The registration?  Surely they should refund that and you're not the only attendee complaining, right?\n\nContinue to work with ombudsman's office, and try to make things right with your supervisor but only following their advice.  Don't now grovel to your advisor.  Also, don't worry what the graduate school thinks.  They deal with hundreds of students and the ones who don't have messed up lives are the exceptions, not the rules.  The biggest thing is to try to get your refund and make the relationship with your supervisor better as much as you can, so that he doesn't screw you over in the future.",

First, part of it comes from the historical class dynamic of the profession\u2019s 19th-century Puritanical/Brahmin origins which sees talking about personal matters at all as uncouth. Second, academics are still dedicated to the old fiction that we are supposed to be living the \u201clife of the mind.\u201d If doing it right, as the perception goes, academics should have little to no time for private or personal matters. Taking the two together, if one not only has the time to have any personal life let alone one that is troubled in any way AND also is willing to be so gauche as to talk about it, it reveals a lack of commitment to the academic idyll and must mean their work as a scholar is insufficient and their identity as a scholar is compromised. It is astounding that, in the third decade of the 21st century, there are still people in the profession who cling to these ideas.",

You have emotions that got the better of you, and you unloaded in an e-mail that went to the person that sent the wrong e-mail at the wrong time. As things go, there are more regrettable ways to unload emotions on someone. You apologized in an e-mail as soon as you realized that you messed up, you didn't pretend like it didn't happen. Bring that up in your defense.\n\nI would put everything you've put in this post (granted, reworded/reformatted) out there and own the mistake, etc. But give it context -- the stressors you have. It's possible to own to something but give context that helps people understand. Having emotions doesn't *not* (double negative) make you a promising young student. If anything, it makes you more \"real.\" A \"loose cannon\" reputation is acquired by repeatedly doing the same types of outbursts, over and over and over and over. Having them occasionally in public happens to the best of us, when we're overwhelmed. The loose cannon also doesn't typically make amends or apologize, they just act as if nothing ever happened.\n\nYou really should stop self-flagellating, we're all good at it but don't worry, six months from now this will be behind you and you will be back on track. Why do I know that? Because I've done this a few times myself...and it always blows over, because everybody's done it at one time or another.\n\nEdit: Honestly, they fucked you. That's pretty shitty to begin with anyway. Granted the person who sent you the e-mail is probably not who made that decision, but as an organization, the conference did screw you over. So maybe they kind of deserved it?",

At my university, people tend to understand that this occurs when someone's in crisis/pain (see: midnight panic attack email the night before lab meeting).

Being in a place of receiving that sucks. As far as their actions go, there's absolutely no reason to have contacted your PI and department about it. You are not a child. If they thought you should have responded differently, they should have responded to you directly. \n\nIf your program director is good, take the time to form a good relationship with them. Having that can help you out in other friction-causing situations. Being able to go to someone with authority and say \"this is how I perceive the situation that's happening\" can help tremendously.",

Cultivate mindfulness of shame and fight it every time it surfaces when you speak your truth boldly. It\u2019s exhausting \u2014 and unnecessary \u2014 to be nice all the time.",

      "text": "I see I'm in the minority opinion here but I'll state it anyway and try to add my two cents in way of moving forward:\n\nLet me start by saying I'm truly sorry for what you're going through.\n\nYou were wrong. The issue wasn't the wording, but bringing your personal issues, as harsh as they may be, to a professional setting. You can ask politely, you can demand, you can threaten, you can't bring in your personal life. This is paramount to attempting emotional blackmail on the organizer. You mentioned that the organizer was friends with your PI, than them talking should be expected. The organizer does not need to personally pay for everyone's cancelled bookings, that's just not plausible.\n\nBut what's done is done and it's time to move on. The way I see it, you don't need to send an apology email since they didn't have the courtesy to deal with you directly, but it would be the smart thing to do career wise. Short email. 3 lines. I apologise for being unprofessional, I understand you aren't liable. I hope this will not adversely affect your professional opinion of me since I was looking forward to presenting in your conference.\n\nNow moving forward - you can ask your ombudsman or your PI to help with covering costs. You can fight the booking site, the airline. You can see if your PI can help talk to the organizer... But the money isn't why you're asking for advice so let's get to academics.\n\nDouble down. You were unprofessional? From now on you need to not mention it in the lab setting and be twice as confident, twice as cocky, let your work show you are a professional.\n\nWhat's done is done. Look forward and hopefully someday (as often happens in academia) you'll get you vengeance (or at least be his reviewer 2).",
