  "title:": "COVID-19 Effects on University Budgets/Graduate Student Stipends",
  "text": "I am a graduate student at a US university in the epicenter of the pandemic. This morning, we received word that our program is likely to lose the funds available for graduate student stipends. This is likely the result of the state reallocating funds towards combatting the virus. This includes previously awarded stipends (i.e., your guaranteed 5 years of funding is no longer guaranteed). No official announcement yet, but it seems as though university administrators are giving us a 'heads up' about this. Obviously, this news has been quite difficult for me and other students in my department. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Are you anticipating your department/university will do the same?",

I am a PhD student at a public university in Missouri and just received news from my PI that they will be cutting our summer funding from .50 (20 hours a week) to .25 (10 hours a week) starting June 1st. However, I signed a similar contract to you, which was supposed to go through July 31st. Being compensated at half the rate for two months will not only prevent me from paying my bills over the summer, but I will also lose half of my health insurance subsidy and be responsible for half of my summer tuition, which was previously covered, as well. I have applied for the CARES Act emergency funding, which awards up to $1000 to students in need [https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html) \n\nAnyone know whether we can apply for unemployment? I was funded through a grant and not technically an employee of the university. Thanks!",
