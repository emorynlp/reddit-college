  "text": "Tell me if this is normal and if you've been in this situation, how you've responded or coped.\n\nI am an Asian woman in graduate school. \n\nI joined my lab for its reputation. It's well-funded. The PI seemed to balance mentoring and the publishing push well. \n\nFirst week in, my gut is telling me something is wrong but I couldn't put my finger on it. I'd heard rumors that two grad students left suddenly, one who actually had published his first-author paper. \n\nOne day I'd also walked in on a conversation between one of the senior PIs in the dept (not my PI) and my labmates. They were laughing about an Asian postdoc who had almost gotten mugged in a bad part of the neighborhood. They were laughing because when he told his story, he was saying it very nonchalantly in a joking manner. \"Who jokes about those things?\" they were saying. The PI rolled his eyes. \n\nA week later, this Asian postdoc gives his lab presentation. Part of his work is to generate reagents, and he has generated a lot of useful, and difficult-to-clone reagents for our lab. He works very hard and is very nice. In talking with him, I could tell how he graduated from one of the top PhD institutions in the world. Great scientific reasoning. But his English isn't that great and he is kind of quiet. The same senior PI who had lead the conversation in ridiculing him tore apart his presentation, saying it was just a bunch of busy work, no scientific rationale. \n\nOther things I've heard through my time in my PhD:\n\n\"I once knew a postdoc, he was Chinese, and he parked his car in the school garage for an entire month.\" \n\n\"I thought the visiting speaker was very racist, saying that our country attracts a lot of top scientific talent from other countries. As if our only scientific talent comes internationally. But we all know the image of a professor is an old white man.\" \n\n\"I've noticed Indian and Chinese postdocs tend to be more routine in how they work, they don't really think.\"\n\nAgain, I am an Asian woman in my lab. I have been teased several times about my height. I don't get invited to bar nights. Labmates' eyes glaze over if I talk about hiking, trying out the new Irish restaurant, or going to the art show - but immediately \"light up with recognition\" when I talk about making dumplings.\n\nBut more disturbing, I've noticed that I can behave exactly the same way as my white labmates but be described differently.\n\nI am hardworking. I am hardworking because we all know many science experiments don't work so I spent my first year of grad school pulling late nights, learning protocols, etc. My labmates distanced themselves from me and have not-so-subtlely told me that I'm a workaholic. When my experiments work, they tell me that it's because I got an easy project. When my experiments don't work, they chalk it up to some human technical error. \n\nHowever, I notice my white labmates work just as hard and their experiments don't work as often. However, when they work hard they get recognition for their hard work. And when their experiments don't work, everyone (including the PIs) joke and pat them on the back, telling them that that's just science and they put in a good effort. \n\nIn my first month here, one of my grad school friends told me that she mentioned to one of my labmates that I'd gone to the library to study for a class, and that labmate had mentioned, \"She probably is really Type A about grades.\" \n\nI am not a socially awkward person. Outside of lab, I balance many groups of friends. I extend the same respect and kindness I treat everyone outside of lab to my labmates. \n\nSo I cannot understand my labmates' behaviors and why there seems to be a different response to my work style as a grad student and theirs. \n\nI am finishing my PhD earlier than most people in my dept. I will have four papers (\"easy projects,\" according to my labmates). I have been invited to give talks (for my first talk invite, all of a sudden my labmates stopped even asking me to join in on lunch). I have struggled with stress as I raced to get data. I have struggled with my social and general anxiety as I prepared for talks.\n\nInstead of support or congratulations through my milestones, I got cold-eyed stares as I gave my practice talks. I get ridiculed at lab meetings by the same PI who made the \"Asians can't do science\" comment. \n\nI ask myself whether I've done anything wrong. I have a few friends tell me, \"You need to play the system, put up a front, 'look good.'\" The way I was brought up, I respected my elders, treat everyone with kindness and respect, and don't self-promote and criticize or hurt other people. Maybe it's a cultural thing, or maybe it's just basic human decency. But anyways, at lab meetings, I don't speak to highlight my accomplishments. I don't point out flaws in other people's experiments to sound smart. I speak to understand.\n\nAnd I speak to defend my scientific ideas. But here again is another point of confusion. When my grad student counterparts speak up, their assertiveness is seen as scientifically responsible. They are giving their opinions and sharing their expertise. When I defend my ideas, I am described as \"defensive.\" \n\nThe good news is nobody can take away my hard work and achievements in graduate school. But from observing the different responses to the same behaviors between two ethnic groups in my lab, I feel immensely confused. And frustrated. I mean, seriously, you're talking about a bunch of people pursuing or who have gotten advanced degrees, treating people like this. \n\nWhat's also frustrating is that I feel it is taboo to discuss these ideas. I feel in the PhD environment, many students conform and begin to justify the mainstream ideas in the department. Not necessarily by choice, but just a lack of awareness of these subtle social issues. Like psychological conditions, racial issues are hard to pinpoint and diagnose. Perhaps they are a specific subset of conditions that we should simply accept, brush aside, or chalk up to human weakness on the part of the one experiencing them. Obviously this viewpoint angers me, but I feel there's nothing much a grad student can do. So I'm curious as to whether any Redditors here have experienced or observed similar situations and how you reacted or responded. ",

          "text": "> This is, of course, a pretty standard Asian cultural attitude and upbringing. Something that I've noticed among my Asian friends who live in NA, is that there is a noticeable correlation between (career) success and being able to 'act White' (or North American, or whatever). Some examples of what I mean by this include speaking up often, making frequent eye contact and holding it, not 'working hard with your head down', and speaking with no/minimal accent.\n\nI think that's probably the most useful advice. I came from a non-US cultural background, and had to adjust a slightly different set of habits (although with some overlap). But that's certainly it. Fake it till you make it! Different cultures smile differently, talk differently, stress their work differently; self-promote to different extent, and in different ways. American academic culture is quite peculiar in these ways: it's not even just \"white\" necessarily (European academic culture, while also white, is quite different for example). Also there are plenty of Asian academics who not just embrace this culture, but almost amplify it and shift it into an even more competitive and self-promotional direction (at least in my narrow field lots of the local culture is defined by two very successful Chinese academics). But the only way to succeed in any culture is to learn it, and adjust to it. And them maybe slowly change it from within, but only then.",

It's almost like people think that admitting they worked hard will make them seem less capable or less smart.\n\nI once asked one of my friends how he was preparing for his med school interviews and he told me, \"Oh I'm just gonna wing it. I haven't done any preparation at all.\" Then only a few hours later I noticed he had 3 books on his desk about medical school interviews. It's not just students: I've even witnessed PIs say things like, \"LOL, I just whipped up this manuscript last night!\" and I know that wasn't true because I saw them working on it weeks ago... See what I mean?\n\nAt the university I went to in Canada, students from different academic cultures who didn't engage this type of behaviour were identified as keeners (this word is a Canadian slang term for someone who is obnoxiously eager to succeed). People assumed they were antisocial, not assertive, and didn't know how to \"play the game.\" I noticed that even the professors didn't like them, instead favouring the dudes who gave a vibe of, \"Lol I just rolled into this final hungover and didn't study at all and got an A!\", when really they were up until 3 am studying. Certain academic cultures seem to value being \"naturally smart\" (USA, Canada), which is why this attitude happens.\n\nIt's not right and I'm sorry it's happening to you. I'm sorry I can't offer better advice :(",

If you do decide to confront the situation, try to get an ally you can on your side in private, before you go public.

Even if he wanted to, he could never understand intuitively. All he could do is try to understand in theory, and he's not even trying to do that. ",

You don't seem to be coming from a place of malice, so I'm totally willing to try to engage in a civil conversation with you.\n\nYour colorblindness isn't practical. Obviously on a micro level everyone should be treated equally and with the same respect and dignity. However, your inability to recognize that race has very real consequences on a larger level is leaving you unable to empathize. OP isn't uncomfortable because she has been identified as Asian. She is uncomfortable because her labmates are treating her badly because of her race. Your original post dismissed this as not being \"real\" racism which is not your call. Your point that \"no one cares\" if she is comfortable is not true. Racism doesn't need to intend to harm to be real.\n\nYour advice was unhelpful because you assumed that she has a tiger mom, used the term \"gobblty-guck\" to describe a language, and your example of what would actually constitute racism was obscene. You weren't downvoted because \"'people of color' overreact and can't be pleased\" (which oh my god, do you hear yourself?). You were downvoted because your advice was tone-deaf and inappropriate.",
