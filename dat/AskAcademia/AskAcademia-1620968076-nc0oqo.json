  "text": "(reposted for grammar and clarity)\n\nHow do you deal with lay people that \"know\" about your field/discipline more than you? Because, asserting your experience, research, and credentials makes you a cookie-cutter elitist and no match for their....umm...uhh........vitriol? *ad hominem* jabs? Friend that once studied French Baroque?  \n\n\nIf you are a scholar and expert in a field, how do you know more than some random person that \"knows\" more about your discipline? The axiom here is that you have/are working toward an advanced degree and have an actual understanding of your field compared to a layperson. These laypeople are actually the ones trying to prove themselves with outright lies despite you, the person who has studied the field for a  decade, being able to state otherwise. you are an expert in your field, have researched and practiced it for a  decade and someone with no real experience or rigor \"knows more than  you.\" So, for example, if you were a cardiologist and somebody on  Reddit/YouTube, etc. claimed to know more than you and their advice just as valid. Often the retort or retaliation for your hard work and sacrifice is that you are an elitist. \n\nMaybe an American sports analogy would be: an armchair quarterback that would coach/tell Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes how to play their position.",

      "text": "The best way to avoid being accused of elitism is to not come across as elitist. It's not a popular thing to say in academia, but knowledge gatekeeping IS a thing and immediately dismissing a layperson non-expert's opinion just reinforces their perception that you're just how they expected an academic to behave. You're automatically positioning yourself as superior by holding your degree over their head and it's quite unpleasant to experience. \n\nNow, I'm not saying not to push back if they get the facts wrong. Particularly if their misinformation is dangerous, like your cardiology example. But you can do it in a way that is non-confrontational and respectful of the fact that this other person wants to be an expert, and will engage in good faith if they value knowledge over ego. Like a student, you guide them to the correct knowledge by asking questions and showing an interest in where they got their information and how they assessed it to be true. Because at the end of the day, you are a scholar and there are always new things to be learned. I open myself to the daily possibility that anyone can teach me, regardless of their background. \n\nWhen I identify a gap in a person's understanding and I'm in a position to inform them of things to fill that gap, I offer links to open access sources whenever I can. I also let them know when I think their point is interesting but just missing a few things that I have privileged access to. It's important to acknowledge the desire to learn and have knowledge on a topic, to encourage that person's further inquiry even if they disagree with you. I might not get anywhere with a troll during an interaction, but if they're curious about the things I sent them and idly wonder '...what if...? ', even for a second, then I consider my efforts worthwhile.",

The COVID situation has convinced me that this delusion that a layman (which includes academics in a different field) can just become an expert in field x by watching youtube videos and maybe reading some papers, without taking any of the formal steps that build up to field expertise, is actually very harmful and can be life-threatening (in the case, for example, where people decide what COVID precautions they should take based on something they read, and not the CDC). A non-expert opinion does not deserve remotely the same respect as an expert opinion, and implying the reverse is a disservice to laymen and imo is a bit patronizing even. \n\n> respectful of the fact that this other person wants to be an expert\n\nIt's great if they want to be an expert, but in that case they should start by learning, not by arguing as if they have already learned everything.",

I reckon that's partially to do with the engagement between scholars and the media (or lack thereof). If scholars directly engaged with journalists to better communicate their work in a layperson-friendly manner, laypeople might not be forced to watch dubious youtube videos made by other laypeople to understand what's going on. They might be proud of the 'research' that they have done, not realising that scientists actually have a process called 'research' with empirical benchmarks and standards to follow for robustness. Extend that to media literacy and a person's inability to verify an expert opinion from that of a self-professed 'expert' and you have our current misinformation issue. \n\nDue to how intelligence is portrayed in the media, some individuals may also see arguing as how intellect and a claim to one's expertise is demonstrated. After seeing people argue so often on TV shows portraying doctors and scientists, and on the internet, it might become an expectation that expertise is fought for, not quietly studied for. The challenge I see ahead of us is not to argue and/or gatekeep better, but to better communicate so that argument and gatekeeping becomes unnecessary. After all, if a gentle conversation can turn an argumentative person into a veritable student, isn't that a win-win?",

In general, I am sick of people arguing that, for every alleged \"failing\" of academia, the solution is for overworked and underpaid academics to become even more overworked and underpaid by taking on yet another unpaid duty that academics are not trained for nor intended to do.\n\nAnyway, maybe these people \"don't realize\" stuff, but when they do it with bullish arrogance, it becomes more than just ignorance. There is no shame in being ignorant, especially in the informational smorgasbord of the 21st century. Yet, people don't like feeling ignorant, probably not so much out of ego as out of the fact that it makes them feel like things are ambiguous or risky, and we as humans abhor ambiguity and risk. So people invent whatever shit they need to make themselves feel confirmed in the absolutism of their priors - antivaxxing, voter fraud, pizzagate, Trump will make America great again... We as a society are back to primitive religion, largely because most people's epistemological approach to life is unchanged since we evolved from monkeys.

                      "text": "Ah! Yes thank you for your perspective. Perhaps I should have worded my point better - I don't believe that the current work being done by academics regarding community outreach should be increased. Instead, I believe that *more* academics should be doing what you just described scholars in your field are doing. Not enough individuals (with time and resources) are directly engaging. This might be either due to an unfamiliarity with social media, and/or a lack of professional incentive to do so. Sure, overwork in academia is another issue that requires addressing for sure, and fixing that will have to involve a restructuring of the institutions which value volume over quality work. \n\n(A lot of my work, like your colleagues, is unpaid. I'm doing all this for free and it won't matter if more people understand my work than the work of my Professor - I still won't get a tenured job in academia because I spend a % of my time here instead of writing articles for paywalled journals. The journal-work is better ranked in terms of scholarly output, so the 'outreach and communication' work at my institution is relegated to a handful of graduate support staff to cover the ENTIRE university's output. I just do this because my epistemological framework is built on the concept of community engagement, from a project's conception to its end.)\n\nHowever, I would like to respectfully disagree with your second point. I've had the privilege to discuss this phenomena with those who study political behaviour, yet I still understand how frustrating it can be to watch. It's not necessarily that we are 'back to primitive religion', but that the current structure of our media landscapes have a direct incentive to skew the flow of information for profit rather than transparency. In addition to this, tacitly understood structures relating to professional conduct have been broken after decades of unspoken agreement not to violate them even though they weren't formalised in written policy or law. In the past, our society had the understanding that news outlets reported factual information. There was no law enforcing it because there didn't need to be, or so we thought. However, some news media outlets discovered that more people will watch the news/read the news if it's sensational. By occasionally making news more sensational than it actually is, our attention is grabbed and viewership increases. (Lost Dogs! *Explosion noises* Dognapping crisis!!! *Cue concerned-looking newscasters on screen discussing a not-newsworthy event*)\n\nViewership = profit, regardless of whether the information communicated is truthful. With the wider adoption of social media, platforms for non-newscasters to share information increased (for better and for worse), and education on media literacy has not kept up with the wider range of sources. Ability to discern what is 'true' and what 'feels true' according to our biases needs to be taught and not everyone has access to that education. When a person is in a community that reinforces and validates their bias it's even harder to sort fact from fiction wrapped in factual-looking prose. We all have our biases - hell, I get tricked by marketing that seems legit but requires careful scrutiny to realize I'm being sold a snack bar that advertises its health benefits to disguise that it's still just a slice of empty carbs. Knowledge and literacy isn't a moral failing if you don't have it; What our society DOES lack - at least in the past 8 or so years - are those conversations we were forced to have before social media curated our social interactions. If you don't want to chat with a Tr*mp supporter today, you don't have to. You can block, ignore, and avoid that content entirely. But in the early 00's and late 90's, if you wanted to socialise you got out there and chatted to whoever was about regardless of political ideology (unless they wore distinct clothing but that's a tangent for another day). \n\nThose discussions with random people aired out our thoughts, had us engage with people who held differing viewpoints, and sometimes change our own. People who held extreme beliefs were literally 'on the fringes' in communities physically removed from others. With the curation of social media ensuring that our conversations are limited to the social circles we personally identify with, those 'fringe' concepts are perceived to be more mainstream as you see more people agree with you. Have you seen how groups on Twitter interact when the believe one of their own has been slighted in some way? It's not a behaviour unique to 'the left' or 'the right' - it's human behaviour amplified by an echo chamber.\n\nNow, while I don't advocate for marginalised peoples to take personal risk to engage with people who hold fringe beliefs just for the sake of open dialogue, those of us with privilege definitely should. Again, I'm not saying it's fair, I'm putting heavy emphasis on 'should'. This links back to one of my comments to another redditor on this thread, whereby breaking the barriers of gatekeeping and elitism actually promotes more honest discussion and understanding even among people who would ordinarily dismiss you. I know how I'm perceived - some elitist inner-city leftie who sips too many lattes and wipes my nose on textbooks for fun while the 'hard working' middle class languishes outside of my ivory tower. But imagine the initial shock a rural Trump voter might have if I were to sit down and share a pint with them to talk about their views for a minute. I don't have to agree - I rarely do - but to give them a second to feel heard in a way that doesn't trigger a fear or insecurity response would go a long way to their desire to listen to me in return. And if I *keep coming back*? It'll get them thinking, if only for a second. I want the bridge between us to be built, in case one day they choose to cross it. It might not be purely for academics to resolve this problem, but we sure as hell are among the best equipped to do the job. All we have to do is take the time.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Like, outreach and research are completely different fields that require different skills and training, and probably different personality types. Just as random lawyers and engineers shouldn't think that they can walk into a professorial job because they're smart people, I don't want to devalue the labor and qualification of professional journalists by assuming that I can just fart and magically become a professional jouranlist.\n\n> the current structure of our media landscapes have a direct incentive to skew the flow of information for profit rather than transparency.\n\nHow is that different from any olden days of your choosing? Journalists don't live on air and transparency. They've always had families to feed.\n\n> In the past, our society had the understanding that news outlets reported factual information.\n\n[The Wikipedia page on fake news has its history back to the Roman times and explicitly says that journalistic ethics weren't a thing until recently, so I'm not sure about this one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news) I'm obviously not a news historian, but from my own reading, I remember sensationalist journalism being a big thing even in the 19th century, and while \"our society\" may have found those storeis to be factual, I doubt the journalists writing them did...\n\n> But in the early 00's and late 90's, if you wanted to socialise you got out there and chatted to whoever was about regardless of political ideology\n\nSure - except that their political ideology was likely the same as yours, because you'd be chatting to a person from your geography, your social class, your educational background, your race and probably your gender. Remember that, until very recently (like, post-WWII) it would have been improper in polite society to address someone to whom you hadn't been introduced by a mutual acquaintance. The sequestering happening on social media is an instinctual human behavior that we are bringing into social media, not a behavior created by the social media.\n\n> we sure as hell are among the best equipped to do the job\n\nYou keep saying this as if it's an obvious fact. I think you first need to qualify why you think this is true.\n\n> But imagine the initial shock a rural Trump voter might have [...]\n\nPlease don't take this the wrong way, but calling having a pint with a Trump supporter \"outreach\" is precisely the ivory tower stick-up-your-ass elitism that gets people riled up. If you ever decide to implement this fanfiction in real life, my recommendation to you is, don't show up with the attitude that you're there to outreach to the unwashed masses, or the one who will get surprised is you.",

              "text": "Good point! Society does hold certain subjects up on a pedestal due to their history and links to wealthy circles (i.e., the Catholic Church's financial endorsement of Art History, etc). I've witnessed friends approach this by finding ways to help an audience relate to how those fields are actually relevant to 'non-elitist' stuff. One example that comes to mind is pointing out how things like classical music principles and techniques are actually still used today and not shelved away in some dusty elitist shelf purely for study. You could make this point by bringing up the use of 'theme and variation', such as what mozart used in his catchy pieces, to draw a link across to modern groups such as Tame Impala and Ariana Grande. Get the layperson to tell you their favourite song, and if you're familiar with it (and classical music theory) you can scratch on a napkin how that artist also uses things like theme and variation, orchestral arrangements, and other things which have been popular for centuries. Verse and chorus is a simple one (I think it's pre-classical music? Please do not quote me I am not an expert on this topic just someone who studied music history for a semester) which can be found in ACDC, The Beatles, and Dua Lipa's music. \n\nOnce a layperson realises that old =/= elite and inscrutable, they may also realise that the concept of 'elite' studies is just that - a concept. It just happens to be gatekept behind the walls of old institutions with lots of money to keep Latin departments open. (Yes, I'm looking at you, Oxford).\n\nThe internet can be a wonderful place. If the person's interest is caught by the accessibility of your explanation and wants to know more there are likely places they can find out. All you need to do is point them in the right direction. So the first part of the challenge is to capture that curiosity. Humans are curious creatures, after all, and just because they're not an expert doesn't mean that they don't desire to learn things. Once the hurdle of 'it's too difficult' or 'not for me' is passed it opens a marvelous door to hundreds of possibilities. Even if that possibility is just personal satisfaction from finding something new.",

      "text": "Oftentimes it's only a matter of communication. Sure, there are many trolls, morons and people with a superiority complex that just want to show off their basic knowledge that barely scrapes the surface, and there's little to be done apart from backing off. Arguing with an idiot is like playing chess with a pigeon. It'll just knock over all the pieces, shit on the board, and strut about like it's won anyway, so don't waste your time. On the other hand, most people are normal and just have a very basic understanding pool which they extrapolate to situations they don't fully comprehend, frequently misjudging and misunderstanding the concepts, but being convinced of it nonetheless.\n\nEspecially discussions on online platforms seem to create these echo chambers where laymen keep perpetuating these false interpretations (like that famous \"car exhausts need backpressure!!!\" argument), which then become their absolute and unquestionable truth. When someone with actual experience and grasp of the topic comes along explaining how it really works, they tend to make the mistake of explaining it in an \"academia\" manner which might be okay for their usual circle of discussion, but not for laymen who then become intimidated as they're being proven wrong, questioned in their intelligence and own experience. It hurts their ego, making them feel humiliated and lash out at the aggressor - i.e you - to save face in front of their laymen peers and themselves.\n\nKnow your audience. One way of communicating is, firstly, not to slap your academic degree in their faces as it will make people shut down internally immediately (\"Oh, the expert has arrived to teach us lowly mortals\"). Secondly, it's crucial for the conversation to use basic terms they either know already or can easily be understood after a short explanation, otherwise they'll lose interest in the discussion after the second unknown technical term. Third, it's detrimental to say \"You're wrong\" or to attack their experience, but rather use soothing phrases which will acknowledge their view of things while simultaneously laying out how it actually works.\n\nGranted, the last point can be difficult to achieve, and it honestly is not worth the effort most of the times. I've spent way too much time in the past years trying to engage in technical online discussions that topically interested me, but I've often found myself becoming cynical and adopting a bitter and arrogant writing style when someone steered the discussion towards disaster, not being interested in discussion but rather proving themselves. The most valuable skill for yourself is being able to determine who's willing to discuss in a friendly and interested manner, knowing when and being able to walk away without it remaining in your head for hours or days after it began derailing. Now, I mostly stay away in the first place and say \"fuck it\" when someone talks shit about a topic they know nothing about. You can't and you should not want to educate everyone.",

It's interesting too, because sometimes these people do in fact know a great deal more about some person or event or period or place than I do. Which is great. But there's a reason professional historians call the amateurs \"buffs\": they may know quite an array of facts, but they are generally completely lacking in context, theoretical or methodological foundation, and have zero contact with actual primary source material. Often they are really just fact/trivia catalogs who are unable to explain the actually interesting parts of historical inquiry-- as we tell our students, *what* happened is less interesting than *why*: causation, context, contingency, complexity, and change over time are what we focus on. Most often these buffs have read a few books or seen some documentaries on a given topic...which is great, but it doesn't make them historians.\n\nWe'll often encounter people who are immersed in bad history or even conspiracy theories. Sometimes in public settings. I've heard these people stand up at public lectures and demand to know why FDR knew about Pearl Harbor a year in advance but did nothing. Or whatever ridiculous scheme Bill O'Reilly is promoting in his latest \"The Death Of...\" fantasy novel. Since I teach and do a fair bit of public speaking on 20th c. American history I do encounter these folks, but more often it's just people who think their personal experiences are somehow definitive. (i.e. \"I was of voting age in 1968 and you're wrong to claim young people were opposed to Nixon, everyone I know voted for him.\")\n\nI just ignore the cranks-- they aren't worth engaging with frankly. But when people fall into the trap of overgeneralization or citing a bullshit book like Bill O'Reilly's crap or betray their ignorance of context I'd usually treat it as an opportunity to educate.

Do you know more in general (i.e., medecine as a a whole) than a doctor having spent 10-12 years studying and gathering experience with many patients? Unlikely. Surely it's inappropriate to belittle someone, and it's not any degree that automatically ensures universal knowledge, but the chances of someone having dedicated a significant portion of their life to a specific task knowing a lot are preeetty high.\n\nAlso, autodidactic people being more flexible could also simply mean they're often wrong and need to revisit their statements. Self-taught knowledge, more often than not, lacks connections between singular topics, preventing people to understand the complete picture. Again, a university degree does not guarantee that you've understood the topic at hand, but the chances grow significantly.",

It's a shame this happened to you and many other people, however it's IMO not the correct conclusion to say that you know more than them. Yes, you listened to your body and there seems to be a connection that your doctors missed, however it does not imply that you know more in general. You may know about something they did not, but in the grand scheme of the topic, they still are far ahead of a layman.\n\nbtw, I know this issue all too well with my partner, she's been sent from one expert to another without a congruent verdict until she went to one that finally put all the pieces together, even though it should be a more well-known problem.",

      "text": "This happened to my boyfriend recently. He just got his PhD in electrical engineering, studying technology to help build more energy-efficient lasers, particularly for colors like red and green (from what he's told me, blue light is the most common and easily-made). Some guy on reddit was claiming green lasers are more expensive because there's a higher demand for blue lasers (using blue-ray players as an example). My boyfriend was like \"I just wrote my dissertation on this. Green lasers are more expensive because there are material limitations in building them. The fact that blue-ray players are accessible is a result of blue light being easier (and cheaper) to manufacture.\" He also provided multiple peer-reviewed sources.\n\nThe laydude was like \"you're wrong, I've been building electronics for 20 years. education =/= intelligence.\" Someone else backed up my bf, and my bf just stopped responding. There's no use arguing with morons who refuse to admit they're ever wrong about anything.",

I respond to nonsense with actual facts and logic and when people try to come at me, I remind them that I have a PhD in this stuff and that nothing I'm saying is wrong. I only pull the PhD card when I feel like I have to. Otherwise I'm just a friendly microbiologist.",

      "text": "In my case, I don't have the confidence to argue with people anymore, and I just assume that the other person will never be convinced no matter how hard I try to at least explain why I think differently than them.  I recognize that I am not qualified to say much about anything regardless of my degree, I can only try to provide reasons why I am skeptical of people spreading what I perceive to be unsupported conclusions based on very little evidence.  My hope is that I can provide caution against accepting false information, but I don't think I can't do much else anymore.",
