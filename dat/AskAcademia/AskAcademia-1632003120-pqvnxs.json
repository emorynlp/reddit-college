  "text": "Hello,\n\ncould somebody please explain to me what the salary as a PhD student in the USA is? I am interested in laser technologies and optics.\n\nI was browsing through the websites but I don't really understand everything that is stated there. For what I understood - you have to pay for the PhD but also you get paid?\n\nI am finishing my master's in Germany rn and I got an offer for the PhD with the salary of 50k euros/yr without any fees. I was hoping to apply for the USA (stanford, caltech etc) but the websites don't really state any salary and I obviously have to eat something.",

      "text": "Generally speaking in the USA, your tuition is completely paid for, and you receive a living stipend (which functions much like a salary for a job), which can range from \\~$20k to \\~$36k depending on the university, any fellowships, and regional cost of living.\n\nSome people do a great job of getting multiple income streams, but I would say the average PhD student should expect to make in the vicinity of $26k +/- $4k or so.\n\nUsually your first couple of years get paid for by the university through a teaching assistantship or something of that nature, and when you join a lab then you get funded by grant money. But this is just the most common path, I've seen other scenarios including wealthy students outright self-funding their studies.",

          "text": "I think this salary is accurate for middle America but less so for the coasts. By the time I finished at my east coast uni the stipend was approaching 40k (it was 37.5k 2 years ago). Still less than what OP would be getting in Germany.",

      "text": "The one thing I know about US vs Germany is that US PhDs obtain ma masters en route to the PhD while the German system separates the two degrees. So you will still have to take 1-2 years of classes/pass qualifying exams even if you already have either an M.Phil or an MS. And that is before you spend 3-5 years on the PhD portion. To me that seems like a waste of your time, especially because the M.Phil most PhD programs give out is pure bullshit and has no real world value.",
