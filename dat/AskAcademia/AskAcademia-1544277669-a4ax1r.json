  "title:": "From \"flirty\"/nice to aggressive/nonsensical email from a \"colleague\"--how to respond?",
  "text": "I recently participated in a small conference that had one of its goals as publishing the conference papers in a journal. I only talked to the organizer a few times at the conference, but at some points I had the feeling that he was being very mildly flirtatious with me. We are around the same age and career-level (both postdocs). After the conference, the organizer emailed me with well wishes that I had a good time, etc. etc. and then asked me to do a \"close reading\" of his book that is about to be published. He didn't email my friend who also attended the conference, so I am assuming he only emailed me. The subject of the email referenced an \"inside joke\" between us, which had been the mildly flirty thing that he initiated at the conference. I didn't respond that same day because as soon as I got back from the conference, I started doing undergraduate admissions interviews at my uni and didn't have time to respond to all my emails. 24 hours after he initially sent the email, he sends me another email with a much curter tone than the first (\"hi\" instead of \"dear idratherbeinegypt, no niceties, no \"best wishes\" or signature) to say that he is not going to consider my paper for publication because I \"did not respond to [his] email.\" There were only 24 hours in between. I actually was not interested in publishing my work with him, because it is already accepted in a much more prestigious journal. \n\n\nMy question is this: should I directly address this as unprofessional (on his part) or just let it go? He is not in my field and is not someone that could impact my career at all. I am a postdoc at a much more prestigious university than he is, if that matters. He seems to have a seriously fragile ego, and I sense there are some weird (perhaps gender-informed) power dynamics going on here, and some part of me feels like I should NOT put up with that. I kind of want to stand up for myself. But, then again, is it worth it?\n\n\nShould I tell him he is unprofessional or let it go? \n\n\nTLDR: I didn't respond to this guy's friendly and unrelated email within 24 hours so he decided not to publish my paper. Should I call him on his bullshit?\n\nEdit: THANK YOU for your responses. This has been truly helpful. I'm still going to think on it for another day but I've taken your suggestions to heart. \n\n--To those of you saying I have my own ego issues, the point of including info about the prestige of my university and publication was to demonstrate that he does not have any institutional power over me which would force me to \"play nice\" no matter how he behaves. We might like to pretend that all universities and publications are equal, but when it comes to hiring committees and the scramble to the TT job that is rarely the reality, unfortunately. \n\n--The point of including info on his flirtatiousness was not to suggest that it was harassment--it wasn't. I was trying instead to rationalize why he could possibly get so butt hurt about not getting an immediate response to his email. But that was speculative on my part. Sorry for not being more clear. Thanks again to everyone who responded.",

I don't see what can be done to give someone a \"wake up call\", as I understand the issue lies on the interpretation of his actions through his emails. Without any first email there wouldn't have been any issues with them. Without the last email there wouldn't be an issue yet. So I believe this is  confined to the emails and their interpretation, as such any \"wake up call\" or \"retaliation\" would be about the *interpretation* OP gives them.\n\nAnd that is easily dismissible (his answer would be: what are you talking about?), and furthermore, it could backfire and then suddenly you become the unreasonable and crazy person.\n\nThe smart thing to do is to either write a polite email to close communications or just not answer. Retaliation is just a bad idea overall in this context.",

I might be socially inept, but I don't read anything in OP's post which might indicate that she looks down on this person for anything other than his weird, inappropriate flirting or tantrum after not getting an email reply in 24 hours. \n\nThe use of 'prestigious' is not particularly weird. You could possibly shorthand it by saying 'better journal' but the impact is still the same - she doesn't need to publish with this guy because the work is already accepted in a journal with a better impact factor / reputation / whatever people use.\n\nPersonally, I would be (and have been) put off when someone is flirting with me at a conference. Moreover, if someone decided to extend that flirting into emails and then acted all huffy and aggressive if I don't reply within 24 hours? That's ridiculous and sounds like an entitlement complex. Some people have a real entitlement complex and those same people tend to respond very badly when rebuked by women. It sounds like that's what is happening here. It hardly seems appropriate to blame OP for that. ",

                          "text": "I think we're looking at different things. I haven't said one way or the other whether or not OP should actually do anything about this. If it were me, I'd be split between two mindsets:\n\n1) This person is behaving inappropriately, and it may or may not be the first time he has done so (or will do so). Calling it out in some form might lower the chances that another woman will have to deal with this in the future. \n\n2) This person is behaving inappropriately, and it may or may not be the first time he has done so (or will do so). However, knowing that some people respond very very badly to rejection or being challenged, it may be safer for OP to not do anything.\n\nI'm not sure which avenue I would choose. I've seen how bad that reaction can get, so I'd have to have a proper risk assessment before taking any action.\n\nBut on the specifics of OP's language, I think that her motivation is different to what you are assuming. You pointed out the use of the word 'prestigious' re: the journal and their institutions. It might be the case that she has mentioned this *not* to make herself appear better than him (or because she thinks she's better than him in some way), but rather because *if* he were at a more 'prestigious' institution than she is (or if he were further in his career than she was) there might be a power differential affecting how to treat this situation. I'd be thinking: Could I run into him again? Could he threaten my career somehow? Could he threaten my reputation? And all of these are valid things to think about.\n\nSince they're in different fields, probably she doesn't have to worry about this. But that could be a reason why it was mentioned.\n\nAnd yes, postdocs (and PhD students, and academics in general) can be `awkward' and they can also be outright aggressive. I can't fault somebody for being awkward, I'm also awkward. The flirting at the conference falls under awkward please-don't-do-that, but the aggressive-sounding email after 24 hours of non-response is what bothers me the most here, because it hints at an entitlement complex where he feels owed her time and attention. I don't get the impression that she wants to burn his career to the ground over this, but it is these kinds of behaviours which - if left unchallenged - can make academia quite unwelcoming and/or intimidating.
