  "title:": "How do you respond to low quality PhD proposals?",
  "text": "For reference, I\u2019m based in the UK social sciences, where acceptance to a doctoral programme usually rests on informal pre-contact with a potential supervisor about research proposals before application. I get pretty constant contact from potential PhD researchers with a first draft of proposals for reveiw (at least one a week) and I can accept only around 2 a year.\n\nI really struggle with knowing how to politely decline proposals that are within my area of expertise, but simply not of high enough quality to accept. They might be uncritical, lacking engagement with the field, or not innovative in identifying a research gap. \n\nHow do others respond to this? What\u2019s a *kind*, but constructive way to say you\u2019re not interested?",

      "text": "My first PhD proposal (UK social sciences) was bad. Part of the problem was that I simply had no idea of what a PhD proposal should include. Once I got initial (scathing) feedback from one programme I worked hard the following months to improve the proposal, submitted it to a different potential supervisor, and was successful in getting funding. \n\nI'm now a lecturer, so I have managed to redeem myself, but I just needed that initial feedback that told me (rather harshly, but accurately) why my proposal was uncompetitive.\n\nNow I am not saying you should work closely with all 50 potential candidates who contact you. But are there any particular helpful resources that you could point people towards? Online advice or sample (successful) proposals in your area for example?\n\nThen you can say: 1. Sorry, you're unlikely to be successful in our programme; but 2. If you want to try some other universities / potential supervisors, then here are some resources to help you further strengthen your proposal.",

      "text": "Your instinct to be candid about why they don't qualify is right on. Being obscure on that point leaves them perplexed and without a better direction. But doing so kindly and constructively is good for everyone.\n\nI've seen the phrase \"unlikely to be successful in our program\" used in a way to indicate that their needs don't match your capabilities. That can be done so it doesn't mean \"you're hopeless\" but \"someone else is better able to help you\".\n\nIt is also pretty common to say something to acknowledge how competitive a slot in the program is, so while they have merit, others were a better fit for the few available openings that you have. Again, phrasing it to avoid having it read as \"you are hopeless\" is important.",

      "text": "Give some feedback about how they can improve their proposal, not too general but also don't spend hours reviewing their proposal. If they can improve it with your feedback then that's a sign they could be a good PhD student later. Many will never even reply, for various reasons, so that's a good sign they weren't fit. Think of it like a filtering process.",

      "text": "I like your line of thinking here. I still remember the very kind rejection letter I received from a professor years ago. It was during the recession, it was extremely competitive, and I knew it\u2019d be tough. The professor was candid but also very courteous, and it meant a lot to me. In fact, I\u2019d say it helped me learn how to offer criticism. I actually thanked him for that when I next saw him at a conference. \n\nWe can sometimes get caught up in the \u201ccriticism is part of the job\u201d thought process that we throw cordiality by the wayside, and I wish we wouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re all colleagues, and we should aim to foster an environment where being corrected and growing as a scientist is supported. Anyway, sorry for the rant!\n\nI\u2019d probably consider something like:\n\n>Dear Student,\n\n>I am writing to let you know that we will not be able to offer you a position in our program this year. Spaces in the program are extremely limited. I\u2019m sorry the news is not better, but I wanted to reach out to let you know personally.\n\n>I enjoyed our conversations (if applicable) and I appreciate you taking the time to submit a research proposal in <my area of research>. As you move forward, my best recommendation is to consider focusing on <identifying a research gap/clearly engaging in the field/other gentle criticism>. I wish you success moving forward and sincerely thank you for your interest in our lab. \n\n>All the best,\n>/u/TheSeaSociety\n\nThat is upfront and direct. It\u2019s not sugarcoating the rejection, but it is empathetic to the fact that these rejections are tough, which I think is worth acknowledging. In my opinion, it\u2019s tougher than many scenarios in academia because it feels like it can shift the trajectory for a whole career. \n\nI\u2019d keep the criticism fairly concise. It\u2019s enough guidance to help them retool their work, but not a beat down. You\u2019re giving them advice to get a leg up on that next application. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my two cents. Thanks for being thoughtful about this.",
