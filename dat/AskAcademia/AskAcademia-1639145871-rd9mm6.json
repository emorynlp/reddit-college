  "title:": "How to start giving more f**ks so that I'm motivated enough to be disciplined?",
  "text": "I know that motivation is not the answer, discipline is. But how do I begin to cultivate it (again)?\n\nIDK y'all, I've been struggling lately. I'm in my final leg of my dissertation maybe I have ~ 6-7 more months on my side. I feel like I was so driven and on top of things even a few years back in mid-20s. I was so disciplined, be it exercise, eating right or emails...I was hungry for it. I've been struggling the last year. Its easy for me to blame it on covid--- but I know its not. I also know that its not depression, anxiety, or burnouts (I take weekend breaks and holidays)\n\nAs an academic, a lot of our work is self-motivated where we set my own milestones, goals etc. I actual love my work, my field and plan on staying in academia. I do weekly check-ins with my advisor, and for the past few months I waste my time on the other days and so I'm always cramming to get work done just to get by those meetings. I just lie on bed scrolling for hours in the morning. I have little motivation to go to my workplace at times. And b/c its covid, no one really bats an eye. I also live on my own (no partners, family, or pets).\n\n\nFor people who are/ were in my position. How do you do it? How do you show up to the grind every day? How did you get back that discipline? I'm struggling to cultivate discipline. I've read all the self-help books, small habits blah blah. But *big sigh\" energy. \n\nTL:DR: How to start giving more fucks so that I'm motivated enough to be disciplined?\n\nEdit: For those asking:\n(1) I have been in serious depression before so I know what it entails and how deeply it affects you. So respectfully I disagree that its depression. Nevertheless, I called to schedule a group counselling for final year dissertation students in my university. I can tell you safely, that I got to work at least 3 days a week but somewhere in the middle of the week, I fall into a slump and just don't want to do anything. I will take into account the weather and thinking of getting vitD to see if it helps\n\n(2) Exercise: I actually exercise regularly thrice a week. Its funny even if I don't do anything else in the day I show up spot on at 7:00 PM MWF to exercise.",

But that doesn't mean that you spend all that time writing - some of it may be reading articles, doing analyses, doing administrative work, formatting, etc.\n\nBut yes, this is probably good advice when you're in the throes of a depressive episode and you have nothing else in the tank.",

      "text": "For myself, I don't think in terms of either motivation or discipline. I try to find systems that work for me. For example, I get easily distracted by the internet (as I suspect most people do). So, when I really need to focus on something, I start a session on the [Forest](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/forest-stay-focused-be-present/) extension, which I have set to block all the websites I would normally get distracted by. It runs for 25 minutes, and then I might take a little break before starting another session. I've put a lot of effort into making nice to-do lists (I use workflowy) so that I can easily see what I want to do next (because after completing a task it's so easy to get distracted before going to the next). I also strongly believe that keeping things in your brain (meetings, tasks, deadlines) is a strong source of stress, and you should put it all somewhere that you know you'll see it.   \n\n\nBroadly, the more important and stressful something is, the more you'll want to just avoid it. I've seen this over and over in myself and others. To get around it, you should set up good systems, pick a specific time you want to do it, visualize just the easy first step (opening the right program/document), take a deep breath, and get started. If you want a good book on getting things done, I recommend [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E). If you want to learn how to write a lot, I recommend [How to Write a Lot](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433). But don't wait to read these books before trying out different strategies and systems. Good luck!",

      "text": "There are already a few other comments mentioning this, but I'd just like to throw in my two cents. \n\nI'm in a very similar situation as you are, living alone (no partner, family is on the other side of the country, no pets), and I'm at the same point in my PhD (\\~6-8 months left), and when I first noticed myself losing motivation to go to work/working on my data analysis/etc., I blamed it on my lack of motivation and discipline. Asked myself why I couldn't get myself to go in and do the work and why I lacked discipline. I didn't want to get out of bed in the mornings, and I spent a lot of my time scrolling on my phone. I, too, have weekly check-ins with my advisor, and always found myself doing some work last minute to show that I've done something. My workplace environment may have contributed to me not wanting to go in to work, but even when I worked from home, I had no desire to do anything related to my thesis.\n\nI finally went to my school's student counseling and was told that I suffered from severe depression. I am very happy/satisfied with my life, and I felt this way prior to my diagnosis as well. I only mention this because I want to ask you why you think you don't suffer from anxiety/depression/burnout, particularly because you described symptoms that I experienced as well. If you think it's because you're happy/satisfied with your life/situation, I'm here to tell you that it's possible to be content and still suffer from depression.\n\nI was prescribed medication and talk therapy. I cannot even begin to explain how much of a difference it has made for me. There's absolutely no shame in asking for help or taking medication if you feel you need it. There's a reason why graduate schools provide student counseling and look out for students' mental health. So many academics suffer from depression, anxiety, and/or burnout, but the culture and environment trains us to think that it's our fault and that we're lacking in motivation or discipline when in reality, (and through no fault of our own) it's a condition that can be treated. I'd really encourage you to seek out professional help because I think it will make a difference for you.",

There is no way for you to make yourself *want* to be disciplined, you just have to start doing it until it's habit. You allocate time for specific tasks to complete specific goals and then you follow through, no matter if you want to or not. Then you keep doing that until you've succeeded. Basically, you have to start doing before any change can be made. There's no shortcut, there's no easy out, there's no book or video or speech that can change it. \n\nA therapist may be able to help you keep sight of your goals, address your mentality that's makes it difficult and teach you life skills for keeping organized and productive. also...   you're likely depressed and/or experiencing burnout and in denial about it, like many people. I mean, you described one of the major signs of depression *exactly*. Tis the season for SAD. Taking breaks while overwhelmed with guilt for not working is no break at all.",

      "text": "Firstly , you say you arent depressed, and yet you describe depression to a T. I would encourage you to examine these feelings further, perhaps with a professional. Even if you are not depressed, a therapist or counselor can be very helpful with the struggles you describe.\n\nMy advice: you truly have to give up on, \"wanting,\" to do things. Once you have fallen into a habit of not wanting to meet your goals, it is extremely difficult to convince your brain that you, \"want,\" that again.\n\nIt may sound silly, but something that helps me is to set alarms on my phone when I am scheduled to begin work. Once the alarm sounds, I force myself to stand, stomp my feet, and say, \"Ugh!! I dont wanna!!\" And act out any other verbal or physical protestations that I have with starting my work (cursing is helpful here). Then I begin work anyway. Letting my inner toddler voice her concerns usually calms her enough to let me get things done.\n\nI also find it helpful to reign in the goals. Instead of, \"I will write X paragraph,\" or, \"I will process X data,\" I tell myself, \"today I will begin by putting the date on a page, and recap where we are in the project at this time.\" This often tricks my brain into engaging with work without framing it as work.\n\nFurther, make sure you are having regularly scheduled (healthy) meals, sleep, and exercise. I know it can be frustrating to hear such basic advice, but not getting enough of those can seriously impair your ability to cope.\n\nI like to think about myself in the third person and as a zoo animal. Has she eaten? Has she rested? Has she been enriched? Does she need to be taken out to the park? I even use self-talk which reflects this. \"Let's go, it's time for X.\" It makes it easier to, \"just do things,\" when I dont actually want to do them.\n\nYMMV. Take care of yourself. I wish you all the best.",

I went to a therapy group for grad students for a while and left when I realized how much worse off some of the students had it... struggling to even get a few sentences out. And sometimes that's OK too (especially when you need to cite that information and check other papers).\n\nExercise helped me a lot too, especially toward the end of the dissertation. Just don't overdo it as you can cause some longterm strain and injuries.",

Most of the that got resolved within a few months. Except the goddamned dissertation. I paid that tuition for 3 more years while falling deeper into mental illness every day. So a year ago I called my advisor and said, \"I'm done. Thank you and I hope you'll still be a reference for me.\"?

      "text": "Motivation is an input, not an output.  It's like health.  Imagine a statement like \"I'm not going to exercise because I don't feel healthy enough to exercise.\"\n\nThat's absurd.  If you input exercise, the outcome will be improved health.  Motivation (at least in my own life) is an output of having needs met.  I often find that when people lose motivation over a long period of time, there's some essential need not being met.  For me, my final years of grad school were punctuated by virtually no motivation, and most of that came from the place of being professionally unfulfilled: I was done with coursework and so I wasn't getting affirmation or interaction from classmates.  COVID actually helped with this by pushing me into presenting work in virtual conferences in workshop, getting feedback, and being motivated to work on my stuff more.\n\nThis ended up being a virtuous cycle of motivation which has led to my postdoc, where I found myself losing motivation under specific circumstances: (a) feeling unsuccessful/not good at my work, (b) feeling disconnected from my discipline, (c) general malaise.\n\nIn situations where it's (a), I seek out ways to feel successful/good at my work.  Maybe I learn a new statistical technique or dataset, other times I do some professional development or mentorship activities.  In situations where it's (b), I look for a workshop or seminar I can attend, or I invite a colleague out for coffee.  Now, when it's (c), that's hard.  I have to take an inventory of my personal life to find areas where I have unmet needs like in dating/relationships or in health and exercise.\n\nSo yeah, TL;DR-start thinking of motivation as an output of being fulfilled, not an input to doing work.  YMMV this works for me.",

I'm not 'motivated' to work on my dissertation everyday per se but I'm responsible, academic and non-academic tasks wise. I don't wanna let myself down in the first place. And the best way to tackle this long *ss writing project is just doing a little bit at a time and being consistent. I have no problem working on it for a few hours every morning, with mini breaks in between or when I feel like it. I'm not a machine - I don't just sit there and work. Sometimes I bake or cook or plan for other stuff while thinking about the writing. I don't feel guilty about it because I still do some work that makes me feel on track. And that's the most important thing. \n\nSome people need to talk to others to hold themselves accountable. I don't. I enjoy not talking to people about my work because I don't wanna explain and I just wanna relax when I can. I only spend time on my phone during lunch and after dinner during my downtime but there's not much to see unless I chat with friends.

      "text": "Taking weekend and holiday breaks doesn't mean you're not burned out. People can be burned out on a thing even if they are working a reasonable number of hours on it. Burnout is about prolonged stress and the exhaustion that follows - and writing a dissertation is a stressful process.\n\nDepression also manifests in many ways, and sometimes the way in which it rears its head can surprise you even if you've had depressive episode before. I have a mood disorder characterized by depressive episodes, and they don't always feel the same - sometimes they are the deep wracking type that people are more familiar with, and sometimes they look exactly like \"I waste my time on the other days and so I'm always cramming to get work done just to get by those meetings. I just lie on bed scrolling for hours in the morning. I have little motivation to go to my workplace at times.\"\n\nSo first, I'd echo the advice to talk to a mental health professional. You don't need to be depressed to talk to one anyway - they can help out with so many things!\n\nBut second, the way that I get myself through depressive episodes - or periods of time in which I lack motivation - is that I make schedules and structure for myself to follow. When you're going through whatever this is, it's often hard to think critically, to concentrate, and to plan. Can you set aside some time to just plan how you are going to work, how you will structure your day? That way you can just put it on autopilot and you don't have to think.\n\nFor example, I made a pretty structured schedule - I woke up at 5, went for a run or did yoga, showered, dressed, checked email. Then I wrote from 9-12, took a break for lunch, and wrote again from 1-5 or 6 pm. I also outlined my entire dissertation - down to 2-3 page sections - and when I planned my day, I didn't just say I would \"write my dissertation\"; I said I would write a specific section, or do specific analyses. At the end of each day I would set aside 10-15 minutes to take notes on what I did that day and what I needed to do the next day - the book *Writing Your Dissertation in 15 Minutes A Day* calls that \"parking on the downhill slope.\" That way, I didn't have to expend a bunch of energy and time trying to remember what the hell I did the day before and where to go from there.\n\nIf you notice that your body and mind has certain rhythms, try to lean into those! So if you fall into a slump mid-week, maybe make Wednesday your short day - so you work until 1 or 2 pm instead of all day. Or maybe that's your cheat morning, when you wake up late and mess around on the Internet for a few hours before working. One of the best parts of academia is the flexibility, so use that to your advantage.",

Then once they're all in place I feel excited and motivated to work most of the time, and it's easier to discipline myself. The trick for me was making these other things a prior condition to doing academic work - I didn't try to do it while trying to work at the same time. I slip back into old habits pretty frequently, and my motivation and discipline slips at the same time, but as soon as I notice it I work on those other things again first, and it gets easier and quicker to sort each time.",
