  "text": "I\u2019m planning to give a little gift to two of my professors with whom I\u2019ve closely worked with over the past year. I really appreciate all they\u2019ve done and also the overall noble profession of an academic professor. They\u2019re also providing me with a LoR for my further studies.\nSo, do you have any suggestions for what gift could be given to a professor?\n\nPS: I\u2019m thinking about gifting a book with a personal handwritten note, but not sure about which book to give. Any suggestions would be helpful!",

I very much appreciated the thought behind them, but not the things themselves. \n\nSomething that I can consume and enjoy makes me happy at least twice: once at the receiving and at one or more times at the consuming. Something permanent makes me happy once and sad at least once: happy when I get it and sad when I have to overcome the obligation to keep it (which may take a while) and eventually get rid of it.",

It potentially puts faculty in a very bad spot because it creates the perception that the relationship maybe was other than purely professional.  I wouldn\u2019t want the student to get in trouble or even be approached necessarily, but I just want it on record that that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this, and that the university has placed me\u2014through my employment\u2014in proximity with someone whose actions cross a line and make me uncomfortable.\n\nI\u2019m not one of those people who refuses to be alone with female colleagues or just avoids them in general and I\u2019m not \u201cworried about false accusations against me\u201d because they are exceedingly rare.  But a gift like 50 Shades of Grey from a student?  Yikes, that\u2019s not a good look and not something I\u2019d want to deal with.",

For example, my institution is a teaching-focused university, and we are judged by our ability to teach our subject matter effectively, mentor students to do their own research, and service to the department/our community. If a professor did a great job teaching a particular area, helped you complete your own creative projects, or was just generally a selfless and effective mentor, you should mention it. We are encouraged to include letters from students about these things in our tenure packets. Plus, it just makes us feel good to know that our efforts were noticed and appreciated ! :)",

Your gratitude is a very nice gift in what I understand can be a pretty thankless job. I've been in casual teaching roles since 2017 (mostly teaching 1st and 2nd year undergrad so a lot of students) and I remember every single student who sent me thank you emails at the end of semester.",

      "text": "I've received a few (not too many) gifts from students. From memory all but one of them were alcohol. Thing is.. I don't even drink. So they just became re-gifted lol.\n\nThe only student gift I kept was a little chibi model (from Japan) of a Bleach anime character. That one is very special to me because it showed the student actually took care to know something about me *as a person*. I have placed that chibi on my display cabinet that I see every day and I have carried it around for years (though I admittedly have completely forgotten the student that gave it to me).\n\nAnother thing to consider: be careful if the department requires the teacher to declare gifts, especially above a certain value. For this reason you may want to ensure that the gift is not mentioned in writing. And if they are an honest person who's likely to declare everything, it may be more hassle than it's worth. You may want to offer the gift but understand if they can't accept it for 'conflict of interest declaration' reasons (even if it's after the course marks are finalised).\n\nAnyhow, that's my experience/2c. Feel free to ask any questions :)",
