  "title:": "Ethics of PhD Student Compensating a Professor for Independent Study",
  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD student with a few chronic health issues that has resulted in me adjusting my program of study multiple times. I\u2019ve recently started my final semester of courses which includes 2 independent study courses. As my professors don\u2019t get paid by the uni for these courses, I was wondering what the ethics were of paying them personally somehow after the semester ends and grades are submitted. I was think of somewhere between $1000 per professor. It\u2019s no course buyout but it\u2019s something. Thoughts?",

Some professors might even feel offended if you try to give them money.",

Being a full-time professor is more than just teaching *N* formal classes per year (aka the \"teaching load\").\n\nProfessors are expected to engage in Research, Teaching, and Service. Advising students on an independent study, especially at the doctoral level, is a combination of teaching and service, even if it is not part of their formal teaching load. That's why they're paid a salary.\n\nI spend easily 75% or more of my time on activities that are outside of my \"teaching load\".",
