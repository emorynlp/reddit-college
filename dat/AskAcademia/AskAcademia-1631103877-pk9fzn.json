  "text": "10 Months ago we sent a paper to an apparently respectable journal from one of the big 3 editors. We didn't get a review back for months. BTW, in this sub-field 3 months is kinda long, >4 months is unheard of. When we wrote them this spring the editor answere \"meh... it's complicated. I can't get a reviewer at the moment\". Then the journal went radio silence. Since the end of june the editorial manager says that the review phase has been finished. But we didn't get it and an editorial decision hasn't been made (apparently). We wrote to the published editor email address last week and got no answer. We wrote again to the editorial office using the form on the online submission manager 2 days ago... And we didn't get any email back (outside the automatic cc to the co-authors).\n\nSeriously... what now? Did the journal close down? Did they died? Who can we escalate this to?\n\nBTW, the paper was about a fast chaning field, so withdrawing it (how if they don't answer??) and submitting it elsewhere would really be sub-optimal, as it would have low chances of being still relevant.",

If they do something stupid like send it to peer review refer them back to your email and complain about them sharing the research without your permission.",

      "text": "I experienced something similar early this year (4+ months for first review, for a medical journal). My chair suggested emailing the managing editor something along the lines of \u201cIs it possible to proceed with an editorial decision?\u201d, give it 2 weeks, and if nothing just send a follow-up saying we retract. Don\u2019t let it hold you up any longer. Fortunately in my case I got an apologetic response and the review back the following week. Apparently one reviewer just never submitted. It\u2019s kind of understandable because I\u2019m sure journals, especially the well known ones, are swamped with the backlog of papers that didn\u2019t get submitted last year. But yeah definitely frustrating.",
