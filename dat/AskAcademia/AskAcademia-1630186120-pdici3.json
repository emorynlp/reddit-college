  "title:": "Unsure if it\u2019s worth doing a PhD",
  "text": "I am a recent first class Biochemistry masters graduate in the UK. I really loved being in research labs doing my final project and I have always been very keen to do a PhD in oncology (I enjoy the academia environment, collaboration, being in a research team etc).\n\nThe average wage during a PhD is \u00a318k per year, which is disappointing, but something I could deal with for 3 years. However, I have been looking at research fellow jobs to get the idea of how much I could be earning afterwards and turns out that it\u2019s around \u00a330-32k pa. \n\nI\u2019m unsure whether it is worth doing a PhD if after so many years of hard work you\u2019re getting payed so little? I would love to know people\u2019s opinions whether it\u2019s worth pursuing one or if I should just get a standard lab job? \n\nTL;DR: I enjoy working in labs and I like academia. Not sure if doing a PhD is a good idea money wise.",

      "text": "Couple of points. Firstly you don't get wages as a PhD student in the UK, you get a stipend. This is isn't me being pedantic, they're fundamentally different and as such you don't pay tax on that \u00a318k and you won't be required to pay back any student loan. That would put it in the same ball park as the take home pay of an entry-level graduate job, or graduate trainee scheme. \n\nSecondly, with a PhD you can go into industry (you can without a PhD too, but a PhD provides more options) or into a host of other careers. Your salary may start out relatively on a par with a postdoc, or it might even be higher, but you can increase your salary relatively rapidly if you make the right moves. In the space of 6 years after I moved from a postdoc to a non-academic track job I doubled my salary and people in my team who are 3 years out of their PhDs are on nearly \u00a350k. \n\nYou don't need to do a PhD to have a good career but it can be a benefit for jobs in industry, and also all the jobs that sit around science - policy, funding, Comms, public engagement, civil service, research administration etc.",

      "text": "It depends on what you want to do with it. You seem to be very oriented towards academia, but as you mentioned the money might not be great and also it's very competitive.\n\nYou can get a PhD and go in the industry in Research and development where you would make significantly more money than academia. I am not in your field (engineering), but here is what I usually answer to those in my field and I think if it could help you too then why not sharing! \n\n*****\n Reasons to do a PhD:\n\nA. You want to go into academia\n\nB. You want to go into industrial R&D & the positions you desire require a PhD\n\nC. The positions you want require a PhD even if it's not in R&D\n\nHow to determine if reasons 2 and 3 apply:\n\nDetermine which field you want to work in (example: aerospace or automotive?)\n\nDetermine which area within the field you want to work in (example: for aerospace, you want to work in fluid (CFD) or solid mechanics (FEA, CAD)?)\n\nDetermine which role you want to do (example: for aerospace and fluid mechanics, do you want to work on improving turbines or the combustion systems?)\n\nLook online at job ads (preferably entry-level) for the position you want in the field and area of your choice.\n\n-If you see ''PhD'' listed, then it's worth doing a PhD.\n\n-If you see ''master or PhD'' listed, then assume that a PhD is preferred, but a master will be considered especially if you can compensate with 2-3 years of relevant experience.\n\n-If you see '' bachelor or master'' or only ''master'', then assume they either can't afford someone with a PhD or do not think that a PhD is necessary for the tasks of the role. In other words, a PhD will overqualify you, so don't bother doing one and consider a master instead. If you only have a bachelor, you will most likely be able to get the position if you have previous relevant work experience (can be through internships for level-entry roles)\n\n-If you see '' bachelor''.. then no need for grad studies. However, try to find similar job positions and see if they also only require a bachelor or if it's just an exception with that company.\n\n-You might see '' bachelor, master or PhD''. It often means that they consider a master and a PhD to be equivalent to years of experience, so if you apply with just a bachelor you will need to have more years of work experience in the field to be considered compared to someone that just got their PhD. Same thing if you have a master, although fewer years of experience will be considered compared to someone with only a Bachelor. (Some people chose to spend years doing internships at R&D companies and delaying their bachelor graduation to get a chance to be hired without a graduate degree. It's mostly this type of applicant that are concerned by the inclusion of ''bachelor'' in the requirements of such job ads.)\n\nIt's up to you to determine in which situation you think you might fit to be considered a serious applicant or not. If you don't think you have the relevant work experience for what you want to do to be considered with just a bachelor or master even with work experience, then do a PhD. \n\n****\n\nAgain sorry if the examples are not targeted towards your field. But I think you get a general idea of what I meant. Also yes there is money, but you should also be happy with what you do. If academia is what you want to do, then go for the PhD regardless of the pay. Good luck to you",

This wasn't even a major shift in career path. It isn't a great feeling being in your late 20s, having no pension pot and watching house prices climb out of control. \n\nA PhD can be worth it but also be aware you are often treated as entry level if you enter industry after (could differ in biochem). Postdocs eventually cap at around 36k I believe which isn't bad, but the job insecurity is a bigger factor to consider.
