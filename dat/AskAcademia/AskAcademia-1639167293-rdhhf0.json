Its easier to have a 4.0 at some schools, and others might not even offer the same classes or opportunities. Not all \"A\"s are created equal, and standardized tests help schools see that.\n\nThey work alright because the tests tell schools how good a student is at, well, taking tests. Thats mostly what college is, so it works alright. When you get into research education, tests are not great indicators, and schools usually dont care as much at that point anyway. They weigh experience and existing research much more heavily.\n\nEdit:\nI dont work in admissions. I have been through this process many times for school, college, grad school, etc.",

Students with low quantitative GRE scores consistently score lower on evaluations of results sections (where students need to use and describe statistics). Students with low writing scores consistently score lower on ratings of paper style and structure.",

They either cheated their way through highschool, or their teachers gave them good grades out of pity or pressure from administrators. Teachers are often not allowed to give bad grades.   \nNot every highschool. But many highschools.   \nI've seen students with highschool GPA's of 3.8 who can't do basic geometry (like calculating the area of a circle), or who can't convert meters to kilometers. Some can barely write a sentence or a paragraph. \n\nSo ACT and SAT scores are the only way to actually know if a student can, for example, solve basic math problems, or read a paragraph and answer basic questions about it.   \nYou can't cheat on the ACT or SAT. There are no extra credit points. The test doesn't care how hard you tried, or how much time you spent studying. All the test cares is ***whether you can answer the questions correctly.***",

Their interviews and transcript calibrations could have always been not very effective and that deficiency was being obscured by the SAT/ACT cuts. Now it's clearly they need to adjust their interview process and transcript calibrations to make them more indicative of future student success.

Aside from the GRE, we have GPA, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and statements of purpose. We've looked at the data: The GRE predicts student success above and beyond these other predictors.\n\nLike many other departments across the country, we discussed removing the GRE requirement. Most of us, including me, want to see it go away. However, we decided that we cannot remove it without a suitable replacent. Removing it without a replacement will negatively affect our admission decisions.\n\nBlanket statements like \"the GRE is useless\" or \"the GRE has no predictive power\" oversimplify a complex and important issue. No, the GRE is not useless. Yes, it does have predictive power. If you want to get rid of it, you need something to take its place. Having less information about something is not better.",

Students who are under-prepared are less likely to receive financial support, which leads to more money out of pocket or more loans. They are also more likely to struggle in the program. Best case, this just costs faculty mentors and instructors time. Worst case, the student invests money into a degree that doesn't earn them employment, or they accrue debt and don't get a degree show for it. These are costs that are more important minimize, in my opinion, and keeping in the GRE can help with that (until it is replaced).\n\nI just hope that whoever reads this discussion comes out appreciating that it's a complex issue.

That's not always the case, because it is not always the case that it contributes nothing.\n\nSure, it's absolutely valid to question the validity of a test. ETS has a team of statisticians who's job is to make sure that the GRE is valid. It's surely more valid that most classroom exams (which, like the GRE, are measuring psychological constructs). If you see no validity issues with those, then you shouldn't see a validity issue with the GRE.\n\nRegarding the science bit: the GRE is an aptitude test, like the IQ test. Tests like these have been around for over a century. They are rooted in Psychology. \n\nGPA is consistently shown to be a strong predictor of graduate school success, even though it is unclear what it measures (it likely measures a vast array of abilities). My point is that you don't need to know exactly what something is measuring for it to be useful for prediction. Same point applies to the GRE.
