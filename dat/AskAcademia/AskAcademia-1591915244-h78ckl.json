  "title:": "UPDATE: LWIFU. How did I recover?",
  "text": "(Translation: Last Week I Fucked Up.) \n\nI posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/gxcxrk/tifu_how_do_i_recover/) last week and got a ton of good advice, and some requests for an update. Long story short, I \"met\" (remotely) with my PI and some muckety-mucks from my graduate program, and it was painfully awkward but ultimately fine. They had a \"not angry, just disappointed\" tone. Most of the meeting was logistics about how to recoup the lost money. It turns out I have some funds from a fellowship that I didn't realize could be used this way, and they made sure I had all the necessary permissions to get reimbursed that way. But each one of them made sure to remind me how important it is to maintain composure, to represent the program well, etc. They presented it like \"just trying to help you out here\" as if I had no idea that I had fucked up. But I just took the note and didn't argue with them.\n\nThere was one more uncomfortable but nice(ish) coda to the whole situation. An even higher higher-up called me on the phone after the meeting. He said my email debacle had made its way to him. At first my stomach sank and I thought this was the moment they were going to actually reprimand me in some way. Instead, he said he had no idea I was going through so much, and asked if he could help. I nearly started crying but I just thanked him and tried to get off the phone as quickly as possibly. I know he meant it kindly but to be honest I just want the whole thing to go away and I felt even more embarrassed that it clearly was getting forwarded around. But it is nice to know there are some actual human beings running this show.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the advice. Now to put this all behind me.",

This is such odd behaviour to me, maybe I'm just lucky but all the supervisors I've had would focus on the personal first and ensure your okay mentally before advising you gently on how to better conduct yourself in emails. Bottom of the priorities is how you represent the programme. \n\nYou're human, you were grieving, for apologised, now forgive yourself and move on. Good luck!",

Dragging the conference chairs\u2019 ass over hot coals.\n\n**They used a national disaster as an excuse to steal money from grad students.** I know you said that they had legalese to cover their asses, but all that means is that you can\u2019t sue them. It definitely doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t drag their names all over the academic world. They used a national disaster as an excuse to steal money from grad students, and then used a moment of weakness to make the student they were stealing from feel like shit. They\u2019re the bad guys in this story.",

In general, the golden rule is: as long as your institution is not dysfunctional, you first address issues internally, and you rely on your institution to deal with external issues. This rule is true at any level.\n\nJust a thing about your higher-higher up.\n\nIn labs, we value highly PhD students. They do a large share of our research. We have to fight to find fundings for them. We are held partly responsible when a PhD goes wrong (except just not in front of the student: remember the golden rule). And so we care about them. A lot. I always found the German expression for PI (\"Doktorvater\", doctor father) quite telling. And there is a lot of ways in which you can get help, and you must not hesitate to use it.",
