  "text": "We\u2019ve all seen the data about how hard it is for English PhDs to get TT/professorial jobs, so I\u2019m curious to know what those with a PhD in literature have moved into. Maybe it\u2019ll help those who are soon to graduate or who are considering entering a program. \n\nFor example, a colleague of mine had a PhD in women\u2019s literature and ended up becoming the director of a women\u2019s center at a US university. Still in higher ed, I suppose, but not as a professor.",

But, if someone coming out of a PhD in English lit. wanted to stay in academia without going through post-doc purgatory, or if they just couldn't find anything a few years out, they could do the MLIS. The PhD would put them in a far better position competing for academic librarian positions. I know it's not ideal to do another degree, but it's a good option for someone who wants to stay in the realm of academia but isn't making it to tenured professor. Academic librarians usually have a \"research\" output and will teach information literacy classes, so it is fairly related to the professor role.",
