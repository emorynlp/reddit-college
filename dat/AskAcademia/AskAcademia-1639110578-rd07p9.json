  "text": "Bonus points if you're in a scientific discipline. I'm obtaining my Masters currently in ecology and have been entertaining the thought of obtaining a PhD. I just look at all of the jobs available in my area for a Masters degree and, while I love field work a lot more than lab work, all of these positions seem like they would lack intellectual stimulation. \n\nI do not directly know what I want to do for a career, though I have been entertaining the thought of becoming a professor or going into some sort of conservation research. I would like to work for (roughly, maybe longer) 2-3 years before pursuing a PhD, if that's what I end up deciding to do. \n\nHowever, I see so many posts on here that are overwhelmingly negative regarding PhD work. These experiences have been very illuminating to me in what to watch out for and what hardships I might experience. But I would love to also weigh what the benefits have been for people who are in the process of achieving their PhD or have already done so.",

      "text": "If you look at grad student surveys, typically 85% of students are satisfied or very satisfied with their grad school. About 8% are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. Percentages are about the same for their PI, w a large majority satisfied. Social media is a place for people to vent, so it is heavily biased to the negative. There are some very bad PIs and some toxic places, but most are good.",

      "text": "I did my PhD in ecology and was pretty happy with it. The first year was somewhat stressful due to a shitty advisor antaking more courses than I should have, but once my advisor and I split ways during my second year, things went a lot more smoothly. I ended up securing my own grant money for my research and my new advisor was pretty hands-off, so research was stress-free other than delays due to covid. I really liked my teaching assistantships, too. \n\nHowever, there were several people in my program who had a rotten time and a few dropped out. Our program director was more concerned with growing the online masters program than supporting the PhD students and was very bad with ensuring everyone had proper funding. She was also super vindictive when someone pissed her off. But if you just steered clear of her all together, it was fine. \n\nPrelims and my defense were also extremely easy and stress-free. A lot of people describe one or both as being basically hazing, but I didn't have that experience. My research went in spurts of doing a lot of stuff at once and then waiting for a long time, so I also didn't have the issue of slaving away in the lab 12 hours per day. In fact, I had a lot of free time in my last 3 years after my coursework was done. I took up martial arts, did a lot of hiking, and watched a lot of SciFi.\n\nI scored a tenure track job at a SLAC after graduation, but the academic job market is super tough. Ecology positions are few and far between and it basically comes down to if you have the particular research background the school is looking for and decent teaching experience, depending on the position. And there are a lot of folks with postdoctoral experience out there competing for the same jobs.",

Firstly, I am glad that I got some work experience before starting my PhD, both inside and outside of academia, so that I can now appreciate all the freedom that academia has given me (and also that I am a bit older now). Secondly, I think the research group and supervisor you have is much more important for the success/enjoyment of your PhD than the actual field of study. And thirdly, it is worth noting that experiences - and salaries! - differ a lot between countries. I moved abroad to the UK.",

The PhD was extremely challenging (especially at the start, when I was very out of my depth), but I was surrounded by a very supportive cohort of grad students, had a fantastic advisor who is still one of my closest mentors, and learned so, so much.

      "text": "It's a while back. I'd say yes and no. It was a huge mental slog and I was at Oxbridge where I didn't really fit with the culture and the University had (and still has) issues with behaviour. That said I made the greatest friends of my life who are still my closest friends many years on, even as we've at various times moved around the world. It exposed me to a whole other world and opportunities I didn't see at UG, it eventually lead to me living overseas for a few years and although not an academic I still work in academia and have a career that's had its difficult moments but that I have to pinch myself sometimes about because I can't believe what I get to do and where I am. I think academia has a huge problem with toxic behaviour and no student should ever have to go through what I experienced (and worse) and I'm proud I'm actively involved in making it better at an organisation that is determined to create a positive culture for everyone. I can't unpick the bad from the good, but while I think it's led somewhere incredibly good for me and shaped me, it was also extremely difficult and did damage my mental health.",

      "text": "I did my PhD in law, and I loved it. I had a good supervisor who understood where I was going with my work and was happy to let me get on with it without trying to manage me. I found it intellectually stimulating and enjoyable and not particularly stressful. \n\nI think it helped that I kept an active social life outside of my PhD - I found that when PhD students socialise they tend to talk only about their PhD experiences. If you do that enough, especially if most of your social interaction is with other PhD students, then it begins to feel like this all-encompassing thing that takes over your life. And I found that other people's PhD troubles become your PhD troubles, and begin to affect how you think and feel about your own work. Once I realised this I spent my social time instead with friends who were not doing a PhD, who had no interest in academic work, and who couldn't care less about my PhD beyond wanting to know that I was doing well and enjoying it. I hung out with and shared experiences with and listened sympathetically to other students when I was on campus, of course, but outside of 'working hours' I hung out with non-academic people.\n\nAlso - I did a PhD because I was intellectually interested in the topic, not because I hoped to get any kind of career out of it, so I didn't take it too seriously. I didn't dedicate all my time to it, I didn't get stressed about deadlines, I didn't make myself work unsociable hours at weekends and evenings. I did what I found interesting, read and wrote what I felt like reading and writing, and when I stopped being interested or couldn't be bothered or whatever I went and did other things instead until I was ready to come back to it.\n\nI finished in three years and I'm now a postdoc, but I would happily have done my PhD again. I approach my postdoc in the same way - don't let it become all-encompassing, don't take it too seriously, keep a life outside of academia - and so far so good.",

When I started my grad school , I made sure to tell everyone that I'm doing this just to further my job prospects in industry and never going into academia. Period. My prof is pretty cool about it and I only pursued projects that required very technical skillsets (e.g, modeling, coding) to produce results. Even then, I tried hard to implement techniques and skills that I think would be attractive for employers.\n\nAnyway, so far it seems it's working out. I did an internship with a tech company last summer and currently secured an internship with a major company for this summer. Personally I see money as *the* motivator and the opportunity cost of me doing a PhD is very very low. I couldn't have had gotten any high paying jobs without a graduate degree so yeah. At the end of the day, it's really what you want to get from your PhD.",
