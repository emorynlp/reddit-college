  "text": "Hello. I'm a researcher in a STEM field, formerly rather successful in terms of published papers, etc. Around three years ago I had a revelation that my research is nonsense: I'm publishing stuff that's peer reviewed by a clique, and read and applied by no one else.  I will be looking to move out of academia, but: (1) firstly I need to work my technical skills to be up-to-date with what industry wants; (2) I need to shed all the negative energy and bitterness that I amassed throughout these years. \n\nSo far (2) has been a real problem for me, partly due to being in my forties and never have worked outside of academia. I would really appreciate sharing positive stories and resources.",

      "text": "> my research is nonsense\n\n> never have worked outside of academia\n\nI'm not in STEM and I'm not middle-aged, but I have worked outside of academia and, based on that, I want to encourage you to temper your expectations of what life outside of academia is like. If you're burned out on your job, changing your job is definitely an avenue you should consider, but it's not your only avenue and I don't think that automatically privileging it is a good idea if it turns out that you're doing so out of overly rosy expectations.\n\nThere's a lot of bullshit in industry too. Working in the private sector (or public sector), being \"demand-driven\", being paid to provide a service to someone else doesn't necessarily mean that your work will be meaningful in some existential sense, nor that you will feel like it's meaningful. When I was in industry, a lot of my senior middle-aged colleagues said the same thing as you: I feel like a paper-pusher, nobody cares about what I do, I wish I were researching *the really important things* in academia/molding young minds. A lot of people were bitter, felt expoloited, felt like they were squandering their working years, and felt like the stuff they were producing (at an internationally renowned organization known to everyone in my field) work that has no impact on people's daily lives or which is a very expensive spinning-of-wheels. Everyone wasted 3 out of 5 days on emails and bullshit administrative tasks, everyone had shitty coworkers and unsupportive bosses, a lot of people were frustrated every day and hated their lives. This is not to discourage you from moving to industry. This is to encourage you to remember that the grass is greener where you water it.\n\nAnyway, to get a little more woo-woo, I've been at institutions that everyone wants to be at starting in my mid-teens, and I am continually surprised by the one thing that unites my experience at all of these institutions: everyone around me bitched constantly. Brilliant people, living geniuses, people with an incredible work ethic and achievements to match, people with a level of privilege that I didn't know existed - they had something to complain about (like, a list as long as my arm of somethings) every single day. Some of these people have left industry for academia, or academia for industry, maybe even several times, and they are still constantly unhappy. I don't think they will ever be happy, because they've gotten everything they wanted several times in life and it's still not enough. Maybe I'm projecting too much of my experience on you, but burnt out + no experience of the outside world is a combination that I've seen way too many times to not notice the pattern. In my experience, a lot of the people who are very successful in academia have had such a rarefied life experience that they quite naturally find themselves above such mortal things as daily frustrations and a sense of worthlessness. But in the end, we are all lesser beings and finding solace in the fact that we must all eat, shit, sleep and respond to emails is a big part of any zen you want to achieve.\n\nThanks for coming to my commencement speech.",

My thesis is that being happy at work is more about your attitude and your specific personal preferences being matched than it is about the nature of the work or where you do it. I am, on sum, happier in industry - I don't like undergrads, I don't want to live in Bumfuck, AK, and I've learned that I prefer a job that has substantive responsibilities other than research. Frankly, given the intense publishing pressures in academia and the undergrads (seriously... they are everywhere...) I don't know why anyone wants to do it. But some people love it! Some people love it so much they will work for poverty wages to stay! But my point is that the fact that OP is unhappy at his job doesn't mean that he'll be happy if he switches it, and ultimately doesn't even mean that it's the job that's causing the unhappiness. Industry is not a utopia made of grant money and rainbow farts, so it's best not to build one's life on that assumption.",

IMO, all research is niche and it's very easy to feel that it's not important. If you genuinely feel that, then move out or branch out in your research. If your gripe is people or culture related then figure out what it is you want and move towards it. If it's directed at yourself, then cut yourself some slack. You did it because at some point you liked it and thought it was important. If we're taking a very high level perspective, very little work is truly important and you never know if it was important until many years have passed.",

Worn out and weary of the environment, I left my TT position behind (controversial, as you know) to industry and immediately made almost twice my salary while working in clinical trials, much further downstream from the bench work that hallmarks most basic research.\n\nThis may be an unusual experience (though I\u2019ve found a sizeable cohort of \u201crecovering academics\u201d at this company alone, so it\u2019s not that rare). I miss the students and teaching the most, as well as the easier schedule and intellectual freedom (greener grass for these for sure), but I\u2019m happier and more fulfilled, and surrounded by, with exceptions, more people who feel the same - something I experienced a fraction as often in the Tower.\n\nEveryone cautioning romanticizing industry as the antidote to academia\u2019s well documented problems are completely correct; it has its issues. But at the same time, moving to industry has done wonders for people like me and you- it\u2019s given me responsibility to directly impact patient/subject lives, for example - and I wish you the best of luck!",

      "text": "I would tread carefully outside of academia if you want to get back in. You probably have much better track record than me but it was hard to even get interviews to come back. I left to teach K-12 for a couple years and you see some differences you make to the kids but the bullshit was not worth it. I don\u2019t know about industry. Originally my plan was to work in industry and then get my PhD and teach others because that\u2019s how I believed it should be so I can see your point. \n\n\nMight I suggest just transitioning or just moving to another more applied topic of research? I had the same issues which is why I left. I felt like such a worthless person because my research was so useless. Now I\u2019m trying to work on projects that have more meaning even if I don\u2019t get a publication out of it. It makes me feel so much better. Try doing outreach too.",
