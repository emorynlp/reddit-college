  "title:": "How can I, a computer science student, learn more about mathematics without grad school or doing another bachelors?",
  "text": "I want to delve deeper into math, in particular into statistics, probability, optimization and operation's research, or in other words applied math.\n\nI don't really have the time to go and get another bachelor's, nobody in their right mind is going to allow me to get a master's in math or PhD with CS mathematics.\n\nSo, what could I realistically do in this scenario? I don't want to self-learn, I just can't do it with math, and I want to take whatever I learn in math into real life, particularly into building a business.\n\nI don't know what to do, but I definitely do not want to let go of learning math. It's just something I have to do, and I can't just move on from it.\n\nAlso, not that this is all that relevant, but this would be happening in a Canadian context. I figure that might make things different than the US. ",

Here are some resources that comes to my mind!\n\nConvex optimization (Boyd) is a classic textbook, and there is some (though old) video lectures. Although lectures are from 2008, book is kind enough to self study. Also, there are some lecture note slides available  online - which I always find slides helpful for their visualization. \n\nMIT OCW have some probability/ optimization lectures.  Depending on your background (and your amount of free time) 'Probability and Random variables' can be helpful. \n\nAnd always, auditing some undergrad courses can be a great option! Maybe for some topics, more applied pov might be your taste- in that case, consider auditing courses from stat, OR/IE, etc. In my case I found my school's stat dept having some good courses.",

I have no idea how it is in your school, but in mine, math dept doesn't have much applied math courses or it uses too much pure math to begin with. Maybe in these cases, senior courses (or beginning grad) in OR dept might be more in your taste. In short, search in wider range - consider that other depts than cs and math might also have some interesting courses.",
