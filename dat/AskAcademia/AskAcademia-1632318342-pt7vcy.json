  "title:": "How to explain the time I took off to have kids when applying faculty positions?",
  "text": "I am in CS field, have a PhD (2017) from a top 15 uni (w/top conf papers) and did a postdoc at a top 3 uni (with projects gained a lot of media attention)  -- all in USA. \n\nThen I had 3 pregnancies back to back, 1 of them sadly passed away and 2 of them had some health problems that I had to attend to. Overall, it was a very difficult 3 years for me. I did some projects (sort of start-ups) with the little amount of time I had, and those gained some visible success (so I have 'some' stuff I can write on my CV for this period) but I don't have any papers in the last 3 years.\n\nA few months ago, I realized that 3-year gap on my academic research  is a lot of time and I am trying to catch up research since and recently published a A star conf paper with part-time students I work with. And I am hoping to add a few more A level or A minus level conferences (currently in submission or in review).\n\nI want to apply to an assistant professor position in US. But I realized that whenever I talk to someone, they skip my PhD, postdoc and always ask me \"oh... what have you been doing for the last 3 years?\". I explain them the start-ups I did but of course, having no paper comes as a red flag..  I can't say that \"well... i had babies at that time and i had to take a leave\". Because I think that also comes as a red flag. Also it sounds like I am making excuses for not having papers.. \n\nIs there any advice on this? I feel like I should just give up pursuing academic career...",

Fortunately, things are now sorted out and I'm excited to be able to really focus on my career once again.\" I would not fill in \\*any\\* details, nor would I apologize in any way.\n\nAnd absolutely DO NOT GIVE UP. You are too good and you have worked to hard for that. You will find the right place, and the right place will want you. Having babies does not disqualify you. My department would take someone like you without hesitation (and I'm a CS professor, btw -- send me a message if you want to talk. I would be happy to help you.). If necessary, consider another postdoc, but that really should not be necessary.",

I couldn't transition back to the lab as planned, etc. Despite that, I've been able to stay connected to the profession and move my research forward by the following.....\" and potentially \"while there is a perceived gap, that I continued progress during these isolating times shows that....\"",

We are split 50/50 by gender. Both our department and our institution are pretty family friendly, so that approach might not serve as well as a general strategy.",

Our former senior-most members were both parents as well, but they've been retired a few years.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how the demos work out. Probably more single and/or childless faculty in R1 schools vs SLACs and CCs simply due to the varied expectations? Really young departments would have fewer parents. Variations by discipline?

My personal opinion (as a guy), since there's no escaping the three-year gap, you're much better off saying you had kids, which is a \"legitimate\" reason, rather than leaving it to their imagination.\n\nI assume you're in your late twenties or thirties. If you *didn't* have kids, they'd be imagining that you're *about* to have kids. So having your childbearing behind you could be seen as a plus.\n\nIt sucks that US academia is so woman-unfriendly. But that's just one piece of a pattern of US laws being very worker-unfriendly. \n\nI don't know what sub-field you are in, but overall I imagine you would be a much hotter commodity than you give yourself credit for.

If they do care, and this information disqualifies you in their eyes, then it's not someplace you want to work anyway.\n\nIt's easy for me to say as a man, but please don't contribute to the odious stereotype of TT applicants who conceal their family situation in the application/interview process. Yes, women still get passed over for too many openings because of assumptions about childrearing, but by hiding this part of your life, you're playing right into their hands. You're becoming exactly what they're so suspicious of, and you're sending the signal to yourself and others that it's smart to lie if it gets your foot in the door.\n\nThe only way these awful stereotypes are going to end is when people take away their power to intimidate us into self-censorship. You're a flexible self-starter in a STEM field, and you also took a little time off to have a family. It should be clear from your materials that motherhood hasn't drained your mind or your ambition, and that you're every bit the scholar you were four years ago. You have so much to be proud of and to contribute, and nothing to hide.\n\nPS - An impolitic thing to add, but I'll say it anyway. If you happen to get a sexist hiring committee anyway, they might look at you and say \"Well, she already had her kids, and flex-time for day care pickups is still a lot easier than a semester of maternity leave!\" To people who think in those terms, you're already a stronger candidate than your typical young woman because you're past the part that costs them the most money :D",

You should consider adding a \"Media recognition\" section as well to further demonstrate the relevance of your work.  \n\nI don't actually think this kind of leave will be a big deal and wish you the best of luck!",

Otherwise you should find a solution to leave kid out of your sight for 10 hours/day for the position. \n\nIn Europe asking your personal information or regarding your pregnancy as red flag are red flags. One of the situation is that a woman got her position (postdoc) without 10 years in Academy (high ranking institute hosting HPC in top 10) due to raise kids. FYI",

      "text": "First, I hope the health problems have gone away. In your case, it really depends on the place that you want to join. It has been very competitive in recent years, but there are also many openings. People might want to overlook the gap, but there are always some other candidates whose profiles are at least similar to yours (or slightly better) if you are looking at the top 50 departments in the country, and the committee might want to take a less \"risky\" decision (given that the field is moving very quickly). I'd recommend always email and talk to the department chair and the hiring committee chair to get a sense of their mind and be frank about your case. Also, it's a good idea to reach out to your past contacts in the field to see if they are aware of any openings and are willing to make a connection (in addition to writing the letter for your application).\n\nI'd look for postdoc (or research associate) positions as a backup option. Best of luck!",
