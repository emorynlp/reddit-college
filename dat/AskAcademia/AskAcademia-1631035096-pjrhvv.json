  "text": "As the title says, how frequent it is in your experience to send an abstract with the work (calculations) partially done, hoping to finish it in the months preceding the conference? \n\nI'm a PhD candidate in the wind energy field, where there are many conferences which are important not to miss, so I've done that more than once. Lately, I feel like this way of doing things makes me work in a hurry, possibly making the quality of my research lower, and I'm wondering if it is better to change approach.",

      "text": "I don't think I've ever sent a finished product for a conference, if it's not publication worthy yet, and it's not accepted, it's not worth my time. I usually have 1 big project, along with 3-4 unfinished subprojects that I send to conferences to see which one is valuable/interesting",

      "text": "In the conferences where I served as chair and in my field (which is quite conference-focused), we\u2019ve set the full paper submission deadline around one week after the abstract submission deadline (since we use that phase for declarations of CoIs and the bidding only before directly starting the review phase). That said, we could still observe on average 5% of abstract submissions being eventually withdrawn because authors did not make it. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty normal. \n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone (in our field) to be still working on their data when submitting an abstract, but rather having completed the analysis and then choosing the conference while writing the manuscript; still, my feeling is that this phenomena could be similar to other fields.",
