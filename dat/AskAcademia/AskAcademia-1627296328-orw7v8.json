  "title:": "Am I being taken advantage of?",
  "text": "I am currently working as an Engineering Post-Doc at a good uni in the UK. The Post-Doc was essentially given to me (I didn't even have to properly interview) towards the end of my PhD (which I am currently interrupting to fulfill this post) by one of my PhD supervisors who I had also worked a lot with in my Undergraduate. I feel that I have a good working relationship with them and for the most part have no complaints and feel quite lucky.   \n\n\nMy current issue is: the project I am currently working on has a PhD student onboard. They seem unable to actually produce work and follow simple instructions from my Supervisor (when asked to write something up for a deadline, they would begin fiddling around with other stuff etc.). They have had needed to submit a report for their funding body, but due to COVID this has kept being delayed, crunch time is now at the beginning of September and they don't seem to really be doing much.   \n\n\nIn terms of the technical development: they have developed the mathematical equations for 1/2 of the model.  \n\n\nMy contribution has been: the mathematical derivation of the other 1/2 of the model, 2 novel theoretical developments  (one of which I think is quite unique/good) and have done all the coding to implement these things to the point where they now have everything they need to get results.   \n\n\nI feel they have contributed disproportionately to this and have not done much of the writing, I am OK with this for the funding report as this won't be published. But this report is supposed to form the basis of a published paper. As it stands I think the plan is for the PhD student to be the first author as in my field it is important for their claim to a PhD, I don't know that this is fair.   \n\n\nAm I being taken advantage of? Is my supervisor using my work to get a student their PhD to prevent the project/themselves looking bad? Should I argue for first author on the published article? Or is this just the way the cookie crumbles?",

      "text": "So much in your post is red flags. You shouldn't be doing a postdoc without a PhD. There's usually some provision in the funding t&cs to allow students to start a postdoc before their PhD is completed but generally you'd need to have submitted your thesis. \n\nThen you're supervising a student who isn't actually doing the work and seemingly your PI is ignoring this problem - or maybe you two haven't sat down to discuss the student's performance properly? Has anyone given the student any feedback?\n\nAnd then the paper. If you've done the majority of the work, intellectual input and writing then you should be first author. However, your supervisor doesn't seem particularly fussed about ensuring you complete your PhD or that you get appropriate recognition and reward for your work, so I would say yes you're being taken advantage of. Focus on your needs which is getting the PhD and then go find a proper postdoc where you are actually developing your own research interests and not doing a PhD for someone else while yours stagnates.",

My advice is to transform these interactions into mentorship relationships so that everybody is happy and well-cited. It is not infrequent that a good postdoc has 1 first paper in 3 years, and 20 co-authorships. Be big, be gregarious.",
