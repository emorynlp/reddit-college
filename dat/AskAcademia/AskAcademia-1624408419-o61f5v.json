  "text": "UPDATE: I want to say thank you to all of the responses to this post. I\u2019ve read each and every answer and they\u2019re all insightful. This week my funding was pulled out from under me- for my tuition and my dissertation research- at no fault of my own. Although I\u2019m in the last year of my PhD, I am strongly considering taking some time off and potentially mastering out because of the disorganization of my department and the stress it\u2019s placing on my mental health. After getting over the initial shock of the news, I am also considered moving to being part time and finding a job outside of the university while I finish  my degree. \n\n\nFor context- I\u2019m interested in moving out of the academic world into industry. I am ABD and considering leaving now instead of finishing my dissertation. My field is public health, but my skills are applicable to a range of careers.",

I managed to teach (which I loved), then my career led me back into academia in a really weird way I would never have expected. Don't regret any of the twists and turns. My only regret is concentrating my initial job search on R1s, without properly asking myself where I would actually be happiest. It worked out in the end, but I wasted a lot of work and heartache chasing something because it was prestigious rather than because it was actually what I wanted.",

I found the topic interesting but really didn't have the technical skills to carry out the experiments. Fortunately, I had an affinity for running the numbers and was able to pick up a second masters in statistics while mastering out of the neuroscience program. I don't regret these choices as they were all the right ones to make. The regret is that I could have transitioned to complete a PhD in statistics. This would have checked the box for completing a PhD and would have been in something I'm good at.\n\nI was ready to move on from graduate school, though, and start making money. I daydream occasionally about going back -- maybe teaching as an adjunct if I've outgrown graduate school.",

I foresaw that I would feel miserable and totally wasting my life if I hop onto such new projects just for the sake of finishing. What could be worse is that upon completing a PhD in such field that I totally don't care or don't believe in, I would still be forced to further work on similar research projects, if I want to go further in academia.\n\nAfter 1.5 years, I moved to another country, and joint another research group that I have been really fascinated about till today. And I eventually completed a PhD on topics that I have intrinsic interest about.",

First, my supervisor got dragged through the press with some well-supported systemic bullying allegations that made me realise it wasn't just me and that she spoke to everyone that way. Second, my (non-academic) career took off, and I had a chance to see from a place of objectivity what the career path I had left behind looked like, compared to the much more lucrative private-sector path I was on that I was (and am) enjoying that still sees me work closely with academics and PhD holders more broadly on a range of things.\n\nIt was a real 'sliding doors' moment, and who knows how it might have ended if I had chosen to ride it through to the end (or into the ground) - but humans have a way of accepting change and new paths and rationalising all sorts of decisions. As for me, for the moment, I don't regret it in the slightest... but who knows, right?",

      "text": "I'm disappointed I didn't finish what I started, but overall I don't regret it.\n\nHad I decided to stay in the program, I would probably be finishing my PhD about now.\n\nIn the time since I've left I've been a project manager for a small \"good food\" farm/processor/distributer (over my head at the time, but I learned a lot in trial by fire), an adjunct professor at a community college, a worker at a caviar processing plant,  a researcher studying mid-air collisions and fish processing injuries, and now a data analyst for healthcare stuff.\n\nI traveled, lived out of my truck, and met lots of people from backgrounds not represented at a university. I've been stranded, and had to learn to ask for help and make quick friends.\n\nHad I stayed in my PhD (Economics), I imagine I'd be looking for tenure track positions about now. I'd have spent the last several years studying something few care about, in the same college town. I imagine I would be indoctrinated by the university (and maybe worse, economic theory). Unless I came to unlearn some of that indoctrination, I would have my eyes closed to many realities of the world and human behavior. I would probably be more condescending and less understanding of my fellow man in general. I think this is part of how the ivory tower is built, by abstracting the real world away and thinking the people trudging on through it are the silly ones.\n\nTLDR: I think I'm wiser, more adaptable, and more pro-social for having left school. I also still haven't published in a journal (though I'm working on that for my current job), and won't be getting any tenured professorships without returning to school. Overall, I think I'm better for having left.",
