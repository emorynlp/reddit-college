  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI use a windows laptop and want to annotate my notes (which are word document typed) using textboxes. \n\nThe Preview app on Mac is great for me, because I can easily drag the textboxes with the desired text format and it\u2019s super convenient.  \n\nAnyone have any suggestions for apps similar to preview for Windows (preferably free)?\n\nThanks!",
