  "title:": "Navigating change of surname",
  "text": "I got married this past summer and my wife and I (also a woman) decided to hyphenate our last names. I initially never intended to change my maiden name, but it was important for my wife that we share a surname and she is already established professionally and didn't want to change her surname to mine.  I'm not sure how to navigate the name change on an institutional level. \n\nI was initially intending on using my maiden name professionally, since I've already got a couple of minor publications under that name and I thought it would be easier/less unwieldy than my hyphenated name, but I'm somewhat confused about how this would work legally. I thought I knew of several colleagues who had done this, but can't find definitive answers. I've changed my name with the university for tax purposes (need my SSN to match my legal name in the system), but am not sure what name to use for things like fellowship applications. Would it create problems to apply for grants, etc. under my preferred name, or is that practice fairly commonplace? I'm mid-application cycle for a few opportunities that begin next year and I would prefer to have all my materials be uniform. Currently they are all under my maiden name, but if necessary I will change them. \n\nETA - I managed to find a few threads about this,but most were written before the poster had made a decision about name change. Several recommended against hyphenating, but this is non-negotiable for us (and the legal name change is already complete).",

      "text": "I think you can keep using your maiden name for your publications. I know a couple people who kept publishing under their maiden name, even after their legal name change. You can think about it like a pen name. I am not sure how it works for things like federal grants, but I would think it is similar.",

      "text": "Your legal name doesn't always have to be the name you publish under/hold professionally. I changed my surname legally, but I publish as *firstName maidenName newLastName.* With *maidenName* being my middle name in publications for all intents and purposes.  \n\n\nHaving both names has helped me in weird scenarios...for example, when I had to solicit letters for promotion, some people wrote letters for *firstName newLastName* and some people wrote letters for *firstName middleName lastName* depending on the context they knew me in...but it is clear that both names are me. It also helps if you are in a conference heavy field to have some sort of connection to a legal name.  \n\n\nThe only problem I've heard of with hyphenating is that some systems don't recognize the hyphen, so when you go to write a book chapter or some other random thing in 10 years, the editor might come back and tell you you can't have the hyphen.   \n\n\nGood luck!",

These days, it really doesn't matter. The rise of digital submissions and digital tools means it is very easy to keep track of people even with a name change. Especially when you are submitting a CV or grant proposal. As for manuscript, the only issue I have ever seen is if the publishers authors information section won't handle it and an email to the editor fixes that.\n\nSo, do what make you feel best. It is not a huge deal anymore. Good luck.",
