  "text": "Hello everyone! Recently I have been admitted to the Berlin School of Mind and Brain Masters program (Track Brain) and I'm awaiting acceptance for TUM Elite biomedical neuroscience master's degree. \n\nI need some help figuring out which path to choose, so if there are any Alumni from these 2 schools, I would like to hear some information.\n\nThank you in advance!",

          "text": "That's funny, I was going to say the oposite: Berlin is far more beautiful, and still cheaper (https://www.immowelt.de/immobilienpreise/bl-berlin/mietspiegel). Plus it is far more interesting, international and lively. Bavarians prefer Munich, I rarely come accross anyone else who does, and all of the students I know (quite a few!) would prefer Berlin. It must be said that Munich is quieter and you are a lot closer to great opportunities for hiking, skiing, etc., and there are a lot more fancy neighborhoods. I can't say anything about the programs.",

                  "text": "\"I come from the south of Germany.\" \n\nI knew it! :)\n\nI don't find that Munich has more old houses (I take it you mean apartment buildings?). I thought that more of Munich was destroyed in the war, and that it is easier to find an Altbau in Berlin, but correct me if I'm wrong. And I find the old buildings in Berlin nicer too, higher ceilings, more windows, more character, ... and if you're lucky, Diele, not just some ordinary building that happens to have pastel paint! But around Munich there are more real villages and rural communities. It's also strange but sometimes Munich feels like a bigger city to me because it feels like there are more cars around. It is probably just the places I have been, but in Berlin I have fond memories of quiet dinners outside with candle lit tables ... of course all those people have probably filled up the streets with their cars by now.",
