  "text": "About to graduate (STEM) and I am fortunate to have several postdoc offers, all academic labs. From a subject matter perspective, one of them interests me less than the rest, but is at a world-renown/tier 1 university. I would therefore like to hear from folks who are on faculty search committees and/or involved in recruiting candidates: all else equal, how much does it benefit me to have a \"Harvard\" or a \"Stanford\" on my resume, relative to a less widely-known university where I might do research that more closely aligns with my intellectual goals?",

      "text": "In my experience in Computer Vision in academia, the prestige of the university is important but even more important is how productive you can be in a certain lab. In Computer Vision, publications are valued a lot and it\u2019s pretty important to be able to publish into top tier conferences and journals. Being in a prestigious lab where you cannot be productive for whatever reason (eg. maybe the culture is unpleasant) could be worse than being at a less known university but where the work culture is good and where you can complete projects. I would probably opt for the lab where the work seems interesting and which seems productive or to have a good working culture.",

It seems to me that researchers at prestigious institutions are not in any way better researcher than people at other institutions. What they seem to be better at, or at least prioritise much more, are the things that matter for an academic career. These things unfortunately don\u2019t include high quality research.",

      "text": "It depends on how \"less widely-known\" that university is, who the PI is, how productive you can/will be in the lab, and your career goals. I'm in the social sciences, for context, and I recruit candidates but for industry research in tech.\n\nFirst, at least in my field, the delta between doing your postdoc at a Harvard and a Michigan isn't as big as the delta between Harvard and, say, the University of Wyoming. Michigan is still a top 10, widely respected department in my field - in fact, it arguably has *more* cachet than Harvard within the field itself - wheres Wyoming would be more of an unknown factor. If my choice was between Harvard and Michigan I'd choose whichever one was better suited for me, but if my choice was between Harvard and Wyoming I'd likely choose Harvard.\n\nBut PI plays a role, too. For a variety of reasons, a well-known, well-connected, and/or productive PI may be at a 'lesser-known' university but still be very influential in the field. Equally important is how you get along with that PI: you don't want to end up at even a very prestigious place where you don't get along with your PI, or they don't support your research and career goals.\n\nCareer goals also matter. It sounds like you're interested in academic jobs; prestige matters a lot in academia, but the prestige of the department you're associated with likely matters more than the university (although the university matters too). So back to my Harvard vs. Michigan example - there'd be little functional difference on the job market between doing a postdoc at either of those places, and in fact, in my subfield Michigan might have a slight edge. But for certain values of industry, the Harvard name and connections might get you further - and either of those two would almost certainly get you further than Wyoming. I'd say name of university matters more for non-academic careers, particularly ones where you'd be stepping outside your field a bit and/or where you'd be hired by and working with mostly non-PhD holders.",

However, there is probably some higher likelihood  that candidates from \"big name\" institutions tend to be more successful  in certain fields due to academic family trees and the relative size of a particular field of research, etc.",

If you have an offer from Oxbridge, Harvard, Yale, etc. it would be silly not to take it on the hope that some other university is an idyllic place to pursue your true passion. In my experience, all universities are impersonal bureaucratic messes and will provide little to no intellectual support to anyone. That's on you to scrounge up for yourself in spite of, rather than because of, the institution. \n\nThe difference is that elite universities give you prestige as a tool to wield towards that end while less well-known institutions will not be able to offer that baseline. People (especially outside academia) care far more about a quote from a \"Harvard Researcher\" than from some rando postdoc at the local state school. This translates into the sort of impact and outreach opportunities that lead to funding and build a reputation search committees really care about.",
