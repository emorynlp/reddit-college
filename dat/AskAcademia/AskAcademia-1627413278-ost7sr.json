  "text": "Hello, my brother and his wife were born in the Dominican Republic and earned Masters in Civil Engineering and Education respectively and worked in their fields for about 10 years. They moved here recently and want to know how or if they can transfer those degrees to use them here in the United States.\n\nI've heard somewhere that some colleges will have them take a few semesters of courses in their fields and then give them an exam to prove they have the education for their degrees but I'm not sure if that's true. \n\nI can't find anything when I research it. Does anyone have any insight as to what colleges do this or any information on the subject at all? I'd really appreciate any help in the right direction! \n\nThanks!",
