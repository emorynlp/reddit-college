              "text": "I find teaching and interacting with students immensely enjoyable. I will say, however, that the returns on that diminish each year I teach, but that's probably true of a lot of jobs. Regarding comparing the classroom with my own reading and research ... They're inseparable! I love both reading, research, and writing, and I have to do all three in order to teach well. So the reading/research never ends and directly benefits the classroom. I'm teaching a class on Hawthorne and Poe this semester, for example, and have learned more about the two authors reading and researching for the class than I ever would have on my own. Just imagine reading and researching so much that you feel confident enough to put those thoughts into the minds of a couple of dozen suckers ... It's like having a book club that people *have* to attend.",

I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking, but if you\u2019re a grad student, try to get as much teaching experience as you can early. Teaching isn\u2019t for everyone; I\u2019ve known several brilliant scholars who quit their PhDs because they didn\u2019t want to teach. With a PhD in English, there are research focused jobs, but I think the majority work in teaching focused positions.",
