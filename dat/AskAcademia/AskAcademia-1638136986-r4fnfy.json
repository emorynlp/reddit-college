Search committees are often reluctant to hire anyone who they fear might retire or leave relatively soon, as they'd have to hire all over again (or worse, might lose the line). I've seen such discrimination impact people <50 so at 60+ I'd think it would be a very real factor. \n\nBut if they aren't actually looking for an academic job after this second degree, perhaps less of an issue.

At the same time, I have heard so so so many times how age/gender/undergrad major/undergrad quality/etc. will knock you out of the running entirely (and, from non academic sources, how doing a PhD is for dilettantes or whathaveyou) and I think that's pretty effed up. But I don't know what the right balance is -- I would say people are generally looking for support unless they specifically ask \"What should I be concerned about?\" or \"What are some reasons this might be a bad idea?\" (which they did ask here!)",

                  "text": "My approach is always about being encouraging but honest. Yes, you are great. Yes, getting a PhD is probably an achievable goal if you are willing to work at it. _But_ you need to think long and hard about what you will be happy with as a career outcome. Because the odds are very long for it to be \"a tenure-track job, esp. in a place you want to work or live.\" That certainly _can_ work out (it did for me, to my continual amazement!) but it is statistically very unlikely and you will have very little control over the odds. That does not mean that doing a PhD is worthless \u2014 it can open up other kinds of career outcomes as well, and there is a virtue in and of itself for further education. But there will likely be both real costs (even if it is \"fully-funded\") and opportunity costs (missing years of income, job experience, and retirement contributions). All of these things need to be part of the consideration (which is going to be unique to every person considering it). I also warn them about the common bias to view oneself as exceptional, and to think that a PhD will be the escape from the bullshit jobs that one is likely to have on offer right out of college (I was working on such a job when I started fantasizing about how nice it would be to be a professor).\n\nIf they have looked at all of this soberly, and they still want to do it \u2014 OK. I will give them every tip I have on how to maximize their odds, and how to think about realistic plans B, C, and D, and do whatever I can to help them. As long as they are going into it with eyes as open as they can have them, I'm supportive. And if they decide to do something else \u2014\u00a0I'm super supportive of that, too. One can have a rich, fulfilling life without going to grad school; one can be a lifelong learner without being involved in formal education. \n\nI don't think it is incompatible at all to be deadly honest _and_ supportive. In fact, I'd argue that it is more supportive to be honest about it all from the beginning. Because you're giving them the information they ought to have, _even if they don't realize it yet_. And I don't think one should assume they have figured all of this out. \n\nI say this as someone who absolutely had no idea what the job market was like when I decided to get a PhD. People were always very encouraging, but never discussed the actual odds with me. And when I started, the numbers were actually pretty good! But now they are so far away from \"pretty good\" that they really need to be discussed explicitly. I'm not saying I would have not done a PhD if I had known the odds... but I'd have been a lot less naive about how I went about it.\n\n\"You're great, you'll do fine\" is superficially nice, but in reality is highly un-useful. \"You're great, but you need to be counted among the great_est_, and you need to be phenomenally lucky as well, and you're going to have to spend a lot of time strategizing on how to make this work for you,\" is more realistic (where \"luck\" here is really just a way to talk about the fact that you will not have a lot of control over the outcome).",

                  "text": "haha i totally did not look into your post history BUT one of the girls on my team, shes i guess about twenty years old or so, was casually seeing a guy in the army. They were supposed to meet up when he went on leave and then he ended up telling her that his orders got messed up and he wouldn't be coming home for leave. And she said she understood and eventually ended up asking him to send a selfie to her. he did, but he sent her a picture he took of himself in his mom's bathroom at his home in Jersey. Where he most definitely was not stationed. I remembered her saying, \"I can't believe he thought he could fool me, i'm literally majoring in criminal justice.\" And myself, a criminal, didn't have the heart to tell her it didn't take a detective to call out a twenty year old army kid making a rookie mistake with his selfies in his mom's bathroom.   \nshe was incredibly hurt and angry about this boy and she was talking to our riding instructor about it. Our riding instructor was twenty four years old. Her sage wisdom was \"If you really like him and you really want it to work, I think you should give him another chance. If he doesn't come through again then i would get rid of him.\" Our riding instructor has the kind of looks that involve multiple second chances. No offense to her. Being ten years older than my riding instructor, and fourteen years older than my teammate, I have already gone through the giving boys who lie second chances things. Even Army boys, boys with sexy accents, musician boys, hot boys, ugly boys, smart, stupid, funny, boring boys will all lie to get you into their beds. Miss Jess Taylor is not PhuckedinPhilly cause she's down on her luck, she's PhuckedinPhilly cause of all these gosh darn boys.  \nSo I turned to my instructor and said, \"Don't fuckin tell her that. Why woudl you tell her that? YOu literaly just told her to put her dignity to the side and give this guy a second chance when we know this isn't the first time he's lied to her and we know he's still talking to his ex girlfriend, and besides all that he's probably got a god damned Charger, Challenger, or Mustang that he financed at twenty three percent. Fuck that guy you're too smart, too pretty too funny, too everything to put up with bullshit from someone who is gonna lie to you, someone who cheated on his girl the first few times he hooked up with you, someone who apparently has just realized that his uniform is gonna get a lot of stupid gullible girls into his bed. Screw that dude and find someone else cause I can guarantee you that if there are dudes who are willing to pay me two hundred dollars for \"an hour\" of my time that is really ten or fifteen minutes, then there are a shit ton of dudes who are lined up around the corner singing \"Oh, Sweet Pea, won't you dance with me, wontcha wontcha wontcha dance with me?\" and by the end of the week, you won't even remember that guy's last name even though its embroidered on all his shirts et alone his first name or what he looked like or how crappy his shitty little dick was.\"   \n\n\nAnyways, she didn't listen. Of course. By the time we had our team Friendsgiving dinner he had hooked up with someone else again, and then broke things off with her while she told everyone that she so totally left him, with tears in her eyes.   \n\n\nBy that point I didn't care, cause my one professor was sending me emails that were not at all appropriate but that made me weak in the knees and so I had to go and make some of my own bad decisions. WORTH IT.",

The rest of the thread seems to be totally unknowledgeable about the topic when they are referring to the \"pursuit of knowledge.\" I don't see why any advisor even want to take on a student that old unless they too were tapping out and giving up on actually making scientific impacts.\n\nI would say nobody older than 40 should be starting a PhD (unless they are extremely talented, committed, and set to  achieve far more than their replacement in a far shorter amount of time).",
