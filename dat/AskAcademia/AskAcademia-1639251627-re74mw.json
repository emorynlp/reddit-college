  "text": "Sorry if this question is repetitive, but I\u2019m really nervous about asking for recommendation. I\u2019m trying to apply for summer interns but I haven\u2019t decide which programs to apply yet. Some of them due by January 15th and today is December 11th. I really need a few more days to decide, so would asking by December 15th too late? Am I already too late?",

Or you could ask them from Now to send a 'general' recommendation letter, that doesn't go into the specifics of the internship requirements, which works for all paths.",

      "text": "During non-holiday times, one month in advance would be a sufficient amount of time. As others have noted, with the holidays and the semester break in the middle, this could be tricky. Reach out to your professors to ask, and acknowledge the timing. One thing you might offer to do is to write a rough draft of a recommendation letter. You can then share this rough draft for them to build upon. Good luck!",

If you've been working closely with the professor for years at a small school and they've already offered to write a recommendation for you it might be fine, but in general that's not enough time even if they've offered already. Maybe if it was a different time of year, but this is the holidays for most people and unless the professor has specifically told you that that isn't a problem for them, this is an unreasonable request.",

It\u2019s a little better if you have a very chummy relationship with the professor (more common at SLACs) and they\u2019re expecting you to ask for an LoR at some point. However, if this is your only option, you had BETTER acknowledge how big of a favor they\u2019d be doing you and maybe gift them something for completing it. Also remember, a rushed letter is more than likely a bad letter.",
