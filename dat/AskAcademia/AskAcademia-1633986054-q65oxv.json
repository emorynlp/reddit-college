  "title:": "Need help navigating conflict with advisor",
  "text": "I'm a PhD student. I was recruited by FA (field advisor) to work on a project as a PhD students with \"co-advisors\" (FA and AA for academic advisor). FA is an outside consultant, AA was at the University. \n\nFA has been abusive since I got here. Although FA recruited me, FA then claimed I'm not qualified for the fieldwork I was hired to do. I was given a list of things I needed to do to appease her. Meanwhile, AA wanted me in the field, so didn't let me register for classes for the entire first year. Forced me into the field where I endured several abusive events. Comments about my body and my clothing being too tight, making me work during a blizzard and then mocking me for being cold. I have PTSD from nearly dying and she drove around in a blizzard joking that we were going to die that day. In three years she has not given me access to any data, let me work on any tasks, and flat out said she doesn't plan to publish anything. \n\nThis past year, she created drama with AA that resulted in AA taking a different job and leaving the university. AA knew about the abuse, but told me not to tell anyone else because she was afraid FA would destroy the project. FA and another PI encouraged me to take on a new AA that they wanted to work with. FA told new AA that I am unqualified, that I don't read her reports, that I won't learn from her, that I'm difficult to work with, etc. New AA is convinced I'm the problem. FA has since chosen to ignore all communication from me, but tells the others project leaders that I won't do assigned tasks. I tried to communicate this with AA, who responded \"this conflict is above my pay grade.\" I have since been removed from decision-making conversations about my own future. \n\nI did manage to secure funds for other research projects and have slowly built them up so I *should* have enough to finish a PhD, despite being set up to fail on my main project. I wrote the grant proposals, designed the research, installed the equipment, and have collected the samples and maintained the equipment for 2.5 years. But now FA is wanting to use that equipment for research that will not include me and probably won't even give me any recognition. It's petty, but I don't want her using expensive equipment that I worked so hard to obtain. I also think there should be some accountability for maintaining the equipment and returning it, but it doesn't seem like there will be. Since I have been removed from these conversations, I don't get a say and that feels unfair. \n\nSo my questions - what do I do? Nobody seems to care that I've endured years of abuse. That I was set up to fail. That she is actively making my life hell. I feel so defeated that I just want to quit. She's on my committee and I have comps coming. I can't help but worry that she will fail me out of spite, or at least make it as miserable as possible. Do I just walk away? If I do, what happens to my other research projects?",

              "text": "I can't promise you this is salvageable, especially as it seems the senior leadership is already aware and not doing anything. However, I'd like to point out a fundamental problem with AA's advice not to tell anyone in case FA destroys the project. FA is destroying the project already. This is not magically going to resolve itself if you do nothing. If you do nothing, nothing will change and you won't get your PhD. The only way out of this is to do *something*. What that something is, I can't say but I think speaking to the Department Head is probably a good step.\n\n I would also say if you have ideas for solutions that might help - is there another group you might be able to move to? Is there a different field advisor you could work with? It will also help if you know what you want to get out of the meeting and also what you want more broadly. It's really difficult when someone comes to you with a problem and then just dumps verbal diarrhoea over you with absolutely no indication of what they want. I've sat in so many meetings with upset people where I've literally had the words \"what do you want?\" rattling around and around my head because it's absolutely not clear.",

Idk much about these, but having talked to the program body to no avail, my limited experience tells me to suggest you center around cold facts than the feels you described here (as much as I do empathize with you), since the dept head is an \"impatient\" type.\n\n e.g. comments, safety, requests for equipment for study other than yours, (esp if in lieu of using towards your study).",
