  "text": "The title says it all.  I published a book in 2018, and am patiently waiting for reviews.  There have been a few (four, to be exact), but several of the major journals in my field haven't reviewed it.  The book was published by one of the major presses in my field.  I understand book reviews take a long time to come out (major journals in my field are still reviewing 2018 books) but I'm worried my book has somehow flown under the radar.  Is it ethical/advisable  for me to send an email to journal editors to politely let them know my book exists?",
