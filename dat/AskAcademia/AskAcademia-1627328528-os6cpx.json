  "text": "(Throwaway because I don't need this being traced back to me)\n\nSo there's a whole story behind this, but I started a PhD program in 2020 and things have been an absolute mess.  There's been a LOT of issues, and the tl;dr would be that they can't adequately support my disability and that my research interests and career goals have changed and don't align with this place anymore.  In hindsight, COVID forced me to choose between a program in a place I'd spent a couple of months in and a place I've never seen and I should have known better than to go with familiarity.\n\nI'm realizing that I'm probably going to be better served if I can go somewhere that better aligns with what I want to and is just a better overall fit for me.  I'm realizing how difficult this is likely to be since it's not anything nearly as clear cut as transferring undergrads, but I'm wondering if anyone has done this successfully/been on an adcom and admitted a student after they'd started elsewhere and if there's some way to minimize the amount of red flags people see and maximize the chances of actually having some form of success before I spend another thousand dollars and experience a lot of stress going through application hell again.  \n\nI'd also love to hear from any people who HAVE done this successfully and how it worked out for you.",

      "text": "First, I hope in terms of the financial you just mean application fees and moving expenses. If you are in STEM (or really any field), you should be getting a stipend and tuition waiver, not spending any money! \n\nYou are only a year in, so the lost time isn't as big an issue as showing potential red flags for wanting to switch. On the lost time, it is possible to get courses to transfer, but not always. For the red flags, you need to show that you are certain and can commit. You need to make sure your current/previous PI can speak well of you, or have a damn good reason why they can't be a reference and have someone else who can be. Since it sounds a bit like you aren't sure what you want, why not try working in a lab as a tech/research assistant for a year. That could be in the lab/program you eventually join, or just a way to get more exposure and figure out what you are looking for.",
