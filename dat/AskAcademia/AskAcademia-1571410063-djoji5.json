  "text": "How would you respond to a student who says \"I don't want to research \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ because there are way smarter people already working on it.\" ?\n\nIt has certainly been my experience in CS that I get viciously outpaced by the developers who are already smarter than me, AND they put in 60+ hour weeks. Like, I'm a good developer, but if I get /that/ person on my team, then my contributions are hardly noticeable. Does this feel true to you, whatever field you're in?\n\nSide note, off the top of your head, what are some fields with too many scholars and some fields with not enough?",

      "text": "Some researchers are recognized solely for their ability to perform comprehensive literature reviews. You don\u2019t always have to be the one coming up with new ideas. Merely setting the table gives you a seat sometimes.\n\nThere\u2019s also a ton of value in interdisciplinary work: Drawing together two discrete conversations, or using theoretical frameworks uncommon to the field to offer new insights. This is a harder path, though, and you are likely to encounter resistance and need to present watertight justification... but it is a way to get yourself out there.",

The team of the two of them will make more money than the lawyer can alone.\n\nYou don't have to be better than them at anything to make it worth having you on the team, you only need to be able to add more value than you cost. If you can do that you're useful.",

      "text": "The most important decision you can make in research is your choice of problem. It's perfectly fine to avoid an area if you think the area is saturated or if you think you don't have anything special to contribute.\n\nInstead, look for something special and novel that you can contribute. It might be a new kind of data set, a new kind of method, a new angle for looking at a problem, a new domain, or even bringing in a new contributor that can help with the above.\n\nTo give a concrete example, I work in smartphone privacy. However, there are several groups around the world that are much, much, much better than I would ever be with respect to the encryption or systems side of things. My group's secret sauce is looking at the human factors side of things, bringing in elements of interaction design and psychology as well as systems. On top of that, rather than looking just at the smartphone OS or apps (which almost everyone else is doing), we are looking at how to help software developers in improving privacy. \n\nI'd also recommend reading this article by famed mathematician Terrence Tao:\n[https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)",

      "text": "In my opinion, it's incredibly important to have a variety of different types of thinkers working on a problem, for the simple reason that if everyone's approaching a problem from the same or similar perspective, using the same toolkits and styles of thinking, it will take longer to solve it or even to comprehensively describe it. I myself am a slow, slow, painfully, frustratingly slow thinker. I am a chronic over-complicator of simple instructions. I failed my first-term Biostats final because I couldn't figure out that all I needed to do was write summary descriptions of simple problems that were already solved for me, so I kept looking for ways to solve the problems further until I ran out of time. I'm *that* slow. Some might even describe me as a dimwit. \n\nBut what my slow slow thinking is doing is seeking as many connections and possibilities as it can conceive of. It makes me pretty good at ecological thinking, which was very helpful for understanding how environment impacts brain development, endocrine pathways, and behavior, and it makes me good at understanding complex life-span disease etiologies. If people can put up with my slowness, they usually get some really good complex ideas out of it. And it really, really helps me to be paired with someone who is much more of a quick, crisp, linear thinker so I don't get bogged down chasing loops, which happens more often than I'd like to admit. \n\nIf you pair a good idea person with a good do-er and a good project manager, you get a good project, right? But what happens when you take any of those three people out of the project? It's not so good. Yet Ideas will be thinking \"Well, I only came up with some ideas, they figured out how to put it together and actually made all the content\" while Doer is thinking \"I'm really just the brawn here, I can code but those two thought it up and organized it\" and Projects is thinking \"All I did was make an outline, I hope I wasn't too bossy. They did all the real work\". \n\nSo whatever topic you want to work on, no matter who you are, your contribution is going to move the understanding forward, even when you feel like your contributions are minor or invisible.",

In fact I've gone further than many of the people I thought were geniuses merely because they could figure out an integral faster or whatever. Why? I have other talents. For example, I am very good at looking at the big picture and approximating problems so that they are feasible to tackle.   Don't need to solve the complicated integral if I can make python do it or I can simplify it in a way that it still fits to the larger picture.   \n\n\nIn your case, some CS people might be better at doing integrals or at coding. So what. CS is more than integrals and coding.",
