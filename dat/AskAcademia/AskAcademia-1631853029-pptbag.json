  "title:": "Is presenting at conferences worth the time and effort if not in academia?",
  "text": "I am a middle school ESL teacher who frequently attends local academic conferences in my field. I always go as an attendee rather than a presenter.  I go mainly for two reasons. I enjoy staying updated on the most current research and methods in my teaching field. It suffices the required professional development clock hours to keep my license current. I haven't presented at a conference since I was in grad school, and at the time it was compulsory. Always when I attend conferences, I am constantly encouraged by those hosting to submit a proposal for a future conference. The thing is, I never feel motivated to submit a proposal on time.\n\nMiddle school teaching is so exhausted, especially being a specialist role that requires lots of paperwork that when I clock out at the end of the day, I don't feel compelled to do anything academic-related. As I mentioned, the grad students presenting are doing it as part of a class assignment. And maybe the college professors are presenting as part of the larger research they are working on. I am inclined to believe that those in academia may be more inclined to submit proposals since research is part of their job duties and career advancement. Whereas, in the secondary education world, there is not the same upward mobility. I don't mind presenting a faculty meeting that is always on the clock during a workday. And maybe if there was a conference I saw in a nice vacation destination to which I felt getting accepted is a means to getting a free or partially paid vacation on the school district's dime. But other than that, I don't go out of my way to present at local conferences. And even with presenting at a local conference, there is still a fee for presenting and it's on my day off after a laborious 40 hour workweek.\n\nI am not looking for an academic job. If I ever leave K12 teaching, it would be to pursue a career in the private sector like instructional design or educational technology. Are there any extrinsic benefits to going through the labor of presenting at a conference if not seeking a career in higher ed?",

Plus potentially fees as well.",

I am planning to attend a local conference next month because it fits my schedule, the topics are of my interest and it suffices my K12 professional development clock hours.

If it\u2019s not fun for you or if it\u2019s a chose, don\u2019t do it. And even for people entering academia, if presenting is not enjoyable at all they should reconsider because communicating information to others is so central to academia.. but I\u2019d argue just being human.",

Traveling to a conference and paying membership/registration fees is expensive, and you might not get reimbursed. Academic conference presentations will not help your career, unless you\u2019re an early career academic who has or is looking for a job in higher ed where active research is required. If you don\u2019t really want to do it, and you don\u2019t have an original idea to research, there\u2019s no reason to do it.",

      "text": "Everyone is going to tell you no but look, I have the exact opposite experience. As a psychologist my experience is #1 presentations are worth very little IN academia. My experience has been that presentations really only matter OUTSIDE of academia where people who are not academics get extremely easily impressed with that stuff. While you don't see a lot of upward mobility, if you do decide to pursue the other industry jobs you mentioned, you are head and shoulders above where you would be just teaching middle school and you look like someone pursuing a lot of outside training and professional excellence.",

Some level of recognition in the field can help, and you often get that by presenting at our conferences. But in our field, presenting at conferences is primarily about sharing your research and experiences (and drinking) with other people, not about lines on your resume.",
