  "text": "Hello\n\nI am applying to MS programs and the professor said \"I emailed \\[the admissions coordinator\\] to let her know we've been in touch and that I will be interested in offering you a position.\"\n\nNow, this may be a dumb question but does this mean what I think it means? Am I certain to get in if my application is well put together?",

      "text": "I certainly would take this as a good sign. In the end though until pen has been put to paper it\u2019s all just talk. I would go about applying as you typically are thinking you would if I was you but feeling a bit confident in the application as well. Odds are though it sounds like you have a good shot which I\u2019m sure is very exciting. If I was in your shoes I\u2019d be excited but what I wouldn\u2019t want to do is do anything rash like not applying to other programs or something because at the end of the day I never assume I\u2019m getting a job offer or anything else until I see the offer in front of me. Best of luck!",

You still need to put in a solid application and show you're serious. It's a bit early for congratulations but you've obviously impressed.",

It's a way of saying \"I went to bat for you but it's not entirely in my hands.\"",
