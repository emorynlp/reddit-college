  "text": "As somebody who will be embarking on a PhD in the fall, I'd like to hear a little bit more about what people have accomplished in their personal lives during graduate school. Did you write a fictional novel? Did you make a video game? Have you gotten married or traveled the world? Did you run a marathon? What personal goals did you achieve during your PhD that helped you escape from the research from time to time? Share any stories here - big or small!",

Far too often dual academic couples or simply couples that get locked into following one spouse's capricious academic career path around the country end up split. I've seen a *lot* of junior faculty divorces in the first 2-3 years of assistant professor's careers...these may be due to the cumulative stresses of graduate school but often it seems the \"unequal\" emphasis on career/location required to land a tenure-track position for one partner just becomes too much for the other to bear, perhaps especially so when it comes upon 5+ years of similar lack-of-choice in terms of Ph.D. location.",

                  "text": "That's exactly correct. In the last few years of graduate school I rarely attended departmental events, but I always felt sad at those opening gatherings to welcome the new PhDs. Everyone was always so proud and smiling and happy. I knew full well that at least half wouldn't finish, and that around a third wouldn't even make it out of the funded cohort. \n\nAnd every year, usually around winter break, there would be splits, with one partner leaving to go where ever \"back home\" was, or leaving for some other graduate student, or leaving to take a different position, job, or assignment. \n\nAt the faculty level, new hires seem similarly inclined. I can't imagine dragging a partner through a PhD, then a move for a post-doc, then another move for a research position, then *another* move for a TT position...then the ending of the relationship. There are all sorts of pressures, and they seem to be particularly hard on relationships. It's far from my field of expertise or interest, but I do notice that academic couples seem to be far less stable than other couples. ",

There's also the fact that so many academic couples are comprised of *two* highly-driven, career-oriented, generally type-A personalities who are probably used to putting their own goals first. The breakups I see are quite often due to one partner having to \"give up\" on their goals to support the other's-- the \"trailing spouse\" problem --and it usually doesn't take more than a year or two for that to eat away at the relationship.\n\nI've also seen academic couples make it through *many* years living in completely different zip codes/states (and in a few cases different countries). Sometimes that works, but I can't imagine doing it myself. Of course, that's easy for me to say as I'm the tenured faculty member and my partner followed me to our university...if the roles were reversed I might feel differently.",

It was a collaborative art piece with another designer and she was awesome!\n\n- Drew a portrait of David Attenborough, which got left in his dressing room while he was on tour in Australia (I knew someone at the venue) and I am 99% certain he has it.\n\n- I got to talk about climate change for my friend's climate change art exhibition, which was great. \n- I moved in with my partner of 8 years, bought my first car and a custom PC.\n\n- I dived in some new spots in Australia, and got to add manta rays, lionfish and leopard sharks to my ever-growing list!",
