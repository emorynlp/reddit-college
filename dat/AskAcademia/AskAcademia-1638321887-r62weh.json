  "text": "This morning I woke up to an email from a top journal in my field confirming my submission. I definitely did not submit anything there. Eventually I realized that instead of submitting their term paper to Canvas, one of my students had somehow managed to submit it as a manuscript to a journal, under my name and identity. I can\u2019t believe I have to put \u201cdo not submit your class papers as journal manuscripts under my name\u201d in my syllabi. \n\nI just keep thinking about it and bursting into laughter. So, what are some of your \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened\u201d teaching stories? \n\nThis is not a thread for student bashing - just some good natured, end of the semester stress relief!",

Its more common than you might think, some students will do what I say, exactly what I say, and only what I say. Some students will also try to litigate grades based on the letter, not the substance, of the instructions given. So instead I tell them to focus on answer the question fully and completely, give them a page count, and let them go from there. \n\nAnyway most students aren't going to go to grad school and study history, almost certainly any writing they do for their future employer will be just as unstructured.

Confused I asked him why he needed another centrifuge. He'd found some protocol which said \"spin for 1 min per ml of culture\" he'd interpreted it as spin 1ml aliquots of your culture for 1min so had very carefully divided 200ml of culture into 1ml aliquots, using a fresh pipette tip for each ml. His face when I explained he should have just put it in 4 50ml falcons and spun for 5 mins was hilarious. He was holding all 200 tubes with the mountain of discarded pipette tips behind him as we were talking which made it even better.",
