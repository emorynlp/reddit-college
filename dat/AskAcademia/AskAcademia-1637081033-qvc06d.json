It doesn\u2019t sound like you need a grade-boost, but if you think it may be misinterpreted as such send it at the end of the semester. With all compliments I try and identify things under their control, not just random qualities. For example, I compliment my kids\u2019 hard work instead of the fact that they are \u201csmart\u201d. I compliment the colors they chose to wear or their style instead of that they are \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201chandsome\u201d.",

It would show that you care about passing, but not about learning. \n\nB. You give compliments in excess, and about things other than the class. For example, if you go on about how a professor is so hilariously funny and should do standup comedy, that would make you sound like a suckup because it doesn't really have to do with the course, and it's not coming from a place of academic interest or respect for their skill. It would instead come off as you trying to score brownie points. It's better to build rapport by doing well in the class and giving feedback on the professor's academic proficiency. They'll know when you're trying too hard to overcompensate.\n\nC. The person you compliment doesn't deserve the compliment you're giving them. People will be able to tell that a compliment is genuine if it matches their behavior. In other words, if you tell an unprepared, careless, and chaotic teacher that they're the best professor you've ever had, they'll know it's fake because it's illogical. But if you tell a skilled, well-prepared, dedicated professor that they're the best professor you've ever had, they'd believe it because that would actually make sense.",
