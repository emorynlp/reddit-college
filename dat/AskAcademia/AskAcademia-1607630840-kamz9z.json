  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am ftm trans and attending college for the third time (dropped out twice) and I'm wondering how to address the transphobia I've been experiencing? I am a part of a scholarship that meets weekly for a project and the group i am in consistently uses my dead name as a joke. In the same weekly meetings, I've been deadnamed by other students and referred to as she/her or a girl, even by the professor. The professor called me a woman and used she/her for me, and apologized and has never slipped again. However, my groupmates who i work with consistently and talk to every day almost, will call me a girl or use she/her and have made jokes about my deadname. This is not the only circumstance that i have come across while attending this school. When i first got accepted I went to ask if there was a way to use a nickname for my classes as I did not want to be called my birth name (i have not petitioned for a change of name yet which is also a part of my real name). I have been able to do this in my previous college and wanted to see if it would be possible here. However I was faced with a lot of hostility and anger from the lady at the front desk who demanded i show proof. overall my experience has been uncomfortable, save for the few understanding professors. However, the whole scholarship thing has really been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel like i'm crazy for feeling upset about this and that i shouldn't bring it up. However, i don't want these people to think i'm okay with them using my dead name as a joke or that it's fine for them to continuously use wrong pronouns. I'm a pretty understanding person when it comes to these things too, I try to be patient and understanding as possible but it feels personal at this point. We've been meeting for months now, consistently, and I am presenting masc. I feel like if it were not for my legal name being displayed all over my online classes, i might not have these problems, however theres no way I can change that, especially not now. Even beyond the name/pronouns thing, my groupmates have also said slightly racist things to me about a girl who was a part of our group initially. I didn't say anything but stared at her with a smile cus I was uncomfortable. anyways, any help or advice is helpful. please let me know. thank you .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: added some information.\nEdit: just wanted to add some more info. First of all thank you to everyone who has shared input or advice. I want to add that I am in the US, in NYC specifically. Also my preferred name isn\u2019t like a completely different name. It is my legal second name (not middle, it\u2019s my second name). That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to do anything legally with my name since it is literally my name. Also not sure if this is important but the people who are behaving this way are older than me by about 5 years (I\u2019m 24). This bit of info isn\u2019t too important but I thought I\u2019d mention it. They also both hold degrees in other countries. \n\nBut in short: I will consider my options (title IX or Dean of Students and/or the LGBT group on campus). Hopefully I can figure this out in a way and manner where I can just get out of the group and graduate next semester. \n\nTo phoompoom who asked if I was presenting feminine I am not. Either way trans people don\u2019t have to present any certain way to be respected.\n\nEdit: part three!! To the transphobes can y\u2019all kindly fuck off??? Does my existence threaten your tiny manhood this much that you HAVE to say what you\u2019re thinking???",

If you've asked them repeatedly not to dead name you and use your preferred pronouns and they're unwilling to be empathetic and treat you with dignity, I'd be reporting them to whatever university office handles cases of discrimination. \n\nAll universities are different in how they handle name changes. My university will by in large be accommodating, but unless it's a legal name change, there are some forms they can't change. So Blackboard might show their preferred name, but the internal program for grade reporting shows their legal name.",

This could be as general as finding more trans people to be friends with and share resources and emotional support, which can make university a lot less draining even if it doesn't necessarily end the bullying. They will also have experience dealing with the issues of name changes and misgendering that you're experiencing, so they can probably give you advice specific to your institution. \n\nIf the professor apologized and seemed supportive, it might be worth telling them about the bullying happening in your group, and seeing if they can talk to the other students, having an authority figure on your side might help. Additionally, is switching groups an option? \n\nI get that being met with hostility is super frustrating and off-putting, in regards to your name change. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the name change in your university system is actually impossible-- see if you can find the administrative guidelines on IDs/names/etc online and look at what the official requirements are.",

You're absolutely not crazy to be upset about it, and their behavior is not even remotely acceptable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of well-meaning advice here to make an official complain/go to your school's Title IX office. In my experience as a trans academic, to be blunt, this is not going to make anything easier for you. Whenever I've complained about truly egregious workplace transphobia, the official response has been either a) profuse apologies from HR then nothing happens b) gaslighting that it didn't really happen/it wasn't that bad/I misinterpreted it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's not to say you shouldn't do it, but if you do, go into it thinking of it as an effort you are putting in to make your college a better place, not something that will necessarily help you personally. If you don't have the time or energy to do that, or simply don't want to, you should feel absolutely no obligation to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are concrete things I think you can do here - it sounds like finding someone else to ask about changing your preferred name would have a better result. And your professor might be sympathetic enough to let you change groups.",

I seriously cannot believe your college-age classmates would be so cruel as to partake in the behaviors you are describing here. I would talk with your professor/scholarship mentor/whoever is in charge about this. (not meaning to come off as not believing you but rather that I can't believe they are such assholes).  Also, I feel you on the administrative hurdles for getting to use your preferred name.  You are way more of saint that I could be for dealing with this all with grace and trying to be understanding. At a certain point, though, those people don't deserve that consideration because they clearly are not putting any effort into hearing you and behaving in a way that makes you feel comfortable and accepted. \n2. As another poster said, the first place I would recommend looking is an LGBTQ group or office on campus. My campus has an official LGBTQ center and they would likely know most of the resources at your disposal.\n3. For the continued harassment from your classmates, (and if you are in the US), have you considered talking to the Title IX office? I would definitely say this is harassment based on your gender and is possibly something that could be actionable under Title IX protections, although that office would know better than I would.",

I\u2019m so sorry :(\n\nIt sounds like getting your displayed name fixed might help you in some ways, so I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s something you could try again? The first person you talked to about it was obviously being discriminatory (based on her attitude), so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s actually something that could be fixed if you talked to someone more helpful. Might be worth a try? This is my go-to trick with health insurance and other administrative situations too \u2014 just call back until you get someone who will help you! (Edit: I realized I should mention that I\u2019m trans and this specifically works great for trans stuff \u2014 people will literally lie about name change policies and stuff like that, so don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not possible just because the first person said no.)\n\nGood luck and hang in there. I hope the people you interact with next semester are less terrible.",

If you have, I'd take that to admin and request they update your name. \n\nI think a lot ties in with attitude. I'm a woman but don't like my birth name and picked a preferred name that could be used for both women and men. I haven't done the paperwork because in my country that is extremely difficult but I've had 0 problems at any stage of my university education/career to get people to use that name. Sure, people mentioned that my initial in my uni email address is different from the name I go by and then I just say: Yeah, I don't like my birth name. That's literally the end of it. And I don't respond to my birth name but no one has called me it. I'd just ignore people if they use the name you don't want them to use. \n\nPronouns are harder because in almost all cases it's 100% clear from what someone looks like which sex they are so which pronoun to use. In the case of non passing mtf you generally can still see they're trying to be seen as a woman because they will have/wear breasts and wear makeup and clothes that in our culture are only worn by women so then it's easier for others to know to use a feminine pronoun. \n\nIf you are ftm but aren't physically transitioning, to others you'll just look like a woman, so I can understand why even well meaning people slip: you are asking too treat you in a way that in their mind is different from what their eyes see. I personally think you're making an unreasonable demand of others to use a pronoun for you that just doesn't match what you look like. Because in Western society it's accepted for women to express in any way they want and still be seen as women, you don't really have any options regarding fashion or haircut to change how people see you, so only medical transition might really help with how others see you.\n\nIt's not too much to ask to work in a group with people who treat you with respect, though, so you could perhaps talk to your professor about changing groups to work with people who are more pleasant to be around. Maybe you could look into strategies to help deal with bullying. It's not your fault other treat you poorly but certain responses from the person being bullied will feed into bullies' attitude more than others. \n\nGood luck.",
