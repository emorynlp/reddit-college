  "text": "My current career goal is to work in a museum through the U.S. Federal Government such as the Smithsonian Institution or a similar institution such as the NARA. Is a humanities Ph.D. such as in History or Political Science necessary to work as a Curator, Historian, or Archivist? I have read horror stories on life after a Ph.D. in the 21st century. That being said, is it necessary to obtain a Ph.D. given how few jobs actually require that specific degree? What is the future of Humanities PHDs in the United States? Will we restructure Ph.Ds similar to Europe such as the United Kingdom?",

Not my field), and to prepare herself for future promotions/leadership positions she is pretty sure she needs to do a PhD at some point. You can probably get your foot in the door in some position without one, but advancement seems to probably require one depending on your goals.",

      "text": "I think people in this thread are vastly underestimating the competitiveness in securing a position at an institution like the Smithsonian or NARA. I'm reading in these comments that people are trying to be helpful, but are relying mostly on anecdotal evidence. Take a look at the data offered by the AHA in regards to job outcomes for recent PhDs. \n\nThink about this for a moment - there are fewer History Curator positions at the Smithsonian than people who play shortstop for Major League Baseball teams. It is a crude analogy, but the days of public history serving as a \"backup\" option for traditional history students is long gone. For one thing, there just aren't enough positions for that to be true and second, people are increasingly seeking out specialized training to make it in these fields. \n\nIs a Ph.D. necessary to work in one of these positions? No. Not necessarily. As others have responded, some people get their foot in the door with an MA in Museum Studies or Public History. In archives, an MLIS is generally required (along with experience cataloging or processing collections). The National Park Service has a \"pathways\" internship program that often sets people up for careers in the NPS. \n\nLook at the most recent hires in these jobs and the background of individuals being hired at the places you describe. Most will have PhDs in addition to years of experience at other museums or other cultural institutions. \"Reverse engineer\" how other folks got to these positions. \n\nThe reality is this - with the job market increasingly saturated with applicants, and new public history programs established every year, you will be competing with individuals who have not only completed an impressive dissertation thesis, they have also likely completed multiple internships in museum or archives settings helping to prepare them for these job openings. They can point to exhibitions they've built and walking tours they've designed. Will your PhD program train you in how to do these things? Have your potential academic advisors engaged in this type of work? \n\nThe last two people I know who were hired at curators at the Smithsonian held PhDs and had more than 5+ years of experience working for museums or other major government agencies. \n\nI'm not at all saying it is impossible, but I do worry that a false impression is being offered in this thread.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your detailed response. I have roughly 10 years of either internships or volunteer experience throughout the course of my BA and MA in Public history. I have experience working in Archives and Museums. Right now I\u2019m trying to decide what is the best course of action for me after completing an MA in Public History. I would love to work for a museum, conduct research and design what goes into exhibits and what stories are told. I fear for the future of History PhDs.",

Has a major in history and MA in secondary education. She got the job on the grounds of her physical fitness, back ground check, and pulse. She got to do the tours cause she was a good speaker. Her supervisor didn't even know her education until she answered an off script question and mentioned her focus in post grad. Another guy I know that is a docent at a GW battlefield has a degree in art history. He got the job cause of his hobby doing reenactments.",
