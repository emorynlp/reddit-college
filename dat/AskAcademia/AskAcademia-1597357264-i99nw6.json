  "text": "Hi ! \n\nI started listening to the \"How to ADHD\" podcast on youtube ( [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvq9Tp5JZ8oDV3SIpSJX25Twp9FHKqi\\_l](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvq9Tp5JZ8oDV3SIpSJX25Twp9FHKqi_l) ) and honestly, it has brought me to tears... I'm not sure if I'm just exhausted or realize that I've been struggling with this for such a long time. \n\nI'm now a PhD student and have been having great grades in school most of my life, even if I didn't study a lot (excepts for math... where I have to study a lot and have meh grades...)\n\nAnyways, I'm interested in how you discovered that you had it, what caused you to get diagnosed and what you are doing now with it.",

Usually for me there are a couple/a few hours a day when my brain chemistry is balanced, I have the optimum caffeine and food energy levels without jitters. I use that time to do my \"A\" tasks, like writing. Then when the full adhd kicks in, it's time for emails, ie. \"C\" tasks. By the end of the day, when I'm tired enough that the adhd isn't overwhelming, I settle in a little bit for reading, \"B\" tasks. This is what works for me, ymmv",

Now that I know the odds are pretty high I have ADD, I am able to tweak it as I need.\n\nThe only thing that I need is a rigid schedule. So I create a calendar and will block off time to work on various projects (I have a few RA jobs so this is quite necessary). And something will work for several weeks and then I will get bored of the routine and need to switch it up. Took me a long time to realize that I wasn't becoming lazy or procrastinating, my brain was just bored of my schedule. Flip some things around, basically just how I name my work blocks in my schedule and I'm good to go for another several weeks.",

I had suspected for a long time (I\u2019m a psychologist) but the impetus for me was the way I nearly fell apart at the end of my degree. I was always able to keep on top of things at uni even though I had terrible study habits, would do everything last minute, and was super disorganised. It all came to a head when I had to spend extra weeks at the clinic because I got so behind on notes. \n\nIt was a huge relief to get diagnosed, it\u2019s made a huge difference.

I'm usually more focused on the discussions, emotions or my laptop... like searching on google what what just asked instead of listening or contributing... same with coursework. Concentration is hard. \n\nHad to take the habit of always take notes, but I never go back to them, or rarely. On good moments I can be pretty well scheduled. I function well when all is organized. Gantt chart like. \n\nThis year has been a wreck. Relationship problems, moving, custody of kids, plus the PhD. So, I'm not sure if all the stress and fatigue is just messing with me or if it is just preventing me of using my usual coping mechanism.  I never feel to be interested long in something. I changed jobs and fields progressively for the last 10 years (From engineering to public health...!) Always excited at the start, getting As the first sessions, then less and less (still good grades though). \n\nAnyways, I just booked an appointment with the Uni psy center. \n\nI'll take any advice you have though !",

Adhd for me manifested a lot in non specific anxiety and low mood for years. \n\nThat\u2019s great you have some support booked in. I take medication for adhd now and I find it really helpful. In terms of other strategies I find all the classic stuff of making a to do list every day and working in set chunks helps a lot. I generally only make myself work 20 minutes at a time, taking 10 minute tests throughout the day. If I know I only have to work for 20 minutes at a time I\u2019m much more likely to stay on top of stuff. It particularly helps for things like writing and reading journal articles which I find really difficult.",

There are three types: primarily inattentive, primarily hyperactive/impulsive and combined. \n\nEssentially you can be diagnosed with ADHD if you have significant symptoms of either or both domains. It\u2019s more common for women to have the inattentive type of ADHD. I have the inattentive kind of ADHD but I do have a few symptoms of hyperactivity when unmedicated, mostly just always wanting to be \u2018on the go\u2019 and being impatient with people.\n\nSome older school psychiatrists and psychologists still use the ADD vs ADHD distinction though!",

      "text": "I half-suspected I had it for a while before I acted on that suspicion. As a kid, I wasn't diagnosed because my parents thought ADHD was fake and my symptoms didn't express in the traditional masculine fashion (e.g. reading a novel under the desk, not jumping out of my seat making noise). Up until midway through my PhD program, school was easy enough that I could get by (and fortunately I get hyperfocus as well as distraction so as long as I was interested in the material, I could cope). \n\nThen I hit my qualifying exams and suddenly needed to learn study skills and memorize stuff and get through massive amounts of reading consistently (and some of it was boring). I had to set my own schedule and keep track of my own progress. It was just too much, and after talking to some friends with ADHD, I was pretty sure I had it. Plus, the whole rest of my life was barely hanging together - I used all my executive functioning on school, so my apartment was a pigsty, I couldn't pay a parking ticket on time to save my life, etc. Went to a shrink, told the truth, got diagnosed, started medication. Suddenly I didn't have to go through elaborate coping strategies to circumvent my procrastination and distraction - I could just decide \"I'm going to work now\" and get work done like a nuerotypical person. My scholarship improved markedly. I still struggle with some tasks that seem easy to other people (like email! ughh) but I'm glad I sought help. \n\nI still have doubts sometimes about whether it's a 'real' condition and often don't want to mention it to people or seek accomodations, but I can't deny that the *symptoms* are real and the treatment works, so it doesn't really matter if ADHD is socially constructed in some sense or if there's some deeper ontological truth to it. Maybe it's natural diversity pathologized by an ableist society, or maybe capitalism puts ridiculous pressure on people to achieve unrealistic standards, or maybe the cluster of symptoms we know as \"ADHD\" is several overlapping things. The fact is this: some stuff is really unusually hard for me compared to other people, my brain/mind works atypically in both good ways and bad, and medication helps even the playing field within the actually existing society I live in.",

At first I was worried about losing my personality/thinking process and I felt self-conscious when around other people, so I didn't take them on days where I was teaching/interacting with people and I took a day or two off on the weekend. For me, the creativity and tangents didn't disappear, I just gained the ability to ignore them or hold off on pursuing them until my current task was done.

Reading scientific/medical based articles about ADHD was helpful for me to better understand the myriad of ways ADHD affects me. One, there are a number of co-morbidities and I have several of them. That helps with doing treatment planning. Two, an area that I didn\u2019t realize was so affected was my ability to prioritize. This is a struggle in many ways and impacts many areas of my life.",

Now I see it mostly as fidgeting, lack of focus, impulses, too many projects that don\u2019t get finished, etc. Looking back at my PhD who was hyper focused at times, it helped me get through because I had really bad insomnia and would wake up at 2 am and work on my dissertation for a couple hours and go back to sleep. It helped me focus at the beginning too, to the point where I defended my proposal after my first year. Now as someone without as much focus and more choices, I get great and fun ideas that I have difficulty getting off the ground or finishing.",

I explained the seemingly stupid mistakes I was making (basically knowing not to do what I was doing and/or not realizing I was doing it, being disorganized) and they recognized the things I was doing were similar to their child who has it. Was finally tested at my university and bingo I had it (and comorbid anxiety)! Spent the last semester in the program with that DGS as an informal advisor and taking classes that added to my skills for the job market... and well one of the professors for those classes saw my stats talent and my adhd and she\u2019s now my advisor! When I told her I was diagnosed, she was not even surprised! This program and environment is a better fit for me... though my supervisor for work is very good at planning/time management/documenting everything... so that\u2019s obviously an interesting challenge sometimes... but with help from someone else who seemed to get most of that challenge I seem to be slowly getting better...",

But despite being bad at homework and writing I was good in class and ambitious and passionate about science so ADHD was never brough up. \n\nMy adult life has been filled with frustration as I really struggle to focus on the routine writing tasks at work. I make tonns of small errors and get yelled at for it. Im forgetful and messy and it pisses off my roomates. Over the years this has calcified into depression and the belief that Im just a shi*t person. Why can't I just DO things? Why is it so much effort? \n\nAfter a temp contract working as an industrial chemist I decided to take a career break and get my phd in my early 30s. I've continued with all the same writing struggles as always. But one of the people I follow on academic twitter keeps posting about life as an academic with ADHD. I identify with it so so very much. I took all the tests I could find online for ADHD and I identify with all the questions so much. (In the name of good science i also took a bunch for things i don't think I have and didn't score highly) \n\nSo I'm getting tested next week. Just the thought that this is medical, not a personality flaw gives me hope.",

      "text": "I discovered I had ADHD in the last year of grad school. I had been in therapy for a year prior and had a good hold on my anxiety but still couldn't get myself to write or plan effectively, among other things. My therapist suggested getting tested and to my complete surprise I checked all the boxes. My attention was at the 8th percentile \ud83d\ude2c. Getting the diagnosis was extremely helpful because I finally stopped blaming myself. I educated myself and read literally 20 books and listened to podcasts to understand what I can do to combat it. All of that skill building helped in addition to medication. Within 6 months I made a ton of changes and was able to get my manuscript and thesis published finally. Dealing with ADHD is still a work in progress, but getting the diagnosis was life-changing for me.\n\nEdit - This won't be relevant for everyone but a lot of the negative effects of ADHD were related to a lack of emotional regulation for me. There is a strong correlation between CPTSD and ADHD and solving ADHD alone did not infact rid me of the massive issues that come with CPTSD. That requires learning different concepts and processing a bunch of shit that will screw with your head for weeks or months. If you also had major depression from an early age then it's worth looking into CPTSD.",

I love that youtube channel, and for what it's worth, when I first saw Jessica's TED talk it also brought me to tears.\n\nI'm in the last leg of my PhD and It wasn't until early this year when I saw the aforementioned TED talk that it dawned on me that my life experience had a name to it, and that I wasn't a complete fuck up. I started reading up after that (I highly recommend the book \"Driven to distraction\") and decided to get tested. \n\nUnfortunately, 2 things worked against me there:\n\n1. The NHS (UK health system) has a wait time for up to a year for ADHD diagnosis once you have been referred by your GP. I'm still waiting.\n2. COVID happened. This made the possibility of looking private diagnosis harder.\n\nMy story in general is not disimilar to that of other ADHD-academics: a bunch of successes and a whole bunch of failures. I'm terrible at keeping deadlines but I'm usually commended for the quality of my work.\n\nI'm actually looking for private diagnosis to see if I can get medication soon, as I need to finish my thesis by the end of 2020. I have some of it written but I can't step away from the experiments as the data is not yet good enough! We'll see how it goes.",

      "text": "I was \"unbiasedly\" diagnosed by a new doctor.  I moved cities to start my post-doc so I had to find a new primary care doctor.  On my first visit they had me fill out a long health questionnaire on an ipad.  When he came in to see me he basically asked when I was diagnosed with ADHD and I laughed and was like sorry you've got the wrong patient.\n\nHe said on my survey I scored very high for adult ADHD.  I laughed again and said doesn't everyone score for ADHD nowadays? No one can pay attention to anything for more than a second.  He was not laughing with me and basically said less than 5% of new patients score for ADHD and those that do are mostly all already diagnosed and that we had to address this during this visit.  \n\nWithout knowing anything about me he said that there is a large group of people my age (25-25) that weren't diagnosed as kids because 1) we grew up in an environment were ADHD wasn't widely considered \"real\" by that generation of parents 2) were smart enough to be able to get by in school ie you could still do your home work without paying attention to 100% of the lesson in class 3) having good grades means you were less likely to get flagged for behavior issues which typically are the tipping point for psych evals as kids 4) are currently still high achieving academically 5) have found methods to \"self-medicate,\" particularly caffeine addictions or habits you need to stabilize your mood.\n\nI was embarrassed that I literally checked off every single box.  I was like well doc, I just got my PhD and I drink 64 ounces of caffeinated drinks a day, but I don't really think I have the symptoms of ADHD.  He basically told me I fit the mold so well that if I were to try medication for it I would instantly realize what my symptoms are, as they can vary between people, and the extreme 180 of being on the meds will make what was \"wrong\" before super clear once the meds make it \"right\".  \n\nTaking my first Ritalin completely changed my world view.  The very first thing that changed was not what I expected. Taking out the trash used to cause me physical discomfort - tension in my chest and neck and just an overall mental dread of thinking I have to take the trash out - and I just assumed everyone was like that.  When my wife would take out the trash I just assumed it was a passive aggressive move against me, because its such an awful task she's just showing me she's willing to do it and I'm not. 30 minutes on my Ritalin, while I was thinking \"this stuff isn't working at all\" my wife asked me to take out the trash and I was like yea sure and took it out no problem.  Why WOUDLN'T I want to take out the trash? It would make the kitchen smell bad if I didn't and it's like 10 steps from the trash can to the garage.  When I walked back inside and realized I had just basically *wanted* to take out the trash I nearly cried.  To think how many things in my life have been difficult, which could have been easier, and to think how many times I completely misjudged other people's actions based on my assumptions (my wife taking out the trash was somehow passive aggressive and not a normal or kind gesture of taking care of our home??) just completely rocked me.\n\nThat being said, I don't respond super well to medications (non-stimulants give me bad side effects and even max dose extended release stimulants only last a total of 6 hours a day for me) but just knowing and understanding the condition has helped me significantly.\n\n**TLDR everyone should take an unbiased mental health screen!**",

      "text": "I recently got diagnosed a couple months ago, in the last year of my PhD. It didn't even cross my mind that I could have ADHD, I just always thought I was lazy, anxious, or depressed. I was haunted by the phrase \"not PhD material\". I was even in therapy to address my anxiety. The topic of ADHD just never came up. \n\nI drew out really nice plans and schedules for my days/weeks, structured my days, tried all sorts of productivity hacks, mental approaches, etc. but I wouldn't be able to stick with it very long, or I'd get extremely burnt out after a week or two from the effort of just DOING things on time. \n\nIt wasn't until my psychiatrist friend got concerned about my frustrations with school, and started asking about my childhood study habits, things I thought were totally normal (daydreaming for hours, spacing out in class, not knowing what we're supposed to be doing in group exercises, low self esteem and picking at my hands until they bled from anxiety)... all the way to my habits now (spacing out every minute in lab meetings, can't finish projects, always late, now as an adult). \n\nThe way he said it was, everyone might benefit from a stimulant in some way or another, but the right treatment for the right patient could have far-reaching benefits beyond \"just productivity\". I had nothing to lose-- if the positive benefits outweigh the negative side effects, it's worth a try. He also said women are more likely to be misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression.\n\nI'm on the lowest dose of Concerta, and it is life-changing in the most subtle ways. For example, I didn't even know I had issues getting out the door in the mornings. Apparently it's possible to get ready and be out the door in less than an hour, and I used to get stuck spacing out while getting dressed, sometimes up to an hour or more. My mental health is drastically improved-- I feel more present, and I can actually regulate and manage my emotions. I can actually practice the cognitive behavioral tools I learned in therapy, and they make SO MUCH SENSE now. I can actually sit through lab meetings and follow along!! \n\nI still struggle with motivation and getting started on shit I don't want to do at work, but now I know it's more to do with the anxiety and fear of failure and not because I'm \"not PhD material\". The meds and CBT have helped immensely for me to manage those feelings and start changing my behaviors and approach more organically.",

      "text": "I had just started my last year of my PhD when I just could not sit and write my thesis. Deadlines passed and I got extension after extension because I was really struggling with writing. I took a mental break and visited my parents for the weekend, where my mom mentioned off hand that my ADD probably didn't help with writing... Turns out when I was a kid I was diagnosed and they didn't believe it because I didn't have typical male add symptoms. They just put me in lots of structured classes and sports and it got me through. They thought I outgrew it. In undergrad I got by with just being really smart and making a strict schedule for myself. I definitely broke down a little that my parents were so careless and didn't even tell me. Went to my doctor who assessed me immediately and started meds within a week. I ended up being able to hand in my thesis on time and Im feeling so much better on the meds. It's weird how much focused I can be on a task and actually finish projects through. Kinda pisses me off though, I could have been just that much better of a student in undergrad has I known...\n\nIt's also odd that the meds have also massively helped with my anxiety and coffee addiction \ud83d\ude06",

I am not sure if that's just my confirmation bias or something else. I however see the biorhythm after establishing the quality of my days or week.",
