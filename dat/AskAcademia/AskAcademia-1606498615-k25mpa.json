  "text": "I'm a PhD student in a Biology department, and I specialize in molecular biology and biochemistry so I feel like I'm the target audience for these journals, but I can only get through the first half easily. How the hell do people read the second half on a regular basis every week? It takes me several hours to get through a paper on a topic that I'm not familiar with. \n\nAnd people are definitely reading them, the department delivers them every week to people who have subscribed, and there's quite a few. Mine are just piling up and I am honestly considering tossing them since the new ones are constantly coming in and by the time I read through the backlog they will be irrelevant anyway.",

This was something I was aware of, but the specifics being discussed tipped me to look into it myself and I could connect it to my own research as an example of similar misuse of primary sources for a political/religious purpose.\n\nEdit: but I did write an exhibition catalogue essay on synaptic plasticity and how being deaf could've altered the visual art of Francisco Goya. The essay was ultimately not accepted because I didn't have any preliminary research on the topic completed and it was merely speculative, but I figured it was an interesting idea that was somewhat backed by science, but obviously too late to do research into this specific artists' case at this time.",

This is especially true for experiments that attempt to preempt certain critiques, but don't explicitly say what those critiques are because they assume the audience is someone in the nitty gritty details of Y.\n\nI think Nature and Science are generally for a wider audience so this is less of a problem, but I just have a hard time believing that anyone can read it cover to cover and truly understand the nuances of each experiment outside their own sub-field.",

Just read the papers that are \"obviously relevant\" to you (this is a hazy definition, and one that tends to expand over time as more things become relevant to you) and any others that seem interesting. If you don't really care about a paper by all means skip it.\n\nFor a journal that publishes in my field, I might actually read more than the abstract of 2-5 papers in a monthly issue. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if you keep up with ~30 journals with monthly issues that publish in your field it adds up pretty quickly, and if you do work in multiple specific fields it multiplies even more. Read smart, not hard.\n\nThat being said, don't toss the backlog - published papers do not stop being relevant after some arbitrary best-by date, even if the field advances past older papers they still provide valuable context, insights, and often times contain information that is not replicated or updated in newer papers as people consider that information not worth publishing - and people of course are often wrong.",

Follow journals you like on Twitter, follow BioRxiv or ChemRxiv on Twitter. \n\nIt sounds like a lot, but the more selective you are the more quickly you can stay on top of \u201cpertinent\u201d articles for your research.

There is too much science being published in our own subfields to keep up with, let alone others. The news and commentary articles are good to peruse in Nature/Science though.",
