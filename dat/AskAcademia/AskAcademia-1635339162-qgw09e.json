  "title:": "STEM. How to tell NO to the advisor without being aggressive?",
  "text": "Tl;dr:\n\nIs it still a PhD candidate's duty to apply for awards even when they're in a funded situation? If not, how can I tell the advisor who wants me to, that I don't want to apply?\n\n\\---\n\nI think I'm being vague but fear I'm IDing myself w a bit of info and my PI may lurk these spaces since they're young (yes this may be paranoia but I now get anxiety attacks whenever I receive their email), but here it goes.\n\nI'm an MD-PhD student in a funded program where the program supports my training partially and the lab ends up supporting me for about 3 years of my PhD.\n\nI'm in a lab of a junior faculty, and so unlike my peers, I couldn't even apply for F30/31 fellowship for one reason or another. (Long story short, at the time I was persuaded to go after a reachable goal instead, i.e. internal awards).\n\nI applied and didn't get an internal award either, and I resigned to believe that I am just not a great candidate. (You know not too bright--I joined a junior faculty's lab after all--the nice and dumb one that tries hard). I don't want to believe otherwise as my lack of measurable success despite my working hard doesn't add up.\n\nNow my advisor is pushing me to apply for awards, but I am not one bit motivated to do so, for I can't find confidence in myself, my work, nor in my PI's support (my PI's letter of support doesn't seem to be carrying much effects to the reviewers, since we're all humans with biases after all).\n\nI think I'm not obligated to apply for awards/grants since they should mainly be for my advancement (which I ***feel*** that my advisor has demonstrated a couple of times that is not in their interest, given their choosing of their own advancement over mine time to time--but I'll admit it is my feelings).\n\nWould it be unprofessional of me to say \"I've got a lot on my plate as you know, and would like to focus on these projects first\"?\n\nI know I should because I should look out for myself, but also I'm at this point feeling like cruising my way out (like get a story done) which alone will already be difficult. No more of my elaborate dreams and projects/experiments I used to plan/dream of.\n\nPeople have somehow let me pursue the degree after my roundabout way to it (Non-trad med student, 1st gen college, 1.5 gen immigrant). I know I gotta get back up, but I got nothing left. I'm tired of having to go the roundabout way again for residency (e.g. without fellowships etc) that I am considering dropping out.\n\nThank you if you read through it all.",

We are all funded by the department anyway, but winning an external award generally means less money comes out of the supervisor's grant (meaning they can higher more students, buy more equipment or server time, etc.). It also makes the department and the supervisor's research group look good, so it obviously makes the supervisors very happy when their students win awards. For academic job applications it would also be in your best interest to apply, but I don't know if it's relevant in the private sector or in government. Whether you are *obligated* to depends on your department, but it is probably a good idea either way.",

Since you\u2019re MSTP, funding isn\u2019t an issue\u2014but funding isn\u2019t an issue for most pure PhD candidates in highly ranked schools of medicine. I\u2019m a non-trad MD/PhD who did a whole PhD first\u2014and we were all guaranteed funding independent of our PIs for up to a decade with no teaching requirements. \n\nWe were all encouraged to apply for everything we could. It advanced our CVs, gave us experience dealing with the difficult (and sometimes patently unfair) review process, and helped us learn to write. There were times when my boss discouraged me because he knew the game was rigged for a particular student (a very specific internal award) because he didn\u2019t want me to go all out only to be let down.\n\nLook, getting rejected is hard. There will be a lot of it in your career. Sometimes, it will seem unfair and many times, it will seem like you just got lucky\u2014but that\u2019s science. You need to be good, but you also need to be lucky\u2014because sometimes really cool stuff doesn\u2019t win \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nDon\u2019t get discouraged. Work on your resume. Get those awards. Have some empathy for your young supervisor. They\u2019re trying to survive and believe me when I say they desperately want you to do well\u2014you are a direct reflection of their ability to train at this early point in their career.",

      "text": "To answer the base of your question, I think you need to first answer honestly (not to us, but to yourself) what you want to do with your PhD. Do you want to go into industry? Then applying for grants likely isn't as important. But if you want to go into academia, you need to learn how to write and apply for funding, even if you don't feel like it and even if you already have stable funding. And trust me, no one \"feels like\" writing grants all the time haha. \n\nYour PI is pushing you to apply for internal awards, and you said 3 years of your program is PI funded. Are you sure that your PI has the funding to continue supporting you? That may be an alternative reason they're trying to get you to get your own funding. \n\n>I applied and didn't get an internal award either, and I resigned to believe that I am just not a great candidate. (You know not too bright--I joined a junior faculty's lab after all--the nice and dumb one that tries hard). I don't want to believe otherwise as my lack of measurable success despite my working hard doesn't add up.\n\nI think we need to address some things here. Firstly, you're not going to win every award - applying isn't ever a guarantee. And not getting an award does NOT mean you aren't a great candidate! Sometimes the project doesn't align with the funder's goals, or there can be so many applicants that it gets to where they have to choose between many excellent proposals. You shouldn't take it personally; instead, try to get as much feedback as possible, so you can improve for the next round of applications! And joining a junior faculty members lab isn't necessarily a point against you - many funders are trying to prioritize awarding new labs these days.\n\n>Now my advisor is pushing me to apply for awards, but I am not one bit motivated to do so, for I can't find confidence in myself, my work, nor in my PI's support (my PI's letter of support doesn't seem to be carrying much effects to the reviewers, since we're all humans with biases after all).\n\nYour PI's letter of recommendation actually carries a lot of weight. Sure, one can presume a bias, but a letter of recommendation is expected and if your PI has ALREADY written one for, I think that's a good sign that they're trying to show their support for you. \n\nThe last thing I'll ask, and again this is for your reflection, you don't have to answer here - are you okay? You have many negative statements about your own abilities that seem to be more than imposter syndrome/fears. Please reflect, and strongly consider seeing a therapist or a counselor. Graduate school is hard, and it wears many people down, and I'm afraid that might be happening with you based on how and what you've written. Have you taken any breaks recently? If not, try to take some time off for yourself. You need to prioritize your health and happiness - maybe that will give you the little bit of motivation you need to give a grant application a try =)",

          "text": "This is a fantastic comment. Applying for grants is important if you want to get a job that will require grants/proposals, and not important if you're taking a different path. Literally everyone I know procrastinates on grant-writing, and only gets it done because they HAVE to do it to stay employed. Usually they get excited about writing when they're about halfway through, because in the end it is fun to elaborate on our research.\n\n> there can be so many applicants that it gets to where they have to choose between many excellent proposals.\n\nI'll add to this: when funding agencies say the above phrase, that means they basically rolled some dice to decide which proposals to fund. Because they had that many submissions that were excellent. So really, truly, don't take it personally.\n\nFinally, /u/burntoutgradstudent you do express a lot of negativity about yourself in your post (likewise makes me worried). Food for thought: most of your negative statements are about your interpretations of what events mean, or your assumptions of what people think or might think. They're not based on a lot of evidence. Maybe you would be reassured if you gathered some evidence? Meaning, ask your PI and your colleagues what they think of your progress, or your efforts that haven't gone well. That will help you gauge where you really stand. \n\nDo NOT try to read deeper into their answers -- take them at their words. You'll worry that they're just being nice, but you can mitigate that effect by asking careful questions. Such as wording your question in a way that communicates you would be relieved/happy to know something concrete to improve on.",

However those weren't quite the ideas my advisor wanted to see, and I know I can't be writing a training award/grants on something too new, but I am at a point in my project where writing a award application for my \"approved\" project is basically asking for retroactive experiment reimbursements, not the other way around.\n\nI think I am too hung up on the F grant, but *not even applying* for an F made me feel as though I didn't even start with getting my foot in the door never mind starting off with a wrong foot (~~F >~~ K > R). Seeing how competitive it is second hand, not having an F sounds like a risk considering I'm in a small lab if I don't end up with a NSC.\n\nThat said, I am aware F grants aren't everything, and in fact my consolation compromise / alternative target for not applying was that I would get to finish more projects....which isn't turning out too well right now. (0 / 2 collab co-author, 1 in prep but end nowhere in sight). They may have wanted my greed (pursuing multiple projects which I did push at one point, and trying to submit an F) to shift down the gear, but instead my whole engine has stalled.\n\nI appreciate my advisor for all they do considering their own situation where their future is not yet certain. For that reason I'd like to think they mean well, but at the same time being a human myself sometimes I am not sure if they also see my success as theirs, just as I had once thought theirs would be mine.\n\nPerhaps with my inability / inefficiency I've been behind schedule so I couldn't catch a break for a while now, but I'll try.\n\nbeste gr\u00fc\u00dfe,",

Sure feel bad (for a little bit) - but then how do you move on?\n\nHow about these reasons:\n\n1. Gosh, sometimes it's a way to take stock of your progress/thinking. Considering how you might feel stuck or \"no be motivated\" - this could be a nudge of motivation of summarizing your thoughts, crafting a study / proposal / idea - can sometimes help with your thinking. \\[or realize how much you've learned / maturd\\]\n2. Building CV. Okay, so you are funded but add to your CV. As in #1 - it'll be good practice describing your work, contextualizing it, and your contribution (and experience applying for monies / job / opportunities latr)\n\nI hope you adviser is being sincere and believes in you and your work... that is why they are nudging you. (trying NOT to be cynical or pessimistic).\n\nI could NOT say no to my adviser.... so it ain't easy... do you have drafts you can just keep updating?\n\nMaybe with adviser prioritize which to apply for?\n\nGood luck.... this journey ain't easy... you can do it!",

      "text": "I got rejected by 8 awards before getting one on the ninth try. It's hard. But, once I got one my advisor treated me so much better since I was saving them money. I would still encourage you to apply even if you're getting rejected. It's great practice distilling all your ideas into a concrete pitch. Also, if your PI really wants you to apply ask them to help with revisions once you've gotten a first draft. Your PI's input will help tremendously, since these proposals are basically a sales pitch to experienced scientists.",

      "text": "\"I've got a lot on my plate as you know, and would like to focus on these projects first\"), I would think they are not doing well in the program and would question their commitment. Your post indicates you are discouraged and if you tell your advisor this, they will definitely know.\n\nThere are a few things you might be missing. First, part of why such programs with funding are possible are because some of the funded students bring in external funding. This is why even when students are fully funded, the program desires and possibly requires that extra funding. While you might still be funded if you don't apply, you are hurting the cohort by not applying. It is a bit selfish to take the money and not try to contribute, although as you note you do have that option.\n\nEven if you remain only focused on yourself only, it is in your best interest to apply to learn how to write grants and also for your CV. That is another reason why your advisor may be recommending that you apply. It is a good thing for you to do. It is part of the doctoral student process.\n\nYou seem to be under the impression that you have little chance of getting awards because you applied for one and didn't get it. As you move up the ladder, you will get less and less of the things you apply for as the competition gets stiffer, but this doesn't mean that you won't get any. It means you need to get used to some level of rejection. Your advisor would not recommend you for these awards if they did not think you were deserving and competitive.\n\nYou also have some strange comments in your post about how your advisor's letter does not seem to be compelling for reviewers. Blaming your advisor for you not getting an award is not a good attitude. Awards are just competitive. Even if you really have a bad advisor, many award programs, including some you mention, require multiple letters. Do you have other reason to suggest you do not have your advisor's support? If they really had no faith in you, they would not be recommending you for awards.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your insight from another point of view.\n\nWhile I do not want to waste your time, I appreciate the time you took to give me a thorough response, so I would like to clarify in case my post gave a different impression.\n\nYou were of course right on some parts 100%. I will take full responsibility of my immature complaint of not getting an award, and I have no excuses for that.\n\nYou also had a great point, that I did have a terrible attitude regarding my advisor's letter. I am upset at myself for having had doubts. Just now I've re-read a recommendation letter from my advisor (I know almost all are confidential, but this low-key award application for a conference did not care about who delivers it, so I was given it). While almost all was spent on how their idea was great and I am on it, I noticed one buried phrase I missed, that I \"show\\[ed\\] great potential...\" (sniff. much more cathartic because all this time I thought it was completely about them). So while I could argue that they were saying nice things because they wanted to save money (because most of the things I am encouraged to apply support only benefit the lab budget directly), I'll concede on this point. You are right.\n\nHowever, there are also a few things I would like to clarify.\n\nI begged my advisor to let me apply for a grant that would support my stipend for the 2 of 3 years that I am funded by the lab's account. At the time however, I was told to work on the experiment which would be more productive. The award I did apply for was an internal grant that would still support the 2 of 3 years. While I didn't actively seek and get the awards (I'd have to ask which ones my advisor would approve of my applying so I didn't bother looking), I don't think I am that selfish for not applying for every $3000 awards I could find (yes this is the range I am allowed to apply for).\n\nI've spent days, nights, weekends (holidays and whatnot) working on the lab work. I haven't seen my family in almost 3 years (okay, that one's from COVID). I braced driving in almost a foot of snow in my non-SUV car just so I can keep the experiments going. I am sure I'm not the brightest nor the most eloquent/talented student, but I am sure I've made it up with grit thus far, and I could provide my CV prior to this lab to support this.\n\nNonetheless, I appreciate your thoughtful comments. I do have some things to work on for sure, so I appreciate it. However, I just hope you understand that this isn't something that happened overnight.\n\nbeste gr\u00fc\u00dfe,",
