  "title:": "Is it a bad idea to get a PhD in philosophy?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been debating which graduate degree to get for years. I have an undergrad degree in French, and I\u2019ve bounced around in ideas, thinking about getting a grad degree in Linguistics, social work, French, TESOL, on and on. The main issue for me is passion vs financial security. The things that would give me the most job options are uninteresting to me, and the things that do interest me\u2026not a lot of career options. It\u2019s not that I need to make a lot of money, to be clear. It\u2019s the fear that I\u2019ll get the degree and not be able to support myself at a minimum and pay off my debt, if I can\u2019t find a job. \n\nPhilosophy seems like the worst fit for this! It\u2019s not a versatile degree! But it\u2019s the most interesting to me. I know I love language, and I think studying philosophy of language would be fascinating. My mind works very abstractly, I love the theoretical and abstract, and I love living an examined life. I think it might be the perfect fit. \n\nWhen I think about what I would think about my life when I\u2019m nearing my end, I don\u2019t want to think, \u201cman, I paid off that debt fast. I really bought a lot of good stuff, too.\u201d I want to think, \u201cI tried to understand. I didn\u2019t go blindly through this life. I didn\u2019t focus just on the money. I really wanted to live an examined life, and I did.\u201d And I also want to feel like I excelled at something. And I think I would excel in academia, in this field. \n\nYet, money is a thing. Lol. \n\nAny thoughts? Especially from people studying or working in philosophy?",

      "text": "What are your goals, exactly? A tenure track job in academia? To have an interesting experience? To get a PhD?\n\nIf it's a TT job, you should be aware that the job market in philosophy is beyond terrible. Look at this data: https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/04/where-the-tt-jobs-werent-in-2020-21.html\n\nGranted, last year for hiring was an absolute garbage fire everywhere. But, say it doubles again over that data - there's still only ~10-15 jobs related to phil language every year.\n\nIf you're goal is to have an interesting experience and learn from interesting people, then go for it, especially if you are young, don't care where you live, and can live off ~$20k/yr.\n\nIf you want a PhD for some other reason, think hard about what those reasons are. You may develop some transferable skills studying philosophy, but no one outside of academia will give a shit that you have a PhD. If you were strategic, you could incorporate some linguistics or NLP into your studies (but this doesn't sound like your jam).\n\nFinally, grad school spots in philosophy are super competitive. Depending on how much philosophy you did as an undergrad, you may need to take some post-bacc classes or audit some grad seminars in order to put together a decent application and find profs to write letters for you.\n\nMy advice, fwiw, would be to look into a funded MA - you can see if academic philosophy is really for you, and put together a really solid PhD application.\n\nsource: I am a PhD student in philosophy",

Everyone is pretty much hyperaware of how risky this career choice is and it can be taxing to deal with such an atmosphere for a long time. You basically have to love the work for it to be worth it.",

The market is awful to echo above--many colleagues stayed for 5-7 years and ended up working in administration and moving away from the field.
