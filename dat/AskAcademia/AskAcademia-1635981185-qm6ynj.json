  "title:": "What are the trade-offs of being a tenure-track STEM professor at a top vs. mid ranked university?",
  "text": "Right now I have the following pros/cons in my mind for top (e.g. top 15) vs. mid (e.g. top 100) ranked universities. It would be great if people who have experience in either situation could correct my thinking anywhere it might be off. I care a lot about both teaching and research. I also care about having a family.\n\nFor a top ranked university I would expect you enjoy more prestige; higher quality graduate students and postdocs for your research; more motivated, well-behaving, and sharper undergraduates in the classes you teach; and an easier time supporting your group due to name recognition, highly motivated colleagues for collaborative grant writing, internal funding opportunities, and more extensive and seasoned administrative support.\n\nFor a (still good, but) lower ranked university I would expect you enjoy a less stressful tenure process; a healthier work/life balance and possibly healthier mindset regarding the importance of work vs. life; probably a comparatively higher teaching-to-research ratio (could be good or bad); and generally speaking less stress and less extreme expectations for bringing in funding and publishing. Also probably less pay, and (for STEM) fewer / harder-to-come-by consulting opportunities.\n\nSo in summary, in my mind it feels like choosing between having a more impressive and successful career versus having a more stress-free and balanced life. Would you generally agree or disagree with this view?",

      "text": "I would not automatically assume that the mid-tier position is lower stress, especially if it's an aspirational department or school (i.e., are they satisfied being mid-tier?) Also, so much academic stress comes from acquiring funding, recruiting students who will be productive, and general resource limitations. These things are all likely to be better at a top program. \n\n\nObviously there are exceptions, but all else equal I would always choose the top-tier program.",

      "text": "I think the assumption that stress is high in a top15, and low in a top100 is unfounded. In fact, I would imagine that working with more unprepared undergraduates to be more stressful. Same with supervising less experienced graduate students, and recruiting postdocs or students that can take off some of the supervisory load. The extra teaching would also contribute greatly to stress, because having less time to do everything just amps up the time pressure.",

      "text": "I would say it really depends: so you end up in an R1 that is a well oiled machine? Collegial? Supportive? where you know your tenure expectations (and it\u2019s not so amorphous and vague) - i think institutions with unions might help here.\n\nWould that not be relief to know clear expectations? \n\nAs stated above, a mid-tier university without the resources but wants seeks R1 designation will work you to the bone w/o all possible structures in place to support you. (there are also probably exceptions).\n\nOne note about students (though i hate deficit thinking of students at any level) - but at R1 students , okay the students might be cream of the drop of students - their commitment varies. being in education we prepare them to commit for student teaching\u2026. not easy.\n\nI taught at more suburban / urban / non R1 universities and the students are AMAZING. They worked to pay  their tuition, some commuted to school - they have no time to waste, they expect your best because their future / careers depends on your being the best instructor to them.\n\nLOVED those students\u2026 kept me on my toes and asked some of the  most critical questions i had encountered.\n\nSo in my opinion : what do you want?\nand try to get the best / most insight about institutions to find out what they value and how they value your quality of life. currently i am in an urban institution that provides resources and are responsive  to us. \n\nAnd, your not tied to any institution. If it\u2019s not working  for you, go elsewhere (we did and so have others we know).\n\ngood luck!",

      "text": "One of the criteria evaluated in funding proposals is \"environment.\" So at top universities, every grant starts with a better score by virtue of being there.\n\nRelated, one of the reasons \"environment\" matters is because of access to resources -- intellectual resources, equipment. Mid-ranked universities might not have the people or equipment you need to do the work you want to do.\n\nAnother reason \"environment\" matters is because of infrastructure. Top universities will have grants management support at every level, and may have analytics or technical cores to make your job easier. (Eg assays I used to do in-house get done for free by a core and they just email me the results.)\n\nAll of that is to say that top universities set you up for success in a way that mid-ranked universities may not.\n\nMaybe mid-tier institutions adjust their expectations accordingly. But the bottom line to me is that you just can't do the work as effectively and you feel that pressure at every stage of the game (hiring, writing, funding, training). For better or worse, success begets success and it's easier to succeed if you start at the top.",
