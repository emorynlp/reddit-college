  "title:": "I tried to bring my research to wider public, but instead I was ridiculed by several high profile academics, in public. How should I deal with this situation?",
  "text": "Hi. I'm a grad student near the end of my study (yay), only needing to revise my thesis atm. My research has me working closely with disenfranchised communities, partly a result of policies by the current administration in where I live. I was deeply engaged with the community, and I think it's important to bring the conversation to wider public. So, in my excitement, I wrote several essays for some newspapers and magazines to bring public attention to this issue.\n\nWhile I did expect to receive a fair of criticism on my writings, I didn't expect to receive *this much*.\n\nSo, imagine having a president like Trump, with the exception that he is a huge media darling that the mainstream media covered every inches of his step with fanfare. We had an election recently, and he won the presidency. The situation was still hot, a bit hotter than I thought.\n\nThen my essays got published.\n\nHonestly, I didn't expect that much people to read my essays, but they did. Someone posted it on Twitter, and I was lambasted for being too critical of the government. I was mocked as \"SJW\" (lol), \"not supporting development programs\", and the classic, \"can you do better than the government\". I was also accused as affiliated to the opposition who lose the election. Yeah the sectarianism is that bad. But at first I thought, okay, I can handle this, it's just bunch of Twitter randos.\n\nBut then some high profile academics, actively tweeting, also got some words on my article. They're not in my field, but they're like celebrity academics here. And oh boy, their comments weren't the warmest. I was called as \"looking for attention\". The worst part is I looked up to one of them. Well, I have only met him a few times, but his writings (used to?) inform a part of my thesis. I know some of them work closely with the current administration. But I wasn't expecting to be called out like this.\n\nSo yeah. I talked to my advisor, and according to him many people in this academic community do love this Trump-esque president. And getting close to the government makes it easier to get grants. He might be biased tho because he doesn't like the president, but I digress.\n\nIf he was right though, oh boy. It's really discouraging. I entered the grad school in the hopes of bringing academic conversation to wider public, but I'm not sure if the stake is that high I can endure. I feel very alienated at the moment. I'm afraid that I've made enemies with some people in the academic community.\n\nSo Reddit prof, I'm asking for your opinions. Am I just being unnecessarily worried or my anxiety is justified? How should I navigate through this situation? Any future for me in academia?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR was trying to bring my thesis to wider public, instead I got lambasted by both the public and several academic celebrities. Now I feel anxious in connecting to the public and the academic community outside of my field in general.\n\nI'm not in the States btw, and this is obviously a throwaway. Thanks! :)",

If your work was widely criticised by academics in a conference on your field then that's different. Those are the people you need to impress.\n\nKeep in mind that even in a politically neutral field like astronomy we get this sort of nonsense going on the comment section. This is just what the public act like, especially on the internet, and especially on twitter.\n\nHonestly, I would see this as a positive thing, in terms of your career. You have reached out and made a real effort on public engagement that has made a genuine impression. The fact that the response is so negative (although it might be good to check through the responses to genuinely count how many are positive and how many are negative - we tend to count negative comments more than positive ones) actually highlights the importance of your research.",

Very young people who aren't in academia at all publish political pieces in online mags all the time, and most people seem to think it's fair game to discuss those pieces, and lambast the author if it is particularly bad.",

Whether you warranted the criticism you received depends not only on what you wrote, but how you present yourself. These articles were presumably published in public periodicals, you should not think that being a post-grad means that you should be treated with kid gloves, especially if what you are saying is intentionally incendiary. For you, you will need to decide how legitimate the criticism is. It sounds like you have already internalized these comments as unreasonable, but I would advise you against the temptation of martyrdom. You said you were already expecting criticism, so it sounds like there probably **was** an element of attention seeking in your writing (which is not a fault of itself, you want eyes on your writing and this is a valid way to do so). Provocation is not a problem in academia, but if it is poorly done, lacking supporting evidence or compelling argumentation, then the result is usually (not always) what seems to have happened to you. \n\nThe best you can do is take the criticisms you are given constructively, and look honestly at what you tried to achieve and consider where you failed, and more importantly, embrace the parts where you succeeded.",

I\u2019ve played around with the idea of starting a podcast or writing some think pieces just to kind of throw some ideas out there and be creative, but I couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nI don\u2019t think I could handle public shaming. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing that celebrity academics would look at a young academic trying to do good by their community and say \u201cthey\u2019re looking for attention\u201d and not think that is actually a huge blow to someone\u2019s self esteem coming out of grad school. This is not how we encourage public dialog and civil discourse.",

Anything reaching public funding for anyone group will not be uncontroversial. And publishing in news papers will attract public attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, if your research is solid, the publicity may be a boon in the long run, so long as you address critics with logic and grace.",
