  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently in the process of deciding between two graduate school programs - Holy Names University and Marymount University. Both are dual degree programs - counseling and forensic psychology. The main appeal of MU is that it is near the DC area and they have alliances and connections with federal and government institutions. However, HNU is in Oakland I've always wanted to go to school in CA. How much does where you go to school matter? I've had conversations with friends that go one of two ways:\n\n\\- It doesn't matter where you go because it is about the connections you form that will land you jobs. After graduating, only experience matters - not which school you attended. This means I can always try and find a job wherever I want anyway. \n\n\\- It does matter because the people you meet during your program are the ones who will connect you with the job opportunities. This means that if I go to school in DC, I will likely land a job in DC and the same goes for attending school in Oakland.\n\nAlso, Oakland is a major city which means more opportunities but also more competition while DC is a hub for opportunities in the field as it is where a lot of federal and legal institutions are. So I'm kind of lost. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight on this matter?",

      "text": "Both perspectives are true. Your skills, experience, and connections are the strongest factors in determining your job placement. At the same time, most schools have stronger reputation and connections locally than nationally. The connection is that your primary skills/experience credential is your degree and your network is primarily from your program.\n\nKeep in mind that this is mostly about your first few years of work after school. To the extent that degree accredidation and licensure allows, you should have increasing flexibility to move around the country as your network builds and you have more credentials beyond just your degree.\n\nA mitigating factor is if you're able to do summer internships out of state. Employers are more willing to gamble on summer interns than on full-time hires (e.g., by hiring a student from a less-familiar program) and a successful summer internship can translate to a full-time offer once you graduate.",

      "text": "School reputation is far and away the most important thing for your first job - unless you really luck out and make a robust personal connection. I'm assuming you're doing a Master's degree. Otherwise, reputation matters quite a bit less.\n\nThat said, your two universities are almost identical in that respect. Marymount is marginally more prestigious/competitive but unless you're applying for a job where the hiring manager is obsessed with regional Catholic universities, it's super unlikely the school will make a difference either way. \n\nBeing in DC gives you prestigious internships/work opportunities. In the summer, you'll be competing with elite universities (e.g. ivies) for the big name agencies and may have a harder time than in Oakland. In the fall/spring though, the door is basically wide open - you'll just need to be able to balance your studies. \n\nIn the long run, it won't end up mattering all that much. If you know you want to work government, do DC. If you don't really care all that much, Oakland isn't going to close any doors and living in CA can be nice.",

It's in Oakland, but the Bay Area is a hub area. Everything is connected, and to be honest, the area where HNU is at isn't particularly a huge anything.\n\nI actually did some years of F Psych before dropping out because the professors did a horrible job of selling me on the profession. Everyone just seemed kinda miserable, there were multiple times when police officers would literally come with propaganda (I'm not joking, imagine almost those 'In the arms of an angel' music videos with the puppies, just replace with LE) vids trying to recruit us into the Alameda Sheriff's Department which I felt very weirded out by.",
