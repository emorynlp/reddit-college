  "title:": "My professor is writing my LOR and asked for a summary of intentions",
  "text": "My professor wants a summary of my intentions for the MA program I\u2019m applying to so he can effectively write the letter of recommendation.\n\nI\u2019m probably overthinking this but - how should I write it and what should I include? How long should it be? I\u2019m eager to know what academia would appreciate to see in something like this and what kind of information would help most. \n\nIt might be a really simple step in the process but I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself and do the wrong thing!\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "It seems helpful to include a summary of what you want to pursue and list of things that qualify you for consideration with an emphasis on how your work/course study/research with this professor is specifically significant to this pursuit.
