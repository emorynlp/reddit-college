  "text": "Hi! I recently submitted my thesis for examination and the department I am at requested I place all my figures at the end of the chapter they belong in, even after all references. I am in STEM and find this very strange. It also seems incredibly tedious for the examiners to page though 20+pages to see a figure then scroll back to the text. I did it of course but I was wondering if this is normal for other universities or departments and if there is any benefit in doing so.",

Your committee will likely just open two documents on their computer and view the tables while reading the MS, so it\u2019s not really that difficult either way. \n\nHonestly most of the formatting requirements are just formalities. Mine required chapter titles to be all caps, and there had to be a certain number of spaces before the text. That\u2019s super specific stuff that no one cares about, but it\u2019s also easy enough to do so there\u2019s no incentive to change it. I just shrugged and did it too.",
