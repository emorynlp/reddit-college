  "text": "I want to give an RBG bobble head to my Professor who has impacted me so much. She has championed for me, and given me great opportunities as being her TA and a scholarship. I want to give her a gift for winter break, so I got her an RBG bobble head, as she is a feminist activist and a lawyer. But I don\u2019t want to cross any boundaries or make her uncomfortable. I know there is some policy that professors can\u2019t accept gifts, or overall some professors get uncomfortable. \n\nI have a nice, but cheap candle that I can give her as a second option. What do you think?",

Wait until after she has entered any final grades for you (if she's still your instructor). I've gotten a couple gifts like these - they truly mean a lot. Your prof will love it.",

You should definitely do it, it will mean so much to them!!",

He's got a big thing about flowers. A wooden chess set cause he's only ever played online. A few small joke things, a bright pink sparkly glitter pimp cup and a plastic piggy bank for when he's too old to work anymore he can fall back on his change savings. And then I handmade sea turtle shaped chocolate bars for him. And he said, \"I don't deserve this.\" And I said, \"no, you do not, but all that could change when you let me set up my saltwater tank in your lab.\"    \n\n\nGive her both the gifts. She works her ass off and doesn't make nearly enough money for it or get nearly enough appreciation for it.",
