      "text": "Not work for free. Seriously. \n\nOur GTAs here are hired for 17 hours per week. They\u2019re told to keep careful track of their hours. Few do, and the ones that do often report working 20 or more hours. Much of this is trickle-down from demanding faculty supervisors, and so of course it\u2019s understandable - if you\u2019re handed a stack of 300 papers to grade, you probably don\u2019t feel permission to stop until the stack is graded. \n\nBut what I scream (figuratively) at grad students is twofold: not only are they laborers in an exploitative system who *must* be their own advocates, but them doing extra work shows upper levels of administration that our needs as a School can be met with our current numbers of GTAs, or perhaps less. Last year in the budget reductions, we lost 8 GTAs, in part because of the perception that we could fill the needs of the school with fewer people. Why? Because GTAs didn\u2019t report their hours and/or consented to unpaid overtime.\n\nI guess to bring this more in line with the spirit of your question, I\u2019d like to see every GTA view themselves as a working, professional member of academia, and all that entails. Ideally, it would lead to accountability alongside self-advocacy, two things that I think academia in general could use a bit more of.",

I told some relevant people in the department about it and not only was I given preference for a light assignment the next term, but the terrible course I'd taught was given an additional TA to manage the workload. \n\nNobody, except the accountants, wants overworked TAs. But you can only ensure assignments are reasonable if you advocate for yourself. That's just the way almost all workplaces are--management asks for stuff, workers tell them if it's too much. It actually works reasonably well if you're lucky.",

It has taken many hours of my time and has of course branded me as a \"troublemaker\" in the department. We are still made to work principal instructorship jobs that take around 20 hours a week while only getting paid for 12. No faculty members (even the ones who are sympathetic to our issues) have stepped up to meaningfully help push back against these exploitative practices. Even the ones who are sympathetic to us end up being apologists for these practices when the issue is raised in department meetings (talking about how our budget is shrinking, or how back in their day they also had to teach without adequate training/support, etc.). \n\nAdvocating for our labour rights is another job on top of the job we already aren't getting fully paid for. Grad students are generally facing a lot of precarity (and will likely continue to do so after graduation considering how academia increasingly relies on precarious labour). It shouldn't all be on us to advocate for the end to this exploitation; faculty members who are in positions of relative power and security should ideally be meaningful accomplices in this work.\n\nAnyway, that's my perspective after 3 years of organizing and advocating that have resulted in zero change from the department and zero involvement from faculty in this struggle beyond a few who offer words of support. I am really glad to hear that you encourage your students to not work beyond their alotted hours, and to document their hours, though. Changing the culture is important. But unfortunately no matter how much energy and work grad students put into advocating for our rights as labourers, we have little powe and influence in the institution, and if we hope to make progress then faculty members need to be joining us in the fight in tangible ways.",

One of their GTAs studied privately with me, and what started as jokingly discussing the student's overload eventually turned into serious concerns about their wellbeing. I immediately started asking/telling the student to keep excessively careful, to-the-minute track of their hours, and to encourage the other GTAs for this faculty member to do the same. It didn't even take the whole term to have evidence that I could take back to administration that our GTAs were being overworked. The response was virtually immediate: the class in question was given more GTA hours, and the faculty in question was directed to immediately revise their syllabus to require less grading.\n\nWhat happens if I, or any other TT faculty, go into my administration's office without that kind of communication or paper trail? Maybe not nothing, but certainly substantially less than we got.",

He doesn't dislike all my ideas perse but he will sometimes tell me to \"think more\" or \"go deeper\" and then not give me any other constructive feedback. Sometimes I feel I truly have thought about everything in a particular experiment (like when he told me that an experiment didn't make sense but switched courses when I cited sources that had done experiments with similar logic and sources that displayed that my interpretation of cell lineages was correct) and he still doesn't have any helpful feedback. We didn't have meetings for months until I told him that I need weekly meetings to help me stay on track, and he was also right when he reduced my projects from 4 to 2, because it became clear to both of us that I needed to be able to focus on one project at a time versus spreading myself too thin on several projects. Basically, my assessment is that he thinks I expect too much guidance while giving me very little guidance and then criticizing many of the plans I do show him without giving me useful feedback to improve my plans.

I'm glad you all reduced that number. \n\nWhy do you think that he thinks you're asking for too much guidance? Is he really thinking this? It's important to avoid assuming. These assumptions will make it difficult for you to ask for the mentoring you need.\n\nIt's essential to get out of the mindset that \"they know best.\" We all are fallible; your advisor may have assumed something about an area of research or forgotten and changed their mind once they understood their initial call was wrong. It's frustrating because as a student, you may have to argue for your point and stroke his ego or defend things you know are true but don't get too hung up on that part. It sucks, but from my experience, focusing on the annoying stuff (even if I had a valid complaint) only made me more bitter and didn't help me move forward. Focus on what you can do to help you move forward. In a way, this experience reflects that he's open to changing his advice/direction once he learns he's wrong. So you may want to have papers and research studies ready for any decisions or suggestions you make in the future.\n\nI think the big issue here is that you're not getting enough feedback. What have you tried (outside of asking for more meetings)? Without knowing anything about what you've tried, here are some ideas:\n\n1. Come to meetings with several ideas for the next steps on each project, catch him up on what you talked about last time, discuss what you've done, discuss on next steps.\n2. When he shoots ideas down, see if he'll engage in a conversation about it to get some insight into why she shoots down ideas (I understand this may not work if the advisor is aggressive/rude/man)\n3. Maybe you'll have to move forward with little feedback from him. Think about what this would look like? Are there other faculty/researchers you can ask for feedback? Do you have a thesis committee that can provide guidance?\n4. Write every morning, even without guidance. Just write. I don't know why, but this helps.\n\nOne other idea is to try and find a student who worked with him in the past and graduated. See if they have advice on how to work well with him. \n\nSorry for the rambling in my reply! Good luck!",

People (especially trainees) get tunnel vision and often forget to consider the fundamental principles that *cause* the effects they're measuring. Thinking about your work in these terms is a habit that you'll need to practice, and figuring out what that means in context of your field/experiment will be a real lightbulb moment.

Ok maybe im dramatizing). We mostly experience only having what needs to be fixed pointed out to us and end up doing the same when we give feedback.  It is difficult to point out everything that works but I do try to point out sections that are particularly well done. I used to write a summary of what worked when i first started teaching. I should start doing that again. I also think this as an area where you can ask your advisor \u201cOverall,  what do you think worked? \u201c Also keep in mind that although i used writing as an example this apple to all areas of research (analyses, data collection, etc).",

          "text": "I think that it's hard to figure out where to even start sometimes. Once you've done something once, it's easier to replicate it. But a lot of advisors just expect their students to walk in and be ready to go.\n\nThe example I have is my first year.\n\nI was taking stats, 2 core classes, and a seminar. Also TAing. My advisor had put me on 4 projects. And I just didn't even know how to push them forward. For the stats especially, the attitude is \"we don't care; just figure it out yourself\". But for me to execute the right stats, it means I need to know a lot more stats to select the correct one, then learn to program it, then correctly interpret the results. It is a much bigger project than someone telling me \"do this statistic, I'll demonstrate once and check your work\". I didn't even know how to allocate my time, because it always felt like everything was due two weeks ago, and every project I was doing involved me teaching myself an entire subject to figure out which corner of it was relevant to me. \n\nI guess, my frustration is advisors who don't give enough structure. Especially the first two years, hand holding seems necessary. Research feels like building a house, and it's terrifying to show up thinking you're apprenticing for a house builder and have them say \"okay, here are some tools, figure out the foundation. We'll talk in 2 weeks!\". I want to watch someone do it, and assist, before I am the project manager and worker.  As a novice there is so much research that goes into that, before you can even begin. Without guidance, it feels insurmountable.",

I would reiterate the strange resistance to asking advisors or professors for guidance, the requests for extensions that absolutely don't help (an extra 24 hours has never fixed a grad level research paper, I promise), and the weird personal boundaries (which are also definitely exacerbated by gender, age, and race). \n\nI'll  add that lack of personal respect and gratitude is one that's bumming me out a bunch right now. Grad students are busy, but a lot of professors put our all into helping to support them in any way we can and we barely ever get a \"thank you.\" This doesn't mean I want a gift or a big show of it, but literally just saying the words without being prompted would be nice. I feel like too many grad students assume everything we do for them is just expected and part of the job. It's not. Please acknowledge the emotional and affective labor that we do for you, especially if it involves something you consider mentorship.",

I am in econ, so some of this is probably field-specific:  \n\n\n1. Not taking feedback seriously.  Ultimately, it's the grad student's own research and I cannot make decisions for them.  But, if I tell you to think about something more carefully, there is a good reason for it.\n2. Using research as an excuse to shirk other responsibilities.  I saw this a lot from my classmates when I was a PhD student and among some of my advisees now.  Too many grad students interpret the freedom they have to structure their own time as permission to disappear.  Meeting with seminar speakers, presenting in reading groups, giving talks in internal brown bags -- these activities are all super important for professional development (especially learning how to talk about research in a clear and effective manner!), and faculty will notice if you don't show up.\n3. Overstepping personal boundaries.  This one is tricky.  As someone who was very recently on the job market, I recognize that my value added as a dissertation committee member is being more \"relatable.\"  To me, that means being transparent about the day-to-day challenges -- code not working, models not solving, results that don't make sense -- that arise in the course of doing research and helping PhD students troubleshoot those.  And I try my best to normalize the fact that research is just really, really hard.  What irks me is when an advisee uses me as a substitute therapist.  (No judgment there, btw -- I am of the firm belief that every single PhD acceptance letter should automatically be accompanied by a referral to a local psychologist.)  I want to be as supportive as possible of advisees, but addressing someone's underlying mental health difficulties is not my primary responsibility.",

We have been fortunate to continue our seminars virtually during the pandemic.  However, it is understandably difficult for speakers to commit to a full day of meetings, so the grad students get squeezed out.\n\nAnother downside of nobody working at their offices in the department anymore is fewer incidental run-ins with grad students.  When I was a PhD student, a surprising amount of advising occurred from, say, bumping into my committee chair in the hallway, him asking me how X was going, and us chatting about it for a while.  We had more formal meetings too, of course, but I always liked those interactions --  it made grad school feel less dehumanizing!",

He can comfortably tell a grad student \"you're not accounting for x's research and honestly that's a huge weak spot in your argument\" because he's previously asked them \"could I get your feedback on an argument I'm going to make in a paper? I've got the sense I'm missing an angle but can't figure out what\". There are a gillion other ways he earns students' trust, but that's just one example.\n\nFor people he doesn't know well -- like at a talk, say -- I've noticed he does a few different things. If the speaker was way off base about something, he'll take the heat as the initial hardass questioner but then invite his grad students to make the \"here's what I liked, and to make sure that comes through, what I'd watch out for is...\" constructive comments. \n\nI'm trying to think of how to broaden this to critiquing generally rather than in a role as a faculty member. So I won't presume to speak for his philosophy on this stuff, but my take is to describe it like this, that the person in front of him deserves his full attention and care and (or sometimes _but_) he has a responsibility to say what those who can't be there would say. That means other researchers but also those without the same privileges he has. He always seems to be channelling a collective argument rather than something that's his, so it makes the critiqued person feel like they're part of something bigger and has a responsibility to it.",

          "text": "I want to provide another perspective on the \"too much venting with other students\" point. My department has an ongoing problem with sexual violence (multiple faculty members are known predators), glaring racism (from comments made in classes to clear discrimination in award processes), homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc. Students are paid for 12 hours of work per week for jobs that actually take 20 hours (and we must do these jobs in order to get a funding package). Students who have tried to address these issues in our department have been retaliated against, given the run-around, etc., and the institution has continually protected the status quo.\n\nThese are NOT problems unique to my department. They are pervasive in academia. (Check out Sarah Ahmed's \"What's the Use?\" for an incisive account and analysis of how institutions suppress attempts to address sexual violence and discrimination. There are also many other opportunities to learn about this kind of thing just by listening to the people in the institution who experience this stuff, particularly paying attention to the voices of women of colour). \n\nSolidarity and support among fellow students has been the one thing that makes this environment survivable for me as a disabled queer woman (and I'm white so I only experience a fraction of the b.s. that some of my colleagues do). And even those grad students who have relatively more privilege (e.g., cishet abled white men) are still contending with things like the unpaid labour the department squeezes out of us. \n\nVenting with fellow students isn't a process of choosing to stew in negativity. It is a process of validating and supporting each other in the face of discrimination, exploitation, and sometimes even violence.",

              "text": "I think there's a spectrum of \"helpfulness of venting\" that needs to be taken into account here. Venting with peers serves to help us process events. By talking things over we organize our thoughts, solidify how we feel about them, etc. I'm pretty sure it's a real psychological process.\n\n* In the situation you describe, where very stressful, harmful events are occurring, a lot of venting is really understandable. There's a *lot* of processing that needs to happen for people involved in those events. That's confirmed by your statement that people in the vent sessions walk away feeling those sessions were helpful and made them feel better.\n\n* On the other hand, people in a less traumatic environment will have minor grievances that don't necessarily *need* so much processing. Recovering (feeling better) from those issues is ideally addressed with a different psychological method, like a 2-minute share/vent session and then a deliberate attempt to shift focus to something else (i.e., to move on with life). They'll know this was the best solution because in a few hours they won't still be upset about those minor grievances. If instead they applied the super-processing tool of long vent sessions, maybe they would walk away feeling still upset about their issues (albeit validated), which is effectively amplifying those issues. This is at least how it works for me -- if I let myself dwell on how my partner leaves the dirty dishes out, I'll end up way more upset about it than if I complain once and deliberately move on.\n\nI don't think there's a great way to assess beforehand which tool is most appropriate for a given grievance. You just have to try something and then check how you feel later about it. If at the end of the day I'm *still* upset about my partner's dishes despite having let it go, then that's my sign that I chose the wrong technique and actually need more processing than I gave it. \n\nSo in the end I think students in your department are doing the right thing in how they process their situation, and students in less traumatic departments are not always helping themselves as much as they think. It's important for us to note that this is a spectrum and the best advice is more like \"choose what you vent about and pay attention to if it's helping\" rather than \"don't vent too much\".\n\n\n^(edited for formatting, sorry this got so long)",

Have a quick google. Some things will take a few seconds on google so if you just ask me first it makes you look lazy. Some things might take longer to figure out on your own, but there might be some benefit to you to figuring it out, so for those things stick at it. But then for other things you could spend 5 hours trying to figure out something that someone else could tell you in 5 seconds and you gain nothing from the 5 wasted hours.\n\nFiguring out the distinction between \"it takes a while but it's worth figuring out\" and \"asking for help is the best research/development decision\" can be tricky, but for the love of *everything* at least do that first google where you figure out if this is an easy solve yourself.\n\nAlso, smaller things:\n\n* If you're stuck on something, and I tell you to try X, and then you don't try X, and then 3 hours later you ask for help again and I have to tell you to try X *again* then I'm not going to be pleased. X might not be the solution, but I have a Y and a Z lined up and we need to check X first.\n\n* If you come to me with a problem and I say \"show me your script/error\", don't change your mind about asking for help, but if then 3 hours later ask for help again, and I have to tell you to show me *again*, then I'm not going to be pleased. You've probably just wasted 3 hours for no reason, and interrupted my work twice.\n\n* Get good at googling/finding research papers. I've known good and intelligent people who swear up and down that they can't find a solution for \"XYZ\", and yet when I google \"How to fix XYZ\" the first hit is a winner. I have no idea how they don't find these things themselves. Finding resources/general search engine use are genuinely important skills, and as we get further through the 21st century I find it more and more amazing that some people are not better at them.",

Yes, Google works for some general things, but if you're working with code then you should be searching the github repository first and if you're looking for papers then you should be searching whatever academic paper repository you use (e.g. arXiv).

That shows you're at least trying.\n\n> Any advice for getting better at this?\n\nHonestly I think it is something that comes with experience (and I'm not saying I'm perfect at it). I'm obviously a lot more forgiving for a new student who asks something they could have eventually figured out than I would be someone close to finishing. But the good thing here with newbies is that I can say \"start looking at such and such a resource and you should be able to figure it out\" and then they can go do it, so they will get that learning experience (after the little nudge). \n\nSo my advice for you would I suppose be to make sure that when you ask for help you make it a question of how can you help yourself. Without going into a full on monologue, say what you're trying to do, what you've briefly looked up, and ask if they can point you to any better resources. If it is in fact something that they think it is better to tell you up front then (hopefully) they just will, but if they think there is a benefit to you figuring it out then they can give you a nudge in the right direction.\n\n> I often waste hours on things that could easily be answered by a superior, because I think they're something I should know or could find out if I only spent five more minutes searching.\n\nTruly I still do this, I would much rather figure things out myself so I have to push myself to ask others questions in the interests of time. It is very easy to fall foul of the sunk cost fallacy but ultimately you have to push through it. I know my original comment might have sounded a bit judgemental of some people asking questions, but truly no one (with half a brain and half a heart) is going to get arsey over being asked for help if it is clear that the person asking has in the first instance made a genuine and reasonable effort to figure it out themselves.",

Those who do will be asked to stay on, those who don't, wont. \n\nFrom this perspective (which I should be clear is strictly a perspective about getting a career in academia, and doesn't apply at all to graduate students who don't want one), the questions about arrogance/confidence, seriously/not seriously prove to be something of a red herring. \n\nIn 9/10 cases, the answer to all of these questions will depend upon (and be secondary to) whether you regularly having interesting things to contribute. No one cares if you are independent if you are not independently arriving at interesting ideas. Conversely, no one will care if you can only develop your paper ideas in office hours, if your papers are brilliant.",

Ideally that would be one short, clear, professional email. \u201cHi, Professor, I\u2019m going to need an extension, can you please let me know how that works?\u201d I see many students get anxious, wait and wait, overthink, and then send last minute messages to faculty and writing coaches\u2014 long, a bit rambly, sharing lots of personal details, profuse apologies... and then asking for extension. Two things there. First, if you know you\u2019re going to need an extension, try to email a bit ahead and don\u2019t expect a response within 24 hours or ask for it the minutes before midnight when the assignment is due. Second, communicate professionally. Faculty forward me emails where I can see the student is *so* anxious, but it\u2019s not helping their communication. I try to help my faculty (I\u2019m a dean) not \u201cabsorb\u201d that anxiety. Respond to the question, in good time, in a professional manner.\n\nThat also relates to my first point about doubt. I see students procrastinate, overthink, avoid reading instructor or writing center feedback, message professors repeatedly when prof doesn\u2019t respond in first 12 hours... Have a little faith in yourself and focus on what things you can work on, not all the doubts you have.\n\nEdited to be more specific: I understand students are anxious. But instructors aren\u2019t required to themselves become anxious taking that on. If I work in a writing center and a student rushes in and the paper is due that day\u2014 they are likely full of anxiety. It\u2019s not my task to let that be transmitted to me.",

Anyone going into it knows that it's going to be financially tough and it sometimes just seems entitled how much this comes up, especially with stem people.

          "text": "In my experience, undergrad is never about mastering the material (not at any really depth anyway). Regardless of degree it tends to be a fairly broad overview of a wide range of topics. Additionally, many enter grad school years after being in undergrad so I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019d generally expect - or do you mean students do not even know basic math for example. \nFurther, how do students whine for faculty to fix what they do not know? Personally when I realize I\u2019ve forgotten something or don\u2019t know enough, there are plenty of resources available to review said material",

      "text": "I'm not an advisor or professor, and I'm not really strictly in academia. I have a B.S. and have worked in an analytical lab for almost 6 years since graduating from undergrad.\n\nWe interface with many grad students and postdocs,  and I've trained them on certain techniques or protocols so they can use our lab independently. The biggest problem I've faced with grad students is that instead of asking for help if they're stuck, they just sit there...and sit there...and sit there until I magically notice what's wrong and help them (which often looks like doing it for them). Even if I give a clear demo, ask if they have questions, and hand them a step by step written SOP, they often need to be coached on the same procedure over and over again, which...is not really doing independent work in our lab. There's an expectation that because I am merely a tech, I have time to stop my projects and help them with each little step (i.e., finding reagents when the location is listed on the SOP I gave them). Also, dropping off samples in the late evening with \"I need this data for a deadline tomorrow, can you process them??\" Like no. Our simplest prep experiment takes 2 days. The instruments have a queue of at least a week. You have worked with us before and therefore know this. Please don't get mad at me, plan better.\n\nPostdocs do all of the above, but it's worse because they don't like being told what to do by me, a person without a Ph.D. They rush me through the tutorial with \"I already know this\" and then proceed to do the above^, taking up way more of my time than if they'd just listened to my instructions in the first place. If my boss tells them what to do, they act as if God has spoken, but if I tell them the same thing, nope, they must know better. Even if their Ph.D. was on something completely unrelated to what our lab does.",

          "text": "Also, BOUNDARIES. My lab has a pretty strict 9-5, weekdays only schedule, and we're all given ample time for appointments, child-related activities, sick days, and vacations, with no repercussions for using it. It is not uncommon for most of the lab to take off school holidays. We stagger a bit, with some of us working 8-4, 9-5, 10-6, and me 11-7, so everything gets done.\n\nI've had panicked students/postdocs ask me to give them the personal phone numbers of lab members after hours or while they're taking time off. \"It's an emergency/my PI will kill me/I need to present this tomorrow\" are NOT reasons I will ever disclose my coworkers' personal information! Others have asked if I could come in to work Saturdays/Sundays or \"do an overnight\" to process their project and the answer is just...hell no.",
