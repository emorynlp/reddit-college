  "title:": "What questions to ask in a preliminary chat with a potential supervisor?",
  "text": "Hi!\n\ni have a small chat on Thursday with a potential supervisor which i really like, on a project which is perfect for me (behavioural ecology and conservation) but i am scared i wont have any questions to ask and will only talk about how much i love the project and how keen i am to be a part of it. I am in the UK looking at funded PhD projects. What are some general questions i should ask? What is normally spoken about in meetings like this? It\u2019s not a formal interview and Im hoping this meeting will be fairly relaxed, ive done a lot of snooping on the supervisor and i really feel like i would enjoy learning from her. Im awful at coming up with questions and i dont want to look silly and ruin my chances! \n\nAny advice would be very much appreciated, im definitely overthinking this ahahaha",

      "text": "Being excited is great. I imagine you will have much to talk about. Here are some things I would ask:\n1. What are the specifics of project funding\n2. What are the expectations for TAing\n3. If you know your project, how long are you expected to work on it (3-4 years, 5-6)\n4. What's your PIs mentor style like? \n5. What is the lab culture? \nEtc. \n\nIn my lab, when potential PhD students meet our PI for the first time, he refers them to all of his lab and advises them to meet with us over zoom or email. It might be worth it to reach out to other members of the lab to ask some of these questions. \n\nGood luck.",

          "text": "Great list although 2 and 3 aren't really relevant in the UK. \n\nI would add asking what jobs people in the lab have gone on to. Asking about opportunities to go to conferences. Does the PI meet one on one with everyone and how often. How many are in the lab and what roles. Lots of students and only one or two postdocs is a warning sign for not a lot of support.",
