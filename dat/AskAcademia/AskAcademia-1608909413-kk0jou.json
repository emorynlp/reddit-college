  "title:": "Professors who agree to write letters of recommendation and then don't, why do you do so?",
  "text": "Applied to 10 schools for a PhD (15 Dec deadline) and asked a professor for a letter of recommendation at the end of September. This was a prof who's class I had taken, who's same class I had TAd, and whose lab I had done research in for a year, including full time over the summer where they paid me. They said they'd be \"glad\" to write me one, and asked for a draft (was this a red flag?).\n\nI sent them email reminders at one month before the deadline, two weeks, one week, one day before. And no response. Did everything according to other posts  here, including thanking them in each email for agreeing to write the letter. Maybe my emails suddenly stopped going through? But after sending reminders from the universities portals, I even texted them on their personal phone a couple days before the deadline when the grad students in the lab suggested I do so. No response. Maybe they became too busy or realized they didn't want to write me a letter for whatever reason? But I asked them after the deadline if they were too busy, I could ask someone else? No response till now, 10 days after the deadline. Maybe they had a personal emergency/accident? All this was while they were in contact with their grad students about their upcoming paper.\n\nProfessors who may have done something similar, why would you do so? I really just want to understand. Because to me, agreeing to take on a responsibility and then flaking out completely is horrible professional behavior. And since universities discard applications without 3 letters, messing with someone's career like this should be grounds for termination in my opinion. I understand departments accept late letters, but I've had no contact for the last 45 days and there's no reason to believe they're ever going to submit that letter.\n\nAdditionally, is there something I should have done differently here? I'm presumably going to have to ask for letters again at some point, and I'd like to know how to do it properly.\n\nIn this particular case, I was fortunate enough to have another prof who could write me a letter, and they did so after the deadline with only 48 hours of notice. My other letters have come from professors who not only submitted on time, but helped me immensely with the application process. So this is not meant to criticize professors as a whole.\n\n\nEdit: sorry for not being clear, I gave them the draft letter over a month before the deadline. In spite of some of my applications explicitly stating that students are not allowed to contribute to writing their own letter in any way, including a draft letter.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for all the responses. I think I better understand what might have been going through my professor's mind and the stress they might be under. Still upset, but lesson learned. I'll make sure to include an extra letter in the future. Merry Christmas y'all!",

While I've never done this myself, I've experienced it in many forms (for example, late/never referee reports, or a coauthor flaking out), and have a bit of sense from the other side.\n\nWhile there is no one answer, my best universal reason is that a faculty member is first overwhelmed, and then embarrassed to the point of denial. The task requires a bit of effort, and doesn't come naturally to them. They put it off, as there are more pressing issues, or maybe even something very serious that came up. They see your emails, but are ashamed, and do a kind of \"curling up into a ball\" (no response at least gives plausible deniability).",

                  "text": "Yep. I've had a few professors who quite literally, on their website or else in their syllabus or somewhere easily found, they had a \"recommendation letter request form and questionnaire\" which basically asks for the things you've accomplished, anything that stands out about you, why you think you matter, why (insert why you need recommendation letter here) is important to you, how long you've known the professor, when the first class you had with them was, all sorts of things. I believe it was something one of the faculty members in the department came up with, and others in that department saw it and made a few changes and adopted it themselves, as they all looked iterative.\n\nI'm not sure, honestly, which is better, a letter you wrote wholesale and they signed (hopefully at least after reading, perhaps adding a few changes), or a letter where they basically asked for your answers to questions and they filled in a sort of form letter Mad Libs style. I realize that *most* professors barely know the majority of their students, and can't, off the top of their head, write a good letter for them, but the absolute best letters you can get are from professors (or mentors) that *do* know you well enough to do that for you, for instance, if you worked in a lab for a professor for several years, perhaps you've been to their home, you know their spouse and kids, they know who you are, why you're worth spending time on, what's good for you and what isn't, they know your writing style, your strengths and weaknesses, that kind of thing. That's rare, but if you can get *one* of those while in undergrad, I would hope that it's worth several random form letters.",

There is really no excuse.\n\nI have had really bad experiences with letters of recommendation, too. Once I was in nearly the same situation as you, except the writer finally did submit about an hour before the deadline. \n\nAnother time, the letter writer asked me for a draft, so I wrote the basic facts: \"I am a Professor of X at University Y. Zinfandelightful was my student, and we worked together on A, B, and C.\" I thought she would fill it in with, you know, some kind of praise? But she just put my words on her letterhead and signed it. It read like she had intentionally been damning with faint praise. I was mortified and had to get someone else to write one at the last minute.\n\nI learned my lesson. From then on, whenever I was asked to \"draft\" a letter about myself, I became one of the most outstanding young scientists this person had encountered in their career. For a career development award, I needed TEN separate letters. I had to \"draft\" nine of them myself. Again, all of the \"writers\" stuck my words on their letterhead and made almost no adjustments.\n\nSo now that I am in a mentoring role, I take letter writing very seriously -- maybe too seriously. If I have a student working in my lab who I can't write a good letter for (after multiple attempts at feedback and coaching), I let them know so they can move on.\n\nAll of that is to say, the situation you are describing is incredibly disrespectful and unfair, but not altogether uncommon. Being \"too busy\" is no excuse to sink someone else's career -- I guarantee those same people are not \"too busy\" to advance their own career. I am sorry this happened to you and wish you lots of luck on your applications. May you remember this vividly and always be the helpful letter writer when you have your own lab!",

And the universities I'm mentioning here even includes top US universities (I think Caltech made me sign one of those). \n\nA word of advice, feel free to ignore me if you think I'm not qualified to speak on this: These statements are only visible to students during their application and aren't typically seen on the department website. I would suggest asking your students in the future if their applications have that requirement because I would reckon some of them may have had to sign such statements in the past.",

If the letter writer cannot accurately recall a certain student, especially if they were an undergrad in a large class, then a summary draft of the student description could assist the writer. Then the writer could jot together points and provide a narrative.\n\nOTOH, if the draft is simply a formality and the letter writer forwards the draft wholesale without significant changes, then that could constitute a letter that was not really written by the intended writer. Again, opinions could vary. I see the reasons why certain schools might have students certify that they didn't assist in the writing process. Perhaps they have seen many malafide cases.",

And tagging /u/lstimrdj so you see it: to add on, the draft letter works to specifically ensure that items that you would want  and think of particular importance in the letter get in there. It's not necessarily just a letter hyping yourself that your advisor will simply sign and send on\n\nFor example, my PhD advisor knew I had spent a good bit of time doing teaching and outreach work but, as that was out of her purview, she didn't really have any specifics. So when I wrote draft letters of recommendation, I would just create paragraphs with lists of certain accomplishments that would be relevant to the position/grant/award/etc. She was happy to share the final drafts at times and they looked nothing like my draft except that they included those specific accomplishments without her having to specifically pick them out of my CV and know that those in particular would be the best for a given position (for example, not understanding that for a SLAC job she shouldn't write the same letter as for an R1 job, which she honestly would be wont to do)",

I was a graduate student who literally produced high quality publishable work and my advisor couldn't be bothered. \n\nIt's frankly disgusting to me and I have never relied on him for anything else. But what a weird system. As an undergraduate or graduate student (or even a post doc...) you are literally not in a position of power and if someone wants to keep you hostage as a worker, why wouldn't they by tanking your chances at a successful future? You can't force an advisor to be as invested in your future as you are. \n\nYeah, in an ideal world, they realize they need to write a great letter about you because it's the right thing to do. But in the real world, they are losing their best worker to \"competing\" PhD programs... Why would they write that great letter?\n\nIt's really just a broken system, with a broken power structure, and my lazy (I really don't think he was purposefully obstructive, just lazy) advisor is a symptom of that disease.",

My referee was contacted only after I was pre finalized as among the best candidate.\n\nI suppose this is much easier solution for everyone involved. Students sometimes have to send maybe over 50 applications to land 1 good position.

I know profs are busy, we work 60 hour weeks, but still.  But to the point of your note OP, it is not a red flag for a prof to ask for a draft. They teach hundreds of students and you're just one of them. Between the hundreds of emails, meetings, followup, grading, course prep etc, remembering exactly who you are is generally low on the list.  I now that may be a surprise but it's true. The draft helps a prof to know what courses you took, what your qualities and interests are, etc. It helps the prof to draft a personalized letter. If you didn't send a draft, it looks like you didn't pick up your end.  And, if you were asked to send one and didn't, it's not fair to go on a rant over the prof, this was your fault.",
