Then, even if you aren't \"wealthy\" you can be very comfortable.\n\nSome of it is relative wage to cost of living essentially.",

I knew this before hand, but it was a stern reminder.  If you want to be wealthy as a humanities academic, it helps a lot to be born into money.",

As it happened, you also spoke French.  What do you do with this?\n\nTeach community college somewhere?(nothing wrong with that, and to hell with who says otherwise)\n\nWell, if you want to put it to practical use, you can take a crack at working for the US State Department, which is the foreign ministry of the USA.  There are more generic civil service jobs with it, and there are jobs where they need people at Embassies. The white collar/managerial employees at Embassies, who are interacting with the host nations government a lot, are usually but not always FSOs.\n\nLet's return to my original post about this.\n\nSo imagine that you got a Masters, you go off to be a FSO, and you pick all the \"garbage postings\" for a decade or so, the sort of postings where you are living on a compound with various Blackwater-types providing security. This is an extreme example, BTW.  If you live like a tightwad in this situation for a few years you can build up quite a chunk of change. \n\n10 years in you decide to go work on your Doc, you get it, and you also get to do the \"also I have *practical* experience in this field\" thing.  \n\nYou get a position in Academia somewhere, somehow, maybe at a lower tier school, but that's okay, because you can live...pretty well thanks to 10 years of saving and investing, in addition to maxing out your TSP.  It certainly gives the *impression* of being a wealthy academic, it's just there was a gap where you built that wealth.",

This is one of the fields where it is easiest to find adjunct positions and hardest to find full-time positions.\n\nA full-time position at a community college is also likely to be five+ class sections, most of which are freshman composition or developmental (remedial) writing. If that sounds like what you'd like to do, great! Being able to enthusiastically write teaching statements about how much I liked teaching developmental math is what got me interviews at community colleges. \n\nIf you don't have a lot of experience, it is pretty unlikely to get a full-time position fresh out of a master's degree. You can still apply, but most places have already hired any full-time positions that they are going to hire for the fall. In math (and in most other areas) CC's start posting jobs in late fall/early spring, with a few trailers in the late spring. It is pretty unusual for full-time academic jobs to still be interviewing over summer.\n\nIf you have a different job or are in graduate school, adjuncting is a great way to find out IF you would like to do the job in the first place. It's a terrible way to try to make a living, though.",

It feels mindblowing that I could achieve a position like yours! \n\nIf you don't mind answering a few more questions: \nIs it possible to get hired right after grad school or do I need teaching experience? \nTo your knowledge, how many years do people generally work as adjuncts before getting full-time positions?\nHave you ever heard of a college hiring adjuncts from Europe?",

                                              "text": "Happy to answer your questions, but it's a little complicated from where I'm at. For many of your questions, the answer is just, it depends. My college is going through some very large changes, so even what I discuss here may change in the next few years.\n\n1) As of right now, we'll still happily take anyone who does not have a PhD but that may change as our school is beginning to offer more 4 year degrees. We were approved for our first one recently and now the office gossip is that PhDs may be required for new hires at some point in the future. I was already planning on furthering my education with a second master's but may get an EdD instead of they make me... I doubt it though. (I don't actually want a PhD in my field, weird, I know.)\n\n2) Experience is pretty much required. As soon as you get your masters, apply to be an adjunct professor. We're always hiring new adjuncts. I was an adjunct before. I had a job in industry and taught at night. We have plenty of adjuncts who teach just for fun and to earn some extra income. They don't even want to teach full time because they have it good where they're at. I just personally loved teaching and preferred it to any industry job by a wide margin.\n\n3) We'll hire from anywhere. It's what I consider another \"perk\" of the job is the diversity of people that I work with. From all different countries and backgrounds.\n\n4) Caveat to the experience thing... I was INCREDIBLY lucky because I was an adjunct for only one semester before being brought on full time. This was for two reasons, our Chancellor started a new program that wanted to bring in people with little experience, and I was a student at the college before and my former professor was on my hiring committee. The Chancellor's program is what really helped me land the job with so little experience. They only did it for that one semester and quickly dropped it because of all the other changes happening to the college mentioned before. My former professor knew me well enough to know that I knew my stuff. I was an older student when I was in his class and he had given me an industry award for my performance, so he knew who I was when I interviewed.\n\nThat being said, even I would be very wary to hire someone with little experience for two reasons. If a position were to open up, I already know who the adjuncts we have that I'd hire. I know they are good professors and even a couple of them I'd consider friends. I'd hire them over anyone first. Also, we've had some very sketchy adjuncts come through who were great on paper but terrible professors. One example, I was told that we had an adjunct who would just sit and watch movies on his iPad with headphones in. I didn't believe it until I saw it myself! That's an extreme example but one that shows why we're wary to hire people we don't know when we already have people we do know and like.\n\nYour best bet is to become an adjunct (yes the pay sucks) but try to do that while working another job, if possible. Then you'll be ready to prove yourself when a full time position does show up. It doesn't have to be the same college either, your experience will speak for your then.\n\nIn my area, lots of adjuncts do the \"triangle\" where they are adjuncts at multiple colleges. It's a large metroplex with multiple systems and colleges to teach at. That life is a grind but worth it to those who do want to teach for a living. I was already securing other adjunct positions around the 'plex before landing full time.\n\nAlso, you may find that it isn't the career for your after you teach a class, and that's great to know too.\n\nGood luck.",

No burning cash money, but suburbs house money. Even in entry level unis, I believe you can rent an apartment in most university towns without a problem.",

              "text": "Comparing US adjuncts' salaries to European professor salaries is apples to oranges though. \n\nWhile we don't really have the same adjunct culture here in France, it does exist. (It's pretty heavily regulated to keep it from becoming like in the US.) They make peanuts and are often only paid once the semester is finished, which makes those months of working but not seeing your paycheck really hard. I did it for a couple of years and was at a prestigious national school of economics teaching English, and all adjuncts only got paid from February to July (the fall semester was paid in chunks divided up over that period along with our spring semester pay). That said, you can't be an adjunct as your primary gig here-- you have to be either a phd student without a stipend or have primary employment elsewhere. Adjunct positions are legally only side gigs, and your main employer has to sign off on the number of hours you're allowed to work outside of your main position. \n\nSalaries for what would be the equivalent of tenure-track here are MUCH lower than in the US. A 1st-year tenure-track prof makes monthly what I made monthly as a phd student at a big R1 state school in the US. But it includes retirement and health insurance and MUCH more paid vacation, and people here don't have student loans to pay off, so it sort of works out. I'm definitely still jealous when I hear the salaries of people I went to grad school with who got tenure-track jobs in the US. But I get a lot of perks being here and also get to choose where I live instead of playing the endless 1-year-stints-and-being-on-the-job-market game, so I guess it balances out.",

We renegotiated, instead departments have to cut 10 percent of classes and the minimum for the number of students needed to run a class has tripled. Not ideal.

For example, my chair took classes away from adjuncts who were scheduled to teach 3 classes (the maximum) so that no individual was laid off. \n\n\nOther than that I agree. I know CUNY pays more than some private universities in the area but CUNY literally runs on adjuncts. The entire system would collapse if every adjunct decided to never show up again.",

Both he and his partner were full professors when they retired, each making more than $200k/year. I don't know if you'd consider that wealthy, but I would imagine that sort of money would allow one to live a very comfortable lifestyle. \n\nStarting salaries for assistant professors (tenure line) in Canada typically range between $60-$100k, so even an early career researcher can be pretty comfortable.",

But do to your lack of supportive evidence and your abundance of biased opinion, I doubt I will make any progress with you. \n\nIf you listened to him you would know that he is more left leaning than right and often criticizes both parties. \nHis \"addiction\" that you are so misinformed about was a common chemical dependency mixed with a severe physical reaction to his antidepressants.\nAnd Dr. Peterson study totalitarian regimes for over 30 years and objected to the Bill C-16 because he did not think a government had the right to tell you what he could and could not say, which were all precursors to tyrannical governments(USSR, Maos China and Hitlers 3rd reich). He discusses all these things in simple terms that even someone as ignorant as you could follow along. \nNow, all that being said, can you do a little reading for yourself before you try to outline someones career that has been very beneficial to this world.",

I've also never seen that happen at business schools either, but admittedly I never considered that route and don't have any friends who went that route, so I could be underinformed about it.

For tenured positions in the US, you can live a reasonably comfortable on a professor's salary. I am in STEM, not in the social sciences, but our pay scale is fairly consistent from department to department, and all of our salaries are publicly available.   \n\n\nA different question is: will this be possible going forward? I am not sure, but I think it will be much more difficult as the tenure track positions are going away. So the answer may look very different in 10 years from now.",
