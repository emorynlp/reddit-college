  "title:": "31M Asst. Professor struggling with recent move to small college town",
  "text": "This August, I began my first tenure-track job. I am from a large coastal urban area in the USA, but my job is at a regional state university located in a college town. This town is located 21 hours from home and 5 hours from the nearest large city. The nearest Trader Joe's and Whole Foods (aka basic needs) are 2 hours away!\n\nI like my job, but I'm really having trouble with the town. My friends back home describe me as a friendly and outgoing person, yet it is hard for me to make friends here. No one is mean; I'm just having trouble finding people I vibe with. I attribute this to two factors:\n\n1. I'm single (the town is very family-focused).\n2. I'm just not that into the activities that are popular here (i.e., sports, church, and the outdoors).\n\nThere aren't even activities I would enjoy doing alone here. I'm a big foodie (the restaurants here are all about meat, meat, and more meat); I enjoy going to museums (the museums here are extremely small and regionally-focused); and I LOVE shopping (this town has little more than Walmart & Target).\n\nSo, as you can see, I'm really out of my element. I love to travel, and I'm willing to take on pretty much any city. However, I've never wanted to live anywhere other than a large city, and now I find myself in a town straight out of a Hallmark movie.\n\nHas anyone else found themselves in this situation? If yes, what did you do about it? I thought about getting a second small place so I could spend the weekend in the small/mid-sized city with Trader Joe's and Whole Foods (and a lot more to do than my college town), but my salary won't allow it. :(\n\nThanks for your input! :)",

      "text": "There's a strong culture in academia to tell people to \"bloom where they're planted\", and sort of subtlety chide people for not being grateful that they have one of those magical, answer to all your prayers tenure track jobs. (At one point in my life, I might have bought this line of thinking, at least in part, too.) I'm not sure I buy that now, though. At 31, you pretty much know what you're about, in a broad sense. Some things may change, but you're a big city single guy in a middle of nowhere college town where the big draw is \"It's a nice place to raise kids\". You may find your niche over time (maybe you'll find a church community you like, or get active volunteering at the local museum, etc.), but you shouldn't be afraid to look for jobs, yes, even non academic jobs, in places where you'd actually like to live. \n\nIt's just a job, man. What you're doing when you're not at work, and who your doing it with, matters a lot more than what you do to earn a paycheck.",

I have heard the \"bloom where you're planted advice\", which comes from a good place, yet it's also really hard to change who you are when you like who you are. I admit that I could be more open-minded, and that I could try things I never thought I would try, but I agree that, at the end of the day, I'll still be the big-city guy I am. I'll see what I can do in my current situation for at least a couple years while considering all my options. Thanks again!",

It's the last plot in your data collection, and you're eager to get the grunt work over with and return to the lab.  You find this farm is going to be harder than you anticipated:  it's run by a salt of the earth, strong, but uncooperative woman.  She's carelessly beautiful and dagger tongued.  You just need her buy in for a couple of months while you collect data, but she seems hell bent on doing nothing but getting in your way.  Unbeknownst to you, the farm, part of the life and love of her family for generations, is in trouble.  Your data is likely to be used as leverage against an already failing and indebted farm.  \n\nNew to this application of your work, you fumble clumsily around the farm: ruining your loafers in cow paddies, almost getting bit by a snake, and being constantly harassed by Beau, the farm cattle dog.  She always seems to be present for your most inept moments on the farm, and your city faux pas around town.  She has a callous exterior, particularly to you, but her warmth comes out as you witness her care for her aging father.  Slowly, you see her heart for the animals, the land, and her way of life.  The love and sadness coexisting in her eyes as she looks across the pasture at sunset.  You start staying for dinner.  \n\nYou reconnect with your heart and the satisfaction of an honest day's work.  Through her, you see how the competitiveness and pretentiousness of your academic pursuits has left you feeling hollow.  You feel pulled to her.  To the farm.  The connection is obvious.  \n\nOn a truck ride to town for supplies, her father pries.  She's been through things; been through enough.  He sees there's something growing between you two, and cautions you to tread carefully. You come home, and throw the data in the trash.  You know what you must do.",

Depending on your field, it may actually be a lot easier to get another assistant professor job, since postings at higher ranks can be rarer. Especially if you\u2019re applying somewhere in a bigger city, or that you maybe have a clear connection to the area, absolutely no one will bat an eye at the idea of \u2018why would this person apply for this job?\u2019. Go for it. \n\nAs far as what to do for now: making friends gets harder as we\u2019re older, for real. And with Covid, that gets trickier. I was very lucky that I had my husband to move to that small town with me, and for those four years we talked about how much we had to \u2018make our own fun\u2019. Our friends were mostly other professors, and we would play board games, organize dinner parties, and hikes and such.

Check for local farm co-ops or farmer's markets. This is great way to get fresh organic produce, certain products like eggs, dairy and/or pasture raises meats.\n3. Start a garden. If you have space, consider raising chickens for their eggs!\n4. Talk with your students to see where they pick up their groceries or where their preferred hang outs for food out.\n5. Learn to cook! It's not that hard! You'd be surprised how easy it is to ferment stuff like kimchi and miso or to make your own meat substitutes, if you are into that!\n6. Talk with the staff at a restaurant! Many places are willing to accommodate!\n7. Talk with the staff at the local grocery, I'm sure they would be happy to special order products that you can't get in the sticks!\n\nI can definitely advise you with the cooking/baking end; if need be, feel free to DM me.\n\nAnother note: maybe consider organizing activities for students that engage arts and culture: cheese society, a cinema studies club, looking at works of art or artifacts and discussing them as group. Hit up the local library, maybe consider organizing something there for the community that might attract likeminded people!",

Hang in there! Get a good Italian or Greek cookbook, many dishes are easily replicated so long as you have access to the basics!!",

Suck it up and invest time in finding your people there, leave the job, or cobble something together that gives you most of what you need.  Options for what that might look like are below. \n\nIn my case I lived in Big City (a 3 hour commute to Small Town) and spent 3-4 days/ week doing the drive, until I met someone and got married. Then our needs and habits changed as kids came, and the commute became too much.  Now we're the young family in a small town, and there are a LOT of other faculty here that are also frustrated foodies (who throw fabulous dinner parties at the drop of a hat) and arts enthusiasts who travel a lot and work to bring awesome groups to campus.  I suspect the pandemic is preventing new faculty from these sorts of experiences right now, though, so harder to find in your first year. \n\nFriends have solved the problem by 1)  living in Big City and renting a spare room from a colleague in Small Town. They cram work into 3 days/ week and bolt for the door. Great for their sanity, not great for their colleagues who have to work around it. Tenure may be a very delicate dance if you choose this. \n\n2) Living in Small Town but traveling extensively at the drop of a hat. Acceptable. What's not is the colleague who got tenure, moved out of state,  and announcing they would only teach online or fly in 1 day a week. \n\n3) Renting in Big City and buying a house in Small Town, then renting a room out to cover the mortgage, moving between the two as needed. Only works in a very strong rental market.",

And the trees and their bodies reflected in the dark water and it was the most magical experience. Before I was a bit scared of deep, dark water. Now swimming in that lake is my summer ritual.

My suggestion is to do a ton of googling on Reddit, Facebook, etc because there might be stuff you don't know about. \n\nAs for the place in a better town, would you consider getting a \"crashpad\" somewhere? My friends who are flight attendants or truckers often have an apartment they share with way too many people to live comfortably, but since they are all only there sometimes, it tends to workout that half the roommates aren't there at the same time. So it saves money, but the issue is sometimes it's crowded.",

      "text": "\\[UPDATE\\] I've survived my first year in my first TT job--the one in an isolated small town that's far from home and from anything resembling a large city--and I thought I would share where I stand now. I hope this will be helpful to others who might be faced with a similar situation.\n\nI am an early 30s, single, non-religious city boy from a top-10 U.S. metro who enjoys going to interesting restaurants and bars, travelling, and visiting museums. I think I want to have a long-term partner some day (any gender, I'm open to it all), but I'm not sure that I see myself with kids.\n\nI am in a town where most people are married with kids and religious, and live for football, hunting, and fishing. I am not outdoorsy at all (and yes, I've tried many outdoor activities at another stage in my life). That means it's been kind of hard to make friends, though I'm sure the COVID situation is at least somewhat to blame.\n\nI like my job due to the opportunity to teach new classes and professional freedom it provides. I also like my colleagues, who are all wonderful and helpful, albeit significantly older than I am and in different life situations (i.e., they all have some sort of family commitment). From a purely professional perspective, I couldn't complain about anything other than my salary, which is about 20-25% lower than what I would get in a currently non-existent job in a comparable school back home. I really have been able to do a lot of things that have given me professional fulfillment and will hopefully help me in my career, and I am grateful for that.\n\nYet, as it stands now, I can't see a long-term future where I am. I just don't fit into the community, and I can't see myself fitting in, either. It's not a good place for any of my hobbies or for my personal situation, either. Yes, I do need to push myself to try new activities (and I will try to do that), but I don't think I need to push myself to become a completely different person. I will be back next year, after travelling and catching-up on my research for most of the summer, but I will look for a job in a location that's more appealing to me.\n\nIt might be nice to have higher pay, and to work for a school that is not a regional state university in a region to which I feel no connection, but the location and the quality of life concerns that come with it are more important to me right now. I will start by being very selective in where I apply (i.e., jobs in or near big cities in my home region of the country), and if I don't find what I'm looking for right away, I'll continue to look less selectively with each passing year as I get closer to tenure. \n\nThank you for all your thoughtful advice this winter. Your advice will be openly received, yet given the large amount of advice you've given me thus far, I don't necessarily expect additional advice. My primary reason for writing this post was to (hopefully) help others who might find themselves in a similar situation. :)",

      "text": "I'm in a similar small college town.  While the town does not completely revolve around the university, it dominates the culture here.  It's a small town in a deep red state and has exactly what you'd expect: a lot of families who have lived here for generations, huge groups of people who all went to high school together, a church on every corner (sometimes it seems everyone is a preacher or close friends with one), and of the people who have college degrees, the overwhelming majority who are not faculty all have their degrees from this school.  No one really leaves; it's like the mafia.\n\nI also find that there is a small but significant group of people for whom religion is take-it-or-leave-it or atheist/agnostic.  Who grew up in a big city and like a lot of the things you do.  Sometimes that group can come across as quite insular; if they make too much areligious noise, they're gonna get the side-eye or invited to church by everyone they know.  They miss the variety of culture and experience you can get in a city, the swaths of foods, restaurants, and ingredients.  \n\nFind those folks.  Depending on the size of your school (we're about 18K) there may be campus organizations like that, or continuing/adult education classes about wine tasting or food.  The people who run those classes will probably know a lot of the people in the second paragraph.",

Second is I made friends by doing university service and joining campus writing groups and the campus faculty beer club and a junior faculty mentoring program...most of my closest friends are profs from other departments. This will be especially hard during covid. Third I keep trying to write my way to a better job, but it's been 11 years of applying and so far no luck. But trying to write my way out of here means I easily got tenured and will probably easily make it to full in another couple of years, plus I still have hope once the covid situation ends and the job market doesn't suck as much, especially as I just got my first very large external grant. Fourth I go on a random adventure once every month or two which usually involves driving like 2 to 3.5 hours for a day trip to somewhere worth going.\n\nWhen I moved here we didn't have a trader joe's or whole foods and we used to drive 1.5 hours to the closest trader joe's with a big cooler and stocked up every few months.",

I\u2019m from an 18 hour drive from here (about that long to fly, too) and the closest job I could find to home when I was on the market was an 8 hour drive. My SO (who I met here, ironically) is a longer drive from home.\n\nA really cool thing the faculty/staff here do (which is NOT covid friendly) is a pot luck on fridays, which rotates between people\u2019s houses on a volunteer basis. It turns into a bit of a party where people would being either their signature dish or would make something they\u2019d been wanting to try or would stop by the (tiny) grocery store on the way for packaged chips and salsa. It has fallen off in recent years as the original hosts/goers have retired, so maybe once covid is done we\u2019ll have more people want to do it again. \n\nWe also have learned to cook a broader range of foods, and picked up a few of the milder outdoor hobbies that don\u2019t require us to kill anything to participate. \n\nBut it\u2019s super isolating living in a tiny family-oriented town when you\u2019re not a parent.

Like doing sports for example, who  you are doing it will make or break the experience. Maybe try church hopping just to find friends?",

      "text": "Honestly this post sort of made me a little sick to my stomach remembering my undergrad years, having gone to a school exactly like the one you're describing. Implying that Trader Joes and Whole Foods are the absolute basic necessities is the kind of ingrained classism that made me remember professors snidely interacting with the \"yokel\" student population. You don't have to absolutely love living there, but you have to realize everyone else living in that town is doing it somehow. \n\nMost of the time these small towns have a general store in that town or in the next town over. It's not Trader Joes, but most of the time you can actually find the best regional food stocked there. Much of the time they'll even have super local produce. The general store in my hometown sells milk from a farm a few miles away, maple syrup and honey from a farm the next town over, etc. You might have luck if your college town has a little food co-op, which is what stores like Trader Joes are built after. It's honestly a little disappointing you're limiting yourself to franchise stores, some of the coolest things I've found have been in tiny country stores. I grew up in a much more rural place than you're describing, and the way my family handled getting stuff from stores in larger amounts was pick one day of the week and make it an afternoon trip. \n\nIf you have any friends in the college, why not build your own foodie activities. Start making recipes you've been dying to try out, and invite your friends. Have them make something, like a potluck. More than that, they're going to have some insight into where the best food in the region is. You can start making recipes with the local produce-- I guarantee food coming shortly from the source tastes very different than out of Trader Joes. You're not into the outdoors, but I've found my mental health improving drastically once I started taking short daily walks, and I anticipate your mood about this whole situation would improve with a little familiar routine. \n\nThe other thing about small towns is that they usually have something going on in the town library, or the rec hall, or something similar. During the summer my tiny town has a craft fair, another town eight miles over has a cheese festival, and there's countless other places with something similar. You can often pick up excellent quality local food and crafts for a fraction of the price what stores in the city would sell them for.\n\nIf you absolutely miss the city, book a room in a hotel for the weekend and make a mini vacation of it. We academics often have three or four day weekends scattered throughout the year.\n\nFinally, while I recognize small town life isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's a lot small towns can in fact offer. I would really encourage you to allow yourself to explore a totally different culture, it might give you something surprising. Most of it is totally word of mouth, you're not often going to find it marked on Google Maps.\n\n(FWIW, I also am a postdoc researcher, also in my early 30s and single, who regularly makes trips back to my tiny hometown when I can to stock up on the local food and other goods I can't find in the city.)",

          "text": "Thank you for your thorough response. I feel really bad for making you feel sick to your stomach, and I apologize for that.\n\nIn fact, I spent a good part of my life in a rural area, about 18-19 hours from where I am now, and I was that yokel student who went to a college that was 15 minutes from home and had many other yokel students. I've never felt fully comfortable in rural areas, and when I went to the big city after college, I LOVED it. I was willing to move to a different big city if need be, but I sincerely hoped that I would never again return to a small town. \n\nYou're completely right that Trader Joe's and Whole Food's are not essential. That was my failed attempt at humor, which is so tricky in writing. I'll keep my eyes peeled for places that sell fresh and local foods, but so far, I've only found standard American grocery stores with a lot of processed foods and few (if any) of the Italian and Greek foods I grew up with. There is definitely no co-op or natural grocery store in this town (or anywhere within 2 hours), and the farmer's market only operates in the summer.\n\nI do take daily walks (I did at home, too). On one hand, I find that they make me feel better, but on the other, I find that they make me feel worse, as I don't like to be reminded of the town I'm in...\n\nI like the idea of forming a foodie/dinner group with others who work at the college (or elsewhere), and I also love to cook, provided that I'm cooking for others (cooking for yourself is just no fun)!  I'm sure that even those who are partnered and/or have kids would enjoy a  nice grown-up dinner and some good conversation now and then! \n\nFor the time being, I've been going away most weekends to cities that are 5 and 3 hours away, and I really enjoy the change of scenery. I do need to make some friends, though, be it there, in the college town, or both. I'll try to keep a more open mind and explore all opportunities. Thanks again for the advice, and I sincerely apologize for bringing back bad memories of college. :(\n\nGood luck to you in your postdoc!",

You'll probably have more luck in the Spring when roadside stands open up, but even right now, if you ask some of your colleagues, or even better the admin or staff that live locally, they'll probably have good tips. This might be something you can tie into a foodie dinner group, since you seem into that. It can be a kind of \"bring something you enjoy from a local farmer/vendor\", and that way you can get some good ideas. \n\nGood luck with your professorship, too! I hope you can find something that will make you happy, or at least content. I'm definitely not",
