What has helped me is ALWAYS visualizing my data before analyzing it so I know I haven't fucked up a set of recordings/data collections.

Also color coding by date of collection to account for any slow changes in your experimental apparatus. Really important in certain studies where things like lasers drift over time. One last way to deal with the anxiety is to say \"fuck it I did my best and my advisor approved of it\".

According to my therapist, obsessive self-doubt is a form of anxiety that that meds seem to work particularly well for. I still have this fear (after stopping Prozac) but it's not as debilitating as it was. One thing my therapist pointed out is that papers aren't only useful for the specific findings they claim; they present a perspective that others will piggyback off of in unexpected ways. You might be surprised by what someone gets out of your paper, even if you made a crucial mistake (which is unlikely, especially if you have been double checking stuff.)\n\nAlso, mistakes happen. That's why in science we trust the weight of the evidence after many publications, not just one. And papers do get retracted or edited when needed. The catastrophic, career-killing retractions are for things that were done on purpose, like outright fabrication. \n\nI would suggest that you don't look at old data unless you need it for current work. \n\nRegardless, anytime you have ongoing fears that prevent you from eating and sleeping or being able to do your work, that's a time for medical intervention. If you're a student you can probably get free counseling on campus. (They usually take walk-ins and are not busy during winter break when the undergrads have left.)

We are not here for the ego and fame, we want society and science to advance, and this means millions of mistakes to get one thing right. It's perfectly normal.\n\nAnd speaking of mistakes, english is not my first language and somethings feel wrong about my writing but I can't figure out why, I'm sorry for any mistakes, good luck :) you got this",

      "text": "Your self doubt is eating you alive. The problem you currently face is just a symptom of it. You need to work through it to find the source of it and come to terms with whatever it is. Else even if you superficially solve this fear that you currently face , another fear of another form will pop up to take it's place in due time.\n\nSelf doubt  and intense fear more often than not points to some part of yourself that you looked away from, either in shame or guilt . Something you don't want to face about yourself. It might have been sometime since u started doing that, the longer you do it , the more easier it becomes to do, but the harder it becomes for you to find the real thing that you looked away from. \n\nFind it , accept it , accept your self , all part of yourself , even the hard parts . Only then can you really know yourself in any meaningful way . Only then can you really perceive what is Infront of you not colored by your fears , guilts and shame. Only when you see what is really there Infront of you can you hope to leave any meaningful way to impact this world or contribute to it in a lasting manner.  \n\nPeace \u270c\ufe0f.",
