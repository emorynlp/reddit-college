Back in the day you could only get onto an MBA program with several years of high level corporate experience. Now as you're so neatly demonstrating you can get one with zero business experience. \n\nThere are a handful of MBA programs that still carry some value, they also carry the price tag to go with them. Increasingly, heavyweight professionals are choosing other professional masters like Masters of Public Policy etc. \n\nI'm not saying don't do an MBA but it will carry much more weight if you do one when you have business experience and a significant career with senior level experience of running an organisation.",
