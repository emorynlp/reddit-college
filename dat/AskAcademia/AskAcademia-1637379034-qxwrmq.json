  "title:": "How long should I give my postdoc position a fair shot before I start looking for industry positions?",
  "text": "I'm in CS.\n\nI started a postdoc position funded by a fellowship in the US in fall. I'm not sure what happened but I'm totally not enjoying it.\n\nI'm usually a hard worker but my PhD advisor was very hands-off and I had a huge amount of freedom to do my thing on my own time (take Wednesday off and work the Sunday? No problem). My \"supervisor\" here isn't an expert in my domain but still wants to guide my research and is way more micromanaging than what I'm used to. It particularly annoys me as I have my own funding and he, honestly doesn't understand what I'm doing (the second half of the project *should* be more up his alley, atleast in theory).\n\nSecondly, the place absolutely sucks. I had only lived in big cities and now I'm here in rural US and I'm at my wits end as to what to do. I'm getting depressed and I literally have cried myself to sleep two nights this week. I'm someone who enjoys my research, no matter how frustrating and how much of a grind it is, and for me to feel this way seems so... foreign. It's fascinating how this situation has managed to suck the joy out of the thing I so enjoyed.\n\nBefore this, I was toying with the idea of going into academia (hence the postdoc), but it's safe to say those intentions are long gone. If I leave I'd be looking at research positions in the industry (I checked I won't have to pay anything back to my fellowship sponsors). So my question is what would be a reasonable timeframe to make this decision? Is 3 months too soon? What is a reasonable timeframe?\n\nEdit: please don't tell me how my leaving will affect him negatively. The project I'm working on was my proposal, so it's hard for me to care too much about this aspect of my decision. Secondly, I'm going to prioritize my own sanity over causing him an inconvenience. I recognize that this will cause him some problems and I do regret that, but if he's upset about it he can create his own r/askacademia thread :-/",

Maybe he's right, but either way that life isn't suited for me.\n\nWhat's worse is that he wants me to push the Ph.D. students the same way that he pushes me (asking for status updates on weekends, etc) and there's zero chance  I'm emailing a student for a status update on a Saturday morning (edit: there are no upcoming deadlines or anything crucial that would warrant this).\n\nEssentially I feel like for the situation to improve he has to change who he is and how he operates and I've worked with enough professors/managers to know that that's an unrealistic goal to have.",
