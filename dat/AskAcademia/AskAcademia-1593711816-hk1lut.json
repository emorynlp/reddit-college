Of course meetings, collaborative experiments and equipment sometimes dictated working hours, but if you have to put in \"face time\" even during solo work find someone else to mentor you. Productive work is much more important than total hours worked.\n\nBurning out is a real thing and a much greater loss to your career than could be offset any prestige that might be gained by joining a particular lab.",

Those hours were 9-5. My bus would get me there either at 8:40 or at 9:10, so I opted to get there at 9:10. It didn't even occur to me that that could be an issue because there were whole weeks when I didn't speak to anyone. Until, of course, all three of my supervisors sat me down for a very serious meeting and told me that I was to be at the office at 9, no exceptions, or they would involve HR.\n\n\nIt's kind of funny because I was totally open to working evenings or weekends as necessary before that. The best way to ensure I never, ever work anything more than I'm required is to make a big stink over 10 minutes. My work-life balance is so much better than it would have been because of that meeting.",

And if you think that universities have stopped bleeding money I have several seafront properties in Colorado that I would like to sell to you. Which means next year too there will be very few to no faculty openings. That means the academic job market will be non existent for the next two years and absolutely brutal then on.

I don't personally know anyone who had to do a second postdoc or leave the one here because they didn't get any offers. Though I know multiple people who chose to do another postdoc or extend their current postdoc for a year before applying. \n\nI'm 100% positive this isn't the case everywhere.

He replied that my \"cold and calculated response\" was \"fine.\" He didn't understand. He was the primary reason I was in financial trouble at that point in my research. \n\nSubsequently, he told me (having received his job in the 1990s and never having been on the market since then) that I should only apply to a handful of teaching positions...that something would work out. \n\nI applied to about 150 jobs while finishing my dissertation and finalizing my divorce. It was a rough ride. I landed a tenure track job where I now work. Every step of the way, he gave me piss poor advice that was completely out of touch,  generally and, specifically, with the reality of the academia job market.\n\nThis year, I asked for a letter of recommendation for a potential better TT job. He sent me a completely weird and  socially unaware message that amounted to no and 'cause.  \n\nHe is - I feel - a turd in every way a that human being possibly can imitate and/or embody the qualities of a turd or the state of turdness, if you will.",

If you can\u2019t get into a top school, then don\u2019t go, because your chances of a good academic job will go from 5% to 0.1%.\n\nThen there are individual facts like your potential publication record as well as choice of specialisation. If you don\u2019t want to publish and instead you just want to \u2018broaden your intellectual horizon\u2019, then yeah, don\u2019t go. If you\u2019ve got an incredibly unfashionable (whatever that is) subject, then maybe reconsider your subject. \n\nStats re: academic job market don\u2019t take into account these varied circumstances. By making the right choices along the way, you can increase your odds. HOWEVER, there\u2019s good amount of luck required too, and there\u2019s obviously nothing you can do about that part.",

      "text": "My passion is and always has been in electronics engineering (EE).  In fact, I just finished my B.S. And about to start my PhD.\n\nI had a former highschool classmate that thought I was a fool to make a living out of something I love.  He was the popular kid, pretty outspoken, and the kind who always wants to \"one up\" someone and can be bully-ish at times.   He touted \"dont make a living out of what you enjoy, otherwise it will no longer be something you enjoy\".  I can see his reasoning, but im still pretty adamant on pursuing EE.\n\nFast forward to freshmen college.  We both went to the same public ivy.  Turns out he also majored in EE because our school's EE program has a reputation for being very challenging.  I run into him and hes panicing about the upcoming midterm.  I think he flunked out of the program and transferred to business school, havent seen nor heard from him since.",
