  "title:": "When is it acceptable to reject a paper?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been reviewing papers regularly for a few years now (I am a postdoc in a STEM field) but I still don\u2019t understand when it is acceptable to reject a paper. I\u2019ve seen some pretty egregious stuff but I always just recommend \u201cmajor revisions\u201d. Some journals that I review for seem to always send me crappy papers, so I just assume that their bar is lower. They are a legit (not predatory) journal. Are flawed methods or bad fit to journal the only reasons to reject? Sometimes I see methods that are only partially flawed, so I recommend major revisions. \n\nIn the case I am working on now, the authors included a bunch of extraneous analysis that did not contribute to their message at all and was not introduced in the introduction or discussed in the discussion. They have 80+ pages of tables and figures. Some of that is supplementary, but supplementary figures are referenced more often in text than their main figures. I really want to reject this paper because it is a mess with no clear point but I don\u2019t think that is a good enough reason. It has taken me over 3 days to review it. My PI doesn\u2019t allow me to do reviews on \u201ccompany time\u201d so I will have to use vacation days. I won\u2019t reject it. I will provide constructive feedback. It is difficult to evaluate the validity of the methods when the writing is unclear. This is not a language barrier issue (I would never comment on that or fault an author for that), but rather that there is no point to the analysis. There is no goal, no question being answered. They got a dataset and threw the statistical kitchen sink at it and then did not draw any conclusions, but just reported results. \n\nEdit: Before anyone gets mad at me: no one has ever taught me how to review a paper. I base my reviews on reviews I have gotten. I would welcome honest advice on how to review a particularly messy paper.",

As it is, I've had the meaning of critical sentences blithely reversed *in English* by editors who misunderstood the original meaning while reading in a hurry or were somehow unaware of some grammatical construct. It's usually easier to make such changes before entering final editing, as context and consistency can complicate that discussion, let alone when edits are sent on without checking.\n\nPersonally I have faith that most authors have the ability to improve their command of a new dialect or language, and that many might prefer to first attempt selection of an alternative that most properly conveys intended meaning.  And as /u/dampew said, it's possible you might not be reviewing what you think you are due to meaning *not* being conveyed.\n\nTalking behind their backs ensures they perpetually remain a second class.  One of many \"well-meaning\" cutthroat tactics, but all's fair in this dog-eat-dog world.\n\nAs far as style, it again seems preferable to flag this but a different tone may be suitable: \"I noticed you wrote in this stile, whereas most papers in this domain tend to be in that style\".  Then, again, the author can choose whether to conform to common usage, *and reduce work for the future*, or retain an idiosyncratic style and make clear to editors that it was intentional.",

                  "text": "It\u2019s a touchy subject, but there are definitely people who get upset when people complain about academics who have difficulty speaking/writing another language. On the one hand, I can definitely understand how incredibly difficult some people work to try and learn another language and have some people make fun of and be unhelpful in trying to learn that language. And often it is very difficult to learn that language at an academic level. And there are definitely some who use these issues to be xenophobic or express internalized xenophobia (this is usually why people are advised not to comment on language in my experience). On the other hand, I do think that effective communication is important in education and sometimes people with knowledge are not effective communicators, including when they are not teaching in their native language. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all had instructors or worked with people who we were trying our best to understand, but despite our best efforts, we simply found it extremely difficult to understand them. \n\nSo, there\u2019s a balancing act to be had here. If you absolutely cannot understand someone\u2019s prose and the ideas they are trying to convey, then that\u2019s an issue. And if you think style choices or poor English will cause harm to the credibility of the work, then that may be worth discussing as well. But addressing this issue of poor English must be done with tact and empathy, and sometimes there are better people to address it (though in reviewing a paper, there may not be a better person).",

The manuscripts I am involved in usually have a bunch of coauthors with an ok level of English & useful comments, but even that is of course no guarantee. \n\nIf a reviewer thought the level of English in my manuscripts was bad enough to be irritating, I'd prefer to know, so it can be fixed. However, I only have the Northern European perspective, molecular biology, and I don't think I've ever had discussions with peers really about this isssue. It's interesting, it probably shows how priviledged I am. I won't likely stop suggesting language revision, but making it more subtle comments to the Editor instead makes sense.",

              "text": "I\u2019m wondering if you can provide some examples and how they might be revised. I too think academic writing (and the available forms it takes) needs to be rethought a bit, but I tend to find the worst part about academic writing is how much it relies on the most jargon-y aspects of its field, often in order to be perceived as \u201cacademic\u201d. And that jargon is never brought down to a reasonable level (or a good source pointed out to explain it), where a person in the field but who is not a specialist on that topic can understand it. There are of course trade offs between technical jargon\u2019s specificity and the ability to convey ideas to a wider audience, but it seems to me that we very often don\u2019t consider them to the degree we should. Sometimes jargon is the answer. Sometimes it\u2019s not. And sometimes you should consider explaining it, but sometimes it is reasonable to assume people have prior knowledge.",

                  "text": "I mean I don't really have good examples in mind but some patterns. One of the biggest offenders is excess parentheticals for me. They really disorient me. E.g. from the page I am reading right now:\n\n> Systems in which high pitch rather obviously signals indisputable accent locations (and this includes unpredictable locations, as well as those that occur at edges) will be referred to as pitch accent systems [... .]\n\nThis is nowhere near as egregious as it gets (not seldom that I encounter parentheticals so long you forget where they started, or that they ever did), but it could be rewritten as such:\n\n> Systems in which high pitch signals indisputable accent locations rather obviouslywill be referred to as pitch accent systems; including when these locations are unpredictable or coincide with word edges.\n\nIn the first example you have a definition with a qualification, fairly distant from the point where the new jargon is introduced. In the second version, the definition and the new jargon are adjacent, and the qualification is tacked on. I'd probably read the latter once, the former twice or thrice if I'm having trouble concentrating. So \"avoid parentheticals\" could be good advice. Similarly good advice is \"Say something, then qualify\" instead of \"say something with a baker's dozen qualifications in the middle\". So, say \"All animals are equal. Some are more equal\" instead of \"All animals, some that are more equal notwithstanding, are equal\".\n\nAnother thing that absolutely throws me off is the APA full author year citations, especially when multiple. Something like (Doe, 1934; Godknowswhosson, 2020; Chang, 1995; van Hooijdonk, 2003; Pinksmith, 1969; Kayaalp; 1984) is just hell for me because it doesn't at all stand apart from prose. But if it's like [Doe1934; God2020; Cha1995; Hoo2003; Pin1969; Kay1984], it stands out more, and it's also nicer than [3, 5, 12, 13, 19, 42], because you still have some mnemonics. E.g. if I she Cho1957, that's as good a cue as (Chomsky, 1957) for Syntactic Structures, a foundational text of late 20th century linguistics. But, in 2021, you can have [1] have a tooltip with the full citation, so even that's not really necessary.\n\nOne thing that grinds my gears is excessive use of initialisms and abbvreviations (EUIA). When EUIA is employed, all you save is a few characters, but it just adds unncecessary cognitive load. Like, everytime the reader encounters and instance of EUIA, they will be like \"wth is EUIA\" and will have to track back to it.\n\nIMO the intro should be the place where all terminology and a sane amount of abbreviations are clarified. If there's a dictionary for the field's jargon (like the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics), and your use deviates from them, define explicitly.\n\nAnother guideline could be, if you referred to something by a pronoun twice already, for the third time use its name. If you used an abbreviation two times, the third time, just type it out. These \"long distance dependencies\" are taxing and can become hard to maintain. So: \"The term stress here will strictly refer to word stress. It's also used, in phonology and rest of linguistics, to refer to sentence stress, and sometimes even focus. Thus, the unqualified term 'stress' is ambiguous\" instead of \"~. Thus, it's an ambiguous term.\"\n\nMaybe the APA thing is somewhat subjective but IMO the three other \"rules\" could in and of itself improve most academic texts.",

I hate it when an editor sends me a bad paper because a bad review is so much harder than a good one. \n\n\n\n- I rejected one this week because the authors didn't do what I asked for in the first review. The paper had major flaws, but by changing a few things it would get over the bar. I said major revision, and outlined exactly what it needed. Later, I saw that one of the other reviewers gave almost exactly the same feedback. When we got the revision it was different but still bad; it didn't address the changes we needed to see at all. Reject. \n\n\n\n- I rejected one a few months ago because the experiment was poor and the conclusions were not justifiable from the data. It took both of these things to get the reject. If the data were good then I would've helped them with different conclusions. Even if the experiment was not ideal, I'd be willing to see if the results were still useful in some limited context. Bad design of experiment AND bad use of data is gonna get the hose. \n\n\n\n- I rejected another paper a few months ago because it was a mess. Reading below, it seems like some of you try to save these. For me, I get uncomfortable if I can't say what I don't like about the paper on the first draft. Sometimes a paper has so many issues that I know many more criticisms will arise once they clean it up. As an author, I hate it when reviewers bring up new issues after the first revision. For a messy paper I'll reject it but tell the authors they just need to clean it up - it's not like it'll never get published, but I also don't want them to think there is a clear path to publication.",

Often, a rejection means that the reviewer doesn't believe that the paper can be salvaged in a reasonable timeline and that resubmitting after significant work has been done might be an option.\n\nRejection because the paper doesn't fit the journal's scope is also common.\n\nRejection because the paper is an unreadable mess is fair in my book. Like, maybe there's a brilliant paper in there, but it's not the reader's job to find it. I've rejected before with \"figure out what you want to say and come back later\" as the general comment before.\n\nRejection because the paper is clearly trying to sell a quarter of the actual results to multiply the number of publications is also fair. Journal papers aren't meant to be sliced into shorter, less significant, repeating pieces.\n\nRejection because the paper spends most of its time explaining how a well known method works, only to use it (maybe badly) to get data that is presented without analysis is also totally fine.

      "text": "I recently rejected my first paper. I have written some hard reviews before, but I had not ever outright written a recommendation to reject without the possibility of revision.\n\nThe article in question was attempting to cash in on a recent fad in the field. It was written by a lone clinician with no access to equipment to make any kind of measurements. The paper represented a theoretical design to achieve the said fad, using old technology.\n\nThe concept wasn't bad - had the design been feasible, or had it solved some problems that no better alternative could, it probably could have been published. But it really suffered in its execution. There was a simplistic computer model that showed the design would work on its face, but it did not address any of the glaring flaws associated with that particular methodology. There was not much time spent on acquiring data or validating the proposed methodology past the very basics. \n\nThe proposed method used obsolete technology associated with a large number of practical and fundamental difficulties that would prevent the design from ever becoming a useful prototype. It solved no problems that were not already solved by existing, commercially available technology. \n\nThe kiss of death was that the author tried to salami cut their already-paltry paper into three - promising two more followup papers where the method would be adapted to slightly different geometries. A single paper where all three geometries were presented and compared and contrasted might have had a lot more standing? But this was egregious.\n\nAnother paper I rejected recently was from a chiropractor writing pro-x-ray imaging propaganda that had been copied and pasted in numerous other publications ad infinitium. The same figures were in 4-5 other articles I linked. I wrote to the editorial staff that I was shocked and appalled it had actually made it to review.",

There's a certain kind of obviously but generally low-quality paper that's particularly difficult to evaluate, which might be what you're dealing with in this specific case - there's not really one glaring fault that makes it clear it needs to be rejected in its current form (I agree that salvageability decides whether you think resubmission makes sense). It's very honorable to want to be constructive but I would suggest being very intentional about who/which papers deserve it, as some people even really will just submit utter shit in order to get reviewers to do their work for them, or just to see whether they get lucky. Those types, where it's just obvious, only should get very general, generic feedback - \"serious lack of clarity/adequate reflection of the literature/methodological justification/etc throughout\", or whatever. If I think the authors made a good faith effort but made a mistake somewhere then I'll go into detail for them.\n\nIt might help to consider explicitly what you see the role as being, or what you agree to when doing it. Are you a copy-editor for free? Do you primarily want to change other people's papers so they're better (\"better\" as per your opinion)? Do you want to serve as a quality control mechanism to try to reduce at least the worse, most obvious nonsense getting into the peer-reviewed scientific literature? (Personally, I've come to lean mostly towards 3, with some of 2 but I try to make it extremely clear when I'm making honestly optional suggestions for improvement, since it's so easy to abuse the role to push opinions.)",

Or a sorta/kinda stab at the issue?\n\n* Does our knowledge change in any meaningful way as a result of this? The topic has probably been covered before - does this work add meaningfully to that discussion?\n\n* are there technical or conceptual issues that seem to cast doubt on the validity? \n\n* Would the authors have to redo analyses or experiments, or add entire new sections, to address any of the above?\n\nAn * informative* rejection review, with the key flaws listed, is much better than a major resubmit recommendation with a litany of issues that would take the authors months to address for little meaningful gain in final paper quality. It gives the authors space to look at the paper again and rethink some of it. \n\nIf you cannot assess these issues because the writing is impenetrable or flabby or you would have to assume the authors\u2019 intentions, recommend rejection and say the paper needs to be restructured for narrative and clarity before it can be fully evaluated.",

This typically creates a multiple testing problem because each potential analysis is effectively a statistical test. Multiple testing procedures are sometimes used to compensate, but that is often difficult or impossible to do precisely. Post hoc analysis that is conducted and interpreted without adequate consideration of this problem is sometimes called data dredging by critics because the statistical associations that it finds are often spurious.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

A good editor will read your review and consider whether the concerns merit rejection or not. \n\nIn my view, based on what you have suggested, a suggestion of rejection would be reasonable. Any academic paper needs to make  a contribution to the literature, and if it's not possible to make any conclusions based on the content of the manuscript, it does not make a contribution.\n\nAnother frequent reason for rejection is that the conclusions are not supported by the results. Sometimes this is easily fixed with a few tweaks to make the conclusions more tempered (so normally addressed through revisions). However, for rejection decisions, there could be serious issue with the analysis or study design that mean the paper is not able to make a meaningful contribution. This might be a very small sample size, missing control groups, or serious flaws in the analysis performed. If the underlying analysis needs to be repeated it makes sense to reject a paper, since the authors need to repeat their analysis, which could change the results and whole message of the paper.",

Usually this is some variation of whether the paper is (1) novel and intellectually meritorious, (2) within the journal's scope, and (3) well-written. Remember, the decision to reject is not made by you but rather by the editor who uses your feedback as input to that decision, and therefore you should not worry too much about this part of your decision. Focus more on providing effective feedback. Personally I recommend rejection of maybe a third to half of the papers I am asked to review (this is going to vary tremendously by field and journal), but in all cases I provide ample feedback that can be used for revisions regardless of the editor's decision.\n\nIn this case, remember that you should not recommend acceptance based on the *potential* for good work, but on whether good work has actually been done and written into a publishable form. \"Major revisions\" should usually be understood to mean additional work to address weaknesses in a paper that is interesting and valuable, not that there might be something there if the authors get their shit together.",

This means that every relevant control was used (positive and negative), and disqualified the tested explanation (this is what controls do. They are there to test alternative possible reasons for effects and disqualify them). Validity also means that the writer did not make assumptions, implicitly, when drawing the conclusion offered. This means you need to look for hidden assumptions added to data when extracting a conclusion (over-generalizations; all possible analysis issues including power and variability go here). The above covers every possible flaw a method may have. If a method is not suffering from the above, it is not flawed.\n\nBeing new: this became impossible to verify today, with the accumulation of papers. I know for a fact of a woman who got her PhD for a paper that she knew was not the first to report those findings, and she got it three decades ago. Your best chance is reading a little and searching for similar works. It's not a valid way but you really don't have much more you can do, until AI is introduced to databases (the EU is using it for the first time this year to assess innovation of grant pre-applications. Stay tune). \n\nThe actual contribution, how substantial results are - well that would depend on journal quality.
