  "text": "It takes time for someone who went for a PhD to get settled down with a permanent job which is pretty obvious. By that time, a person is near 30 or around 32 or more if we consider postdoc. How does uncertainty of which city/state/country(?) one may get a job relate to finding and keeping relationship a partner? This particularly happens a lot in faculty position. If one's lover or spouse has a job, how should the decision to move in other's city be taken?\n\nThere is a meme on internet that you either settle down for less or stay single. Jokes aside, once I read an social studies article where it shows that statistically male faculties more likely to have housewife (had a job but left) or wives doing a job she's too qualified to do because of moving with her husband. Female faculties may have faculty husband most likely (I forgot the percentage). Housewife observation may be relatively uncommon nowadays because of the changes compared to 30 years ago. Unfortunately I can't find the article again, so please ignore if you wish. However it is relatable.\n\nI wonder about my professors how their life is (am afraid to ask such personal questions). It is more difficult for single academicians in a foreign country to find a partner (like me). From PhD to postdoc, you may need to change your place 2-3 times or more. I have checked my teachers's profiles and I don't know how they manage to do it if they had spouse at that time. Also, taking children is a parallel issue and a time dependent factor for female academicians if they want to. What do you think about this?\n\nabout me: I am a male grad student of STEM in his mid-20s. I have a plan to stay in academia, if not, in a research lab. I may do 1-2 postdoc (maybe?) in different places in future. I never had any partner and I am worried how it would go in future. I don't want to be a jerk asking someone to leave her job for me. I am even afraid to ask out someone I like because most likely we won't be able to stay together.\n\nAny kind opinion and comment on my perspective will be welcome! Thanks for reading.",

                  "text": "I mean people here can\u2019t give you answers about your relationship and whether or not it will work. I know couples in academia who fell apart because of distance within a few months and others who have been doing long distance for 10+ years because they can\u2019t get jobs in the same geographic location. Some of those couples even have kids together and raise them separately. I know one professor who gave up two tenured positions because of her husband\u2019s academic job pursuits, and she couldn\u2019t keep tenure at whatever new institution she moved to. She\u2019s nearing 60 and still doesn\u2019t have tenure at her new institution as a result, and they\u2019re divorced.\n\nIn essence, it will depend on both of you and whether or not you will continue to grow together, or end up growing apart. From my time in academia and from hearing other people\u2019s stories, 99% of the time, one person has to sacrifice a lot of personal and career goals to be with the other one (taking teaching positions, research-only staff positions, or leaving academia altogether). Ideally, you both land your ideal jobs in the same location, but that\u2019s the exception to the two-body problem, not the rule.",

My acceptance was contingent on her own appointment to the med school faculty. \n\nA lot of luck but two things I learned: First, choose major urban centers for your postdoc aspirations, especially if one of you matriculates before the other, because you double/triple the chances of being able to work in the same city when that city has 2-3 major universities. I mean, Madison is fine, but Chicago has way more options with UChicago, Northwestern, UIC, and more. Same for LA, NYC, Boston. \nSecond, the harder you work the more you\u2019ll be able to set the terms of your employment. It\u2019s much better to be recruited than to apply. Network early.",

My partner and I (both academics) have made many sacrifices in terms of personal lives and career prospects to stay together, as this was more important to us than our careers. He started a PhD before me and deliberately chose a university in an area with a high density of universities, knowing I'd want to start a PhD shortly after him. Thus, we could live together while pursuing our degrees. Did this make for perfect research projects at schools we wanted to go to? No, but we were happy to make that sacrifice to remain together. We also decided early on that the first of us to get a full time position anywhere would follow the other and hope for the best. Happy to say this happened recently and we are moving to accommodate his new job!\n\nThe point is, if you are committed to your partner and they to you, there will be hard compromises that need to be made. Sometimes leading to a lot of debate/arguing. If that compromise cannot be made for one reason or another, than that relationship may not be the best one for you and your career goals.

I wouldn't count on this happening often. Even then, the joint offer would not be tenured for one of you. You have to be a *real* superstar to get two tenured offers, for example.

Depending on what you and your significant other are willing to sacrifice, the long distance can be months or decades but people do it. I have heard a lot of people (half joking) advise against a partner also in academia because double appointments can be harder to come by. Ideally, a partner has a job that can be remote or easily found in multiple places. However choosing to live in a bigger city can also help with getting two jobs. Some people also choose to stay put for multiple parts of their career to minimize the effect on their family (e.g. grad and post doc at same institution). Lastly, some people just get lucky. Lucky people give hope and not helpful advice on the subject haha.",

      "text": "TLDR: You can't predict the future.\n\nMy wife and I were lucky... we were both students at the same school and married at the end of undergrad and both continued on as grad students at that same school.  (Yes, this means that both of us have all of our degrees from the same school).  While we both planned to pursue PhDs at the time we married, we had no idea where things would go from there.\n\nI finished my PhD about two years ahead of my wife.  I didn't have a TT position lined up at graduation (I had a couple of interviews but no offers).  A professor (not my supervisor) at our school helped me out by hiring me into a postdoc position for about a year while my wife got closer to completion.  It wasn't really a good match for me but he had a grant that he needed to spend out and it let me get a couple of publications out, provided some income, and gave me a second round of applications for TT positions.  This resulted in multiple tenure track position offers, a non-tenure track offer at a really good school, and multiple industrial offers.  \n\nI ultimately accepted a tenure track teaching position half way across the country (a more teaching-focused position was a better match for my interests).  My wife stayed behind to finish the lab work needed for her PhD.  We lived apart for about 6 months with only one visit.  It wasn't fun, but there were no kids involved, so it was manageable.  Once her lab work was done she moved to join me and wrote up her work remotely.  \n\nBefore my wife finished writing up her work she landed a part time position that was highly relevant to her work and adjacent to the campus where I was working.  (Remember what I said about us being lucky?)  This was great because it gave her the time she needed to finish writing while also letting her develop some relevant connections in our new home.  She moved into a full time position when she was done writing.  It wasn't an academic position, but she was never sure that was really what she wanted.  It was a position where her PhD was appropriate -- most of her colleagues hold either masters degrees or PhDs -- so it wasn't a case of getting her PhD and not using it.  A dozen years later I'm still in my academic position, now as a tenured full teaching professor, and she is still with the same organization having moved through a few different roles.\n\nYou don't ultimately know what will happen.  We would have never predicted that we would end up where we did geographically when we got married, but it's home now, and it has worked out well.  My career path went more or less where I would have predicted in that I ended up in an academic position, but I wouldn't have said I was aiming for a teaching focused position at the beginning of my PhD even though it was definitely what I wanted at its end.  My wife's career path certainly wasn't what she would have predicted at the beginning of her PhD, but we both have careers where we do work that we generally enjoy and use the degrees that we earned.  It all worked out in the end, even though we couldn't have predicted how it would have worked out when we got married (and certainly not when we started dating fairly early in undergrad).  Don't let your inability to predict the future prevent you from asking someone out on a date.\n\nEdit: Grammar is hard late at night.",

      "text": "Hmm.  I guess only part of this works for my own personal stats. \n\nI'm a woman. I didn't go to undergrad straight out of high school, so I didn't get my BS until I was almost 25.  Then I did a 2 year Masters and a 5 year PhD.  I am at the end of the first year of my second post doc, and I am 34 (will be 35 later this year). My first postdoc was at the same school I attended for PhD; the second postdoc city required a move of about 350 miles, but is still in the same state. I have one more year of this postdoc. I have an out-of-state TT job accepted with a deferred start date of July 2021.  I will be almost 36 when I start that position. When we eventually have kid(s) I will be at least 37, I'm fine with this. (I was considering having a kid this year, as a postdoc. But then COVID happened, and there is no way in hell I'm willing to be pregnant and immunocompromised during this mess.)\n\nI got married during my Phd (in year 4).  My husband is a web developer/designer, in no way related to academia. I met him shortly after I moved to my PhD city. I didn't take any longer to finish my PhD because I got married. We always knew that although we loved the city where we met that we would have to move, likely more than once, when I finished my PhD. For us it has been so important that he has a job he can do remotely, he still works for the same company he did before we moved for this current postdoc.  \n\nHere's the thing to remember: You can't predict the future, so as such, you cannot (should not?) put your life on hold while you are in graduate school. If you meet someone you are interested in, ask them on a date.  If you are hoping to find a partner, put yourself out there. If you have a good relationship and you are open with your partner about the possibilities and potential trajectories in your life, you can make decisions about how to move forward (and move house!) as partners.  This is my best advice.\n\nIf I could offer other maybe useful advice at all it would be to:\n\n\\~ Find someone who has a job that can be done in any city, or someone who can work remotely. (This is assuming you are willing to consider the career trajectory of your partner before you even engage in a serious relationship with them, that's up to you I guess.) Be aware of the two-body problem as it is a real pain in the ass. I barely scrapped together the one job that I finally landed, I can't imagine trying to land a second one. None of the couples that formed while I was in grad school have landed dual jobs at the same academic institution, yet. \n\n\\~Stay out of debt (if you can); paying off debt as a postdoc sucks hard. Have money saved for moving expenses when you accept your postdocs because they don't pay relocation costs, most of the time. It cost us almost $5k last summer to move 350 miles, mainly because I didn't follow my next piece of advice. \n\n\\~Don't acquire furniture or other large objects you are emotionally attached to and cannot sell when you move. \n\n\\~Be willing to go long distance, at least for a little while.  I only know two couples that have a permanent long distance relationship. \n\n\\~Aim for positions in big cities. There are more employment options in general, but also likely several academic institutions.  This just helps your odds.  \n\nAcademia doesn't have to be a sentence to single life. If you want, you can get married and have kids in graduate school/as a postdoc. It just takes additional planning and it's best to have a partner who's really in it with you.",

On estimate, about 66% of women who start trying at age 35 conceive within a year. After four years, 84% eventually get pregnant and have a baby. Those chances steadily drop as one gets older.\n\nSorry, I don't mean to assume things or trigger negative feelings. Just curious as I think of these things.

I don\u2019t think he mentions this, but if your spouse has a WFH job or a highly mobile one (management consultant), then they\u2019ll be able to move with you with little to no loss to them.",

      "text": "It's really difficult to predict! \n\nWhen I began my PhD I discussed it with my partner and basically we had a few possible options: 1. Either I apply/try and get a job in academia in a city that his company has an office in (which was most big cities) 2. If I got a good offer elsewhere he would revaluate how he was feeling about his own work and consider looking for another job, 3. I look for work outside of academia in our home city. \n\nWhat ended up happening was before I'd finished my PhD, I was offered a TT position in our home city (which was not a possibility we had ever even considered!). Which was incredibly lucky as I was simply in the right place, in the right field, at the right time. But we had contingency plans in place.\n\nSo I think it's important to have that discussion early in the relationship so both people understand the situation and you can approach it as a team and see what each person is willing to compromise on.",

      "text": "I concur that you can\u2019t Plan love. You take what is offered and make the best decision when the time comes. Usually someone is going to have to sacrifice initially. I married my husband after undergrad. He was already in a TT position (yes, I married my prof. It\u2019s been 20 years, it worked out.) I was dismayed at the thought of trying to find a good job, never mind a faculty position, in our small town. The university does not have grad programs, so I had to leave to finish my education. I figured I had time and would worry about it when the time came. We had agreed to give it 5 years. If I did not find a job I loved in that time, he would leave to allow me to follow my career goals. Luckily, I landed a TT position in the 5th year. But, I know he would have left to allow me to be fulfilled in my career, just as he was in his. It boils down to what is important to you and your partner. We both wanted the other to have a job they loved, so I don\u2019t know that I would have actually made him leave if I hadn\u2019t have found a TT position. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to find out. But, each person should be given the opportunity to have something that fulfills them beyond family. If not their career, then volunteer work or recreational activities... both should be able to find happiness outside of their relationship.\n\nNot sure what this adds, though I hope it helps in some way. I advise to keep dating and let life happen. Trying to plan life is often a recipe for disaster. If you find yourself in a serious relationship, share your worries. Don\u2019t try to solve anything, just share. Then, live your life by doing what makes you happy.",

Our lives were going different directions, so it was only a matter of time, but it's a choice I reflect on frequently. We might've worked it out if I had privileged our relationship over my career, but I wanted to attend a school in an area she did not want to be. I've continued to live with that decision.\n\nIf I remain single through my PhD, it is not on account for concern of having to move or the uncertainty of knowing where I'll be on the other side of all this. It really has much more to do with the lack of desire to have children, the awfulness of dating app culture (this is really the biggest point), and the fact that my research is my biggest priority in life.\n\nRelationships don't have to be forever, and there's nothing wrong with being in a committed relationship during your PhD and then recognizing that the time has passed and you both have to go your separate ways. Besides, academia is hardly the only industry where this is the case. Millennials across the board are less likely to get married than their parents, and those that do tend to be much older. There are a ton of economic reasons for that, but there are plenty of evolving cultural ones as well.",

I had to either be okay with that OR our 5-year relationship needed to be over. So we have done the long-distance thing for almost 3 years now. In that time, we got married (still doing long distance).  \n\nWhen I was on the job market this cycle, I only applied to places that were within 5 hours of where he lived OR that he was willing to relocate to.  This really limited my job prospects, and then with the whole COVID-19 hiring freezes left and right, I am finding myself without a job in academia come fall.  I am going to drop into K-12 for a while where he lives and we will see how the market shakes out in a year or two. I have a grant extension so over this summer and next, I'll be able to shake out a few last papers from my project to keep my academic profile relevant.  \n\nSo much of academia involves being able to go where the job is, and being in a relationship with an academic means understanding that. Sometimes it means someone has to move with their partner, sometimes it means doing long distance, sometimes it means ending relationships.  I think you have to do what works/feels right for you and your significant other at each transition point, - though no matter what it is, it is going to be hard.",

      "text": "I'm a woman (22-30 through the course of this story) and my boyfriend made the decision to follow me to where I went to grad school and later to the different places where I got jobs. He worked when I was in grad school and put off going to grad school in order for us to make a little more money than what I got off my assistantship and professional gigs. When I got my first assistant professor job, he went back to school and stayed at home. We were just talking about how I probably would have lost my mind if I didn't have someone to do the vast majority of the chores and cooking when I was working 70-90 hours a week for three years.  It wasn't ideal, but he was able to get his degree. When we moved for my work again, I was able to find him an adjunct job in the area. While not full-time work, he did get the job less than a month after graduating and no teaching experience.\n\nWe'll likely take my job prospects into account more because I have more earning potential in the future and my field is extremely small, but we're going to try to make the best decision for both of our careers. Basically, it's tricky as heck to balance having a relationship and working in academia. My significant other delayed his career in order for me to start mine. It was a big sacrifice on his part, but it was one he was willing to make to be with me.\n\nI know and have worked with a number of women that have significant others that work in other states because that was the only way for them to both have their careers. I can't imagine it for me, but it's not uncommon.\n\nReally, if you don't want to be an impact on your future person's career, maybe try to find someone that has an established career in the place where you start working. You'll still have to deal with what to do if you want to work somewhere else, but it might be a little smoother if they got their own thing going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout the kids thing: I know a lot of women that have set their careers back significantly by having children. This is fine if it's what they really, really want, but it is an issue to be aware of that impacts a lot of women.\n\nSome just teach adjunct when they could be teaching full time. It's actually so common where I currently work they have professor's wives go to female faculty/student mentoring events because there are so few women teaching full time at the school. They do throw these women with really great degrees and experience the occasional adjunct job when the school needs it, but that's about it. I have noticed this is not the case when genders are reversed.\n\nI also know one woman in particular that has given up a blossoming career where they would have found international renown to stay in one place for their kid's childhood, setting their career back by over a decade. Her husband lived in another state teaching so she only saw him once a month for several of those years. Only now is she finally getting jobs as she once did now that her child is in their late teens.\n\nMost of the women I went to grad school with either are still putting off having kids or are never having them. I'd say 3/4ths don't want kids at all. I know one woman that definitely has wanted kids, but she's going on 8 years graduated and she's still putting it off because she wants to have her career. One got pregnant in grad school and couldn't deal with the bullying from male professors that still expected her to be working 70 hours a week two weeks after having the kid (because they had dumped their offspring on their well-educated wives that gave up their careers to have said kids). That one was a really bad situation. The only people from grad school that had children and are still in the field are men and I think there are only two out of 30 or so people after being graduated from 4-8 years.\n\nI'm not having kids for a lot of reasons and the value I place on work and having a successful career is one of them. If you get to that stage in a relationship, really think about how childcare will be handled. Set money aside, plan for it. Think about working in places where your spouse (or you, though you mentioned working abroad) has family or some support system. Talk to people if you see them pulling it off and learn how they did it.",

      "text": "My husband and I offset our careers. I am a PhD researcher in Europe - we do a masters/research masters first here, so the actual PhD itself takes around three years. From that perspective I\u2019m in the later stages of a US-style PhD. Conversely, my husband is entering the final year of his bachelor degree. \n\nBy the time I finish my PhD, he will have finished his bachelor, and had a year to get an internship somewhere, take the GRE/GMAT, write applications etc. \n\nSo I\u2019ll take an academic job somewhere\u2014Post-Doc or otherwise\u2014and he will apply for a Masters degree at either the same university or one nearby (i.e. within an hour or so commuting distance, which is what I have now because of his job). \n\nAnd so on. By the time I\u2019ve got at least one Post-Doc under my belt, he\u2019ll have his Masters and be ready to apply for a PhD. So I\u2019ll be applying for junior positions at a university while he applies for a PhD. Again, we will be jointly selecting locations based on availability and our research interests. We aren\u2019t tied to a geographical location long-term, neither of us are from the country we live in right now\u2014or even the continent\u2014and we are entirely flexible in terms of location. \n\nThis approach has actually worked fairly well so far.\n\nI completed my Masters\u2019 of Science/Research and worked part-time at a research institute, while he worked full-time and worked on his bachelor part-time. Soon I\u2019ll be working, most likely as a Post-Doc, while he does his Masters. So we will trade positions in terms of earning income while the other studies. \n\nIt honestly probably helps a lot that we are a) in the same field, and b) have the same research interests. In terms of institute compatibility, it means jointly finding locations that are a good fit is/will be easier.\n\nThere are only two potential problems we can foresee: 1) we are different nationalities, which may be a problem visa-wise. 2) he may get rejected by PhD programs at every location I apply to work at as junior faculty (and all corresponding nearby locations). The latter we don\u2019t think will happen - we honestly have a very similar profile grades-wise and ability-wise so far. If they\u2019d have taken me, they should\u2014in a theoretical world\u2014be willing to take him. \n\nAfter he finishes his PhD .. that\u2019s another matter. I will be a few years into a position at that point, and if there was no space for him either at the same institute or a nearby one that would kind of suck. \n\nThe fact we are both willing to commute an hour each way, and only intend to apply to places with multiple institutions, as well as private research institutions, nearby... hopefully this somewhat negates that risk. Given a 2 hour preferred radius in DC, Chicago, New York or Boston, we are betting on there has to be something for each of us.\n\nCheck back in a couple years and I\u2019ll let you know how that turns out lol.\n\nEdit: in the case that it doesn\u2019t work out for him, his back-up career is that he wants to write popular science and be a stay at home dad. So our worst outcome is still an okay kind of deal.",

      "text": "I started dating my partner near the end of my PhD, with about 8 months left before moving for my postdoc. A lot of people in this thread have recommended finding a partner who's an academic. To the extent that we can pick this, I'd recommend finding someone in a field that has career opportunities everywhere. My husband is a civil engineer and has found employment everywhere we've moved, including where he was for six months. I have good friends from graduate school who both married people in medical fields (a nurse and a speech therapist) who have also been very successful at finding employment wherever they needed to live.\n\nFor our story, we met near the end of my PhD when my now-husband had JUST opened a restaurant. When I moved across the US for my postdoc, he stayed behind and sold his business and remodeled then sold his house. We were long distance for 1.5 years. We were a 16 hour drive apart (and always drove because we were each ~3 hours from major airports), which was definitely hard. I planned to stay in my postdoc for another year, so after selling his house, he moved out to live with me, we got married, and he found a decent position in the small town where we lived. I ended up finding a permanent position right at the end of the job-hunting season so we surprise moved 6 months after he moved there. He was really worried about what his resume looked like after leaving engineering for ~2.5 years for a restaurant then house-remodeling, then working in a position for 6 months. Since we live in a college town now, all of the companies that he interviewed with are very used to seeing people whose partners are in academia so he didn't actually end up having a problem with it.\n\nMy best advice is: it's not easy, but it's worth it for the right person. I dated a lot during my PhD and always struggled because I knew I'd have to move around. When I found the right person, I was willing to give up my academic career to stay with him, but he was willing to move to make my academic dreams come true.",

      "text": "I understand your concern. I (f) left a long term relationship after my master's to do a PhD abroad. The relationship was bad and would have ended anyway do that's not the point. Over my PhD I was mainly single. Whenever I tried to date someone, I had to bring up the fact that I won't stay forever which for most people is a deal-breaker. I think I also have to mention the legend of the saphiophile. Dating is naturally greatly affected by sexism, and the world views of both partners which easily collide if she is highly educated. Anyway, now I'm about to move for my first postdoc. I will have to move at least once more after that. I'm in my early 30s and I now decided to make my own plans without considering whether or not I will find a partner. I'm prepared and happy to have a child on my own as soon as my career allows it. You don't have that option I guess! But you have also more choice in a partner due to sexism.\n\nYou could say, we have made our bed and need to lie in it. You can't expect to find someone who will put up with your lifestyle, esp if you don't find them quickly enough within this 2-3 year period you will stay somewhere. Not enough time to make a connection strong enough for them to come with you. You can hope to find someone in your institute with whom you can move on together. Become one of those double-PI groups. But what are the chances!",

      "text": "My wife and I were friends in undergrad, but only started dating after we were at grad schools 1000 miles apart. She did an MD/PhD and I just did a PhD, so we were long distance for \\~ 6 years while I did my PhD and since her program was a few years longer than mine, I got a post-doc at her university and moved there.   \n\n\nWe have, since then, had to move to a different city for her residency. I was fortunate that I had a few years in my post-doc and do work that is 90% computational, so my advisor was willing to let me work remotely and has been willing to extend my typical post-doc period that was supposed to expire next month in the middle of pretty serious hiring freezes in academic/medical centers.   \n\n\nThat said, I don't think it's likely that I'll end up in a faculty position in part because of the most recent move. We ended up in a fairly large city, but the universities here have fairly small research centers for what I do. My next job will most likely be a senior scientist type role and my skillset has some appliciation to certain industry jobs, so I think the answer to your initial question is that the \"two body problem\" can definitely limit your options.   \n\n\nI think the best advice I have:  \n\n\n1) This question is probably going to be irrelevant for quite a few relationships you might have. Simply put, not everything sticks and you're kinda going from zero to married in your head before you've even gone on a date. It isn't really something to worry about until you're kinda getting serious.  \n\n\n2) Have this discussion somewhat early in your relationship - certainly before you do something like move in together or get engaged, but it's also not first few dates material.   \n\n\n3) Respect your future partners' ability to make their own choices. The relationship danger is that one partner might resent the other for limiting their career, but you also need to trust that if your partner chooses to suspend their own career in order to move with you - that it's something that they're choosing to do as an equal adult partner in the relationship.  \n\n\n4) Seriously consider the possibility that you'll be the partner who needs to subordinate your career for your partner's  - if only for the purpose of being able to empathize with the choice that your future partner might have to make.  \n\n\n5) If you've got enough publications and grants, spousal hires are something you can negotiate with future employers.  \n\n\n6) Be flexible - you may need to take a position that isn't 100% what you want in order to make things work.   \n\n\n7) Consider that this question may also be irrelevant for a different reason - the path from grad school to academic career is pretty narrow. Only about 10% of PhD graduates end up in faculty jobs. There's a lot of burn-out in between, so you may not even want to stay in academia in a few years. \n\n8) Develop your skills - and really look at what's marketable outside of academia too. For example, a lot of my job requires computer programming skills, which certainly opens up different career paths - but academia tends to use different programming languages than industry (e.g. Matlab vs. Python/R).",

      "text": "I met my husband when I was in the last year of undergrad. He's in a field that is needed in most areas in the US, so he moved wherever my jobs took me. The hardest time was in my last year of post-doc while looking for faculty positions. We have a small child and my husband is getting his M.S. now, so the uncertainty was really hard, but we got lucky with a really good position opening in a region that we want to raise our child in. I'm in physics, btw, so it is possible.\n\nThe future is unpredictable, though, and people are all different. And just because this worked for us, doesn't mean it will work for everyone. I think it's important to keep an open mind and not actively look for a partner in a certain job because you think it will work well. The best thing to do is let the relationship happen and then openly communicate life-long plans when the time is right.",

      "text": "When you consider job offers, consider how much time you actually have to depend there and how the semesters line up. Some schools let you stack your teaching in one semester, others don't. Australia is also good for having their summer in the Northern hemisphere's winter, so can make a two body problem easier. The schools that are the closest geographically aren't necessarily the ones that will let you spend the most time together.",
