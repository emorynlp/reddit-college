  "text": "Hey all,\n\n I have recently been accepted into a PhD in English in England. I will be studying a topic that is very near and dear to me (lyrics as poetry). I currently am teaching at two universities who treat me very well in terms of classes and treatment. My dilemma is I am torn on what to do. Since my PhD is in the UK, I have to pay for it out of pocket with student loans. Which won\u2019t allow me to have that much to live on after I pay for rent, food, travel, etc. Whilst it\u2019s a great opportunity to study abroad (seeing that I got my masters in England), I am nervous about not being able to work for 4 years. I will be 35 by the time I graduate and am nervous about leaving the teaching opportunities I have here in the States. I know the academia job market is not the greatest, but there\u2019s a part of me that will always wonder \u201cwhat if?\u201d if I do not take the opportunity to get my PhD abroad. I have been very blessed to have found the jobs I have so easily and am wondering if leaving academic jobs for a PhD will benefit or harm me in the long run. I see the pros and cons of each situation and am really looking for advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs a PhD worth it if you are studying what you love? Is it worth leaving two pretty good academic jobs for?",

My real advice would be to do anything other than academia. You are not too old to run from it! I am a humanities PhD (early modern literature, so about as bad as job prospects in your field) and if I had a time machine, I would tell my younger self to bag it and do something else. Humanities departments are being shut down in many places and it's painful on the way out.",

The research councils put a lot of pressure on universities to ensure that students complete on time and universities can lose funding if they don't. With no incentive to get students finished on time supervisors can and do exploit students, not entirely different from what you see in US universities where PIs don't want to see their free labour leave so don't support their students to finish. \n\nI can't comment on whether you should do the PhD - I see the comments here, which are totally correct but I might counter that you're probably not going to advance much further in academia without a PhD so if you want career progression you will need to eventually get a PhD. Whether it's this PhD is another matter...",

      "text": "Just a quick point of information: if your goal is to land a tenure-track job in the humanities in the US afterward then a UK Ph.D. may hinder that. Due to the nature of graduate education in the UK (i.e. limited coursework) and the lack of US-style teaching experience (i.e. not TAing big lectures, teaching courses on your own, etc.) many search committee members at PUI/teaching oriented schools will simply reject UK Ph.D.s out of hand. The market is terrible and is going to get worse as more US schools close due to COVID's economic hit and the looming [demographic cliff.](https://www.cupahr.org/issue/feature/higher-ed-enrollment-cliff/) Anything that makes you a less competitive candidate is a risk. Note also that while there *are* jobs in rhet/comp subfield positions teaching literature are much more scarce.\n\nIf you're studying economics at the LSE or Brit Lit at Oxford that's probably a different matter. But in my now lengthy experience with search committees in the humanities at SLACs and other PUIs a UK Ph.D. can really be a handicap due to the teaching differences (and outright ignorance among search committee members). These days if you don't have direct experience teaching as the instructor-of-record you aren't going to make the first cut at schools like mine, as there are far too many applicants who do have both direct experience and the evals/LORs to go with them that committees are simply unwilling to gamble on untested/unproven candidates.\n\nThe situation for research-oriented jobs of course will be different.",

In the humanities (and somewhat in the social sciences) there aren't many postdocs, so most people work as adjunct/term faculty before/while on the market; as a result almost all of the top candidates have at least a few semesters of teaching full time.  It's different in STEM, and one of the issues is that far too many STEM candidates never teach but only run labs. That's not enough for an SLAC job, so that postdoc teaching experience can be vital.\n\nIt's also *really* important that a candidate's teaching file include LORs from faculty who directly observed them teaching-- the old \"I hear she's a good teacher\" or \"students seem to like her\" or \"colleagues say there were no complaints\" sort of LORs are completely worthless. Strong candidates will also include student evaluations of their teaching, or at least summary information from those. One issue I've seen with UK Ph.D.s is that often neither of those are present, which puts the candidate at a severe disadvantage against someone who is, say, from the U. California system where ABD grads often teach independently and mentors are good about observing them.",

      "text": "English PhD here.....my general take on it is that humanities PhDs are an absolute ripoff. They require you to dedicate years of your life and tens of thousands of dollars for the attainment of a credential that has incredibly low value, given the abysmal state of the academic job market. I couldn't find a prof job w my phd, so I had to leave academia and now do an office job that I could have done with a b.a.\n\nPart of what enables this exploitative system is the false prestige that the PhD carries, that somehow having the title next to one's name confirms that one is a Real Scholar. The reality is that one can in fact become a great humanities scholar without attending a PhD program. In fact, I'd argue that a great deal of PhD education is actually detrimental to humanities scholarship, as it is often about training students in pursuing extremely specialized, obscurantist lines of inquiry that are largely irrelevant and alienating to the rest of humanity. This is why so many humanities scholars find that absolutely no one cares about their scholarship, aside from maybe 15 specialists.",

So, you will be able to pay some of your tuition fees. \n\nHave you asked your school to provide a full studentship?\n\nIt is worth asking as the UK government has allocated funds for this type of research last year. If you get the full studentship, then you won\u2019t have to worry about the tuition fees. The student loan is your option but it is still a loan. I won\u2019t suggest you do that because a PhD without funding from the school will get less priority from the supervision team than funded PhD students. My supervision team mentioned that to me. But if you enjoy research (like me), then there is nothing that can change your mind. :)",
