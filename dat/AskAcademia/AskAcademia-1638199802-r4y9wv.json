  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI saw an advertised Ph.D. position and the application period is between 25 Nov and 9 Dec. Two days ago, I sent a mail to the professor asking if it is still available and he could provide me information about the project, but he did not return yet. Is this a red flag as in that the professor may not be so professional etc.?  Sorry if this is a really stupid question. I just really liked the subject of the Ph.D. and now I am quite worried.",
