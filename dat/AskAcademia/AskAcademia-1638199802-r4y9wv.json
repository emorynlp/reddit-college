  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI saw an advertised Ph.D. position and the application period is between 25 Nov and 9 Dec. Two days ago, I sent a mail to the professor asking if it is still available and he could provide me information about the project, but he did not return yet. Is this a red flag as in that the professor may not be so professional etc.?  Sorry if this is a really stupid question. I just really liked the subject of the Ph.D. and now I am quite worried.",

      "text": "If the application period hasn\u2019t ended yet, you may assume that the position is still available. In the US, if you apply before the closing date, your application is generally guaranteed to be reviewed and considered before any offer has been made. And because this is the Thanksgiving holiday, you emailed while everyone is away. Chill out. Two days is nothing and calling a two-day delay in responding over a holiday weekend \u201cunprofessional\u201d is both unprofessional and insane.",
