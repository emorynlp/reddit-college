  "text": "I won the best paper award at a conference I attended in September 2019. At the time, I was given a \"temporary\" certificate and was told to wait for details on the prize money and the real certificate. I sent a few emails to the organisers of the conference about other things (a journal submission and details of the proceedings publication) with a question about the award as well. They never responded to my question about the award. Since January, they haven't responded to me at all.\n\n\nSince January, I have emailed the publisher of the proceedings (no reply) and also the secretary for IEEE in the country in which the conference took place (also no reply).\n\n\nAt this point, I just want to know what happened. Was it a fake award? Is there some administrative issue on their end? Has the conference committee completely dissolved? I just want someone to email me back and tell me what happened.\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I just feel like I got scammed and I want an explanation, and also I don't want future attendees to have this happen to them. What should I do?",

My department had to cut me a personal check.  \n\n\nUsually you get some sort of receipt after the conference in an email. If you or your PI got one, check that...because that's where my prize monies were reflected.",
