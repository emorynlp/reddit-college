  "text": "My brother got his undergrad in Sociology and is currently working at a college. Thanks to that he is able to take classes for free and he's going to get his Master's in Mathematics, because mathematical sociology is a field that neither of us knew existed until he looked into it. \n\nHowever this got me thinking. Is there a website or something somewhere that lists potential jobs(even broadly) based on different areas of study? Because he's inspiring me to go get my Master's in Comp.Sci/IT, but my Undergrad was History and the Master's of Education. But I'm not familiar with what potential cross-discipline jobs there might be if any.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know of any website but I\u2019m getting an MS in interdisciplinary studies linguistics/sociology and in my INT courses, they make a good point about the world demanding more than one specialty or area of expertise so it would always benefit you to have different backgrounds and then find ways to connect them all. I say this, because you\u2019ll have an impressive resume and you\u2019re likely to impress potential employers by being able to cross compare your different studies. \n\nI\u2019ll look for a website similar to what you\u2019re asking for and if I find it I\u2019ll reply again to this thread.\n\nTLDR: go for it; more knowledge can only be good for you as the demands of the world are changing and it also can satisfy your multiple interests in the long term instead of being beholden to one discipline.",
