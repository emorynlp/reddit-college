  "text": "I\u2019m about to finish my first semester as an MS student and to be quiet honest this semester has been both overwhelming and underwhelming in the sense that I\u2019ve found it difficult to transition from an undergraduate to a graduate student mindset. Research-wise, all I\u2019ve been doing this semester is reading relevant papers, taking notes, presenting during each lab meeting every week, and so on and it\u2019s just been underwhelming. I know that I shouldn\u2019t expect to start conducting experiments from the get-go considering this is only my first semester, but I feel like there should\u2019ve been more to the research aspect of grad school than just writing lit reviews all semester. \n\nAll of my lab mates are senior PhD students and many of them are about to schedule their defense next semester. Like I mentioned, I\u2019m only a first semester MS student, so ig it makes sense my PI would prioritize their research over my mine and I have no grudges over that. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m putting in hours and hours of effort writing lit reviews, making ppt presentations for each lab meeting, writing down a list of lab equipment I\u2019ll need once I start my experiments, and lab procedures for my first experiments. I\u2019m exceeding her expectations. I have so many ideas and I want those ideas to be realized, but I don\u2019t know how I can do that if my PI and I don\u2019t have a personal conversation for at least 25-30min. I tell her my thoughts and we just have a conversation for 2 minutes and after that, the lab meeting is adjourned. She doesn\u2019t even respond to my emails regarding my proposed research. I don\u2019t know what to do and I feel alone in this. I hope this changes over the course of next semester, but that\u2019s just how I feel right now. It\u2019s like I have developed imposter syndrome. Has anyone else gone through this who can offer some advice? I\u2019m just really lost and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being over dramatic since this is my first semester as a grad student",

Reading a ton of research papers and seeing what the senior PhD students are doing is how you learn enough to have the context to get there. In other words, it sounds like your PI is having you do exactly the right things at this time.",

              "text": "I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. A first-semester MS student isn't qualified to do much of anything, and OP's advisor is busy helping all of OP's lab mates prepare for their defenses (and they are all busy doing so). Once they are done, OP can expect a little more attention. In my experience, the second year is when an MS student starts to become useful. I think pushing for more attention now would be foolish and counter-productive.",

                  "text": "Agree to disagree I guess. \n\nIn my field (genetics/bioinformatics) I would have OP get involved with some basic data collection or analysis (on someone else's project with the premise/design and protocol worked out) and/or encourage them to start reproducing some foundational published work (from a github or package tutorial, or using \"good\" reagents if experimental). I find that gives a lot of the key context for understanding the literature and working on specific project ideas.\n\nIt's also useful for the senior students to have the chance to teach their skills and project someone incoming.",

      "text": "What is your role in the lab? Are you able to talk to the doctoral students about their experiences? Honestly, as a first semester Master's student, a PI isn't going to just hand you all their data and tell you to go wild. It sounds like she doesn't have the time to guide you through it. Although I do think she should respond to your emails, seeing as you're a member of her lab, it is probably not helpful to send her multiple emails about all of your research ideas - I honestly think that is overstepping boundaries and you should try and manage your expectations. If you can, it may help to talk to one of the PhD students or lab staff/lab manager if applicable. They could potentially give you more insight into the situation. Or, ask to meet with the PI specifically to review lab expectations.",

It's time to read, sinthesize work, learn to write and learn to present simple ideas, such as literature reviews. As a first semester MA student you aren't scientifically literature yet-- certainly not thepoint of being able to formulate research problems for somrbody else's lab. That's your PI's job. The fact that you want to do more is great,  but focus on the task at hand. Your time to shine will come an you'll be very well prepared then.",
