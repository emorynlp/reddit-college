  "text": "Hi there, \n\nI am a Ph.D. student in engineering working on building models for cancer signaling pathways. My PI and I are looking for both paid and free oncology databases which have data regarding medication (cancer-related) and outcomes (life span, tumor size shrinkage), etc. \n\nI identified Optum and ICARE 's oncology database and have reached out to them for more information on pricing and more details.  I would really appreciate it if you can share the names of some of the databases your groups might be using and if you have some insights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",
