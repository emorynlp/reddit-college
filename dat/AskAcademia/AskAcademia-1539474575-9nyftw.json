  "title:": "(Ethical Quandary): My PhD adviser has used my solutions extensively in his new textbook without acknowledgement.",
  "text": "I was his TA for a graduate level physics  course that is  well-known for having difficult problem sets.  He asked me to write solutions for what I thought were unusually  long and detailed problems.  The students often came to me complaining that the problems were too hard, to which I could only reply that I agreed.  As it turned out, he converted his notes from that class into a published manuscript.  The problem sets became the \"examples\" used in the text.  He claims in the foreword that what makes this book a noteworthy contribution  is the numerous and detailed examples worked out in each section.  There are about 2 or 3  examples per section (think Griffith's for the physicists reading this), comprising of about 30-40% of the text.  Many examples follow my solutions, and  few follow verbatim.  To be fair to him, the first few chapters are entirely  his language, though the equations and notation are similar to mine.  However, the last two chapters are identical to my solutions, with identical sentences, and only cosmetic modifications or equation references thrown in (I found at least three like this).  I remember that for the last two problem sets he asked for copies of my latex files.  He may have changed a word here or there, but it is easy to see the exposition and  entire paragraph came straight from my work.  \n\nI'm not sure what to do about this.  It is possible that he mentioned to me that he wanted to use this for a book (honestly can't remember) but if I consented it would have been because I thought he was putting them in the back of the book for odd-numbered solutions, as is quite common in our field.  What bothers me  is these examples make up the body of the text and are advertised as what makes the text interesting.  There is enough of his DNA is in the examples that you could argue he is responsible for most of the language  (except towards the end) so I am not trying to claim credit for his work.   I just don't understand why he couldn't have acknowledged me in any way.  Even when he uses his own language, a mathematical derivation is a kind of language that required a lot of work and forethought on my end.  It is much easier to read someone else's derivation than to come up with your own.   I would have been happy with an acknowledgement, not co-authorship as a friend suggested.  A search for my name reveals nothing.  He actually thanks our school's IT guy but not me.  I wonder if our IT guy will put it on his resume.  That's what I would have done.\n\nHow should I respond to this?    I need a good recommendation letter.  I've graduated but I never asked for a letter because I believed our relationship went south.    I've reached out to him in an effort to repair our relationship and that is how I learned about the book.  It... gets a bit thornier.  \n\nHe has been using my efforts to reconnect with him to request free labor, such as to check his math,  send write ups on what he is doing wrong, just like when I was his student, except now I am unemployed and going along simply to get a good letter.  He recently (last week) made a grandiose claim that he solved one of maths outstanding problems in his first year of retirement, and has been leaning on me to check his work.  It was just rejected by a top-tier journal (literally today) and he has requested that I fix his paper, responding to referees report so he can resubmit.  I am beginning to feel used.  I know it is a toxic situation.  I would  love to hear the fastest way out that won't  damage  my career prospects.    Should I go with it just long enough to get the letter and then check out?   It feels like my options are limited.",

      "text": "Go straight to your university's ombudsman's office, and share your concerns WITHOUT offering the name of the offending party, asking for confidential advice on how and whether to proceed, just so you can get an idea of how behind you your university will be - most take this sort of thing very seriously, but you don't want to hang your career out to dry if they have a weak approach to this sort of thing. THEN, if you are comfortable with the level of support you think you'll have, approach your advisor in good faith, simply asking them to credit you, nothing more. No threats, just a good faith request asked in a professional manner, face-to-face, with no hint of threats; if he refuses, or just doesn't do it, you'll know the terrain and can proceed accordingly.\n\nThis can be done after getting the letter, too, if you're worried, but I'm not sure I'd trust a letter from someone you're certain is consciously passing your work off as theirs.",

From there, you can request to have a copy sent somewhere you have a friend, and they can give you a copy. Then you'll at least know what he's saying. Just my 2 cents, but I'd stop giving him power. Ask for the letter now and be done with him.",

I didn't say a word because I didn't want to lose my TA stipend.",
