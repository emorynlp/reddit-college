  "title:": "How do academics keep track of stuff that they read?",
  "text": "TL;DR\n\nI would like to start keeping better track of what I am reading, but I don't know where to start (my go-to methods is notes in the margins).\n\nBasically, I have spent the last 10 years raising kids and am looking forward to beginning some post-grad in the next 12-18months.\n\nWhen I listen to academics speak they always seem to be able to reference past works. However I feel like I forget so much of what I have read. When reading casually I write in the margins, and I really enjoy flicking through books that I have marked. When I read on the kindle I am able to highlight sections that stood out.\n\nHowever, I feel I should be moving towards something more organised, and am hoping for some suggestions. I am currently taking advantage of my partners under-grad degree to access the university library, so a lot of reading via Adobe Digital Editions, but not sure if/how I should take notes.\n\nETA:  Thanks to everyone for the responses. I have spent a solid day reading them all and looking at all the various recommendations (including installing about ten pieces of software).  I now feel much better able to think about the notetaking methods that I like using, and how to turn those into a system that can work for larger scale research/reading. My mind was a little blown by [this note taking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOI4f7yCag), and the whole zettelkasten method, which I had never heard of but it made so much sense to me - particularly as someone embarking on 18months of reading with no idea where I want to focus on when I begin post-grad. Thank you all.",

Other than that, I'll scroll through the list or use the search function to find 'that one article about X I read years ago'. Quite often it's easier that way, and it helps me freshen up my own memory. Also, I come across items that had slipped my mind, so even in that sense it's good to browse your own collection periodically.",

They key is to make sure you don't get into a situation where you have the Zotero software open on two computers simultaneously, and then they start synching on top of each other, and the database could become corrupted.

      "text": "Everyone will tell you to use a program (Zotero, whatever)... but my recommendation (as a professor who's been doing this a long time) is:  don't.   \n\nBrains are tricky things.  They do what they feel they *need* to do, but not more than that.  So, if you start amassing a huge database on your computer (using whatever program), the fact is it your brain won't prioritize remembering it, and it will *stay* on your computer (and not in your brain).\n\nThis is fine for less-important material (the I-covered-my-bases citations for your dissertation, for instance.)  \n\nBut it's not fine for your job interview, or teaching a graduate class.  The only way to remember past work on-the-fly is to use it.  \n\nI found that my retention of important literature as a grad student or a professor made HUGE leaps at the following stages:  \n\n- arguing in graduate seminars (where I had to remember it, or look foolish) \n\n- studying for my Prelims (Quals, Orals, whatever)  (where I had to remember it, or fail) \n\n- teaching my first graduate class (where I had to remember it, or look foolish) \n\nHonestly, I've found that when I just click important bibliography into my database (Endnotes is what I use) without \"using\" it, it is *completely* forgotten within one month.  (I have notes to myself in Endnotes:  \"remember this!  This is crucial!\"... repeated six or seven times..!  One for each time that I've 'rediscovered' it, forgotten, sitting in my database....!)\n\nBizarrely, I've found that even just typing out the entry into my database software manually (rather than drag-dropping like Zotero) increases my chance of remembering it exponentially. \n\nMy grad students who rely heavily on database-bibliography have horrible memories, by the way.  Far worse than I was at the same stage, way back when.  They think I'm brilliant with a phenomenal memory, but the fact is, it's really just practice. \n\nCuriously, the same effect writ large is the difference between true knowledge and internet-knowledge... \"I can always look it up\" (post-internet) has made people (students, academics, everyone) feel smarter (because they feel like they have a lot of information at their fingertips) while actually being more ignorant...  but that's an argument for another day.\n\nEDIT:  by the way, writing notes in the margins (like you do) is one way to increase your retention.  Taking detailed notes on a separate sheet of paper does even better... but slows you down.  (not doing either...?  Forget retention, it's gone a few weeks after you finish the book.)   But if you really want to remember a book or article, write a review of it... a review that you spend a LOT of time on, and which sends you back to the book to find choice quotes, perfect summary of the argument(s), etc.",

Your estimation seems spot-on to me. \n\nI read 'professionally' (about two academic books a week, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 a week), often under deadline pressure (i.e. trying to finish a book in time to get discussion questions out to the grad students on it), so I'm very aware of 'speed'. \n\n- To skim a book, two to four hours.\n \n- To read an average (academic) book thoroughly, two days. \n\n- To read a book while taking detailed marginal notes, 4 days.   (BUT:  if I read it again, a thorough read takes only a single day!!  The notes are incredibly useful for the future.)\n\n- To read a book taking notes on paper or my computer (i.e. really wanting to know it well), about 6 days.  (!!)\n\n- To write on a book for my own purposes, add +1 day to the above. \n\n- To write on a book for publication (i.e. book review), add +2 days to the 6 days of note-taking reading.  \n\n**Retention** is directly and inversely related to the above times.   !\n\nSo, it's all a balance of time vs. necessity... how much am I going to need to know this in the future?  And do I have the time to do it?   How much time have I pissed away on Reddit?  :-) \n\nAcademic study is awesome, by the way.  I had a grad student in her 50s come work with me (after a hugely-successful previous career), and not only was she a stellar student, but she loved it so much more than her earlier career...!",

But I realised I can keep going until I die if I am enjoying what I am doing (my pre-children career was teaching).\n\nYour estimates about reading books reminds me of a conversation I had, years ago, with a more serious online bookclub. We were working through classic literature with several members who had attended a literary university (in the US), in which they had to read several books per week. I think I was watching \"Gilmore Girls\" at the time and watching a 15yo burn through novels at an incredible rate.\n\nI was always pushing the question about how much we actually retained (Rory Gilmore's memory was insanely unachievable). I can listen to Anna Karenina on my audiobook in 30hrs, but to really read it required a lot longer. So often I felt that no one would discuss how long we spend reading a book, and how that affects what we understand of it. Again, thank you.",

It's a Swiss software which is more oriented towards information management than library management. I haven't used Mendeley, but I guess both are similar in a lot of aspects. \n\nIn Citavi, you make projects, similar to collections in Zotero. You have the option to add articles directly from the web in one click, add notes, tags, keywords, abstracts, etc. But the best thing about Citavi, on top of it being a library for your articles, is:\n\n1. You can read and annotate, with varying levels of importance, within Citavi. It has a section called Knowledge Items, where all your annotations are listed. This helps you write a skeleton thesis by just adding the relevant information. And all the annotations appear in one place, and one click takes you to the relevant location in the paper. This helps you draw connections across articles and consolidate your information.\n2. You have a Tasks section, where you can make a to-do list, be it reading an article or discussing it, or writing. And you can set the progress of each task as well. This helps when you're working with a team, and can know who is where with their tasks, and hence optimize workflow and output.\n\nIt's a freemium software, with the free version providing all features as paid, but limits the number of articles you can add on a project. Definitely worth checking out. The only downside is that it only works on Windows.",

Sometimes, there are papers that are not necessarily relevant but they give you motivation or some background information. The most important columns are results, methods, and your comments on the papers. They make you think and help you recall why you are interested in reading these papers, what the takeaways are.\n\nYou can also add other columns that suit your needs easily.",

I am currently pursuing a literature review which is writing a research paper based on the accumulation of other research papers. What we do is first we go on relevant databases then try to use key words to find a relevant set of papers (maybe a hundred or two), and export to Zotero. \n\nAfterward, we go through and read the abstracts and mark them as whether they are relevant or not. We then cross check with each other to ensure that everything is related. Generally we try and narrow it down to around 20- 30 papers per database. Afterward, we export that to an excel sheet, and summarize the papers, while filtering out and ones that appeared to be relevant through the abstract, but aren't. By now, it's ideal to have roughly 30 papers in total.\n\nNext, we go through again and code all of the papers for key terms for us to reference while writing the paper. Since this is my first literature review, I have not gotten to the next steps yet, but the main point that I am trying to get at is that by the time we are done (even to where I am now), we have a pretty good sense of what paper is related to what content. Of course, when I am trying to reference a paper, I'll still look it up on the spreadsheet for the exact name, but it doesn't take too long.\n\ntl;dr, we read the papers over and over until it's familiarized and use zotero / excel to keep a list for reference.",

I have tried others but this one just clicked with my brain.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from all of my studies (less than 15 days left before I submit my final dissertation) was to just continously write, ask yourself questions, reread what you've written, write about the process of reading and synthesising your data. Being reflexive about your practice is important, ask yourself what worked what didn't, etc etc.",
