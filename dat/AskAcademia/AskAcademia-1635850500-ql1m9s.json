      "text": "The qualification you get at the end will be different too, at least in the UK. A 9 month programme without a dissertation will give you a PG Diploma, and a 12 month one with a dissertation will give you a Masters (MSc). Which one is right for you is really up to you. Do you want/need the full masters, or would you be satisfied with the PG Dip? Do you need a particular qualification for the career you're interested in? Things to ask yourself.",

      "text": "It depends on why you are doing this, if this is just a professional qualification or even just a box ticking exercise to get a promotion or a pay rise then he shorter one makes sense but if you're wanting an academic research qualification either for a future PhD or a research career then you need to do the dissertation",
