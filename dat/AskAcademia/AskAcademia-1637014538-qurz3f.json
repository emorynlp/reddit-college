  "text": "Hey everyone! So I have a module with the title \"Philosophy and Crucial Issues in Asian Communities\". One of the requirements is to do research on 3 asian countries which I already finished doing. (Namely Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). The research includes the impact of politics, religion, culture etc. on education. The second requirement is to make a position paper on Asian education. However, on my position paper I am required to put the results of my research on the 3 countries. I already picked out a position which is \"The positive effect of video games on education.\" However, I am not sure how I am supposed to show my previous research in my position paper. How can I go about including things about politics, religion, economics, etc. in my position paper? Even if I changed my position, I would find it hard to include those different topics in my paper. Am I going about this the wrong way? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks again!",
