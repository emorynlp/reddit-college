  "title:": "What to expect during 30 minute TT interview?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been given an interview for a tenure track position at medium sized, public university. It is for a faculty position in their college of education. \n\nThe interview is scheduled for 30 minutes. The few other TT interviews I\u2019ve gone to have been all day affairs. I assume this is a screening process. \n\nWhat should I expect for this type of interview? Just an overview of who I am and such?",

      "text": "It\u2019s just a screener. Public schools usually have some weird state- or school-mandated standardized questions to \u2018make the interview fair.\u2019\n\nThey\u2019ll probably ask you about your research agenda, teaching experience, expertise with grants, experience with collaboration, etc.\n\nThen you have a few minutes to ask them about the position or the campus. \n\nDon\u2019t stress, 10+ candidates (for one position) undergo these interviews, so you aren\u2019t a finalist yet.",

If there are people who do similar work as you, read some of their papers. Have an articulated plan for your future research (grants and papers mainly). Be yourself and personable. New PhD grads don\u2019t often factor in how important \u201cfit\u201d is for these hires. No one wants to work with a pompous ass (regardless of their h-index) for 30 years. Good luck!",
