  "text": "Hey all. I hope you're all doing well. I didnt really know who to turn to so I thought I'd share my experience in the last few months since September. I'm in the UK and I've achieved a first in my undergrad(biomed) and got a merit in my MSc(cancer). I've applied for about 8 PhD positions but I haven't even gotten through the first screening process even once. Because of current circumstances I havent been able to get feedback. I feel really lost and confused and I dont know who to turn to or what to do next, the PhDs out there currently aren't in my field and I just spend my time checking my emails hoping for something that isn't there. How many tries did it take for you guys? Should I be doing something else? I didnt really know how to word this or put this but I hope there's some people out there in my position. A few of my friends got into PhD positions in the first month and its really crushing.",

      "text": "Get someone you know who is familiar with PhD recruitment to look over your materials. If you've been through 8 applications, with that academic record, without getting a single interview it suggests there *may be* something problematic in your application documents.\n\nSome obvious ones to check for:\n\n1. Make sure your CV is short concise, and allows your application to get through the first filter. The purpose of the CV is simply to tick off checkbox items like has a degree, has some relevant experience, etc. No one is expecting a graduate to have an exciting CV, but make sure it is at least simple and clear. Don't add fluff items on there which are not relevant. This is not a random job on a recruitment site. Maybe highlight a few key specialist or transferrable skills or responsibilities that relate to previous activities, but don't go mad. There is little reason for most PhD application CVs to run over 1 page.\n\n2. Coverletter. Keep it specific and to the point. You should address - in order - any requirements of the project and how you fit them. More specifically for a PhD what you want to do is highlight why *you specifically* are a great fit for *this specific* project. What directly relevant experience or interest do you have? Why are you a shoe-in for it? Also, don't include one of those vague gushy intro paragraphs that UCAS tutors train you to include. You are not Indiana Jones adventuring through life, this is not the Temple of Doom, you are not saving the world.\n\n3. Contact the PI. Make sure you make contact before the application submission with the people listed on the advert. Ask them if there are any specific skills or experience they are looking for? even if there aren't by starting that communication process you can tap into any help or guidance they might want to offer.\n\n4. Don't try and flatter the PI into accepting. We don't need to know what you think of our work - we want to know what you are capable of, and that you are someone who could hit the ground running and deliver a project. We want to know that you have thought through the process of doing a PhD. We don't want to hear that you've dreamt of this since you were a child - we want to know that you here right now have thought through the reality, and are keen to work on this specific project.",

After reading your post I have realised I have been trying to impress many of the project supervisors with things I did/achieved rather than showing why I belong in the chosen programme. My cover letters at times were also vague and I admit I delved into my own research a bit too much without addressing the skills they really wanted to see. You've really lifted me up and I realise now there are many things I need to change with my application technique. Thank you for help and support, I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to help me.",

Also, I recommend academic twitter, people will probably offer to read your materials and tell you what they think is wrong with them.",

I wouldn't underestimate those two, just maybe focus more on being a good fit for the job rather than flattering and being over emotional.",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation as you some years back. I applied to 15 programmes (all different universities). I got rejected from all but one that took me in for an interview. \n\nI went for that interview and a week later.... I got rejected.\n\nI told myself I would wait for the next application cycle and decided to put in some serious efforts into finding a job so I won't remain unemployed/homeless while feeling the loss from the rejections. Long story short, I re-applied a few years later (yeah, skipped some application cycles to sort out my life as a young grad) and managed to land a PhD position not too long ago where I am now. I was fortunate that my old profs still remembered me enough to write me LORs, the same profs who wrote me the ones that got me rejected lol.\n\nMy point is, it's not the end of the world. Take some time to grief, which is normal and important, but take some time to plan out your next steps. Your route doesn't have to be the same as mine.  You could volunteer in a lab or work as an RA to boost your CV a little more and continue being in an academic environment and build connections. Or you could take this time to pursue something else. \n\nThis leads me to the second point of not giving up. I understand that it sucks that all your friends got into programmes except you, cause I have been there myself. It's completely alright to feel sad but at the same time, you're strong enough to not let it consume you. Start by thinking about what you want. Is it to re-apply during the next cycle? Do you have a particular school in mind? etc. Yes, it sucks being a year later than your peers but it doesn't make you any less of a person than them. I'm sure they wouldn't think that way about you either. Take some time to think about how you can use the next 6 months to bolster your application for the next cycle. There's a lot that can be accomplished during that time. Don't forget why you're doing what you're doing, and don't give up.",

You're right and im really grateful that you took time to write this. It's easy to feel down and disheartened but after reading your post I feel motivated, I'm going to take active steps to improve my application technique and try and do some RA and volunteering work if I can find any. There are a few industry positions that I've been unsure about and I think I'll just apply to those too. Again, I cant thank you and everyone on here enough for sharing their own paths and offering words of encouragement and advice. This is what im set on doing and in due time perhaps I can get something. I hope you'll continue to thrive.",

      "text": "You've gotten some good advice that I want to amplify from the other side of the desk. I don't know if this is true for you, but just in case... The single largest factor that will get someone to look at your application is **specificity**.\n\nI get tens of inquiries a week for post-doc and PhD student positions. 98% of them are generic, lack awareness of the basics of our institution (e.g. I'm in the US, and we have a unified PhD program administered by the school; individual labs don't hire students), AND DON'T TELL ME WHY THIS PERSON WANTS TO DO RESEARCH, MUCH LESS DO IT WITH ME.\n\nI'm not conceited, I'm just busy. I simply don't have time to respond to low-effort \"applications\" like that. It is, to be very frank, not my problem.\n\nSo, my advice: target individual PIs. Read some of their work. Make it clear you've read it, and even ask a question. Tell them your scientific interests. Be genuine: I've lost count of the number of people whose life's dream is to work with me on a specific project listed on my lab website. Tell them how you see your skill set fitting into general field and ask if this might be a fruitful partnership between you.  Do a little institutional homework so you appear informed (\"I know Smithingham University runs a school-wide program, but before I apply I'd like to know if you are taking students and if you'd consider someone with my qualifications for your lab\").\n\nPique their interest. PIs are always (OK, often) looking for bright young people to train and mentor and set off on fruitful careers, but you need to rise above the spam. \n\nThis guide from [the ASBMB](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/careers/091713/writing-cover-letter-for-postdoctoral-application) on good cover letters will help too. Good luck - and keep going!",

In my third year of undergraduate I applied for several PhDs and managed to get 3 interviews (2 unsuccessful and 1 I rejected as I wasn't that keen on the project) however now I'm a masters student I've applied for around 8-10 and haven't even secured an interview on any of them so far. It seems to be super tough competition this year. \n\nFrom speaking with others and looking online I've realized I was treating my applications too much like job applications; talking about general skills and work experience that's not necessarily relevant. I'm now focusing on lab-based skills and how I could apply this to the specific project. My supervisor also told me to always extensively read the literature, so in my statements I'm including papers I've read and topics I would be enthusiastic to research. \n\nI feel the same, I feel so guilty that my supervisors have had to constantly provide references for me I'm a little shy to ask them to read my CV/ cover letters, but I think now it's my only option! I really wish you success and fingers crossed I will secure at least an interview soon.",

One is to apply for advertised PhD positions (which sounds like what you\u2019ve been doing), and the other is to submit your own research proposal to various scholarships. The latter takes more work as you have to approach potential supervisors you\u2019re interested in and work with them to write an application. However, since they will be supporting you in writing a strong application and probably have previous experience doing this, you might be more successful. Regardless of how you apply, I\u2019d strongly recommend approaching academics you\u2019d like to work with. They could really help with pointing you in the right direction and even supporting your application.",

Another thing to consider is your application material should be tailored a little bit for each project you apply for.  \n\n\nAs others have mentioned, it's not the end of the world and likely things will work out for the best when you finally get into a school of your choice. I would also suggest applying to other places apart from the UK if you are not already doing so.\n\nConsider places that have a strong biomed research industry like Sweden and Denmark. Just from the overview of searching for PhD projects, I know Denmark has a lot of opportunities many tied with leading pharma companies like Novo Nordisk and Novozymes. While I am not sure what kind of project you are looking for exactly, I hope looking into Danish and Swedish universities will help.

              "text": "For networking, I would email researchers or their Ph.D. students (more likely to get a response) directly, indicating a paper/topic you want to talk to them about. \n\nIn general, you should not feel bad about \"wasting\" researcher's time. To be in academia usually means you are passionate about a topic, love discussing research, and want to foster the next generation of researchers. From talking to many prominent professors, they never really get \"annoyed\" at student emails, they only feel bad that they cannot respond to everyone. So they actually like students who follow-up a lot because it shows the student's passion and persistence in the face of lack of results, which are great attributes to have as a graduate student. \n\nAgain, if you don't get a response it doesn't mean they think negatively of you or you aren't \"worthy\" of their time. It is overwhelmingly the case that they are just too busy. You shouldn't take it personally at all, and continue to follow-up a few times until you get lucky at the top of their inbox or catch them on a less busy day. \n\nTry to make your emails short, to the point, and not about yourself and proving how worthy you are, but about some action item that they can quickly address.",

Most PhDs I know either got onto the course with a supervisor they had at BSc or \nMSc etc. Other people I know worked as a research assistant for a while and then maybe the following year got a PhD with the academic who was employing them.  During these hard times I'd say be flexible. Research budgets have been cut in the UK this year (not sure about elsewhere). Some great research experience in a covid testing lab etc might line you up perfectly for a PhD in the future and get you well paid in the meantime. Goodluck with your applications for sure but don't put all your eggs in one basket. A lot of it can come down to chance and there are a good few industrial research / applied opportunities now due to the demand.",

If you are struggling or have any questions regarding who to contact, find the PGR admissions tutor and ask them. \n\n(2) your materials should address the 3Ps: person, place,  project.  Essentially you need to address why it needs to be you (what you bring & how you could contribute), why it needs to be the place (often neglected... why this institution/lab), and why this project (research proposal,  addressing the studentship requirements,  etc etc). \n\n(3) remember, everyone is impressive.  Everyone has degrees. You need to show why you would be more successful and a better fit. Make it less of a \"pick e! pick me!\" exercise and more of a \"here's why I'm your best option\"",

      "text": "Hey have you done any research or been involved in relevant societies at uni? Many places love to see you have gone beyond course requirements and have been motivated enough to do research over the summer vacations. I applied for PhDs last year- quite a few, but I stupidly only applied to the top Unis in the uk/the states except for one. I did get that PhD offer, but chose to take another msc program and have reapplied. I now have 7 PhD offers (one rejection). What really really helped was having done some research the previous year, and I had a minor paper being reviewed for submission to a journal. I stress it was minor. No one expects groundbreaking work at this stage, but they love to see evidence of  motivation and passion. Also, I only coauthored that paper so you don't have to do anything solo, just get your name on a publication from a lab. In my interviews, we spent some time discussing my paper so it can also be a great aid in case- like me- you freeze up on interviews. Just know your paper inside out. \n\nI also took part in a reading group and gave a talk (im in a theoretical field so it won't exactly be the same in your case) but look around for seminars. The advantage of things being online is that it should be no problem for you to participate in a zoom seminar at some uni if you ask. You won't be giving a talk at this stage, but you might find people you could ask to work in a lab with. It's also great to just put on your PS that you attended seminar x at place y each week.\n\nFinally, networking is a big thing. You don't have to have a good network yet, but do try to work with people who are reasonably well known in your field over the next few months. That connection can help massively.\n\nGood luck!",

That might be more important since you've said that the open positions aren't in your field. \n\nI'm wondering though, are you applying just because you want to have a PhD or are you interested in the positions you're applying to? \n\nIf your previous work is far outside of the fields you're applying to they may have reservations about your interest in the specific topic you'd be researching so you would need to explain clearly why its interesting and how your previous experience has prepared you to investigate it.",

I've realised by your reply and many other comments on here that its highly beneficial to seek out PI's, I believe this is something I'll need to start doing to land those interviews. I'll be honest with you, I decided very late that I wanted to do a PhD, it was actually during my masters thesis that I found out I really enjoyed research and felt like I was contributing with my own research. My field is mainly treating cancer using immunotherapy  and I suspect those are quite competitive. During my undergraduate degree I did do viral replication work during my thesis so I might consider that field too. Thank you for your advice, I really appreciate it.",

Then how I see it is it is a way for schools to pick privilege students. Why? because privilege students will tend to get into good schools for undergrad (relatively much easier than the unprivileged)  and then they just get into a lab, hook up with the professor, publish some papers with most of the job done by advisor or others. Using that get into another great PhD program.  \n\nLike considering how hard publishing 'should be', I don't just buy a fairly good undergrad will able to publish something while doing class and other stuff. People spend 60+ hours on their research to publish one thing in a year.",

I have a co-first and a second author paper that I did the majority of the writing on and a book chapter, same deal, and I just got a \"you are an extremely strong candidate but we could only hire one person\" rejection, which is the closest I've come so far. I have classmates who published their master's work (often in the context of the organization they did their work in) and are now doing PhDs. It was not uncommon in my undergrad STEM program for the better students to publish first-authored papers where they did the majority of the work and the supervisor guided them through the writing process and ensured quality (conference presentations were more common, though). Those papers often got finished up after graduation. Some of those students are now professors.\n\nIs it *fair,* when PhDs are supposed to be training? No. But publishing earlier is becoming more and more common, especially in STEM, and publishing on the side IS a way to make one's application more competitive. \n\nFWIW, all my publishing has been unfunded and in my spare time from my unrelated day job - and yes, I've tracked the hours I put in and it is indeed a huge time commitment. Which is a privilege, I suppose, in the sense that I *can* do that instead of getting a second job, although I sacrifice other things to get it done and have absolutely taken unpaid \"vacation\" time to work on research. But I can say that my post-publication rejection was much, much more encouraging than either of my pre-publication rejections (one of which led to a collaboration that resulted in a paper).",

But still, I really wanted to do PhD as I like my field: protein biology in health and disease states. So I started to read about admission, rejections to understand my gaps in this process. I found this article:[https://thedarwinsmonkey.medium.com/reasons-phd-applicants-get-rejected-685eef494192](https://thedarwinsmonkey.medium.com/reasons-phd-applicants-get-rejected-685eef494192) . They recommend applying for more than 10 programs and which uni-s to choose from. It was useful for me, so I did it and I got in!!! Don't give up! Good luck!!!",
