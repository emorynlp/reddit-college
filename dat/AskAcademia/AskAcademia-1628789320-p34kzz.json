  "text": "I'm an incoming BME PhD student. I have a Master's where I did some cell culture based research, and some industry experience using molecular biology and microbiology. I'm pretty confident that my PI and my labmates are wonderful people, and I'll be living in low to medium cost of living city so I'm not worried about finances (yet). However, I'll be doing my PhD in a slightly new field ('new' as in one I haven't explored extensively before), so I'm a little nervous that I won't be as 'ahead' as I thought I would be. I want to be as prepared as I can be, if that's even possible! \n\nWhat were the biggest challenges you faced while starting out (and during your PhD) and how did you deal with them? How do I hit the ground running, so to speak? I'd appreciate any tips y'all have!!",
