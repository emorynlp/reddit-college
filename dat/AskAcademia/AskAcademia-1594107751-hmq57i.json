  "text": "I know it sounds a rhetorical question. But as a TA, I have noticed that students in my institution often have a very difficult time with correct citation style. My class follows APA. Somehow, even with widely available internet sources (and even citation generators) many still do not seem to get it. Sometimes I wonder if a universally accepted, standardized citation style, across disciplines would make more sense. \n\nPerhaps this is more of a rant out of frustration. But I figured I would extend this question to the crowd to see what others think.",

      "text": "I think it makes sense that for example philosophy and mathematics or physics follow different citation styles. In philosophy, one often addresses arguments of the author so naming them via something like Harvard citation style makes sense. On the other hand, in mathematics and physics papers references are often made to results only and a lot of papers often have a lot more authors than in other fields, making numbered referencing more useful as we otherwise would cite a whole slew of names even if we used et al. (e.g. \"previous experiments \\[1,2,3,4,5\\] have shown...\" would be atrocious with names). I don't see any way to devise something standardised that fits both of these needs.",

It is something that has never really come up. I have always just used the citation style expected. I have noticed that many of the students in the class I TA just cannot seem to \"get\" APA citation. It seems that many are simply confused due to the different styles used in other classes. But your answer clears it up very well for me. Thank you.",

They think \"eh, what does it matter?\"\n\n I find it very frustrating as a student that some professors want APA, some MLA, some Chicago and some don't gaf. And here I'm only talking about within my department, not even across multiple disciplines. As an undergrad, I often had multiple papers due all at the same time, with a combination of citation styles requested. \n\n\nI had a professor once who took off points for every citation mistake. That made me triple check my citations. But it also made me think *WHY*. As long as the information is all there at the end, and you can find my original source, does it *really* matter if I accidentally put a period instead of a comma somewhere?",

They think \"eh, what does it matter?\"\n\nI think it's incumbent on faculty to *teach* students why it matters. My department starts with first-year students and explains why our discipline uses a specific format (Chicago) while we're teaching it. Sure, they have to learn APA in psych and MLA in English, etc. but when they are in our classes they are learning the conventions of *our* discipline, reading articles in *our* journals, raiding bibliographies in *our* monographs, etc. So part of doing the disciplinary work includes learning the citation conventions of the discipline.\n\nMany still don't care, so we assign points to citations to up the stakes. We also teach them how to cite and how to use tools like Refworks and Endnote and Zotero. It's all so damned *easy* now there's no excuse to do it in a half-assed manner, but quite a few students still want to use some made-up format they invented in high school.",

It seems rather burdensome and germane. Most professors and TAs do not care all that much. However, you do occasionally encounter one who does, and I think this tends to scare students a little bit. \n\nPersonally I just dock a few marks out of 100, and point them towards a citation generator for future work. But I often think that it would just be easier to just amalgamate APA, MLA and Chicago to just put this minor issue to bed.",

      "text": "Different citation styles emphasize different information, which is important, as different information is important in different disciplines.  (for instance, some styles emphasize Authors, others the Year, others Publishers... depends on what's most important.)   So the differences can be useful. \n\nBut here's a different thought:\n\nit's a test.  And a VERY important one for students to master. \n\nThere are two reasons that students DON'T use the right style:  laziness, and lateness.   \n\nWaaaay back when, when I was in college, I hated trying to suss out and use the \"correct\" style, because I was always skating close to the deadline... and in those rare moments when I *wasn't*,  I still felt like it was a \"waste of (my important) time.\"   My students today have the same problem. \n\nBut here's the thing:  there are a LOT of incredibly important things in life that have to be done PRECISELY, in the correct format. \n\nNot just your 1040 Form 6251-AMT... but also any scholarship or grant application, most serious job applications, paperwork for your Residency Permit, etc. etc. \n\nIn high school, and in many college classes, students are cut a lot of slack.  (\"She's a smart kid;  this is a good paper;  yes, the citations are wrong, but the paper has great ideas--I'll still give it an A.\") \n\nBut then, a decade later, they find themselves applying for something really important--a major Federal grant, for example, or for naturalized citizenship.  And very suddenly, with the stakes incredibly high, formatting perfection is make-or-break:   if you make ONE mistake, and you're done.  \n\nStudents who have been cut a lot of slack can't make this adjustment. \n\nActually, I think one of the real determinants for whether a smart undergrad gets into a grad program or not is exactly this minutia--attention to detail.  (I say this as a former grad director, who's read a lot of application files.)\n\nSo, yes:  students don't \"get\" citation styles.  (and really--how important *is* the correct style, in the cosmic scheme of things...???)\n But if they are forced to do it anyway--forced to look up the appropriate style, interpret it, apply it perfectly--then this will prepare them for a whole range of really important application-processes.   But *only* if they are forced to do it, and held to it. \n\nOne underappreciated reason, I would argue, that students with college degrees do so much better, career-wise, is that some of the 'administrative bullshit' of college--applying correct citation styles, running afoul of add/drop dates, pleading your piteous case to a hard-nosed professor, dealing with a difficult roommate, finding someone to explain a problem-set you just don't *understand*--prepares you for the \"real world.\"  Prepares you for *life itself.*  In a way that high school never could. \n\nTLDR:  it's for their own good.",

(academics themselves cannot agree on which style would be \"best\"...  just like bureaucracies themselves can never agree on which system would be \"best\".  We're all part of the same, messy, human experiment.) \n\nOn another level:  citing is NOT trivial these days.  (!)\n\nFirst, I've used Endnotes for 15 years... but I have learned (the hard way) it's best to cut-and-paste formatted citations than to rely on these programs to autoformat, because autoformat inherently fuck things up.  \n\nSecondly, as a mentor/teacher of grad students:   you can see instantly whether the student-author has done a \"zotero-dump\" (i.e. just schlocked in a bunch of cites they just pulled from the web), or actually are mindfully citing significant, important sources.  I recognize that's not what you were suggesting... but I think it's important that grads realize that in many disciplines, the footnotes are at *least* as important as the text. (!)  Hand-formatting (i've found, in a successful publishing career) is actually a *good* thing, in that it forces you to focus on what you're actually putting in your footnotes... which people (experts) pay attention to. \n\n... which was my larger point. \n\nThere is no \"short cut\", no \"easy fix\" for the vast majority of detail-oriented work.  You can't script it, you can't farm it out.   Ultimately you just gotta *do* it.  Or not do it, and then not make progress in your career/life. \n\nTHAT's the important lesson, I think:\n\n There are, in the end, no shortcuts.  (this is an especially important lesson for Americans, I think, who have been nursed on stories of shortcuts to success--from Barnum to Zuckerberg--which are largely bullshit.) \n\nTo paraphrase Yoda:\n\n\"Do.  Or not Do.  There is no 'But The *Ideas* Were Good'.\"",

So they hear: learn MLA. Now learn something else. And repeat. On top of that, many students know or Intuit that they\u2019ll rarely use those styles once they graduate.\n\nIf we want students to learn to use citation styles, we have to do more in our curricula than teach rules or reference pages in dense style books. Many faculty and TAs can take for granted that they\u2019re already practiced readers and writers in a discipline, and we cannot expect that same degree of competence from writers new to a field who are frequently under-read in a discipline.\n\nTl;dr: if we want students to be more accurate and precise in their citations, we have to get them to value the reasons why we cite and show them how we and our colleagues do it.",

They're never going to have to put something into proper citation format again, and it's the equivalent of high school students complaining about why they have to learn matrices in algebra.  In other words, I learned to just stop caring if they got it.  I know I've got it right for me, I'll grade them accordingly because that's part of the class, but I'll only care if they learn it if they show they want to.  Otherwise, let them go be accountants or middle managers, and hopefully you've at least imparted the more important knowledge of the subject and its relevance to them.",
