  "title:": "I feel absolutely mortified after being denied an extension for an assignment.",
  "text": "I accept that my excuse was probably not a valid one compared to the reasons of some students asking for an assignment, yet I still feel so stupid and am cringing at being such an idiot for even thinking they might consider. I told the truth for why I felt like I needed it, I'm exhausted and stressed and the workload for the semester is massive and also the dates are in a tight time frame, which makes it hard to commit to one and the other. The valid reasons for getting an extension have to be illness or bereavement, something like that, but with a doctor's note, none of which I had, which they said would give me an unfair advantage over other students. I was close to bursting into tears when I saw the email, my head is fried and I'm a fucking idiot for even considering asking them when I had no valid reason in the first place. Also because they probably think I was bullshitting when I said that I have the majority of the work done, and that this was not an excuse for leaving it to the last minute. I'm afraid to show my face again now to the professor.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I had to get it off my chest.",

Use the counseling resources at your school.  Group therapy with other students may help see that your situation is more common than you think.  Get a checkup to make sure you're in good health (check vitamin D levels), exercise to improve your mood, drink less caffeine so you can relax, avoid using unprescribed drugs.\n\nI would suggest reducing your course load or taking off a semester altogether.  Spend the extra time doing something relaxing that you love.",

I hate being the bad cop)\n\nTry to take their response at face value without reading into it.\n\nYou're not an idiot for asking, you're actually thoroughly exploring the resources available to you. Lots of profs have policies where they grant extensions to anyone who asks, but they don't advertise this, so only the people who ask get a chance to have the extension. (this isn't actually a *fair* policy, but I know many that have it)\n\nReally, if your prof even remembers that you asked for this, they're more likely to understand the issue if your submitted assignment is not great quality. And that can only help you when they're grading it.",

For me I almost always grant and extension when students are overwhelmed with work. I make sure they know though that they need to avoid letting it get them behind on other work and to finish this ASAP and then move on to their other work. \n\nIt is just my view that every student's experience is different. Some work full time, have families, take many classes, do extracurriculars, and etc. There's always the chance you're professor will think the same. If not then at least your found out ahead of time and know you need to finish that assignment by the deadline. \n\nIf you're worried you can always reply back and thank them for their consideration.",

My point is that OP made human mistakes, and professors, or us on the internet, don't have a direct peephole into this person's life. As a TA, I consider it hardly going out of my way to just afford basic levels of sympathy to my students. Maybe at the end of the day I can't offer an extension a student wants, but again that's not the student's fault, which is what I was trying to get across in my comment. I just have expectations on my end that can't accommodate those exceptions. I'm literally just telling OP not to take it personally.",
