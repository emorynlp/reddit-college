  "text": "I am so hurt right now. I put blood in my application and I really felt like I had a good chance to get in. \n\nI sent everything in 15 days before the deadline, confirmed my referees availability to provide a reference, sent them a draft when asked and offered a reminder before the deadline.\n\nYet, one of the two informed me that he never received the link or the form -- a hour after the official deadline.\n\nI panicked and immediately contacted admissions,  sent them the reference he forwarded me (without reading it) and gave him the contact so that he can reach out and explain the issue.\n\nHe didn't answer yet, but man, I feel awful. I am afraid my chances are gone and getting paranoid about the other reference as well --- I haven't heard from my other referee after he confirmed his availability and assumed that everything was going fine, but now I am second-guessing everything.\n\nWhat else can I do? Any tip?",

I think 2/3 of my recommenders turned my letters in after the application deadline and I didn't have a problem. I know people whose recommenders didn't turn them in until a month after the deadline and they still got into their top choices.\n\nThis is going to be highly dependent on your field, what you're applying to, and the schools. But, IME they will accept them after the deadline, they just don't explicitly say that. However, you will need to have all of your recommenders' information in before the deadline. Best of luck.\n\nUnless they have a hard deadline for letters of recommendation posted, they usually just will not review your application until everything is received.\n\nedit: Just as a tip, you usually have to be pretty on top of your recommenders if they're pretty busy people. Don't be too pushy or rude in any way, but I had to double email, show up in person, etc. to make sure they were in.",

However, having served on a departmental admissions committee, and multiple other committees that rely on referees, we've never looked at a missing letter as a reflection on the applicant.  Most applications have the names of the references attached, and our first assumption is that the letter is late.  Our second assumption is that the letter got lost in the paperwork.  If we don't see the letter, and everything else looks good, then we'll just contact the reference (usually by phone) and ask him/her to send a letter as soon as possible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only time I've ever seen applications with missing reference letters rejected were for other reasons, and no reference letter - no matter how glowing - would help.

It takes me at least one hour to write a new reference.  That's the time that I am not working on research, teaching, or service that more measurably affects tenure, promotion, or ease of finding a future position.  At best, it adds to the counter on one line on my CV under the \"Service to the University\", which already has plenty and, as a whole, is valued way, way less than an extra publication or a better teaching evaluation.\n\nI still do it, though.  Because I like my students, and I want them to succeed--that's why I am in this business in the first place.  In my experience, most professors are this way.\n\nThat's why anything that a student can do to make the recommendation writing easier for the recommender benefits both parties.  Give the recommender a copy of your personal statement and your transcripts.  Include samples of your best work from the classes you took with that professor, to refresh their memory.  Send a few polite reminders, spaced weeks before the deadline.\n\nSend a notice of when they should expect an invitation to submit a recommendation, and check if they got it.  This past year, for example, our IT changed something in the email spam filter, and one such invitation to me got sucked into it.",
