  "text": "Hi, I was watching one online conference yesterday, and my supervisor made a presentation about the research I was working on. I was not invited in the presentation, nor any other verbal mention of me was present. No one said a word about this presentation... More interesting there were used photos I made during the research (without any credit), and even photo of me working on it! Another interesting thing was that one colleague called me, that the very same supervisor added her as an coauthor to another presentation, without her knowledge. She found out when she watched the conference...\n\nIs this normal? If it is not, what should I do?",

If she refuses, then you can take it to the ethical committee.",

I don't think of talks as a formal \"author list\" and more of just an acknowledgment of people who have contributed in some way to the work.\n\nI would genuinely love to be corrected if I am off base.

A lot of PI's create presentations of the groups work not necessarily their work and if it's a short form presentation there isn't time to go through a laundry list of credits to various group members. If you were the main person working on the research though, it is common to say that up front, some thing like \"Most of the work for this was done by my student _____\", and they should have.\nPresentations aren't like papers where they are cited and re used etc... so a authorship isn't as formal.

A lot of times supervisors put together presentations quickly and view any of their supervisees work as free game to use/reuse without explicit permission. It's like how a company views any works created by its employees as belonging to them. The lack of crediting it to you also was probably just innocuous as PIs present work all the time and often don't think about crediting every figure they have *especially* if it's from someone they directly advise. Certainly they should credit everything but a lot gets lost especially when presentations are made in haste.\n\nImo, this is completely normal behavior.",
