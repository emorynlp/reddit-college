  "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nI emailed the head of an interesting lab where id love to do an internship for a couple of moths. I am on master's level - so no PhD yet. \n\nThe head answered me and invited me to a short discussion on Zoom. \n\nSo I am not sure if it will be more like a job interview or more like a chat to get to know more about opportunities at the lab and so on. Of course I believe this is highly depended of the charakter of the PI. \n\nAnyways, does anybody have any advice for me? Perhaps someone was in the same position?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you! :-)",

      "text": "I would imagine that if they are willing to have a meeting they are feeling you out to see if you\u2019d fit with their group. The fact that you reached out, showing some interest in the lab, is a huge step imho. \n\nBe sure to have a grasp on what they are doing, why you are interested, how the experience would benefit your growth as a researcher, and possibly how your personal research ideas/interests can be explored as an extension of their lab.",
