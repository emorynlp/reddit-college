  "title:": "How much is a typical PhD stipend in Canada?",
  "text": "I'm from the UK where a PhD stipend is minimum \u00a315,609 ($27,215 CAD) per year. I've seen what seems to be the perfect PhD for me, but the stipend is advertised as $21,000 CAD (\u00a312,044). This seems really low to me.! Is this normal/liveable in Canada, or am I right in thinking it's quite low?",

      "text": "Depends on the field but for life science 21k is unfortunately quite normal. It is \"livable\" but certainly not comfortable, and is well below the poverty line for most cities. In Toronto or Vancouver I'm honestly not sure how they do it, Montreal where I live is a bit cheaper but you still have to make sacrifices (living in run down apartments with roommates, long bus trips to get cheap groceries, some students use food banks etc). Some programs or labs will give you TAships which pay fairly well, others increase your stipends if you can get funding, but it's not guaranteed. I started my PhD with external funding and was paid 28k by my somewhat generous PI, but then the lab hit a multi-year rough patch so my and everyone else's pay was cut to the minimum 21k. An additional factor you're probably aware of is that PhDs can take a lot longer in Canada than UK where I understand it's uncommon to go past 4 years, but this depends on the field too.\n\nThat all being said Canada is a great country to live in, I'm friends with a lot of international students from the US and Europe and many say it is worth the low pay to be here.",

      "text": "Based on my experiences travelling in the UK, ignore the exchange rate, it's highly misleading. Those Canadian dollars won't buy you much in the UK, but they'll do *alright* here. That  \u00a315k stipend is about half of the UK median salary (\u00a3[31,461](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1002964/average-full-time-annual-earnings-in-the-uk/)) - the Canadian stipend of $21k is actually more like 65% of median salary in this country ($[31,300](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210323/t001a-eng.htm) after taxes for single individuals). All this to say, I'd reckon those are fairly equivalent in terms of lifestyle they can buy, though it will vary heavily depending on region. Note in particular that in cities like Vancouver and Toronto rent has been getting insanely expensive, but the wages and funding they offer PhD students really doesn't make up for it.",

Also the stipend is just the minimum and your supervisor can provide a top up as well as TAships which in some cases are paid out separate from departmental funding. I know loads of graduate students at the school I\u2019m at now who pick up multiple TAships or jobs outside of school to pay their way through unfortunately.\n\nMy masters was 16.5k (including TAship) in a relatively cheap city and my PhD is 25.5k (excluding TAship) in an expensive city so there\u2019s definitely a pretty big range. You may also want to ask how external funding (scholarships, grants, etc) are paid out! Some schools use them to pay you less and some pay out the scholarship on top of your base funding.",

Do note that part of it has to go towards tuition & fees at the domestic rate. While my program does make it clear that the funding isn't meant to replace full-time income, the money *should* be able to cover the absolute basic living expenses (suppose you rent an en-suite room instead of a bachelor's apt, cook a lot & are not in Vancouver/Toronto). I was definitely prepared to dig into my own savings. BUT! Be aware of how potential study permit issues can ruin all your academic & financial plans!! A bizarre, super last-minute & non-covid-related delay in the processing of my application\u2014which I've submitted about 5 months ago\u2014has forced me to defer enrollment for a year (otherwise I'd lose practically half a year of funding). When I tried to contact the IRCC/local Canadian consulate for help in early August, I found that their central web form was down for about a week\u2014& weeks later I was simply told to continue waiting. Apparently this isn't a rare occurrence because other people in & outside of my program have encountered similar issues, even before the pandemic. But I honestly can't imagine this happening to people who need lab access!",

          "text": "To answer that for anyone reading, it depends. At least in my region and discipline, 'stipends' don't exist, and it's not a term we use. Instead, you'll get funding in a mixture of scholarships and guaranteed work (usually as a TA or RA). Scholarships are entirely non-taxable, and federally they don't even count as income at all, so they don't impact your eligibility for low-income tax credits and the like (in Qu\u00e9bec they *do* count as non-taxable income, so still tax free but if you get a really big scholarship it will prevent you from getting some tax credits). The portion that comes as wages is taxable (and subject to other deductions like Canada Pension Plan and union dues), but usually you'll be in a very very low tax bracket, and get the majority of withheld taxes back when you file in April.",

      "text": "This is highly field-dependent. In STEM, 21k is a pretty standard stipend, but there are ways to increase it. \n\nIn Canada (at least in STEM), there are two ways to get financing for your PhD :\n\n* A stipend from your PhD advisor. This money will come from their research funds, and there's usually a minimum amount that they have to pay you (set by the department). At my university, the minimum was 18k. Every student was guaranteed that amount for duration of their PhD. \n* A doctoral award. These stipends are usually bigger, but there's a lot of competition to get them. For example, my PhD award was 35k/year for 3 years, but the success rate among applicants was around 10%. I applied 3 years in a row before finally getting it.\n\nBecause awards are so competitive, it's pretty rare to secure one before starting your PhD.   \nFor that reason, new PhD students will typically be offered a basic stipend by their advisor (like the 21k that's offered for the position you're interested in). When they begin working on their PhD, students start applying for doctoral awards. If they get one, it replaces the stipend their advisor was giving them. As an incentive, some advisors will offer a yearly bonus (a few thousans dollars) to their students who get an award, because the award frees up some of the advisor's research funds. \n\nRegardless of the source and amount of your stipend, you can apply for TA positions, which pay pretty well. I was making an extra 400-600$ per month to supervise 1 lab session/week and grade a few lab reports. \n\n21k is not that much money, but in Canada, you can live on that. Vancouver and Toronto are very expensive cities though, so I'd avoid them unless you're 100% sure you'll be able to increase your income. I lived on less than 20k in Quebec during my master's degree and the first year of my PhD. I had a roommate and I was on a tight budget, but it's doable.\n\nAlso, remember that PhD stipends are not taxable in Canada, so you keep all of it.",

If you get one of these then many schools will top it up. At my dept it was a 10k topup. Tuition was exempt for major scholarship holders and all this income was tax free. Working as a teaching assistant would be taxable income, for example, but the personal exemption is around 10k so you need to be doing a LOT of TAing to not get everything back as a tax refund.\n\nStudents in my dept without an external scholarship but having a studentship would get about $16k and tuition paid.
