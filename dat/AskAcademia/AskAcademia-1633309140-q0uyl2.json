  "title:": "Should I reply to a paper invatation?",
  "text": "So I am a senior PhD student, previously published a paper on a MDPI journal. After that, I kept receiving paper invitations from some predatory journals or unknown journals, which I usually put into the spam. \n\nBut today I received a paper invitation from a professor in a good university for a special issue on a, let say, not-too-bad journal. While I dont intend to contribute a paper to his special issue, I wonder that should I reply him out of courtesy? Or I just ignore it as usual? \n\nI sometimes see my supervisor gets paper invitations from some middle-level journals, so he replies on occasion, which makes me think that if there is a common threshold people adopt to decide whether to reply or not?\n\nMany thanks!",

      "text": "MDPI has become so spammy recently, using social engineering to get more submissions. These \"special issue\" invitations have become a real plague, and not just from that publisher. A lot of people have not caught on yet, so some serious scholars are getting exploited. \n\nYour inclination is good. Be nice to the professor when you decline to contribute a paper.",

      "text": "There are a few questions that you need to answer first. Do you have a paper available? Often predatory journals tell you they are seeking papers for a journal next month. The review process is not typically this short for a reputable journal because revisions are required. Are you sure this credible academic is involved? It is not uncommon for citations' rankings to be fabricated. Publishing in poor journals is worse than a waste of your time, it marks you out as desperate.",
