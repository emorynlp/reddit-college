  "text": "This may be a very stupid question but please humour me.\n\nI'm from the UK and applying for professorial/lecturing/instructor positions in the US. Many of the listings include a reference to 9-months, e.g.:\n\n*University X invites applications for a full-time (9-month) assistant professor position* \n\nI understand the academic year is \\~9 months but these listings also specify a 1-3 year contract (subject to review, etc.) so does this mean that there is no pay for those 3 months and you're released into the wild for a quarter of the year?\n\nI've never seen jobs advertised in Europe with that detail. Does it relate to having no summer school commitments?\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "It means you only teach 9 months each year, and you have the summer off, 3 months with no teaching or work responsibilities. Yes, you are free to do whatever you want, for a quarter of the year. You can travel, write grants, get a temporary summer job, go hiking every day, or do nothing at all.   \nI know someone who works as a national park tour guide in the summer.   \nOne summer I was a caretaker for an off-grid cross country ski hut in Maine (and when I say \"hut\" I mean a lake-side ski chalet-hotel an hour from the nearest road, with a fully stocked commercial kitchen, solar electric and hot water, and all the modern ammenities, a fleet of kayaks and canoes, and miles of trails. It was awesome.   \nUsually there is an option for the salary to be spread out over 12 months, so you get paid all year.",

      "text": "Two different things that may be confusing. I\u2019ll try to separate them: \n\n1. Our academic year usually starts around mid-august/first of September and ends in early-mid May. Those are the 9 months you\u2019re guaranteed pay for. You can take that pay over 9 months (if you\u2019re really good with money or confident in your summer funding) or stretch it over 12 months. Neither of which affects:\n\n2. During the other 3 months (summer) you can do nothing, teach for extra pay, use grant money to pay yourself another 3 months of salary. Any of these extra monies are on top of your 9-month pay.\n\nI, for example, take my 9-month pay over 12 months. That provides me with a stable budget from month to month. I then take my grant money during this summer, which provides me with a \u201cbonus\u201d (in my simple mind) that I use for big ticket items like vacations, remodeling, etc. \n\nThere are many, many, many ways to structure your pay depending on your income streams, institutional policies, etc. Your 9-month salary is the foundation of whatever you can build.",

      "text": "There are numerous factors that may influence how this works on an individual level. While some people may choose not to do work during those 3 months off contract, most/all of the professors in my large School at an R1 who have 9 mo. appointments still work full-time during the summer doing research, writing pubs and grants, etc. Some have extra grant funding to cover that time, some do not, but pretty much all of them still have to work during those months to get their work done. Faculty get evaluated annually on both research output and teaching, so when you're not teaching you put all your time towards research (this depends on your appointment, of course). So if someone has a 80% teaching/20% research appointment, they may be able to squeeze their research into the two main semesters and take the summer off, but if someone has a 50% teaching/50% research appointment, they may not have enough time during the semesters to generate enough pubs to meet annual expectations, etc.",
