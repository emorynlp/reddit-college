  "text": "Hello! I know this has been asked before but I\u2019m still a bit conflicted. When publishing papers, would it be better to use my legal name (non-English, less common) or my English name that I use at school? Can I use both?",

      "text": "You should use the name that you want to be known as, so it's fine to use both your legal name and your \"English\" name if that's what you want. I've seen variations on names like John Jaehoon Doe, Jaehoon (John) Doe, J. John Doe, etc.\n\nIt's especially helpful if your legal name is common, because it'll help distinguish you from other researchers with the same legal name.",

      "text": "Use the name how you want to be known, like the other poster said.  It's perfectly fine to use both, or just one with an initial, or whatever.  If you are on a manuscript or presentation that someone else is giving, it is good etiquette for the lead author to send the author list out to everyone and ask \"please review this authors list and tell me if I am presenting your name in the preferred way\"; if the author does not do this and you want your name to be consistent on a poster, you should definitely ask them to change it. Also, get an ORCID ID so others can track your publications amid similarly-named people.",
