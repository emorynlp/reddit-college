  "title:": "How should I keep in contact with old professors?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I just graduated with my BA this May and started a master's program this fall, but I'd like to potentially do my PhD at the school I went to for undergrad. As such, I'd really like to keep in touch with professors I impressed, in case I need letters of recommendation. I haven't been able to visit my undergrad campus since graduating, or had an excuse to contact faculty like my undergrad PI or anyone else. Does anyone have suggestions on how to contact the professors I'd like to maintain connections with? I'm thinking of scheduling a trip to that city, but I'm not sure what reason I could give for wanting to meet with faculty. Even if I do meet with them, what would we talk about? Thanks for any help!",

      "text": "Presumably some of these professors wrote your letters for your Master's program? I think these professors would view it very favorably if you reached out to them to give an update about how you are feeling and what things you are working on. You can use the opportunity to thank them again for the letter for extra brownie points.\n\nFrom there, you could give them updates whenever you get to big milestones (thesis proposal or defense, paper publication, etc.).\n\nJust speaking from personal experience, it is not strange at all when a former student reaches out to give an update on how things are going. It's really nice.",

      "text": "Most advisors like to hear from their former students, so don't feel like you have to come up w a great reason why you're contacting them. If you feel like you need an excuse, ask for advice about something. What can you do during your Masters to maximize your chances of getting into a good PhD program? Which PhD programs do they recommend?  Career advice is a good topic for questions.",

      "text": "I agree that it could be a good idea to keep in touch for the reasons to mentioned. And I also agree that there aren't so many great excuses to do so.\n\nMaybe you could attend conferences in which they participate. Conferences halls are a great place to bond with people in academia.\n\nLastly, I'm not from the US so maybe there might be some cultural differences here. But if a student who made a great impression on me reaches out a few years afer for a letter of reccomendation, I woud do it gladly as if they just finished the course.",
