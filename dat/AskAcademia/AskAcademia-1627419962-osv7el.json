  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI (31F) am currently a teacher. I've been teaching for 5 years now. I have a bachelor's in science and a master's in education. I pursued a degree in the field of education with the goal of going into leadership roles in education. \n\nI am very passionate about making a change in our current public education system because growing up I hated school and the system is outdated. As a teacher, I've gotten to see that nothing much has changed since I was a kid and I've been trying my best to implement changes in my classrooms in the way that I teach and in how I view education. But I understand that there's only so much I can do as a teacher. I want to create educational policies and develop curriculum on a larger scale to improve the current system that we have. \n\nWhen I applied for my master's I knew that I would eventually get my doctorate. With some teaching experience now, I feel that I am ready to apply to a doctorate program. I've done my own research on EdDs and PhDs. It is my understanding that PhDs are more research based, whereas EdDs are application based. Those who pursue PhDs are more academia focused and EdDs are work focused (please correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nAs mentioned previously, I want to be in a position where I am able to create change and policies that will benefit students and teachers. I also want to find and implement innovative ideas that will strengthen our education system. I am not interested in being a professor or educating students in colleges/universities.\n\nI hope that gives you all an idea of some of the things I want to do in my career. I would love to hear what you all have to say based on your experiences. \n\nSo should I go for an EdD or a PhD?",

      "text": "Hello! Fellow public school teacher here, also entering my 6th year of teaching. I have my BSEd and MsEd as well.\n\nMy mom is a public school superintendent and she finished her Ed.D this year. Based on what you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like EdD would be the best option for you, since you\u2019ll be able to work towards your doctorate while still working full time in the field. (Some programs cater to full time administrators or full time teachers, but you can always leave the classroom and pursue full time EdD study as well). The EdD is nice because you have rich research opportunities that are woven in to your actual daily practice as an educator, and you get to use your research to improve the school communities that you work in.\n\nPhD programs in education generally all require full-time student status where you\u2019d be serving as a TA and teaching undergrads or Masters students while you conduct your own studies. I started the application process during the pandemic but withdrew because I realized I wanted to stay working in school communities. \n\nThere are also a few fully-funded PhD in urban education policy programs that focus on educational policy in public schools, but my understanding is that the goal of these programs is to become a researcher or university professor rather than a K-12 educational leader. \n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "Teacher, year 7 here. I have an MS and am doing an SYC for school admin. \n\nIMO you should go get your admin license before anything (requirements depend on the state. Here it's 30 credits post master's called \"sixth-year\"... most states call that an EdS it seems). You want to be a school leader, a PhD or EdD isn't going to mean crap if you don't have the license to work in schools.\n\nEdDs are usually made to do part time so you could work at the same time. Many school admin do them after school. Would be good so you don't have to try to survive on a PhD stipend. They are made for practicing educators. \n\nThe demands are not nearly as strenuous academically as a PhD in most cases. Though education PhDs are not really the same as something like a philosophy phd either. Tbh education doctorates are notoriously weak... so look into programs carefully.\n\nPhDs are for academics and future professors. You will need a fully funded program with a stipend. They are full time for 3-4 years depending on the program, maybe more.\n\nSounds like an EdD is up your alley. But I HIGHLY recommend getting information about admin licensing first.\n\nHoller at me if you want some more info. I have spent too much of my life looking up these options to not share lol",
