  "text": "My professor has asked me to write a Letter of Recommendation by myself.  I don't know what to focus on and how to describe my ablities and work from his view point.\n\nI have been able to somewhat figure out some stuff by looking at samples, but one biggest issue I am having is following,\n\nI have two research papers as first author in very reputed conferences while working in his lab. Being an undergrad student this is very deal for me, and very much a highlight of my profile .\n\nSo my question is, how much should I describe those research papers? should I go into the inner workings of model described in paper. I have written two 100 words paragraph for each paper, describing paper and my contribution. I don't feel this good, as paragraphs look more like abstract.\n\nOne more question, if you feel okay with it, can someone help me out by sharing a recommendation letter they recieved from their Supervisor or professor. It will be a big help. I have looked at some samples on Internet and I have gotten an idea of structure, but I can't comprehend how I should present my research papers in Recommendation letter.\n\nAlso, I will be happy to share what I wrote if anyone could help me review it.\n\nAny suggestion and help is highly appreciated. Thank you.",

      "text": "100 words is much too long! Briefly touch on the content but focus on the skills you brought to it, e.g. \u201cwhen I worked with him/her on topic X for conference presentation Y, I was especially impressed with his/her analytical thinking as well as his/her methodological acuity.\u201d (Or the skills and contributions you want to highlight)\n\nIt is a letter about you and crucially, the skills that make you an attractive candidate - not the content of a presentation. Also make sure that the final letter is not too long. Where I am, 400 words is enough!\n\nEdit: application committees also look for \u201cfit\u201d, so you can also highlight this letter as the opportunity to highlight some soft skills. Like working together on a paper, which includes clear and punctual communication, fast trouble shooting, and a collaborative spirit.",
