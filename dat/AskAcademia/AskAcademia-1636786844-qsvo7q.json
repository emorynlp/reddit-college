The career I was working for suddenly in grey cloud. \n2. Three months back, charged with misdemeanor DUI. \n3. Now, I am worried, how it is going to effect my career and job search. I am looking for a tenure track position in STEM field.",

      "text": "Have you checked the employee handbook? Most institutions have a policy on this, and it is highly unlikely that this charge will affect your tenure. I am at a state university and was charged with a DUI the same year i went up and it didn't bear on the process at all. In fact the chair of my tenure committee knew what had happened and didn't bat an eye. I attribute some of this to having a pretty airtight tenure app and track record, but honestly a DUI shouldn't disqualify anyone. \n\nYou may need to report this to HR if you are ultimately convicted. However, again, consult employee handbook. \n\nGood luck!",

Just be honest on the app if you are asked. Ideally, get into a treatment program and specify that you have done so if there is a question on the app. \n\nAlso, don't give any info if you haven't yet been convicted. Most places ask if you have convictions. Some might ask about pending charges but I rarely see this.",

      "text": "Job applications are going to ask about convictions, not pending charges. So if you have not been convicted yet, there\u2019s nothing to report. In the USA, you are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Definitely get a lawyer if you\u2019re in this situation. You might be able to reach a plea bargain with the prosecutor and avoid a conviction. This will cost you a good amount of money, of course. A cab would have been cheaper, right?\n\nWhen applying, don\u2019t lie when they ask if you if you have ever been convicted of a crime. Most likely, they are looking for felonies. But not disclosing a misdemeanor is disqualifying as it is. I would not worry too much if it is an isolated incident. The search committee probably won\u2019t pay much attention to the criminal history part and will be focused on your academic qualifications and accomplishments. The HR office will be looking for a pattern of past behavior, so if it\u2019s an isolated incident, it probably won\u2019t disqualify you. There has been at least one past president of the United States with a DUI on his record, and several congresspeople as well. I would be prepared to make a statement about the incident and what you have learned from it if it comes up in an interview. But if it does not come up in an interview, there is no reason to even mention it. It is what it is.",
