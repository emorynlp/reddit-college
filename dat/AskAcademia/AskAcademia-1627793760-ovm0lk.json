  "title:": "What are the red flags of low quality graduate programs?",
  "text": "I'm reading an article about masters programs which serve as more of a trap rather than an opportunity. What stood out to me was how a seemingly reputable university (uChicago) preys on naive undergraduates and uses personal prestige to sell an expensive graduate program that has terrible market value. And yet, their marketing is so good that an average student - desperate to go to grad school - wouldn't even notice. \n\nSo my question is: In your experience (e.g. after you've spent time at the school), which red flags did you notice (if any)? What advice can you give for students trying to wade through the marketing bs to find a good program? What are some things that are difficult to spot on the surface?",

They almost universally don't offer assistantships, but they do fund students (as in partially or fully forgive tuition) on a case by case basis. Further, a larger number of students than you might think are supported by an employer, a government scholarship, etc. Plus, some professional programs (as well as some academic programs) do have an appreciable ROI, even given the exhorbitant rates charged on student loans.\n\nThat said, paying sticker price for 99% of these programs is still a bad idea.",

These programs don't offer guarantee of employment (even med school - apparently 25% of students don't get matched every year), and most have ballooned in cost so much that you can't reasonably expect to pay off sticker price even with an appropriately qualified job in the field (public policy and low-ranked law and MBA programs are particularly problematic here). \n\nThe number of programs for which sticker is justifiable is very small. Even then, I would be conservative in the financial analysis, because fully internalizing the risk on tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt or equity against an uncertain future where you don't know what will happen with the job field (09 law market anyone), what will happen to you (get sick and can't work, need to move to another geography, etc), or frankly whether you'll even like the job enough to keep at it for years - that's sort of insane if you think about it. Just, a really bad idea. And I don't think there's awareness of how this looks from a risk perspective among policymakers who design these policies, much less among various debt counselors and the like, and certainly the end consumer.",

Students should be very aware of the debt they are taking on, use cost to determine what school they want to attend (recognizing that in a few career paths prestige does unfortunately matter, but many should just choose the cheapest school), and employment likelihood. Minor correction as well- for US med school graduates (at least allopathic- MD not DO), only about 5% go unmatched and most who go unmatched will be able to find a position in an open residency.

A PhD is just a low-paying job with high-demand merit badges - you compete to get it, and what you do with it is entirely up to you. If you bail, great. If you stick around, good for you.\n\nThe traditional Master's approach is pay-to-play and simpler to pull off. \n\nThe trade-off with earning your Master's through your PhD is dealing with a more competitive, more expensive application process. As a PhD student, your courses are typically segregated from and more challenging than the same institution's Master's series. And you probably need to teach or at least make an attempt at research. That is, you're earning your keep. Someone who wants to take this LPT seriously should at least consider a PhD as a possible future (or be really financially strapped), given the increased difficulty.\n\nIn any case, blame the cash cow that higher ed has become, not the individual who seeks access.",

      "text": "The MAPH program at UChicago has always struck me as being highly exploitative for many reasons but maybe one of the clearest is the short length of the program. They frame the program as being a stepping stone to PhD programs but one year is simply too short for most students to develop relationships with faculty for LORs, fine-tune a writing sample, etc. If you enter the MAPH program and want to apply to PhD programs for the next year, you basically have to submit an app with just one quarter of the program under your belt. My partner has a PhD in a STEM field and knows of programs in his field that are one-year long and marketed in a similar way. Faculty have basically admitted that these programs are cash cows to fund the PhD programs and other research. \n\nBasically, unless it's a professional program, you should never pay for an MA or PhD. If you want to go into academia, it's a terrible idea to saddle yourself with tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt before you even enter a PhD program. There are funded MAs out there.\n\nSource: Current PhD student in the humanities who only applied to funded programs.

What stands out about the Chicago programs is the pricetag and the fact that people are admitted who don't apply. \n\nI don't know if I would conclude simply that it is a terrible program in itself, but it is, as you said, preying on naive undergraduates and admitting people who don't get into Ph.D. programs. So it is full of students who did not get into say the 10 Ph.D. programs they applied to. I think part of the problem with the \"market value\" is just that. It's really hard to get into good Ph.D. programs, and these are people who didn't manage to, and it is a lot to expect for an MA program to change this. \n\nThat said, there are in my field a few MA programs (many of them funded or with assistantships) which are devoted to *precisely this*, and that is certainly a much better idea than a \"design your own\" program or a general humanities or liberal arts or whatever program (if you want to do a Ph.D.).

At your prestigious MPH program, I'm sure there's a minority of students who are aware that things aren't right, but most of them got in knowing very little about the field (which is normal - if you know all about the field, you wouldn't be going to school to learn about it) and believe that the education they're getting is adequate and even superior because that's what the school told them. I see this a lot with MPA students who think that the intro to econ and descriptive stats class their MPA program gave them is a \"strong quantitative base\" that makes them eligible to be a researcher or economist, probably because they come from a humanities BA and entered the masters without having ever worked in the field, so they don't know which way is up. If a prospective student were to ask them about their experience, they'd say that everything is super. Some of them realize it after they graduate and can't get a job. Some never do.",

      "text": "> ow a seemingly reputable university (uChicago) preys on naive undergraduates and uses personal prestige to sell an expensive graduate program that has terrible market value.\n\nA few things.\n\nOne, American policymakers as backed by the American taxpayer have created a system wherein universities must drive revenue and compete for profit opportunities in order to survive. Some of us now endeavor to blame said universities for trying to exist within this system. That does not make sense to me.\n\nTwo, assuming you are talking about the MAPH or the social sciences equivalent, I forget the name, why are these hypothetical undergraduates trying to derive \"market value\" from a humanities program? A masters in the humanities from any school isn't going to have good ROI. Also, based on my observation of non-hypothetical humanities students, most of them seem singularly uninterested in market value and are doing it because they're pursuing a dream vocation. I believe that UChicago uses its name to charge higher fees than humanities masters at unprestigious schools (which still overcharge), but the notion that they promise some kind of market value is absurd.\n\nThree, I think you mean \"institutional\" prestige.\n\n> What advice can you give for students trying to wade through the marketing bs to find a good program?\n\nIf you are in the humanities or social sciences save economics, don't pay for a master's program. It's as simple as that. No amount of marketing bs can harm you if you are firm in the conviction that you shan't borrow 6 figures to get an MA in the humanities. In practice, this means applying widely, digging for scholarships, and being okay with not going to the most \"prestigious\" program - but it's eminently doable.",
