  "title:": "Should I leave my academic research job? What am I doing wrong?",
  "text": "field: medicine / machine learning, title: research engineer, country: U.S.\n\nBackground: \n\nI recently graduated from college (majored in bioengineering) and I was able to have a brief conversation with a researcher I respected. He was impressed with my senior design project and recommended I join his colleague's lab since they were doing similar work. After talking to the PI, I decided to join. \n\nI've been in this lab for almost 3 months. I have a strange combination of feelings: \n\n(1) I attended a low ranking college and am the first person in my family to graduate. Now, I am working at one of the top institutions in the U.S. and it gives me a sense of validation. (I know it sounds silly). \n\n(2) I feel incompetent and useless. Everyone in the lab has a background in computer science / machine learning and they are all graduate students and post docs. For lack of better words, I feel like they treat me like a disease. They all say they are very busy with their own work and sometimes they ignore me when I ask for help or have a question. The PI has also pressured me on a few occasions to be more useful. \n\n(3) I feel I may be in denial. I have experienced numerous red flags. One example is that my PI has made at least a few racist comments in front of me. Everyday I try convince myself: I'm fine, I must have misheard him, nothing's wrong. It is starting to become emotionally exhausting. \n\n(4) I am determined and ambitious. I've experienced numerous hardships in life which have thickened my skin. It's currently my opinion that being at a highly prestigious institution is critical for my career growth. So, I feel like I need to keep fighting, otherwise I am just being weak. \n\nI hope the above information provides enough context and makes sense. I don't have anyone to ask these types questions. Please take the time to share your opinions and any advice. \n\nThank you.",

      "text": "There are two things happening here that are worth thinking about:\n\n(1.) It's important to separate your own judgements from the facts. Everyone in your lab having a different background is a fact, and sure it does put you at a disadvantage in some ways. But it can also be an advantage -- the lab knew your background when they hired you, so they are probably interested in your different perspective/approach and, by hiring you, they decided that your different background knowledge is worth the benefits of the approach you bring.\n\nThe non-fact is that they treat you like a disease. They may be avoiding you or being short with you -- and yes, that's rude of them! -- but characterizing that as treating you like a \"disease\" is bringing a lot of negativity to the interpretation. Alternative interpretations would be that this is the tone taken by everyone in their field, or that they're being overworked by the PI and thus constantly forgetful. In other words, it could easily be more about what's going on in their heads regarding their lives, rather than what they think about you specifically.\n\nThat said, it's still rude of them. If you feel like being direct, you could ask them if they have a preferred way you ask for their help, so they can reflect on their behavior as well as be aware that you are feeling like you need help sometimes.\n\n(2.) Your red flags in your item (3), though, are very concerning. If your PI is making racist comments out loud to you, they're probably 1000x worse in private. This could easily affect the quality of the recommendations they write for you and how positively they speak of you to collaborators. Between this and the weird behavior of the lab members, the entire atmosphere sounds really toxic. If I were in your shoes I would be strengthening my connections with other labs so I could ask them if I could join sooner rather than later.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It is true that my characterization of their attitude seems harsh. I know for a fact they are being overworked and I try to be mindful of that when I approach them. \n\nI'm actually a temporary employee and my contract expires early next year. I do wonder at times what this PI will say about be if I asked for a letter of recommendation for graduate school or reference if I work in industry. There is another lab member who is a post-doc / instructor at this institution who applied for a job in industry and our PI refused to give him a reference because the PI wanted to continue using this person in his lab. Since I mentioned the racism previously, it may be noteworthy that the person who asked for a reference is the same ethnicity as me. So, I am a bit concerned by this.",

              "text": "It's a harsh characterization, and certainly the harshness is deserved. I really don't intend to invalidate that. I only state it as \"non-fact\" because it's important to be aware of what is your own interpretation and what is the evidence itself. Building that skill can help you keep a cool head in spaces like that where there are hidden/unspoken rules but also an expectation of criticism/critique.\n\nThe fact that you interpret their behavior so harshly is a sign of your own self-respect. Not everyone has strong self-respect, especially in academia (so many passive people there). Your harsh interpretation might be identifying the true reason for their behavior or it might not (do they despise you, or are they rude for other reasons? who knows), but it unambiguously indicates that (A) they're behaving poorly, and (B) you firmly believe you deserve better. You have good instincts.\n\nAnyway, this PI really does sound very concerning. Usually you can help your future self by asking if you're on the right track for a good recommendation or need to improve, but... I 100% don't trust this guy to stay true to his word regardless of how he answers that. I'm glad you have a time limit on your stay there, and I wish there was a way to improve the chances of it being productive for your career.",

      "text": "PhD in Genomics. You should feel proud! Very few people get to work in academic science at a level higher than undergraduate.\n\nIf you graduated with your B.S. and joined the lab right after then to be completely honest with you, compared to the grad students and post-docs, you are closer to incompetent and useless than not. BUT that's to be expected. All new grad students are basically useless and you are effectively as educated as a new grad student. We were all there at one point.\n\nIts really hard to get your own work done AND try and help someone with theirs, so its not surprising they don't have time for you. If the PI is pressuring you to get more done then you might have to reach out to other lab mates to see if they want help.\n\nObviously the racism is unacceptable under all circumstances. I don't know your ethnicity, but if his comments seem directed toward you then you need to leave the lab, it will not get better. If they are not directed at you, then you might just have to suck it up (not ideal of course).\n\nYou are not doing anything wrong. You may need to ask your PI what they expect from you. If they indicate you are not living up to their expectations, then it is only fair to lay out what those expectations are. Welcome to Academia.",

          "text": "Thanks for your insights. I was very straightforward during my interview about what skills I do have / don't have. So, when I got the job, I assumed they knew what level I was at and would give me a chance to grow. But something doesn't seem right... I overheard some of the other lab members complain about hiring inexperienced people like me over more experienced people (i.e., post-docs). This tells me they are unhappy with the fact that I am closer to incompetent and useless. \n\nI do feel sympathy for the other lab members though since I am aware that they are overwhelmed with work. I try to keep that in mind. \n\nI agree - I will need to have a conversation with my PI to get a clearer understanding what the expectations are.",

              "text": "I think a lot of people here are overlooking the racism you mentioned. You clearly come from a very different background from the PI and the others in the lab and frankly a lot of people deep down want to make sure that academia remains closed to everyone except those just like them. God knows why they hire people they then discriminate against but it happens time and time again. \n\nIt's my experience that labs tend to model the behaviours shown by the group leader and in a lab where the PI treats everyone badly but singles out certain individuals for additional nastiness, you'll often see a hierarchy where instead of banding together against the PI everyone else picks on the victim of the PI's ire. \n\nYou do belong in academia, just as much as anyone else but this lab is not good for you. Don't let them convince you otherwise.\n\nIf you haven't seen it already, I recommend Picture A Scientist on Netflix. It's about gender discrimination but I suspect you'll recognise a lot of their experiences.",

It sounds like some sort of anti-inclusivity thing, but trust me a group of great people around you who have shared your experiences and not only get you but can champion you and help each other out is so important.",

      "text": "Hey there - fellow PhD student here, coming from a fairly low-ranked institution to a high ranked one. You should feel proud that you've made it to this institution and this far, even if the work environment isn't great.\n\nI think it's **most important** to keep in mind that if you *already knew everything you were going to learn in grad school, there would be no reason to be in grad school.* It took me at least 8 months to feel like I was starting to transition from useless to, \"hey! maybe I know somethings.\"\n\nHowever, it sounds like your work environment is pretty toxic. Does your PI have clear expectations for you (that are reasonable)? Are they available to help you/check in with you semi regularly? Do you feel like you're making any progress (i.e., once trained on a task/concept you feel fairly independent)? Hiring you straight out of undergrad, it would be *ridiculous* to expect you to be on the same playing field as students who have been there for years after three months.\n\nFor (2), I think it's likely that the other student's attitudes has much more to do with the PI than you. It sounds like they're overworked, busy, and generally unsupported. Their qualms about your inexperience have nothing to do with you, but rather your PI's failure to fill roles the lab needed. Regardless, they shouldn't be rude to you, but I would try my best to focus on the fact that their attitudes are not about *you specifically*.\n\n(3) is by far the most concerning. As other have said, this is incredibly toxic. Are you required to stay in this lab until the end of your contract? Could you transfer to another lab in the same department? A lot of times, abusive/toxic/racist/etc PIs are no secret to the other members of a department. Colloquially, you could maybe list your reason for seeking transfer as, \"unaligned opinions on work environment.\"\n\nI realize you are concerned about recommendations in the future. Transferring labs ASAP would help this if you have a relationship with any other labs in the department (do y'all do rotations, etc.?). If this PI refuses to write you a letter of rec, remember that you have other qualified professionals in your life that can fill this role (i.e., the researcher who recommended you for this position).\n\nI don't know if this was helpful - I mostly wanted to reiterate that **you aren't doing anything wrong here**, you just had the misfortune of ending up in a bad environment. In the future, *always always always* reach out to a PI's graduate students before you accept a role in their lab (they likely won't recommend it if it's extremely toxic). If the PI won't put you in contact with them/gets weird about it this is a massive red flag.",

Just to clear any confusion, I was hired in as a research engineer with the hopes of applying for a PhD so I can continue doing research in this lab. Unfortunately, this means I don't have rotations. \n\nCoincidentally, my PI just had a conversation with me and he admitted to having severely overestimated my abilities before hiring me. Though I don't agree with some of his views, he at least mentioned he was willing to find some projects for me to contribute to while I gain new skills. One positive thing from this experience is that I've been learning at a rapid pace. I'm expected to learn everything on my own though. I wish I could have more guidance but I can handle it.\n\nCommunicating with him has been weird. After 3 months, I just had an in-person conversation with him for the *first* time... I'm hoping this will improve in the near future.\n\nI'm almost certain that I'm stuck in this lab until the contract expires but I will still check. I'm working on finding different graduate schools and departments to apply to. I should have a few solid references though from my previous institution and a few from this one.",
