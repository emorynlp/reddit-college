It's not that much of a salary but pretty good for a doctoral student. And tuition fees are fairly low (free when you're under a certain age).\n\nI think what's more of a \"problem\" is that you spend years and years in education and by the time you're in your late 30s you are really just starting to take your career to the next level. And as I said, family was not in the picture.\n\nEdit: But of course the education system in the country you're in plays a huge role, i.e. is it possible to afford 2 PhDs and a masters in between.",

Having the PhD and some demonstrable statistics knowledge and background will get you where ever you want to go 99% of the time.",

      "text": "The common thread among most of the responses is that a secondary masters is a good route to change your career direction, but if you haven't started a PhD yet, there are probably better routes (both for your career and financially). Having a strong background in statistics is definitely a huge boon in mol bio/omics, but you could often take extra courses in statistics during your PhD (some schools will even let you get a secondary masters in a different field). Another alternative is to do a PhD with dual advisors -- one in molecular bio, and a second in statistics. \n\nUnfortunately \"staleness\" of a PhD is a thing that affects hiring, at least in more research oriented roles. If after you finish your PhD, you take two years off research to get a masters, it'll be more difficult to get picked up for a research position (at least in academia). Taking a bit of extra time to finish your PhD, during which you take stats courses would likely be looked at more positively. Plus having the knowledge in statistics would be beneficial to your research in the PhD, and now when you finish you'll have a research record that reflects your expertise in both.\n\nAll that to say -- getting a masters after a PhD is not a bad option, but if you're really interested in both fields there are probably better routes.",

Most of my professors also had multiple masters degrees and various certifications. I actually didn\u2019t finish my masters and since I changed fields I am looking at a different masters program and PhD now that\u2019s more relevant to my current career field but would build upon the skills I developed in my bachelors still. But I would like to eventually go back and finish the masters I started when I retire or something. I had been doing a masters in German studies, which isn\u2019t relevant to what I do now\u2014but it\u2019s still an interesting field to me and I hate leaving things unfinished.",
