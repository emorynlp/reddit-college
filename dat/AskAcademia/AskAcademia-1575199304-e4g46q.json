The departmental committee that officially approved my thesis was never actually involved in the actual conception of the thesis, and I never met them in person. The university originally had a policy of requiring two advisors, but got rid of it while I was studying, so the only advisor that I ultimately had was my professor. Two external examiners and an opponent for the public examination were chosen so that I could comment, but it was ultimately my professor who selected them, and the committee approved them. The external examiners and the opponent had to be uninvolved, and they became involved in the process very late, working much like peer reviewers. The grade was recommended by the opponent.\n\nSee for example [instructions](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-of-arts/research/doctoral-education/instructions-for-the-examiners-of-doctoral-dissertations) from the University of Helsinki:\n\n> In the appointment of preliminary examiners, the University of Helsinki regulations on the disqualification of preliminary examiners must be taken into account. The preliminary examiner can have no relationship with the doctoral candidate, the doctoral dissertation or another party involved that may compromise his or her impartiality. Consequently, e.g. the following persons can never be named as preliminary examiners:\n>\n> - A person who has co-authored at least one of the articles used in an article-based dissertation\n> - A person who is currently engaged in research cooperation with the doctoral candidate or was engaged in such research cooperation during the dissertation project\n> - A person who has been engaged in close research cooperation with the dissertation supervisor during the three years prior to the preliminary examination of the doctoral dissertation\n> - A close relative of the doctoral candidate\n> - The immediate superior or subordinate of the doctoral candidate, or the supervisor\n> - A member of the doctoral dissertation monitoring group, in cases where such group has been appointed\n\nAlso, for the opponent, the same ethical guidelines apply, particularly this:\n\n> Opponent(s) are always named from outside the doctoral candidate's home faculty and, as a rule, from outside the University of Helsinki. The preliminary examiner must not supervise the doctoral student or accept revised versions of the manuscript or any other material related to the dissertation except through the Faculty's Doctoral Student Services.\n\nThe grading committee is composed of the custos (usually the advisor), the opponent and a faculty representative appointed by the university. Only the advisor is allowed to work with the student directly, other than via official channels.",

It's not that I don't think they are cut out for grad school academically, it's that I want to make sure they are getting into it with a realistic expectation of the experience and what they can do once they are done, so that they don't have to go through what I went/am going through.",

Actively push your PI to allow you to do an internship somewhere.  I also thought that having a PhD would make it quite easy to get a job.  I was wrong.  Even my PhD research was almost directly relatable to industry, I'm sure I was turned away because I had no industry experience.  I applied to easily over 100 jobs.  I ended up doing an internship which eventually turned into a full time job but when I was doing that round applied after I had the internship on my resume (even though it was only 2-3 months of experience) I felt like I was getting significantly more call backs.\n\nAlso network.  If you can't find a job on your own merit, network.  Many people out of grad school find their first job simply by who they know.  I went to a conference to search for jobs and there was a panel of new grads who were answering questions about getting jobs in industry.  I asked him afterwards about the company (which is a major company in my field) and he said applying online is worthless.  The only way to get a job there is if you know someone or if they recruit at a university that I'm at.  So he said that I should postdoc at one of those universities so I could get a chance to get a job there.",

If no one is talking to you about post-graduation options by spring of your junior year, go talk to them.  Ask your advisor, other faculty in the department, ask about previous graduate students and what they did (industry vs grad school). Then, you can ask what connections the department or the university might have with local industry companies.\n\n**Here is what I ask my students:**\n\n1. Tell me what you want to be doing during a work day (not what you want to be...what you want to be DOING), i.e. writing code, working at a lab table, teaching, fixing broken lasers, etc.\n2. Tell me WHY you want to do that.\n3. If answer is reasonable - good, now go find out all the types of positions that involve people doing the things you listed in Q1. What level of education do they require? How much do they pay?  How secure is the employment?\n4. Which of those types of jobs sounds most appealing to you?  \n5. What can we do together to get you from where you are right now, to being ready to take the type of job (or grad schooling) you want after graduation?\n\nIt's entirely possible some of those jobs require an M.S. or a Ph.D., and then we put grad school on the table at that point. \n\n**Resources:** \n\nIn physics, there are plenty of jobs that you can find through the American Physical Society job postings section, and I always send my students there. I think we do a huge disservice to our students by not letting them know how much companies want to hire physicists because of their problem-solving abilities.  Crystal Bailey, of APS, has done a ton of work on this and she has many resources posted on the APS website about where to look for jobs, how to apply, how to write a skills-based resume, etc. (I also will look over cover letters and resumes for my students as they apply to things).\n\nI know for biology and chemistry, there are a TON of \"lab tech\" positions in companies, which do everything from test water to running samples through cell cultures.  My friend got such a position with her B.S. in biology and made a decent wage (\\~45k back in 2010, now probably closer to 50-52k). I'm not sure of what specific source to point you to for these types of jobs though, sorry!   \n\nI hope this helps!",

If you are in the social sciences and humanities (maybe other fields too), try to get a 2nd terminal masters along the way in something a bit more marketable (e.g., information science).

      "text": "I completed my PhD at a US R1 in 2016. I got my first TT job right away at a teaching heavy (4/4) university in an undesirable location. After three years in that job, I got a second TT at a better university with less teaching in a great location. I'm also very honest with students considering academia about the many talented people I know who have yet to land a TT. \n\nI wish I had known that I could have negotiated the terms of my PhD once the offer was on the table. You can request additional funding at some schools, and you can request less teaching. The latter may not be the best choice, though, as the more teaching experience you have, the more marketable you will be in my field.\n\nMy advice during the PhD is to seek out service opportunities (by organizing events with your advisor and cohort, participating in grad student representative bodies, etc.), publish at least one article and a review during the PhD (for the Humanities), and keep an eye on the job market from the beginning to know how to diversify your portfolio to meet the changing demands. So, if digital humanities appears often in the postings for jobs you would want, find a way to get that on your CV. Add any pertinent certificates available to further diversify. Apply for teaching fellowships to create your own course and get that interesting course title on your CV. Also keep your conference paper titles as interesting as possible. Keep that CV in mind at every turn.\n\nI had a wonderful experience in grad school, and I hope you do as well if you choose this path! I would also agree with a former poster that it's important to mostly enjoy the work in grad school because it will become more demanding in TT jobs. But it's fantastic to have a job you love in the end!",
