If you are in the first year of school, maybe the rich parents had a Nanny who taught them or they went to a pre-school, but at best you are 6 months, a year behind, by the time you are 15 that could be 4 years behind, by 22 the rich kid might have 2 internships at investment banks/law firms/hospitals/esteemed labs under their belt, and then when they apply for the job their dad recommends them, and arguably, because of the hundreds of thousands that are put into their education and their work experience, at least on paper, they are the best candidate. Of course the white kid from the ghetto, who has worked 12 hour days since 14 probably has a far better work ethic, and the fact they have even managed to put a competitive application together is astounding, but when it comes done it it, is it the best application, probably not, that probably comes from a similar person with less disadvantages stacked up against them, and the longer those disadvantages exist the more likely that is so. \n\nIf you are working at a supermarket to pay the power bill, you aren't doing an unpaid internship in NYC your dad set up, while staying in the apartment your parents pay the rent for.",

While a person may mention a marginalized identity they hold as part of a diversity statement, you can still have a strong diversity statement from your position of privilege if you demonstrate how you will foster an environment of inclusion and equity at an institution.\n\nA couple of things that I included in my diversity statement that you might consider (I'm a queer cis white man, so I hold some but not all of your identities):\n\n-Discuss how I integrate diversity-related topics into my courses, using specific examples of class activities and assignments that I've used to help students learn about diversity\n\n-Describe my process of creating an inclusive classroom environment and, specifically, preparing students to discuss at times heavy topics (e.g., privilege and marginalization) while maintaining an inclusive and respectful environment\n\nSome of this depends upon your specific discipline--for example, I understand that a physics course may not have a deep dive about diversity. I will say that colleagues of mine in the hard sciences have shared how they have made efforts to highlight the accomplishments of researchers who are women and/or people of color but whose work may not have had the spotlight it deserved in the field. The key is to write something that is true to yourself and the kind of courses you teach, or the research you do, while painting a picture of the kind of (ideally sensitive and inclusive) teacher and colleague you will be.",
