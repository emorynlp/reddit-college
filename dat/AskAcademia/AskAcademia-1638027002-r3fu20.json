  "title:": "To read about your field (Humanities) in another language. How do you deal with names?",
  "text": "I'm an undergraduate of History in Spain. All of my bibliography is in Spanish, but I want to practice my English at the same time that I get to know more about the things I am studying. So I'm reading History books in English (currently Creators, Conquerors and Citizens, published by Oxford University Press).\n\n**The problem** I've ran into are the names (places, people, etc) . There are names that are easy to know their equivalence in Spanish: it sounds similar or either you use a translating tool or go to the wikipedia page and change the language to Spanish. But lots of others are difficult to know the equivalence. \n\nThis is **relevant to me** because if in the exam I want to name something and turns out I only know the name in English but not Spanish, do I write the name in English even knowing that's not optimal? **An example** of this: to write in the exam \"Peisistratos\" instead of the Spanish \"Pis\u00edstrato\"\n\n**So my question is: How do you members of the Academia deal with names when reading in another language about your field? Would you recommend me writing the names I don't know in Spanish in English?**",
