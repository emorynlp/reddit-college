  "text": "i'm in the usa.  i have a master's degree in adult and higher education administration, achieved in 2017.  i was working up the housing ladder throughout undergrad and grad school, then worked 2 years out of grad school at a large public university as a professional in their housing program, and left due to the absolutely horrible treatment of and unrealistic expectations placed upon housing professionals.\n\nsince may of 2019, i've worked some other jobs - a year at a call center, some time in retail, etc.  but i think i'm ready to go back into higher ed.  i've also had a case study i created during my final semester of grad school get approval for publishing in a textbook to be released sometime in the next year.\n\nmy question is - does my time away for my own mental and physical health look suspicious?  have i ruined my chances of ever getting back into an administrative role at a university?  or worse - is my only option to go back into housing, since that's where my higher ed background is?\n\ni guess i'm just wondering if it's even worth it to start looking for a job in academia again if my chances are abysmal, since the processes always take forever and usually are super in-depth.",

      "text": "You can very likely still get a good job in higher Ed. You may need to start at a little lower of a position than you like and move up over time. You can try different positions. I think sometimes it\u2019s best to try different one early in your career because you can get sort of pigeon holed if you stay in one field / department for a long time. Try to connect your graduate work to your resume and cover letter.",

      "text": "I chaired Social Sciences at a 5000 student state baccalaureate college.\n\nSeveral years before I retired I hired a late 50's-something who had a career as a cop and earned her masters while working. She retired and earned her doctorate. She applied and I hired her from among 50 or so other applicants without any push-back at all from anybody higher up in the administration. She was very clear when she interviewed that she was planning on working for 10 years to earn a second pension and then retire again. She's actually gone a bit longer than that.\n\nAlso, our college hired a person with a master's in I/O psychology who had worked in industry for 20 years or so to run our Student Success program.\n\nSo, my n=2 suggests that it is certainly possible to come into higher ed a bit later in life. Apply and see what happens. I'd bet that your earlier experiences would put you higher up on the applicant pool, particularly if you can get a good LOR from somebody at your previous institution.",
