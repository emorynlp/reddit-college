  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you can share your experiences and thoughts on this. \n\nI defended my PhD 2 weeks ago (Greece) (31, F). It went great, I had an interesting, scholarly discussion afterwards which was very stimulating and really felt like my committee welcomed me in academia. I've received some corrections, which are not that difficult to do and I expect to have the final manuscript by the end of October.\n\nI have been applying to postdoc positions, or even cold-emailing PIs (one ended in an interview and invited talk, but unsuccessful). Academia is not a one-way for my career, I have a clinical degree and experience and I can work as a clinician (and I would greatly enjoy that). \n\nI have the economic ability to not have to look for a job straight away and allow myself to write papers, get some rest and think about my next steps. I have a partner and we have also started talking about the prospect of a family in the future. \n\nI have this feeling that I will never be 'good enough' in academia, I'll never publish in high impact journals (although I know how relative BS that is), I'll never be within the 'clique' in my interdisciplinary field. Although during my pre-defense time I was confident of my work and acknowledged that I did the best I could (also during COVID and data collection implications), I now find myself to think that I didn't do anything special. The academic job market sounds horrendous and I wonder why go through it? I'm really passionate about my subject and I believe I can contribute to it, but it feels like there aren't enough chances, or that I can't compete with other better-equipped applicants, from better universities and with more high-prestige supervisors. It just feels a bit Sisyphean. \n\nIt's really dumb for me to be thinking that an academic career would be better in any way than my clinical career. I know this comes from me being ambitious and wanting to satisfy silly needs (which I work on in therapy). I feel I'm very close to saying 'this is not for me', but I also feel very guilty about saying this. \n\nIs it just the post-defense blues? Would be great to share your experience. Thanks!",

Take some time to relax (since it sounds like you can) and get back on track once you feel ready. It can take awhile to get over the intensity of finishing a PhD!",

      "text": "Not really what you asked but as I've moved on in my career I've taken the approach of apply and then worry about it. It's so easy to rule yourself out something because of your fears so instead I apply and then if I don't get an interview, well that's that. If I do get an interview, that's an opportunity to learn more and see if they're a good fit and if I like them. If I get a job offer, well then that's the moment for the existential crisis about whether I'm good enough or not. Fortunately, the interview has usually given me an idea of whether or not I'm interested. I've turned down a job before because I knew I wouldn't like it, and I've been relieved I didn't get a couple of others. \n\nYou're not obliged to take a job just because it's offered and if you can develop a thick enough skin to take not getting an interview, it's a much easier way of going through life than the perpetual angst of am I good enough to do this job? Who knows if you're good enough but you're certainly good enough to be able to write an application.",
