  "text": "Hello there,\n\nLong story short, my professor asked me to change my topic to a new one (the new topic may grant me a place at a new department).  \n\nThe broad idea is a study that looks into family supervision over children consumption of media in  X country.\n\nThat's all he had left me with. I don't know what do or how to start ... \n\nI am a first year student ... I'm kinda lost. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",

Are you currently a PhD student working on a topic and your PI wants you to change topic, department and supervisor?\n\nHas this other professor agreed to supervise? Is the transfer approved?\n\nIt's hard to give any advice without understanding your situation because right now it sounds like you're being kicked out of your PhD program which is a big issue.",

Is the UNESCO chair position a postdoc?\n\nI'm really struggling to get my head around the idea you're doing PhD right now but your PI no longer wants you to do the project you started and wants you to do a different PhD project in a different department, under a different PI but they'll still be supervising your PhD? That makes no sense. Obviously, different countries work differently, but in general moving departments means starting a whole new PhD and usually a PI cannot supervise a PhD being done in a department they aren't in, with a student doing the project under another PI. The PI whose project it is needs to be responsible for the work done. Do you see why I'm struggling to understand what's being proposed here?",

I'm still a bit confused about what's going on here but it sounds like they know you'd be interested in doing a postdoc in a different area so have suggested a change of project and you just agreed to it? Is your PI qualified to supervise that topic? Do you really want to do change topic?\n\nI think you need to do a deeper dive into the topic with them and hash out some high level ideas for a project, or you need to say you don't want to throw away a year's worth of work and would rather continue with the current project. You could consider developing a side project that would make you more attractive to the UNESCO chair. \n\nLastly, is the UNESCO chair aware of any of this? Do they intend to get postdoc funding for you? Have you discussed any of this with them? If not you need to approach them and discuss future research projects with them and sound them out. There's no point in completely changing your PhD for this person if they have no idea and then have no intention of taking on a postdoc.",
