  "text": " \n\nGreetings, \n\nI'm a grad student from Russia. Looking for a doctoral program in the US. I'm interested in urban governance and local government issues. Right now I am working on a project about intergovernmental fiscal relations between city and district (intra-city) authorities. So, urban decentralization and neighborhood governance are my current research focus. Planning to keep working in this field in the US. Moreover, I'm not a big fan of quantitative research, so I'm looking for a field/program which is benevolent to qualitative research. \n\nDuring my search, I see a big variation of doctoral programs. I guess four fields potentially fit me:\n\n* PhD in Political Science, \n* PhD in Public Policy (not DPP!)\n* PhD in Public Affairs \n* PhD in Public Administration (not DPA!)\n\nFor me, it's quite difficult to understand the meaning of all these fields because there is only a PhD in Political Science degree in Russia.\n\nWhat is the difference between these types of PhDs? What fields are relevant if I'm going to pursue an academic career in the US/Canada? What about working conditions and the labor market in these fields?\n\nWould be happy to receive any response and advice",

      "text": "You mentioned you\u2019re interested in qual, have you considered Sociology / Political Science + Public Policy PhDs? Harvard, Michigan, and Princeton has them. I think a few other universities have these programs too. The labour market for grads from these programs is pretty favourable in comparison to other Sociology PhDs, but they\u2019re also more competitive to get into.  \n\nHow these combined PhDs work: your home department is a traditional discipline (sociology, political science) and you also work with the public policy school at the university. There is also a \u201cbackdoor,\u201d so to speak, at some of these programs where any Sociology / PoliSci PhD can apply to the Public Policy add-on once they\u2019re at the school. \n\nA word of caution about programs housed in \u201capplied\u201d schools (like public policy) vs traditional schools (like graduate school of arts and sciences) \u2014 sometimes the applied programs don\u2019t have as good of a reputation as the traditional programs, even if they\u2019re at the same institution. This matters much more in academia than in industry. So if you want to stay in academia, I\u2019d encourage you to focus on programs in traditional disciplines with a public policy addition (like the ones I suggested above), or even a pure political science program, over the applied programs. It\u2019s common to move from a traditional discipline to an applied discipline in the job market, but I haven\u2019t seen the reverse. Maybe this is different in STEM fields but at least in the social sciences this is what I\u2019ve observed.",

This is a combined program with both HKS & the Faculty of Arts & Sciences: https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs/phd-social-policy \n\nFinally, the PhD in Government at Harvard (Poli Sci) is actually in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences instead of HKS.

The rest of those are a pipeline to industry jobs.\n\nOther than that, rather than orienting yourself based on broad fields, I'd pick programs based on how well they fit your research interests (e.g. more quant vs more qual, whether they have a, say, big econ focus or a big environment/climate focus, who teaches there) and on what faculty work there, particularly who could supervise your thesis. What the degree is called can be important (e.g. some countries have constricting hiring practices regarding what one's degree is called), but your actual PhD experience will be determined by the quality of the environment you're in for what you want to do, not what the department is.",
