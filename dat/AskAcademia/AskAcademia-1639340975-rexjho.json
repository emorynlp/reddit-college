  "title:": "I hate my master thesis. Advice requested",
  "text": "Hello Everyone\n\nI'm currently studying for Master's of Science degree in Belgium (computer science related), and I started to hate my master's thesis.\n\nI choose a subject about 7 months ago. 3 months ago I started working on it like was planned.   \nThe first week, my master's thesis supervisors changed the subject into something that is really complicated. I have basic Machine Learning knowledge but the thesis is about very complicated, specific time series algorithms combined with ML.    \nAt first, I was not even aware the new subject they proposed was that different from what was originally planned. So, I said okay and started doing research on that topic.  \n\nThis semester I also have a lot of \"normal\" subjects, for which I have a lot of projects. Nonetheless, on average I should work one hour each day for my master's thesis. But I just can't bring myself up to it. Everyday I put it on my to do list, but sometimes I let a week go by without any progress. I find it a lot easier to work on projects (and study for exams) for which I have a deadline in the near future. I tried the 'start with five minutes' method, but I literally just give up after five minutes.\n\nI have meetings with my supervisors every few weeks, but I just tell them I have been busy and that I wasted time on a certain problem. Another obstacle I've encountered is that English is not my native language, and since one supervisor does not speak my native language, the meetings are in English, so that forms kind of a barrier for me sometimes. \n\nTo summarize: I find my subject not interesting at all, I can't bring myself up to work for it, I feel like I'm too stupid to do this complicated research, I'm afraid to reach out to my supervisors and tell them I'm kind of stuck.\n\nI would really appreciate some advice. I'll answer any questions in the comments.",

      "text": "Something you could try is to change your master thesis. Maybe you'll have to do an additional semester but it can be worth it (a friend of mine did that). \nAnother thing I would suggest is to explain your situation to your supervisors, telling them that your subject isn't what you've expected. \nMy master thesis in neurosciences is very difficult sometimes, but I tell my supervisor everything that I do not understand and it makes things much easier for me.",
