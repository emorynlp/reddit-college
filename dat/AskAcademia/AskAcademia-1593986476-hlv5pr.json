  "text": "I passed my defense last week \u201cwith conditions\u201d. Are conditions the same as revisions? I have an official list of things to address, it\u2019s much more work than I was hoping to have to do after defending. Honestly I feel pretty downtrodden meanwhile everyone around me keeps congratulating me for \u201cpassing\u201d.  My advisor has stressed that what I have to do is par for the course but he\u2019s also not super great at interpersonal relationships so I never know how to interpret what he says. I don\u2019t disagree with anything I\u2019m being asked to do necessarily. I\u2019m just a bit overwhelmed. Plus I\u2019ve already started a full time (non academic) job.",

I think that having an external examination is probably the more appropriate way to do examinations, both to ensure a rigorous examination, but also to ensure it is fair to the student.

My committee has been more than fair to me, sometimes I think they are too lenient really... Conversely several of my friends in other programs around the US have experienced straight up harassment and blatant personal attacks during their committee meetings and thesis defense.",

If you're starting a full-time job, you won't want to spend a ton of time redoing analysis I imagine. \n\nFor my MS, one of the revisions requested (by a committee member) would have involved re-working the entire analysis (much of which was built over time and not easily back-filled). That's not to say it couldn't be done....it just wasn't really all that necessary for the amount of work it would require. It was more of an additional step that would make my research a bit stronger for later publication in a major econ journal on its own merit. So I straight up told my major professor that I didn't have time for it, stressing that I would do the other things. He was totally understanding, tho I suspect also relieved because he had other things to attend to. \n\nOf course, later when we did publish (and now, when we're publishing again), taking the time to go back through the whole thing to really streamline the analysis back then would have been really helpful. But I have much more energy and patience to do it now. \n\nIn summary: you've passed. Now all that's left to do is figure out how to submit the dang thing so that everyone involved is reasonably satisfied. I'd figure out what you feel up to doing and create a plan of attack, including what revisions you won't do with justification, before sharing it with your major professor.\n\nEdit: whether or not you call yourself a Dr now is really a social thing. If people in your department/area do that after a defense, but before the official conferring of a degree, you're g2g. My impression has always been that while its ok to say you passed, it's a bit of a faux pas to call yourself a Doctor until you actually have the degree conferred  (realistically, this would be whenever your dissertation is accepted by the grad school or whoever after revisions).",

      "text": "I think I had an experience similar to yours. My dept only has pass/pass with revisions/fail. But my committee said I\u2019m not a doctor yet after I passed and they gave me revisions to do. This was confusing because virtually everyone I know goes on fb after their defense and says, \u201cWoo! I\u2019m Dr. Whoever!\u201d But I apparently couldn\u2019t tell people that although I passed with revisions (as is the case with these \u201cfb people\u201d). So I didn\u2019t know what to tell anyone because I didn\u2019t know what I was or where I was. If mine was a conditional pass, no one told me, but we don\u2019t have it. \n\nMy point is, I think I\u2019m in a similar boat to you. Even though we don\u2019t have \u201cwith conditions,\u201d I can only guess I got that informally. It sucks, absolutely, but we are just like the people with revisions: we have a little more to do and then we\u2019re done. \n\nCongratulations! You\u2019re all good, you\u2019re great, and it won\u2019t be long until you look back on this and you\u2019ll be too happy to care.",
