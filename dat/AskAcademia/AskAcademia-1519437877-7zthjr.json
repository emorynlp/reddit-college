  "text": "I have to train a couple of students, I have never done this before. The training periods are usually very long hours in the day, from 8am to 10pm. So I get to hang around these people a lot! Unfortunately me and the guy have started becoming good friends. The girl has additional classes and sometimes she is not present and it's just the two of us guys. The conversations tend to get less professional when she isn't around. We talk about music, about travel and our ex bosses. But also, I share my experiences with the guy. For example, how I thought of a particular solution or what i was looking for to get an idea. The girl misses these discussions. \n\nThere is a huge lack of women in the STEM world where we all are. I hate to be part of the problem by propogating the boys club. I noticed this problem in the two days I have been training them, thankfully we have a year to go.\n\nHow do I rectify the problem? I already feel the girl not enjoying working in the lab as much as the guy, and that I may be a reason. This is not that bad though, we all have fun in the lab. There laughter all around, it's just that the girl student is a bit nervous around me, while the guy student treats me like a friend. It maybe a second order problem, but I find it troubling and want to fix it. I am just starting my academic career, and want to do things right.\n\nThanks for all your help!\n\n\nUpdate:\nThank you all for your replies!\n1. I did start making notes about important things to tell her when she is not around.\n2. Yesterday, we had a breakthrough in our work and since then it has been very easy to talk. (It was something unexpected and beautiful, and I may have let or a strong of profanities which might have broken the ice). All is good now :)\n",

And their classes and labs are in a city two hours by train. So she essentially misses almost two days in a week. she is quite upset. And today she left around three hours before us to go meet her friends (which is completely okay) but she missed some exciting developments. That was when it hit me that I had inadvertently formed a 'boys club' and that there must be something I should do to include her in it as well. Unfortunately, it is easier for me to talk to the guy (he is very laid back and relaxed) and it is rather difficult for me to talk to the girl (we both are somewhat social akward and anxious, and make each other nervous). I had just ignored these things earlier thinking they were just my social ineptitude... But I will at all cost get her talking. (Today for instance we looked at some grad schools to apply to, and which profs who have gotten new grants and have funding available) I will have to tell her all of this tomorrow.",

Unfortunately me and the guy have started becoming good friends. The girl has additional classes and sometimes she is not present and it's just the two of us guys.\n\nIt would appear that these training sessions do not need to extend from 8am to 10pm. If both students need to be involved-- and need to get the same information-- then you need to shorten them and restrict them to times during which both students can attend.\n\nAs it stands, it appears to me that you're either shorting the girl what she should be getting in the way of training, or dragging things out for the guy, for whatever reason. Either way, it appears that the situation is not appropriate.\n\nIt *is* unfair that you're apparently supposed to be training both of these people, and yet one of the two-- who seems to have a legitimate reason for not being there-- is not getting everything that the other is. This is your problem, not hers. The correct response is to restrict the training to times that both students can be present. You can hang out with your friend outside of training, but you shouldn't be leaving one of the two students out.\n\nOr if both students can't be there enough of the time that you can get through what you need to cover, then, then you need to revise your training schedule so that you can do the same activities / cover the same material with each student separately within the allotted time. Frankly, there's no reason that you need to be having 12-hour marathon training sessions. That's enormously inefficient use of time, unless it literally involves multiple hours of driving to wherever you need to be.\n\n",

This follow-up is where I think things get tricky:\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is easier for me to talk to the guy (he is very laid back and relaxed) and it is rather difficult for me to talk to the girl (we both are somewhat social akward and anxious, and make each other nervous).\"\n\nI'm sure you've read all of the literature about hiring/how offices and labs end up being homogenous because of \"culture\" (i.e. humans have a natural bias toward people like ourselves).\n\nThis is where I would *strongly* encourage you to adopt a little more formality in your interactions with both students. It's possible to have a collegial workspace where people are polite, professional, and *NOT FRIENDS*. Because \"feeling friendly toward XYZ\" sets up a structure that doesn't have anything to do with job execution and has a lot to do with supporting existing biases.\n\nFor women, in particular, (but also people of color, parents, or anyone whose life is a little different from an office's \"norm\") the \"informal\" relationships game that's cultivated over beers, on the golf course or in personal conversations sets up exactly the dynamic that you're so thoughtfully trying to fight.\n\nMy granddad (also a college professor) was a personally warm and friendly character everywhere but the classroom and the lab -- where he was reserved, slightly formal, and never discussed personal matters with undergrads or grad students. (He was warmer with his longtime colleagues, but mostly while socializing off campus.) He adopted that tack in the 1960s and '70s, because it established a level playing field for his students/lab staff at a time when women and (in his case) black graduate students needed equal access to his time, attention and supervision.\n\nIt's not super fun to be formal, and it's hard to pull back toward a professional reserve once you've introduced a more casual tone, but you're in charge and you have to set the boundaries.\n\nAnd, really: Good for you for being careful with this. It's important.",

          "text": "Yes, this is SO important. It's tough because academia has a very informal culture, and that culture is often what draws people to academia versus the corporate world. Even so, if you want to attract the best students and do the best work, you need to be able to collaborate effectively with people who you wouldn't necessarily be friends with outside of a professional setting. (Related: Academics should have friends who do other things. Don't fall into the \"my work is my life, my colleagues are my friends, I don't need boundaries\" trap.)\n\nOne way to build trust with the people you manage is to make them feel supported even if/when they make mistakes. Share your own stories about, \"I remember when I was first starting out, I did XYZ and was so scared to tell my advisor about it...\" Let both students know that you'll train them to do good work but that you know it will take time for them to get the hang of it and that making mistakes is normal. Young women in particular are really prone to imposter syndrome, so opening up about your own challenges and imperfections is a good way to build rapport and help her develop confidence. ",
