  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a current postgraduate psychology student, and I am training to become a psychologist. I am looking for the perspectives of academics.\n\nI have a complex medical history, and I take multiple medications to manage my health. The university are aware of this. In 2015, the police caught me at the airport in Australia headed for the UK with opioids. I had a prescription, but it wasn't on me. They charged me with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I went to court with a lawyer, and the charge was withdrawn.\n\nWhen I applied to become a provisional psychologist, my application was significantly delayed because I had to declare my medical history, incase it was considered an 'impairment'. They were not, however, concerned by my criminal history once they understood the circumstances. I am now a registered provisional psychologist.\n\nI also applied for a Working With Children Check in October last year. They wrote to me and asked me to explain the charges. They said I had no proof that I had a prescription, so they were going to reject my application, but my lawyer and I decided to hire a forensic psychiatrist. He wrote to them, and said I am no risk to children, and I sometimes take opioids to manage severe pain, but I am not addicted to opioids. We sent the report in July, and have not heard from them since.\n\nThe university have forgotten about the WWCC, and have organised a placement as a provisional psychologist. I contacted my lawyer, and she said it is illegal for me to commence the placement. WWCC are not answerable to anyone, and are unwilling to provide a timeline.\n\nI think I need to tell the university, but I am nervous. I am worried they will think I am addicted to opioids. I am worried they will think I am lying about my criminal history - because, really, how are opioids related to working with children? I am also worried they will think the reason my registration took so long to process was because of my history. Ultimately, I am worried I will lose my place in the course.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What should I do?\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

I'm sorry for that.\n\nI think that you do absolutely have to disclose this to the university, even if there is some risk involved. On the other hand, if I were a supervising professor in this scenario, I would be enthusiastic about providing resources to the student. So, you could look at this as an opportunity to gain additional support.",

      "text": "There are a few things to consider.\n\nFirst, you don't have to disclose to the University the reason the WWDC is delayed; with COVID and everything else at the moment it is a natural to assume that there is a snafu somewhere. \n\nHowever, having a medical condition and having to take medication for it is common enough. You don't have to disclose the condition or the medication. \n\nThe problem is that if you don't disclose people's imagination can be worse than the reality. \n\nThey are likely to have dealt with this before. But if you are unsure - try going to the University counselling service first, the student guild, or someone you trust in a similar position at another university in a similar program and find out the norms for your discipline in this situation.",

Nowhere have I ever seen anyone ask \"have you ever been charged/accused of a crime?\"  It is always, do you have a *criminal* history, i.e. have you ever been convicted of a crime.\n\nThat said, FULL disclosure (to everyone, with lots of detail) is always the best option, because that just avoids trouble.  \n\nIf it were me (and I am not a psychologist nor versed in law or psychology) I would tell your advisor/relevant people about the WWCC... BUT, you can frame it appropriately, i.e. \"this stupid, idiotic bureacratically-incompetant organization has not yet signed off, for a ridiculous reason.  <explain>   Is there any way that you can help me to pressure them to get their shit together and act like the professionally-competent organization they are supposed to be?\" \n\nagain, just an opinion.",

This is definitely stressful but I think you have a lot of ways to fight it or would at least have luck with another agency, perhaps?",

Is this how the law works in Australia? If a charge is formally withdrawn then how can it be on your record or indicate criminality in any way? Sorry for the lack of help, just that is some fucking bs legal crap right there. You have my sympathies.",

In the U.S. it is illegal to discriminate based on medical history. Sounds like you live elsewhere though.  Your placement may be delayed since it sounds like there is a valid legal reason (cruddy background check board) to delay it. Maybe there is a work around? Perhaps a private school would be willing to allow your placement given your note from a forensic psychologist? You won't know unless you ask.",

Explain the situation exactly as you described it, there were charges for not having your prescription on you and then they were dropped. You can tell them that this gets flagged in background checks but you have a lawyer that has been helping you.  Most importantly, that your lawyer advises you not to start any placement until everything is resolved.  \n\nAt least speaking for the clinical psychology faculty I work with, this would not negatively impact you in the program.  They would have probably said they wished you told them earlier so they knew you would probably need more lead time before placements to work things out.  \n\nThat being said, there is no reason to tell others beyond what you feel comfortable sharing.  There could a single administrator that would have to know to help facilitate something, but we know how to deal with confidential things.",
