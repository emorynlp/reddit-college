      "text": "This is an impossible question to answer without more information. In fact, it fails my \"answers are proportionate to the question asked\" criteria. Nonetheless. It really depends on the institution. If you work for a top-10 SLAC (Williams, Swarthmore, Pomona) then you have to really do the work in your area of specialization. I'm at a research-focused SLAC and you can't get away with pedagogical work or \"applied service\" work. Expectation is about 1 paper per year in my field.\n\nExpectations differ widely in different areas, but in hard sciences, a postdoc is expected and 3-4 papers for tenure (making approximations). If you are in a field where you can run 4 studies in a summer, then the expectations will be higher. No idea about humanities areas (I'm in STEM).\n\nOverall, I think the load is reasonable if you have a good teaching load, institutional support for research, and/or good undergraduate research students. My institution supports pre-tenure sabbaticals which made all the difference in the world for me. More details are necessary for better feedback. (which you should know better if you are asking this question)",
