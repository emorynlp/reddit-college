  "title:": "How can a student start practicing critical thinking rather than memorization of facts?",
  "text": "Hello r/AskAcademia,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently in Grade 10, taking the Academic stream. It deals with more abstract concepts and prepares you for university. If you need any more background information please let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI notice that in school, particularly in Science, that I am really bad at applying the concepts we just learned to real life situations. I do just fine in the knowledge and communication aspect of a test, but I struggle in the application section and usually leave the thinking section blank. That just shows that I really don't have a solid grasp of that concept. I get really emotional when the thinking parts of a test show up, and I start panicking because it illuminates just how stupid I really am. In the end, I leave it blank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm asking is how I can better understand any scientific concept I'm trying to learn from a textbook. My current strategy is to just to spend multiple hours flipping through the pages and reading and re-reading the text in my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2018/12/29: Thank you everyone for commenting on my post! You all gave me many tips on how to effectively practice critical thinking. It's currently the break as of writing this update and I'm currently in a position where I can get ahead in my Science class, particularly in the climate unit. I don't plan on wasting any time. I'll try participating in the class more, when the break is over, so I can better understand the inner workings of a concept we are learning.",

Snyder](https://tccl.arcc.albany.edu/knilt/images/a/a5/Teaching_critical_thinking.pdf)\n\nRelevant bit:\n\n>students\u2019 critical thinking is best supported when instructors use critical questioning techniques to engage students actively in the learning process. Sample questions from all these studies include the following:\n\n* What do you think about this? ? \n\n* Why do you think that?\n* What is your knowledge based upon?\n* What does it imply and presuppose? \n* What explains it, connects to it, leads from it? \n* How are you viewing it? \n\n* Should it be viewed differently?\n\n>These questions require students to evaluate the clarity and accuracy of their thinking as well as the depth and breadth of their thinking. Have they considered all the alternatives? Do they know why they think the way they do? Students need to determine whether the content they are using is relevant and if their thinking process is logical. By questioning their thought process, students can begin thinking about their thinking.\n\nIt's a nice read.\n\n",

      "text": "Instead of focusing on memorization, try and understand the concepts in an interconnected way (like a big web) that ties everything together. For instance, within a given unit, understand how all the individual concepts come together to form the big picture. This might take practice but by doing this, you not only have memorized the content, but you understand how everything is connected which then leads you to understanding the cause and effect, significantly improving your ability to think critically. Also, test yourself using quizlit or any online questions you can find on the concepts that involve critical thinking over memorization. One final thing too is when it comes time to take your tests, don\u2019t be caught up in the facts and straight memorization; instead, trust your studying that has allowed you to form a deep understanding, and try your best to stay calm and trust your critical thinking. While this might seem minor, having a clear head and not being overly stressed really does improve ones\u2019 ability to think in a clear and concise manner. In the end, it really comes down to not merely memorizing something (while this is important), but understanding the deeper meaning such as the why, how, and the cause and effect, which overall just expands your general knowledge on a topic in a way which prioritizes how deep your stream of understanding goes, rather than how wide the stream runs. I\u2019m currently in grade 12 and in the process of improving my study techniques and critical thinking which has really proved to be the key in taking your standardized test scores to the next level, as well as really succeeding in your most difficult AP/IB courses.

It would be counterproductive, for example, to hypothesize that if I drop a rubber ball it won\u2019t fall to the ground. We can rely on the law of gravity to work because it has never not worked. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t think critically. If someone said that the ball is attracted to the ground because of magnetism, we could reject the hypothesis by showing that rubber isn\u2019t a ferrous or magnetic material.\n\nNatural laws aren\u2019t anything \u201cmythic\u201d, they\u2019re reliable, observable phenomena that govern the physical universe and always work. There has to be a *ton* of evidence to define a physical law. \n\nThe humanities, on the other hand, allow for magic and all sorts of other things that I would truly call \u201cnonsense\u201d. I use your word here because there is *no sense* (logically) to claim the existence of something for which there is no evidentiary basis in reality. \n\nP.S. My main point is that the type of thinking you describe has its place, but that place is not in the sciences. ",

The perspective you get from economics literature might be completely different than a historical perspective or a political science one. The more of these different lenses you can think about and compare and contrast, the more complex of an answer you can formulate to include all the different angles. Honestly most of todays problems need this type of interdisciplinary solution. To think critically is to think about all the possible implications",
