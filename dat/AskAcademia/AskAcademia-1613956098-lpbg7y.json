      "text": "Had my first during graduation week of my first year on the tenure track, so I was pregnant basically my entire first year. Didn\u2019t really get a maternity leave, and the second year (when she was a baby) was tough! She was a horrible sleeper and I was exhausted the whole time. Just had my second ten months ago and insisted on having the fall semester off. That was a much better experience (for obvious reasons). Got tenure this past summer. I\u2019m at a teaching-heavy institution, so my lack of time to publish wasn\u2019t held against me because I did well in other areas (teaching, committee work, department chairing, grant-writing, etc.). \n\nIt is hard because I essentially have no \u201cme\u201d time. When I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m parenting, period. And with the pandemic I\u2019ve had no childcare, so that\u2019s really been a struggle.\n\nSo, yes, it\u2019s doable, and being a mom is wonderful. But it\u2019s far from easy. You may want to check out the books \u201cMama PhD\u201d and \u201cDo Babies Matter?\u201d\u2014I read them when I had baby fever in grad school and they helped me think through what I might be in for.",

He\u2019s over half way done with his career, so my options are to get an online PhD - so far my only option has been in an online school though, and they will not provide clinical experience so it would have to be in Ed or Abnormal Psychology. I\u2019ve done as much research as I could and those two programs are all I could find that made sense with my background and lifestyle. My other option would be to wait until this duty station is finished, then start a program at our next location and stay there and look for employment after he\u2019s finished *his entire career*. That\u2019s right, he will have retired by the time I start and *we are the same age*. I can get certificates along the way, I can quit now and go back to work (almost impossible with a 4 year old in a pandemic) or start a PhD now and hope for the best (probably not reasonable to do that). Realistically, my best option is to wait until we get our next orders to move, then start working after he retires. \n\nI haven\u2019t typed that out in a while, it\u2019s ... unsettling but the truth.

I know plenty of people who had babies in graduate school and during their first years on the tenure track, at many different kinds of institutions. It can be done, but you may also want to feel out how family-friendly the institution is on interviews. When I was on the job market, people went out of their way to do tell me about the culture of the department/college/university, even though certain kinds of things were off-limits/illegal- like, they are not allowed to ask a candidate about family status, but search committee members would say things like, \"I don't know if you have a family and please don't feel like you need to share anything, but if you do, this is a great place to raise a family....\"",

I'm now almost done with my 2nd semester of my masters, and considering I also want a professorship w/tenure track, I have a lot more schooling ahead of me. I've had to miss A LOT of my daughter's life due to my school. I've only attended 2 back-to-school nights, I've missed parent-teacher conferences, ice skating lessons, and many more. Luckily I have a very wide support net and her father and I are still very happily married. If you decide to adopt during your schooling, please make sure you have a large support net which includes people that can take your child to their important events, and be prepared to have to miss a few things. \n\nBut on the bright side, you will be showing your child that hard work and dedication pays off in the end! Good luck potentially future momma!!",

      "text": "Currently a PhD student with my first due in June. Having a baby makes it even less likely that I\u2019ll be applying widely to TT jobs, because my husband is also in academia and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to follow me, and I don\u2019t want to split the family up like that. Then again, I didn\u2019t want to live apart from my husband to start with, so that\u2019s not a massive change to my plans. I like my research and being a student in my program is honestly pretty great, but I\u2019m not sure TT is in my future at this point. To be fair though, my field has a very very low number of TT jobs to start with. Idk, I\u2019m just along for the ride at this point\u2014we\u2019ll see where it takes me!",

The key is having reliable, affordable child care. we started using a daycare when my son was about 8 months. With childcare and a supportive partner I\u2019ve found juggling motherhood and an academic career a great fit for me and I\u2019ve been pretty successful. Good papers, fellowships, job interviews...Then the pandemic hit. Without reliable, all day childcare it\u2019s very obvious who is making progress and who isn\u2019t. Papers aren\u2019t getting finished, work is piling up and I\u2019m missing out on collaboration opportunities because My \u2018time is so limited\u2019. But you know, my priorities have changed. I was very career-driven, but now I just want my kid to be happy and healthy. And that takes precedent during times like this. So am I (or will I be) the successful, well known academic I set out to be? Probably not. Will I get a job and work just enough so my family has their needs met. Eh Hopefully.",

I do want to say, make sure you have a strong support network. There is no way to know how your body will respond to pregnancy and while you get a lot of flex time in grad school you don't get a lot of official time off, unless you take an unpaid leave of absence. I've had Hyperemesis Gravidarum and there is absolutely no way I would have been able to continue officially working (I say officially because I've fallen behind on many of deadlines) without the immense support of my partner. I'm literally on bedrest, my partner does all the cooking/cleaning, and does everything else to keep me alive. I do not want to scare you, being this sick isn't common. But pregnancy is hard and having someone to help (anyone!) can go along way in keeping you on track in your career.",

Many of these positions get literally hundreds of applicants each, and plenty of talented academics fail to reach tenure track (my spouse is one of them, and we've had to put off starting a family as a result). If you're unable to get a stable job post-PhD, do you have a backup plan for how you're going to financially provide for your child? \n\nAlso, if you don't get a tenure track job right away when you finish your PhD, you could find yourself teetering on the edge of unemployment and/or moving states every 1-3 years, chasing postdocs and/or VAP/lecturer positions in order to try and stay employed in academia while applying to tenure track jobs. \n\nYou may want to consider waiting until you're in a more stable financial and living situation before becoming a parent.",
