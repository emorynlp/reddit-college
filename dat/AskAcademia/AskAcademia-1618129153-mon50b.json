  "title:": "Over a month ago I posted about my challenges with TT interviews and campus visits. I was feeling pretty down, but I decided to continue interviewing. I recently accepted a TT...and I wanted to thank those of you that encouraged me to continue interviewing. You were right...",
  "text": "I accepted a TT offer and I am so excited about this opportunity. The department seems really great, they are incredibly collaborative, and it is like night and day from the first campus visit I had. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you to all of you that encouraged me to continue interviewing. You were right. When you find a good fit with the department, it is SO much easier to make it through the campus visit and it was much more collegial. I was treated like a colleague. Thank you. \n\n...And just wanted to briefly say thanks to all of you who serve on search committees. As a candidate, I am grateful for all the work you put in to make campus visits work despite all the covid challenges. You all are the real deal.",
