  "title:": "Collaborator wants me to do a postdoc but I'm not sure...",
  "text": "I'm in the final year of my PhD (Physics) and up until now had planned on moving to industry. I wasn't planning on looking for a postdoc position as I haven't really enjoyed my project and the whole process has really taken its toll on my mental health and self esteem.\n\nOut of the blue, one of my collaborators at another university emailed me asking if I would be interested in doing a postdoc with them. The postdoc would be in a similar field to my current research but the work would be more simulation based rather than 'real data'. This would require a lot of effort getting up to scratch as I have no experience with simulations plus I would have to move to another country. \n\nThey have also invited me to give a seminar at their department - this is really scary to me as I have only given 10 minute talks at conferences and I always found the Q&A very tough. I struggle to think on the spot and feel my knowledge is lacking.\n\nI guess I am a little flattered that someone potentially wants to work with me and in a way I have been feeling like a failure or 'not smart enough' for considering leaving academia. I am also scared that if I leave academia now, that door is closed forever as in my area it is very hard to return. However, I do know that there are plenty of opportunities in industry for me too (haven't actually applied yet though).\n\nAm I being silly even considering this offer even though it goes against everything I thought up until now? Does anyone have any interesting thought on postdoc vs industry?",

Everyone wants a collaborator. Everyone wants you to fill out a survey. Everyone thinks this job is a good move. Everyone has a need, a want, and an opinion that pulls you in one direction or another.\n\nIt's great to get offers, but decide what's best for you by your own definition of success.",

Do you think your PhD lab has been unusual or unrepresentative?\n\nLastly, Im not sure how difficult the move will be on you that could be very tough hard to say, but the time only a year or two thats really no time at all.

For me, I left after securing a TT position. The accumulation of a number of \"norms\" keeping me poor finally caught up with me to the point that I could no longer support myself in my place of employment, and my colleagues who all loudly espoused positions of Diversity and Inclusion told me that I was dealing with a personal problem. So I had no choice but to resign. They only offered to help me after I'd relocated my family across the country and submitted my resignation letter. \n\nI was making 75k.
