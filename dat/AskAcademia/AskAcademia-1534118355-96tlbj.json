Only a few at the top.\n\nIn my experience of dealing with European academics this is also the case on much of the continent. Indeed, it seems like it's perhaps only the US and Canada where \"professor\" is commonly used to refer to academics of all ranks.\n\nAs wikipedia says (yes, I know wikipedia, just go with it):\n\n>In most systems of academic ranks the word \"professor\", and particularly the unqualified word, only refers to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as \"full professor\".[2][3] In some countries or institutions, the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor; this is particularly the case in the United States, where the word professor is sometimes used colloquially to refer to anyone in an academic post.[4] This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect nearly everywhere else.",

Going by first names with your students is a way of leveling the playing field, so to speak, and fostering more critical thinking.  \n\nThat's not to say you didn't work your ass for for your doctorate - because you absolutely did.  And if your colleagues expect their students to call them by Dr, then they should give you that same courtesy.  Or if you want to be called Dr that's what you should be called.\n\nBut just.. going by a first name has its benefits, as well.

Yikes! However, he simply did not know how to address me and tried his best so I did not hold it against him. \n\nI tell this story because many times this comes from students not knowing what to call you. Correcting them is teaching them the proper way to address any professor. It's not bitchy or insecure, even if some people (i.e. this was a big thing on Twitter recently) tells you it is! ",

My next step up is \"Look, I worked hard for my doctorate, you can at least respect that by acknowledging it.\" Final step: don't respond to anything other than correct title and name. \n\nTalk to your admin too. In my role of admin I correct A LOT of students. Standard:\n\n\"Is Miss X here?\"\n\n\"No, but Dr X is.\"\n.....\n\n\"Where is Mrs X's office?\"\n\n\"Do you mean Dr. X? Her office is down the hall/corridor.\" \n\n.......\n\nOr my fav so far with Dr X being our chair/head of department (female) and Dr Y being our assistant chair/deputy head (male):\n\n\"Is Dr Y or Miss X here?\"\n\n\"Dr Y is not, but his boss Dr X might be.\" ",

My own undergrad was 100% \"Dr.\" Grad school is a wash, I have no idea what the undergrads called professors.

In my department (and field more broadly) I'd call someone who's tenured and has a PhD \"professor\" because the work to get tenure required the PhD and then lots of additional effort beyond that.

I can understand wanting the appropriate title for formal introductions, like meetings and conferences, but at University students call everyone by their first name. That means everyone from the tutor all the way up the the Vice Chancellor (the Dean). Expectations otherwise would seem very snobbish. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this to belittle the OP\u2019s feelings on the question particularly if she see\u2019s other people getting the sort of treatment she doesn\u2019t. I just wanted to weigh in from a different cultural perspective. ",

Being a very tall, broad, and pretty serious looking guy, students are generally fairly respectful, regardless of my (pretty nonexistent) system of discipline. For my wife, it is another matter. She needs to stress the Dr. and and put her foot down a lot more. Being called by your title is a sign of authority that can be very helpful in asserting control when you don\u2019t have other traditional markers of authority. Women are especially prone to this. Comparing our student evals is just awful - I don\u2019t know how women in the profession deal with the constant sexualization (or being called motherly - the whole mother, whore, or goddess stereotyping). The title is another reminder there is more to them. Both for students and themselves. ",
