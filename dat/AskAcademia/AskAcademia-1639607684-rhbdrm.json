  "text": "Biomedical research\n\nPhd\n\nNetherlands\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello,\n\nI have a big problem and I don t know how to tackle it or if there is something I should do that I am not aware of because of bad mentoring or mentoring whatsoever. So, work on biomedical research for quite some time now, over 10 years. I have a Ph.D. I have a lot of work done but none of it is published yet. I have the following problem, I have prepared the drafts and everything and from then on I get in lowest priority of the corresponding authors. To the point that for an additional experiment before a corresponding author approves the manuscript 6 months or more pass. To the point that my PhD advisor spent the last 3 years just revising the text of the manuscript - we sent it twice got rejected sent it again and after one year in revisions when nothing was done it was decided to send to another journal, now we are 4 months in revisions and the revisions were minor with a deadline of 2 weeks. The other advisor sends me an email as URGENT and ccs other people to make me respond and I spend the next weeks emailing him AND HE DOESN T RESPOND!!!!! I don t know why my PhD advisor tells me he has to approve everything or to wait for him more to make some slight changes. He found me to exercise his perfectionism disability? The other explicitly told me that he has to make the manuscript according to his wishes otherwise he doesn't want to participate in th paper. Can this happen? I mean how do other people publish? Or only the people with advisors that like them ( I guess this is it because to others the same advisors don t delay that much) publish?\n\nNow I want to resubmit and the second author has the revised figure and I cannot resubmit. For a reason I have to wait. \n\nI am fed up.\n\nHow do people handle it, especially when advisors/ corresponding authors want to have the last word but leave it when they have time and motivation for them? Is there something that I don t know and I am taken advantage of for their amusement/bullying and ultimately convenience?\n\nLike i FEEL MY CAREER IS RUINED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention that the phd advisor in his letter to the editor apologised saying that the first author had a serious medical issue - yes I got a stroke and could not change 2 sentences!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest",

      "text": "I\u2019m not sure how you manage your workflow but it seems off. In my field the first author has the final say on the writing, second has a lot of influence, and everyone else can contribute their sections but often those contributions aren\u2019t *vital*. If I\u2019m first on a paper I give people deadlines and say that if revisions aren\u2019t given to me by X date I\u2019ll move forward without them. The time I give is reasonable and I send reminders. This process is established early in the project so there are no hard feelings. I find that more often than not people are happy to have someone take the lead and make the final decisions. \n\nThat said, if your collaborators are delaying things too much it\u2019s time to find new ones.",

      "text": "Hi there,\n\nWell, based on your supervisors/ co-authors behavior, it is clear that your papers or line of work do not have their priority. Obviously, they want to exert control but not put the hours into it. That is a sad realization.\n\nOn the other side, this does not have to be taken personal. They are probably super busy  and might not be fully aware of the situation they are putting you in. It seems you are emailing with them mostly. It is easy to overlook or forget about an email.... Have you tried to talk to them one-on-one?\n\nMy situation improved dramatically after I got one of my (mostly absent/super thinly spread) supervisors to take on the role of a mentor. It was awkward at first, but after I shared my anxiety and frustration, this person became a solid help for me. At least no more papers lying around for months on their desk, and more trust from their part to submit papers without their final say.\n\nGood luck",

          "text": "This is great advice. OP you need to try a different strategy and find a way to get this work moving.\n\nTwo things in the post jumped out at me. The first was about them sending emails saying things are urgent and then you sending lots of emails back and getting no response. Now obviously, I don't know what was in any of those emails but I've seen this happen several times in my career and what is often happening is the person sending the first email is saying \"these are the things that need addressing/I'm worried about, please address them\" and then the person responds to them either wanting a discussion about it or addressing the concerns in the email but the sender doesn't want a conversation and doesn't want the concerns addressed in an email they just want the paper sorted and they want you to do it. So stop emailing back and just make the changes or don't but have a reason for not. If you need something from them to make the change send a short direct email stating what you want and when you need it by. \n\nSecondly, you seem very upset your PI told the editor you were sick, but you were. It was the truth and informing colleagues that work is delayed due to illness is perfectly acceptable - going into detail is not. \n\nThis and your defensive response above makes me think this is a two-sided problem where both sides are making mistakes but ultimately you're the one suffering so you're the one who is going to have to take the actions to fix it. Fair? Maybe not, but that's the job sometimes.",

              "text": "I address the concerns immediately. Any other conversation is additional. In general, I do also more that I am supposed to do immediately without delay mainly because I get addicted once I start - that s why I like research and my field of study. I am pretty sure this is just bullying from their side along with me being uninformed about my rights and how to ask for them maybe? For example, we have a response from a reviewer who completely disregarded an experiment according to his recommendations. I did what the CA asked and then told him to write to the editor just in case he sees that we asnwer the question or give more detail so that we don t have the same problem again. Yes, I will do it. One week later...nothing. I write the letter...no response. I ask what to do, he replies...\\*Gosh, you don tunderstand that I have other things to do? I am in a committee that evaluates proposals (!!!!!!!!!!) - as if they have more priority than my paper\\*. This is a joke, ridiculous. As if they say to me I put your career in lowest priority... And we have deadline for the revisions. How to tackle this bullying?",

Why don't you write to the editor? You're first author you can do that? \n\nAt this stage I would compile a list of outstanding issues. Draft a plan to address them, with you doing absolutely as much as you can (because it's clear they won't) and them give them a deadline and the position that this has been going on for a while now, it's critical to get it finished so if you aren't able to pull the remaining material together you will incorporate that in the response to the editor. \n\nIt's either take it over or walk away at this point. Your collaborators have made it very clear this isn't a priority for them and they're not going to fix it. That's not great of them but it happens.",

I don t know, usualy when I do sth then they don t talk to me because I took the initiative wihtout asking them. There is this narcissistic disorder of theirs. \n\nBut at the end of the day you are right. \n\nIt is also the other thing, either I am accused of being pressurising them/annoying that I don t understand, or I am downright aggressive. They have taken disputes in another level by accusing me of being aggressive and fighting with them all the time to the point that I try to remain calm and not raise any issue.
