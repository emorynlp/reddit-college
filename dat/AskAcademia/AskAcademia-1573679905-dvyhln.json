          "text": "I will be presenting a linguistic topic, my current research on Vowel Harmony in an African language. \n\nEssentially, the literature has generally viewed vowel harmony as being a single process, regardless of the directionality (left to right / right to left) I'm arguing that there's enough evidence^1 from this African language to suggest that we should consider vowel harmony, especially in cases where it's bidirectional, as not one single process, but two different processes to be analyzed as such.\n\nI'm also using a relatively new, albeit slightly controversial framework. I'm not sure how it will go, or how it will be received, but I believe in my analysis and in my research.\n\n\nFor background purpose, vowel harmony is a process where, within a single domain (typically a word) vowels are going to become more similar to each other in different features. (height (/i/ is pronounced with your tongue in a higher position than /a/ for example), backness (/i/ is pronounced with your tongue closer to your teeth and front of mouth than /u/), and more. \n\nBy similarity I mean that if we have a harmony for backness, and we take a root word with front vowels, say /pik/ (phonetic notation, where i is a front vowel) and we attach to this root a morpheme /u/ (phonologically back) this result in the word /pik-u/. Applying back vowel harmony to this form will yield not /pik-u/, but /pik-y/, where /y/ is also pronounced at the front of the mouth.  (this vowel is pronounced like the French /u/ sound, so a high, front and round vowel, which contrast with /u/, \u00e0 high, back and round vowel. \n\n1. By evidence I mean that the left to right harmony present drastic differences from the harmony that goes right to left.",

I know what it's like to be excited about academic achievements and not really having the people to share it with.   I'm excited for you, that is great news.   The more you do, the more will come.  Keep up with the hard work!\n\n I just learned today that my philosophy professor entered a paper I wrote for a scholarship and that I am one of ten finalists in consideration for the award! Even if I don't get the scholarship it is a huge win for me, and no one outside of my academic circle understands what it means.\n\nAnyways, again congratulations on your success!  Keep it up!!",

It's an opportunity I was given and I seized it, but in no way does it make me a better scholar or person than you. I'm just working on something different than you did.\n\nI'm absolutely certain you have good things that I don't have. Just keep going and don't start thinking about what you should have done in undergrad. You did what you did, and if it puts you somewhere where you are satisfied, then what you did was enough. And if it wasn't, if you are not happy, then use the person that you are now, with the experience you've acquired, to make yourself happy.",

But you shouldn't give too much importance to the voices in your head that tells you you're unworthy.\n\nYou made it to your master, you're doing your thesis, it's a great achievement. I'm not you, and I don't know you, so I can't tell you if you're able to be in Academia without it being just niceties. If love to, but it wouldn't be faire. \n\nJust be kind to yourself.
