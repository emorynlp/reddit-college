At one position I applied for, the previous postdoc had left and people wouldn't tell me why beyond saying 'there were personality conflicts.' Soon, I found out what that meant.\n\nAs I prepared to interview, the PI kept pushing an earlier start date, ignored my personal schedule for the summer, moved the interview date earlier, criticized me when I didn't communicate well beforehand (I was on vacation right after defending, as explained in my emails), criticized me for not showing up early the morning of (we still had hours before my talk, and the time zone was several hours different), criticized my vegetarian choice at lunch, criticized my outfit, then went on a rant about cats after I said I'd be moving with mine. It wasn't truly mean spirited, but good grief!\n\nThe talk went fine, but of course there was no way I was taking the job. Did I see her perspective? Sure. At first I was thinking, '*Why didn't I plan to head in earlier?*' and '*Why did some of these miscommunications happen?*' but then I remembered how pushy she was with the dates and realized there just hadn't been much time to plan. Of course, when there's grant money burning, you're really eager to hire someone, but work with me here...\n\nFast-forward a week later after I've let her know I don't want the position and she subsequently emails multiple professors in my department to complain about me, to say I only took the interview to visit friends in the area, and basically to sabotage my future prospects. It's just mind-blowing. I feel bad for anyone who ends up working for her.",

Any paper will almost always be \"the new paper from the PI lab\". The postdoc can use it to get more fellowships to get to work for the fame of another PI but doesn't get the main benefit.       \nThey of course hope that collecting all these papers in their CV will give them an advantage too, but the harsh truth is that the majority of postdocs get stuck at that level and just worked their ass of to make all their PI's more famous and give *them* more ground to do science while the postdocs themselves often don't even know if they still have a job next year and if so: where and under which conditions.",

It was only a 14 month position, and it started 6 months in, so I just kept my head down and finished it. My second postdoc of course has a little, because that's kind of how academia is, but it's at a level that's doable.\n\nI did also recieve xenophobia a lot during my second postdoc. Most of that was outside of the institute though, by the general public.... blah!",
