  "title:": "Why do people say anthropology is worthless?",
  "text": "I am currently a biochemistry/premed major, but I've been wanting to switch to anthropology. A lot of people say this is not a good idea and don't support this decision while calling it a \"useless\" degree. Why is that? I understand you aren't going to be an anthropologist straight out of undergrad with a bachelor's degree. However, I feel I could argue MANY undergrad degrees require more schooling such as masters or Ph.D. to open more careers actually in their intended field. So wouldn't something as anthropology provide good/marketable traits for universally most jobs that just require a bachelor's degree?",

      "text": "Anthropology provides a great skillset, it\u2019s just that so many people view college as vocational training, and if you don\u2019t get a job in your chosen field (in this case, as a literal anthropologist) then it\u2019s considered a \u201cwaste.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with training for a vocation (I did actually become an academic, so for me liberal arts education really was vocational training), but it\u2019s not an apprenticeship\u2014 you\u2019re meant to learn a broad range of skills beyond just \u201cthis is how to do x.\u201d If you learn how to think critically, articulate and express your ideas, and navigate unfamiliar topics then you will have considerable strengths over job candidates who can\u2019t do those things. You will need to learn how to identify and present those strengths to employers, but you won\u2019t be at a disadvantage unless you\u2019re trying specifically to go into a career in STEM. \n\nAs a quick example, I have a PhD in the humanities and I worked briefly as a market research analyst. I was basically doing an ethnography but with the end result of making a product better, rather than for the sake of knowledge itself. Your skills will be transferable, and you will be fine.",

      "text": "I am generalising here, but in my experience undergraduate life science students tend to look down on every field that isn't medicine-related (with the exception of comp sci and engineering). Even though a very small percentage of them will go to medical school, they all refer to themselves as premeds and tend to act like they are already doctors. When I have to TA physics courses for life science students they constantly complain about how it's useless and it won't help them become a doctor. Obviously not all of them are like this, but I have found these snobby attitudes are way more common in life sciences than in most other fields. I wouldn't take their concerns too seriously.  \n\n\nEdit: If you've been thinking about switching for a while then please don't let other people's opinions stop you. You *will* regret it later if you stay in biochemistry solely because other people told you anthropology was worthless.",

      "text": "I think anthro can be a tremendously useful and versatile degree! At its core it's just the study of humans, with a great many methods and subdisciplines falling under its umbrella. But one's marketability in the job search depends a lot on precisely *which* methods were focused on. For example, a student working in medical anthropology + anthropological genetics could be very competitive for biomedical informatic positions. One that leans heavily into the digital humanities, focusing on developing and applying snazzy new Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision models to some corpus of texts or artworks etc. might have an easy time finding work in many tech spaces. Those who focus their studies on describing and understanding the drivers of human behavior -- say, applying spatially-aware MrP to cultural survey data, with strong emphasis on e.g. do-calculus and decision theory -- might find gainful employ as UX researchers or data scientists or whatever.\n\nAt least, that's been my experience as an anthro grad (currently working in / studying comp bio, w/ lotsa friends finding work at e.g. consumer genotyping & precision medicine companies). My department was explicitly separate from the more ethnography etc. focused \"cultural anthropology\" dept, and we never really interacted lol, so I know less about career prospects there (which I found kind of odd tbh -- we had 3 of Boas' 4 subfields and then some, where they had just the one... but maybe they had lots of extra stuff too).",

      "text": "Obviously they are thinking of employment opportunities, but the word \"useless\" is an exaggeration. You simply will have more employment opportunities with higher pay as a biochem major than you will as an anthropology major. There was an article some time ago where a high up executive at a recruiting firm said that undergrad degrees in generalized majors like \"area studies\" and also anthropology were \"useless\" for finding a job. The top starting salaries are all science/engineering ([https://fortune.com/2021/09/01/highest-paying-college-majors-starting-salaries/](https://fortune.com/2021/09/01/highest-paying-college-majors-starting-salaries/)). But that doesn't mean you can't be employed either as an anthropologist or in some other field with that degree. You should also love what you are doing. Have you considered medical/physical anthropology? It could be a way of combining the two. Your university should have stats on job prospects by undergrad major, which can help you understand your prospects. Good luck.",

What that means is that, for employers, they are going to use past experiences with grads with the same degree as you to judge your worth. You\u2019re going to be dinged for the fact that it appears to be a softer major.\n\nIt\u2019s why math/comp sci are so valued; the skill sets acquired lead to positive views of their abilities.\n\nYou can succeed as an anthropology major, but you start at a disadvantage.",

      "text": "I would never tell someone not to study what they want to study, but I understand where such people are coming from. Yes, many careers require further education, but degrees that can at least get you started on a career with just the bachelors - engineering, CS, nursing, whatever - are at an obvious premium in an educational climate where people must mortgage their lives for a master's with hazy employment prospects in a field that they have at best a hypothetical understanding of. \"I'll just get a master's\" is actually a huge financial and just life gamble, and one that I'm not sure many undegrads understand.\n\nAnyway, I think the most important thing in your bachelor's is to have a plan. I had many undergrad classmates who studied stuff like literature, poli sci, psych or whatever, but who had a clear career goal, understood how their major complemented that goal either by being sorta related or being low-key enough that they could focus on other things, and crucially, did the extracurricular stuff that they needed to do to have a job by graduation. I think the worry sometimes with people studying a degree that isn't a selling point in itself is that they're a bit directionless and just expecting the job stuff to resolve itself at some point. And sure, for some it does, but others can get stuck in a situation where they must wake up to how much living costs, to the fact that maybe they must pay loans back, and they're still underemployed and have little idea how to fix that. And then the ruinous-masters-out-of-desperation situation arises, which is a bad one to be in.\n\nI don't know if that made very much sense, but basically the \"I'll just get a masters\" crowd worries people for the reasons amply outlined in [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773).",
