  "title:": "Do you have any advice for becoming more articulate in class discussions and other academic settings?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a 24 year old female student. I love my classes, most of which are small, discussion heavy seminars on English literature. I am always a very active participant in class, despite my nerves. In fact, I get so excited that I often have to stop myself from monopolizing the conversation.\n\nOne of my classes this semester is recorded on Zoom, and of curiosity I decided to listen to the recording. Boy, was it mortifying! I mean, I knew that I wasn\u2019t the most confident speaker, In the recording I sounded like a total idiot and probably quite annoying to listen to. So embarrassing I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve gone this long sounding like this. \n\nMy issues: \n\n1.) No eye contact while speaking \n\n2.) saying \u201cLike\u201d all time\n\n3.) Interrupting myself, contradicting, second guessing\n\n4.) saying too much at once\n\n5.) going on tangents\n\n6.) apologizing randomly \n\n7.) fidgeting weirdly \n\n8.) nervous tics  \n\nHow do you all become good at speaking/lecturing/having academic discussions without sounding like an idiot? \n\nBy the way, yes, I have ADHD and anxiety but I am in therapy and take medicine for all of it. Off meds and without therapy I\u2019d be much worse.",

      "text": "* Understand opportunity costs (those costs being your audience's time and interest). If I think other people in the room get a concept I try to give them the room, and focus my energy on actual knowledge or perspective gaps I see in the conversation. This allows us all to shine and build a more constructive dialogue where words are used efficiently.\n\n* Understand your peers' conversational and conceptual style. Sometimes when I monopolize conversation it's because I'm assuming common ground and trying to hurry the conversation along. Listening for the nuance of other perspectives is good mental floss that will make your points more useful because you're not glossing over.\n\n* Take your moment before speaking. In academia a lot of smart people start talking quickly when they get excited, and it's easy to get caught up in that and start talking before you know what you're trying to say. It's okay to ask for 20 seconds to think through a response. It's okay to pause mid-idea and reorient yourself. People don't remember silences, but they do remember what comes after. This has been crucial for me as somebody who talks by thinking, and it does wonders for filler words like like.\n\n* Pick your eye contact people. This is easier without zoom but I always pick a few people in the audience that are my main eye contact. Usually somebody with a responsive face and somebody with a stone face. It works better if they're in different parts of the room so you can scan the rest of the audience.",

      "text": "A large part might stem from the online setting. You cannot really make eye contact on Zoom without it being rather weird; if you are looking at the person you are speaking to then you are not looking at the webcam and thus seem to be looking away. If you focus on the webcam you won\u2019t see and won\u2019t be able to react to the facial expressions of your conversation partner. It is rather difficult to simulate eye contact in that setting so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it.\n\nAlso, I believe that if you listen to your own voice it sounds really bad to you yourself but that there is no difference for other people listen to a recording of you voice.",

      "text": "I've participated in research (so, getting to see the process from the other side) in which the interviewer basically started out apologizing, saying she was just trying her best - being obviously insecure. Don't do this! Prefacing contributions as \"I'm probably wrong but...\" or \"I'm sorry, this is probably totally wrong but...\" is a habit a lot of people (including me) need to break. Usually there is absolutely no need to do this  - just straightforwardly offer your contribution and see how people respond. Ask yourself - did I do or say anything that warrants an apology? 99% of the time the answer is no. Stick to your guns and realize that you're much more articulate and prepared than you think you are most of the time. \n\nI still have nervous tics and fidget a lot but it's gotten a lot better as I've spent many years in my program. A lot of what you describe is learned behavior, sort of a counterproductive mechanism to protect yourself from negative feedback, but that also means you can unlearn it. And yes, there will be negative feedback along the way - the key is to not take it personally at all, and instead see it as an opportunity to learn.",

              "text": "My biggest advice to change your mind, and any graduate students or more senior undergraduates, is talk to or mentor lower year students. You'll suddenly realize how much you've learned and adjusted how you tackle a problem. \n\nAcademia is a group of students progressively learning similar things together so you can't see how far you've come because everyone around you is learning similar things. If you talk to someone two years earlier in the academic process you'll realize things you take for granted as common knowledge they will think of as a profound level of understanding. \n\nThe reason why you notice your mistakes more is you understand what you were trying to say. Everyone else has to use most of their attention to process and unpack your ideas so they won't notice the fidgeting and \"likes\". My recommendation fo improving is pausing and taking a breath between sentences, it gives you time to more concretely compose your thoughts. This helps with the contradictions and saying \"like\" as well as giving the audience time to think about what you are saying.",

So now I don't fidgit much and I rarely use a \"like\" (when I'm in formal-speaking-mode anyway), and these days I am working on reducing self-interruptions and tangents. \n\nI got a lot better at eye contact in the before-times but these days (over zoom) I'm not worrying about it. It's a bonus goal. Just gotta remember to not turn my face away from the microphone.\n\nTL;DR every time you talk, focus on your one or two goals and forgive yourself for all the other tics. After several months of that you'll probably notice an improvement and can add another goal or two. Watching recordings of yourself really helps too even though it's hard.",

      "text": "My two main pieces of advice:\n\n1. Get sleep. Meds are no replacement for sleep and sleep deprivation will pretty much inevitably make you incoherent. This is tough because the meds definitely don't help you sleep. So you've gotta try to keep a schedule that works.\n\n2. Restrict yourself to making 2-3 comments per class. This means waiting until you have an idea worth mentioning. This requires evaluating your ideas and determining whether they are worth a slot. Once you have an idea that seems worth it, recite what you're going to say at least three times in your head before raising your hand. If you have a comment before class practice that. Don't answer every question the prof. raises. Trust me, the prof. doesn't want you to, either. The people who didn't read deserve to squirm a bit.\n\n>1.) No eye contact while speaking \n\nThis is not really an issue. People might not like it, but they're just being nitpicky. If you're anything like me, eye contact will probably distract you and throw you off. It's okay to focus on your ideas.\n\n>2.) saying \u201cLike\u201d all time\n\nThis is difficult to correct because it is a habit. Practicing what you're going to say will help somewhat. Otherwise, try using 'erm' for pauses in your thought. It at least sounds more cultured than 'like'. \n\n>3.) Interrupting myself, contradicting, second guessing\n\n>4.) saying too much at once\n\n>5.) going on tangents\n\nThis is par for the course with ADHD and even meds won't keep you from doing it. In my experience, the only thing that can mitigate it is the first two main pieces of advice, and just being aware of how much you're talking. If you're like me your mind is like a constantly flowing river of thoughts and in your own head all you can do is try to guide the flow in one direction or another. But you do have the power to not drown everyone else. Lol\n\n>6.) apologizing randomly \n\nIdk about this one. Just try to be aware of it and try to stop yourself from doing it now that you know it's a problem.\n\n>7.) fidgeting weirdly \n\n>8.) nervous tics \n\nInevitable in my experience. You don't want to spend all your mental energy trying to stay still, so all you can really do is try to do is replace them with better looking nervous ticks. I have a beard to stroke, which I take it isn't an option for you. Idk. Run your fingers through your hair, or do a Mr. Burns style finger temple. Flipping a coin like a 1920s gangster and then ending every sentence with \"see\" would be the ideal, but you will get complaints about it being too distracting.",

Let some of the other students answer first to give yourself some time to respond. In your notes, jot down the main points of what you\u2019re going to say/respond to. Then, when it\u2019s your turn, just take yourself through your list of points - I think it\u2019s generally acceptable to call back to an earlier point in the discussion if you\u2019ve moved past it by the time it\u2019s your turn, but use your best judgment in the moment. Try not to add too much from what you wrote down to when you actually speak, unless another student or the teacher prompts you. I think that allowing yourself to move more slowly and deliberately will inherently alleviate some of the things you\u2019re trying to avoid.",

I get that it's totally an anxiety thing, but try and work on not apologizing, own what you say and just say it. Pretty much everything else is not a big deal. Who is going to fault you for having nervous tics or not making eye contact? Literally doesn't matter.",

That will give you a sense of where you find yourself wanting to go on tangents. This will not only help you with comments in class, but also with answering questions at conferences, pitching article and book ideas, etc. \n\nI agree that it happens to a lot of students, but as both grad students and now a professor, I always find myself trying to rescue students from themselves by weeding through those comments to find the point. If you can do this exercise on your own comments, you\u2019ll be ahead of the game!\n\nAlso, eye contact is hard on Zoom! I\u2019d alternate between looking in the camera and looking at your peers. The nice thing is that looking into the camera eye doesn\u2019t require you to actually see anyone\u2019s reactions, so consider it good practice for the real thing :).\n\nAlso, the fact that you\u2019re aware of these things and want to change them already shows that you\u2019re on the right track! Most people, especially in the humanities, don\u2019t actually pay attention to the nonverbal parts of their communication...despite often talking about them (says the cranky theatre and performance studies scholar, whose own field has this problem too)!",

I think this is doubly important in a graduate seminar in English because it is a discipline (one I cherish by the way) that privileges students being infatuated with their own bullshit. I know this sounds cynical and harsh, but over the last decade and one half I have come to realize the smartest students in the room speak the least. Being articulate is not about style but about substance, and being a really good seminar member means transcending your own ego to listen, really listen to the conversation, then making a contribution that is insightful and original that moves the discussion forward. What I did in graduate school that really helped me was limit my contribution to twice - I know that seems difficult in a 3 hour seminar but try it and see how it changes your whole perspective on what it means to be a valuable seminar member. It will also provide a radically different perspective on the participation of your peers. More than anything else learning to listen, and really hear peers and later colleagues, has made a monumental difference in the trajectory of my scholarship and career.",

      "text": "Others have pointed out many things to improve your speaking by giving yourself enough time etc. So I won't get into that any further.\nI feel the same like you in many regards when it comes to public speaking. What calms me down a bit is the following: Do you hear every filler word from others? Probably not. Do you wonder about how weird their voice is? Probably not. Your the expert in you, so you hear every little annoyance, when listening to a recording of yourself. This is propelled additionally by the fact that when you listen to the recording shortly after the class, you know what you said, from a content perspective. So you listen more for the style of speaking rather than what is spoken. Compare that to when you listen to others speaking and you're listening to WHAT they're saying.\nAlso, with the recording you might have a tendency to replay 'the cringes stuff' which just manifolds the feeling you had when listening initially.\n\nWith the tics, it's a tricky thing. I don't know what kind of tics you have and to what extent they show. I tic mainly in the way that I move my head a bit like if I flipped long hair out of my eyes. When I try to actively suppress it, my neck stiffens up and I feel really uncomfortable. I just go along with the tic, since it is what it is. Probably no one will call you out in a seminar setting. However, if you feel too uncomfortable with the tics and it gets to a level where it actively inhibits you from performing the tasks you need to, you might want to see a doctor. When I in middle school, my tics were really bad and it helped to seek professional assistance and I wouldn't rule it out categorically for the future, but at the moment coping with it seems to be the more comfortable way to go for me.\nAll in all, be sure to remind yourself that everyone has their package when it comes to public speaking. Some have a smaller one and take it a bit easier, some have a bigger one and need to figure out a bit more of a strategy to deal with it. But in the end, people are usually dealing more with their own shortcomings and insecurities than with yours.",

A typical toastmasters meeting has a table topics session where you practice responding to a question impromptu, and a prepared speeches session where members present 5-7 minute speeches they prepared beforehand. Everything in the meeting gets feedback - so you'll be told what you do well when you speak and also something to work on for next time. It is a very friendly environment and you shouldn't feel intimidated. You can attend a few meetings as a guest usually to decide whether you want to join. Membership fees vary somewhat from club to club (and by country) but I pay $80 AUD every 6 months.\n\nI joined when I started my PhD and it has helped hugely with reducing my nerves, helping feel confident, and not stressing out before presenting, even if I'm under prepared. I also think I'm a lot better at answering questions after a presentation because I take a bit more time to think about my answer before starting to talk.",

      "text": "Just to give a bit of background so you know where I'm coming from with this advice. I work as a flight controller for the ISS so communication skills are VERY important. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Communication, for anxious people, is difficult but it can absolutely get better!\n\n1.) No eye contact while speaking\n\nThis one is tough but something that helped me is realizing the people around me are all here to work as a team to accomplish our missions. In your case, all your classmates are there with you because they care about the same things you do. Try to think about the situation as you talking to someone who gets just as jazzed up about your seminar topics as you do! It may help make things feel more comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) saying \u201cLike\u201d all time\n\nOne thing I was taught is to have your audience, if appropriate for the situation, raise their hand every time you say a filler word such as \"um\", \"like\", \"yeah\", etc. Since you may not be able to do this during class, you can try a variant of it with friends or family. It will also feel a little awkward at first but if it's one of your personal goals it's worth it!\n\nSomething else you can try is to cut out filler words in your normal day to day speech. Outside of class is a good environment to slow down your verbal pace and be more intentional with your words. As you practice more it will start to feel natural.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Interrupting myself, contradicting, second guessing\n\nIt's okay to have a contradictory thought while giving your perspective and subsequently second guess yourself. THIS HAPPENS TO EVERYONE. Instead of trying to back track mid sentence/explanation, finish your original response/thought. If someone contradicts you, that's okay (it happens to me all the time)! This is why it's called a discussion! Also, after giving your initial response, you can always add on your contradictory thought to see what others think of the idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.) saying too much at once   +   5.) going on tangents\n\nLol, I can relate to this on a very personal level.\n\nBullet points! Think of what question or prompt was given, think of your response (an idea or some specific words), and write a quick ONE or TWO bullet response. This will give you something to physically glance at to keep you on track and remember your original  point if you get lost along the way. Keeping your bullet list short is important since discussion tends to move quickly at times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6.) apologizing randomly   +   7.) fidgeting weirdly   +   8.) nervous tics\n\nIn my experience, these are not a root problem in their own right when talking specifically about improving communication. They are a symptom of an underlying issue. If you're anxiety issues are anything like mine, these issues will improve as you become more comfortable/knowledgeable in an environment and improve on the other communication \"bugs\". That being said, I know that becoming comfortable in an environment is not easy. As you move through different courses, try to think about your \"environment\" as \"having discussions in general\". Focus on things that help you to become comfortable in any discussion setting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anything is unclear, or you want some more detail, just let me know!\n\nAnd good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:\n\nListening to yourself speak is an incredibly POWERFUL tool. IT IS ALWAYS PAINFUL. I have had to listen to recordings of myself for hours on end. It sucks but it really helps you to gain perspective on your own speech patterns.",

I have a friend who speaks how she talks in that she always \"circles\" the main point.

If more is needed from you the professor/instructor will usually say \"can you elaborate more\" and that's when you can do so. \n\nI am not a perfectly articulate speaker but I have gotten a lot better just by practicing out loud to myself in the mirror or before bed.
