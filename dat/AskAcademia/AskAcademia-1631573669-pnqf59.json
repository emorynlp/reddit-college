  "text": "So basically I  finished my PhD a few months ago and we are in the process of submitting a few of my research chapters to journals. However, going back through one chapter, I now believe that the data shown in one figure may be incorrect due to an issue with a machine I used. I didn't realize this until recently reading another paper that mentioned that this error can happen with the process that I was doing, and my supervisor didnt catch this potential issue either. I don't expect this to change the end conclusions significantly, but the data values will definitely be different. Now I could get someone in the lab to retry the experiment for me and collect new data, but again the data will be different. However I cannot change my thesis at this point. If I were to submit my paper to a journal with new data from that research chapter, how bad would it look? I'm not sure if this is something that happens often or not.",

      "text": "That would be fine, software errors happen. Seriously doubt anyone would bat an eye. And if someone asks why the data are different, just be honest - \"there was a small software error with the thesis data, so we collected additional data prior to publishing.\" Easy peasy.",
