  "text": "In my university in the country (Philippines) this has always been the practice. Is it there same in other countries like US, UK, etc.? Also if ever you want extra courses outside your program how often are people permitted to take them? Can they(admin ,PI, etc.) disapprove your move or this is something they cannot question as long as you have the resources to pay?",

      "text": "I'm in the US and we are capped at 6 credits of undergrad classes to count toward our 32 credits for masters or 72 for PhD. It may be slightly different at other institutions but there isn't much restriction on what courses you can take as far as I know. It just depends what you count towards graduation. We can take anything we want outside of that but can only count a certain amount towards our degree. I'm taking some undergrad classes that I won't count towards my program so I'll just have extra credits which is fine! Just boosts my GPA.",

In the bookkeeping the department would owe the university money for tuition for each grad student for courses outside the degree.",

      "text": "This varies a lot by university. At my university, some undergraduate classes were cross-listed - so they were 4000-level (senior) for the undergrads and 6000-level (graduate) for the grad students; we had an additional recitation session with the professor, or sometimes additional assignments or papers to make the class graduate-level. I took a couple of those when I was in graduate school.\n\nRegular undergraduate classes were uncommon for people to take unless it was for personal edification or fun - I took calculus to finish the sequence because I wanted to take more statistics courses, but I didn't earn any credit for it and my advisor didn't even know I was taking it.\n\nUsually universities have credit limits, and some may limit how many undergraduate credits you can get while enrolled in a graduate program. And yes, your PI can definitely prevent you from taking classes - I don't know if they can officially, but they can make your life really difficult if you don't heed their advice.",

      "text": "Germany:\n\nIn principle, I can take whatever courses I want but if the number of seats is limited, the person teaching the course may prioritize undergraduates or Master's students over me.\n\nWithin my own department I'd never take a course without asking the instructor if that's ok with them and agreeing on an appropriate level of participation - having a PhD student in the course can change its dynamics significantly (e.g. it's possible that I currently am or will be teaching the students sitting next to me,  I'll generally have more knowledge than your average student, ...) and for some instructors it may add stress because they feel monitored in their teaching.\n\nWhen taking courses in other subjects and departments (where I'm a novice myself), that's usually not an issue.\n\nSome professors expect their PhD students or at least their assistant (a PhD student or postdoc who also assists the professor in some of their administrative duties) to be present in the courses they teach. I've known some great and very likeable exceptions, but in general, this strikes me as rather old-fashioned and authoritarian. I associate this practice with an academic culture in which you are supposed to become an avatar of your advisor more than a researcher in your own right (observe and absorb their every word so that you'll come to anticipate their thinking perfectly).",
