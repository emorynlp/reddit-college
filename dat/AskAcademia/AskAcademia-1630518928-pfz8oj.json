  "title:": "Requesting articles via email vs interlibrary loan",
  "text": "I\u2019m a librarian for an R&D agency that employs mostly PhD-level researchers who have strong ties to academia and industry. We spend a good amount of money on electronic subscriptions and have a full ILL service. We are definitely limited compared to big research universities but we have a healthy budget to loan or purchase any materials that are requested.\n\nA few recent comments have made me aware that some of my clients are almost apologetic about coming to me for ILLs versus going directly to the author. My question is whether, when you receive a request from a peer affiliated with an institution, do you ever feel that it's a waste of your time? Do you ever look at their email signature and think, geez, couldn't Big Science Organization just provide a library rather than asking me to spend time attaching PDFs to emails? I know that it's gratifying to see research being used, but is there a limit? \n\nI appreciate all the problems with paywalls and Big Publishing and I'm certainly not coming at this from the perspective of trying to stop copyright infringement. Maybe a bit from the perspective of trying to protect my job! I'm more wondering if this is a call to do more marketing of our ILL service, and if there's any negative PR associated with having scientists make frequent demands of peers from other institutions.",
