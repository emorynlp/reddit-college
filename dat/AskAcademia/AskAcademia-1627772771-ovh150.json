In practical terms, working on the side typically backfires. The time commitment and the type of mental effort required to do a PhD is beyond full time. I really would advice against it.",

These were basically the numbers they stated because of technicalities: things like not counting you as an employee/staff member and thus not needing to give you special privileges that come with those titles, and yet still pay you an amount that would technically be below minimum wage if you were actually counting the hours (but also claiming that you were eligible for a salaried quantity/value rather than being hourly to begin with). Basically, no one actually followed the official numbers.",

If they want to work (like I did) there is plenty of time to do so, if they are up to it. \n\nIt is not for everyone, though. It helped me work more focused on my thesis, and think of other stuff at work. For others, it would be too stressful, I guess.",
