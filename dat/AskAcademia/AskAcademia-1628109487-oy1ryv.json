  "text": "TLDR: my PhD was changed to an MPhil so I want to know if I can jump from one PhD to another in a different university? \n\nSo I've 14 months left of my PhD (Engineering field, EPSRC funded). I've just had my APR and I've been recommended to submit at MPhil level. \n\nThis has been a rocky road from day one. I started my industrially sponsored PhD in October 2019, the company sponsoring it went bust a week beforehand, my funding body changed, I sailed through initial review but then the pandemic hit and my supervisor came out as an all out witch. I submitted my differentiation paper and she tore through me, calling me stupid and slow, and many of her meetings contained mostly personal attacks rather than critiquing my work. I raised this at the time and was offered to make a formal complaint or change supervisor. I decided to change supervisor, but only after I passed my differentiation. \n\nI didn't pass my diff until November 2020, then changed my supervisor almost immediately. I took a leave of absence of one month in February, and then had my APR in April. I didn't pass it, and was asked to come back with a clearer novelty, a few formatting tweaks, things like that.\n\nMy supervisor, who wasn't with me at the start, asked if I had anything in mind for a novelty that wasn'tin keeping with what I started with. And I did, not completely unrelated to the work I was doing, but definitely a different direction. My supervisor rejected it as too much work to do in the time left. However, my assessor in my APR had apparently approached her with a project that would be suitable for me.\n\nWe had our first meeting on the 21st of June, then a follow-up with the company on the 7th of July. In the month that followed there was a lot of annual leave and I decided to go part time as I was struggling to commit to the project. \n\nI had my APR this week and i pitched my plan for this new project that my assessor wanted me to run with. And I was told that there wasn't enough time to complete the PhD in the time left, so submit as an MPhil instead. \n\nNothing has changed since our first meeting in June. Literally a month has passed and it's gone from a \"great project\" to \"unfeasible\". \n\nI signed up for a PhD. I don't want to leave with an MPhil. I know my funding body has offered 6 months extra time to all students due to Covid, but at this point in time I'm looking to fight a case to either:\n\nA) remain on the PhD programme and submit my thesis accordingly, or\nB) take my idea that I pitched after my APR, the one that was rejected as not having enough time for it, and get a new supervisor and funding body to help me run with it. I've done some of the legwork for it already and it's definitely novel. But can I do that when I've already started a PhD? \n\nAdvice please \ud83e\udd17",

      "text": "> Literally a month has passed and it's gone from a \"great project\" to \"unfeasible\". \n\n\nOkay, here's the cold hard calculation I'd be doing if I were your supervisor.\n\n\nTo do a PhD worth of work in a year you have to be consistently working 2-3 times faster than the typical UK PhD student.  You had a month and a half window to demonstrate that you can do this, and instead of seizing the opportunity and smashing it out of the park, you took leave and went part-time because you \"struggled to commit\".  \n\nTo put in another way: you need several months to write your thesis, so this window from June 21 to today took up, say, 6.5 weeks of the 10 months that were available to do the work.  That's 15% of the available time.  Did you finish 15% of the required work for a thesis in this time?  \n\n\nYou've certainly had a shitty situation, and it sucks.  And who knows, it may well be that you *could* finish your PhD.  But the question is: if you fight to stay in, what evidence can you present that you're likely to get the work done on time?  What can you bring to the table to convince them that the future will be different from the past?  If you decide to push to continue, or apply to start a new PhD, you're going to have to think carefully about how you can provide a convincing answer to those questions.",

          "text": "I get what you're saying but here me out:\n\nI have been told I've 14 months left. I've actually 15 months as the month in February was technically not factored in. I've also got 6 months of Covid leave that the funding body has allowed everyone to have, and generally we're all allowed to go thesis only for 6 months.\n\nMy initial project was on hydrogen, and then it was realised I wouldn't have access to any data now I've changed supervisor (internal politics, I'm still not familiar with it).\n\nI then proposed a new research topic and novelty that would need a bit of lab time but in terms of purchasing, ~\u00a350 max for equipment. And I was told I didn't have a budget to fund it. \n\nI've now been handed this other project that has absolutely nothing to do with hydrogen and is a sound enough project, but I really couldn't be bothered doing it as it's not what I signed up for. \n\nAdditionally, in the month of July there was annual leave taken for 3 of the 4 weeks by supervisors. And I've had to take on an extra job to make ends meet. That's what made me decide to go part time, so I'd be able to continue with the research but also be able to survive\n\nThey wanted me to do a year's worth of work in 6 weeks, and I couldn't do that. Plus I shouldn't be expected to do it. I'd like to either get back to the project I signed up for, or go for the research project I proposed. \n\nTruthfully, I've some groundwork done so I'd like to propose my research elsewhere and see if I'd get backing for it, but I'm not sure if I can when I've come this far in a funded PhD already.",
