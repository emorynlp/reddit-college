  "text": "Hi! \n\nI just started my first position post-degree and I am a bit taken aback. \n\nI work for a prominent scholar who is very well recognized. However, is this allowed?\n\nEssentially, as RAs we source grants/funding, complete the application and send it to the PI for approval. Then we draft contracts if we have a partner, write the research proposal, draft the questions for interviews, write the literature review, etc. We also do the ethics applications. Once she approves it all, we do the interviews, analyze the data and write the reports and again, she just approves it. Then once published, she is first author, although it doesn\u2019t seem like shes done anything more than approve. \n\nWe also write all her conference material, make her slides, prep her responses for speaking engagements etc. \n\nIs this a permissible, responsible and ethical way to do reach or does this violate ethics/academic integrity?\n\nI just never expected to see a PI do so little. Even when things aren\u2019t well done, she just tells us to redo it with little guidance.",

Humanities fields with primarily single-author traditions may also put the PI first, which can be weird as some humanities lean more towards social sciences and multi-author publications without clear rules. Finally, some fields (e.g. maths) are straight alphabetical, so if your supervisor's name starts with \"A\" that might be all there is to it. I'd just casually ask another academic in the field how they handle authorship the next time you're at a conference before raising a fuss. It's not at all unusual for a PI to do basically zero research work though. I know many who I'm certain don't even read every paper that goes through their lab.",

You are not in the meetings.  \"it doesn\u2019t seem like...\" is exactly right, it is not your place to understand what the PI is doing.  You have your part and that is doing the leg work for the research. \n\nAuthorship is about intellectual contribution, not work put into a project.  Someone tells you what to write, someone dreams up the big ideas.  Ultimately, that is the PI.  It sounds like she has post-docs and grad students, they will have independence because she is training them to be her one day.  \n\nLet's also face it, her name is on the grants and on the papers because it sounds like she is a big deal and a big deal name gets you into top journals and past grant reviews.  \n\nI don't know what field you are in, but they all have different views on authorship. I publish in the biomedical sciences, where in this type of setup, typically the post-doc or grad student would be first author and the PI would be last author which is known as the senior author.  However, I can remember how my PI in grad school was criticized in a psychology department for putting himself last and letting grad students take first author.  The faculty there evidently would be first author on any work by grad students, sometimes not even including grad students at all (this was such a problem, APA had to make an ethics rule about authorship of papers from dissertations).  Way back when I worked in a chemistry lab, I was told the PI goes first on papers (I was way to young to question that at the time).  As others have said, some fields just use alphabetical order.",

One faculty, for example, took a manuscript written by an RA, had his PhD student edit it, and they were first and second authors, and the RA who wrote the manuscript was not listed as an author at all. When I queried about this, I found myself reassured that such practices were normal in the field and dismissed that day. Likewise, as a doctoral student, I wrote the significant preponderance of a manuscript, a fellow doctoral student wrote the rest and we were listed as second and third author on the draft he submitted. Surprised, I approached my professor only to be reassured that this was \"the way it is done\" (and yes, found myself without a research position shortly thereafter).\n\nIf you were a psychology student, you could follow up with the APA:\n\n*Violations of the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct by an APA member should be reported to the APA Ethics Committee by phone at 202-336-5930, or in writing to the APA Ethics Office, 750 First St., NE, Washington, DC 20002-424.*\n\nNothing happened years ago when I went through this, but times have changed in the thirty years since. \n\nPerhaps your field also has a code of ethics and an Ethics Committee you could report to?",

This position may be a great way for you to gain valuable experience doing lots of the day-to-day, practical tasks as well as taking on larger responsibilities to support a lab, but I really hope you get credit for the work that you do for each project!",

Maybe they'd give some input on plans or sex up papers. But yeah, for the ones I've seen close-up personally, and these were massively successful people, all the hard substantive work was done by minions, and all the credit got assigned to the PI. At most they'd work, effectively, on networking. Lots of sunk cost fallacy and cronyism keeping 'em a black hole of scarce resources.\n\nI think it \\*should\\* be an ethics violation but it's a blind spot, except maybe on the author contribution - but that's so gray since they'll surely be great at making a case it was all their idea really, at a \"high level\".

I directly interfaced with our funding agencies program officers and I presented at conferences when the PI couldn't. This was immediately after my Master's degree and honestly was overwhelming.
