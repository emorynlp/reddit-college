The rest is purely my work. They think their contribution is not enough for the co-author title whereas I think contributing original intellectual content is enough for the title regardless of significance. Thoughts?",

      "text": "Yes, they should be listed as a co-author. One, their intellectual contribution is key, and as a general rule of thumb, someone making a significant intellectual contribution to an article should be listed as an author. I also think that writing over 10% of the manuscript merits authorship in and of itself. I would go so far to say as publishing this without listing them as a co-author would be academic dishonesty.\n\nIf they are open to being listed as a co-author and just don't think they did enough, then go forward with listing them. If they absolutely insist that you do not list them as a co-author (which would be odd), get their refusal to be a co-author in writing, consider removing as much of their portion as makes sense, and thank them for their contributions in the acknowledgments section.",
