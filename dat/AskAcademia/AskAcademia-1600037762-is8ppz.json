          "text": "I would also just say that you can find a lot of excellent independent school jobs in the US listed on the website of the [National Association of Independent Schools](https://careers.nais.org/jobs). There are a lot of jobs there that aren't contracted to Carney Sandoe (my wife is at a very elite private school and I don't think they use CS, because it costs a lot of money to hire through them). I would check out both.\n\nMy only other \"elite US private school\" advice is to talk to someone who works in those jobs to get a sense of what they are before you apply, and to get a sense of how to interview with them. My wife has seen a lot of recent PhDs flame out of the interview process because they didn't really get what the job was, and they interviewed like a recent PhD going for a TT job as opposed to someone applying for a private school job. It's a job that uses some of the same skills as a TT job but is also very very different in many ways, especially in the day to day. An impressive CV can get you an interview for such jobs, but it won't get you the job by itself.",

They weren't looking for someone with specific research interests or narrowly specific skillsets, just anyone Ph.D. will do, which we know are a dime a dozen. Of course, this may be field specific. \n\nI spoke to several friends who teach in public schools, and they told me that this is common in private schools. \n\nI hope you find a school that treats you fairly.",

The ones to work for are the ones that value the teachers and give them near total independence from the rich parents, and they can compensate well.",

I taught in a title I urban school and a rural school that was slightly better off but not a whole lot in the South.

I worked in a project where I got to work with middle schoolers and thought it was pretty fun and so a few years later I went from academia to K-12.\n\nI hated it. I didn\u2019t realize that the teacher I was working with had such good classroom management. I had to be the manager of the classroom and it\u2019s my biggest weakness. You\u2019re also prepping for 5 days a week and at least 45 minute lessons. These aren\u2019t lectures either. You need them to be interactive or you will get poor observations. The level of shit you have to deal with from your admin is borderline ridiculous at times. Parents are on a whole other planet sometimes. Duty posts are annoying as hell. Your fellow teachers will make you sad. This may really vary but the number of teachers who are just skating through and don\u2019t really care makes me sad. So many coach teachers who just want to coach and hate the kids. Standardized tests. The kids will make the days hard but they\u2019ll have moments where you feel so proud to be a teacher.

It\u2019s so draining dealing with the rules they expect you to enforce that are so stupid. Some of them I get like yeah no phones out and don\u2019t distract others.

      "text": "I did the opposite (went from K-12 teaching to academia) and what I\u2019ve discovered is that most academics don\u2019t know anything about teacher licensing laws. If you teach at a private school or some charter schools, you don\u2019t need to be licensed because they operate outside of school districts, so that is probably the best bet for you. \n\n\nIf you are thinking of going into public schools, you need to see what your state licensing laws are and that will tell you what the requirements are. Almost all are going to want you to spend time doing practicums or student teaching. Going through a program like TFA will fast track you and get you a provisional license, but you cannot become a permanent full time teacher on that license. Also, TFA generally places you wherever they want you to go, so you will likely need to pick up and move (I assume since you\u2019re in academia that\u2019s not a problem, but be aware). You\u2019ll be observed and mentored both through TFA and through the school that you\u2019re placed in. I\u2019ve mentored many TFA teachers, and in general I don\u2019t love the program. Out of the fiftyish TFA teachers I have known, only one ended up becoming a real teacher. He was great - shoutout to Mr. B. \n\n\nSo even if you do TFA, you\u2019ll still need to get yourself a real teaching license if this is something you want to do for more than a few years. It may be better to skip right to an ARL program (alternative route to licensure). Again, each state has their own method of how this works. However, MOST of the time you are put into a classroom teaching a high needs area (in my state that is math and special education but depending on the job market it sometimes includes science. Absolutely say goodbye to any idea of teaching social studies this way - there are way too many people who want to be social studies teachers than there are jobs). Being in the classroom \u2018counts\u2019 as your practicum/student teaching experience, but you are still on a provisional license and you still need to do your coursework in education. You\u2019ll be taking classes on nights and weekends with the rest of the people in your cohort at the college or university of the program\u2019s choosing. In 2 or 3 years you\u2019ll be set with your permanent teaching license in whatever subject you were hired to teach. \n\n\nThe last option is to go the traditional way and start with an undergrad degree in education. You likely have most of your gen ed requirements done, so you\u2019ll be taking classes in general pedagogy, educational psychology, assessment, etc plus the classes of your teaching subject (for me that was English, so I took 32 credits in English lit, grammar, journalism, etc) plus the classes for pedagogy in your teaching subject (ie: teaching literature, teaching writing, etc). Your last semester is student teaching. Generally you pay for a full time credit load while you work for free in a high school every day. This totally sucks and is almost impossible to do while working another job, so just keep taking out those loans. \n\n\nAt the end of any of these paths, you have a teaching job! Congrats! In my district starting pay is 40k. When I left teaching I had 2 Master\u2019s degrees and 7 years of experience and was making 49k. If you want to teach in a place that pays more, they likely have stricter standards (ie: requiring a graduate degree in education) because they can be more competitive.",

My advice is to find a program and school that will allow you to enter in as a teacher of record while you work on your licensure. Don't emphasize your Ph.D. as much and instead emphasize your love of teaching and desire to work with k-12 students, especially on the social-emotional learning side of things if they're under high school age. Like you, my committee had no helpful advice and it took quite a bit of frustrating research to figure out the system. Long story short, the first few years are very rough and you'll be finding your own path but the job security, focus on effective teaching, and community I have found in k-12 is worth it.",

          "text": "I've heard Europe is better, but I'm not sure. I also have a disability that keeps me too broke to move overseas. There are very few tenure track jobs. You will see postdocs, visiting assistant professorships, and other similar short term jobs - but even those are scarce in contrast to the amount of Ph.D.s in the field. I recommend looking alt-ac. I think having a Ph.D. is worthwhile. I wouldn't change anything, but staying in academia is very difficult. I think only 30% or so of Ph.D.s stay in academia.",

      "text": "Lots of academics hate teaching. They can't stand those pesky undergrads keeping them away from the lofty brilliance on-high that their research represents. Come to think of it, most universities hate teaching, too. It detracts from all the diversity training and administrative work that they have to do, what with keeping busy the 40% spike in administrators they have hired lately. At least with the pandemic they don't have to do anything icky like teach on campus -- after all campus is for safe space and administrative offices. If they can just take over the classrooms for new admins, that would be fantastic!\n\nSo, all in all, if you really like teaching, you are probably a lot better off in K-12, because it is not going to get any better on campus.",
