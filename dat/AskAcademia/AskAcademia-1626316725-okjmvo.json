  "title:": "So turns out my Master's research was pretty bad.",
  "text": "I graduated a year and a half ago from a master's program that required us to present a poster at the end as a part of our degree. I worked on a research project with a post-doc that was very different from what others did in the lab, so a lot of the work was done independently (and haphazardly because I was very new to the field). \n\nI was recently going through my project and I realized that I made some pretty fundamental mistakes (took baseline values incorrectly, used a really high flow rate which is probably why I struggled so muvh with my work and had some unusually high values). The post-doc who worked with me on this research left the lab and that line of research is no longer being pursued at the moment, but it definitely renders the work un-publishable. I feel really shitty about making such simple mistakes, even though I'm trying to convince myself that it was out of inexperience. I'm joining a PhD program soon and I'm trying not to feel like an absolute imposter and fraud.\n\nI'm also quite sad that I let my ex-advisor down by producing shitty science, especially since he wrote my recommendations and has been so kind to me. Though he didn't look over all of my data (which he should have done), he did guide me direction-wise.\n\n I'm not sure what to do - should I let him know what I have realized? I'm not even sure how/what to tell him since it has been so long. \n\nEDIT: I should mention that it feels important for me to keep myself in good graces with this prof as much as possible for future recommendations/collabs if needed...especially since I'm going to join the academic world for a brief period of time.\n\n\nEDIT #2: Thank you all for your advice/kind words!! I think the pressure of starting a PhD and the impact of realizing my mistakes sent me down an anxiety spiral that I'm still recovering from, but hearing reassuring words from everyone has definitely helped. I feel too guilty to sit by and do nothing, and I'm also scared that they'll publish my shit data without letting me know (can they/will they do that??) so I am considering writing to my PI with an additional SOP and tips in case somebody wants to take up the project again. Given that he recently reached out to me about how to use a specific machine that only I knew how to use, it'll be a good follow-up and a nice way to keep in touch with him. I'm still going over ways to frame this without making it sound like I massively fucked up. Any tips would be appreciated!!\n\nEDIT #3: I sent him an email today that said that I found some things in my methods that could have caused some of the problems I was seeing, and that I added some tips and improvements to the SOP I had sent him after I graduated... He hasn't replied though \ud83d\ude10 and I'm not sure if he's even seen it. Is there anything more I can do?",

Since your end product was a poster, and not a peer reviewed publication, it means your results were preliminary and probably prone to some mistakes. I don't see a reason to bring this up with your previous advisor, especially if you have a good relationship with him. You are probably overthinking it. Your work was good enough to pass your thesis defense and that is all there is to it. Research is never perfect and realizing your mistakes and learning from them is important, but if your previous advisor is not pursuing the topic anymore, then why bring it up?",

It\u2019s upto the pi and postdoc to make sure their money is well spent and you\u2019re on track with their study. You did the best you could, with a mind that\u2019s learning to learn. You went to school to learn and now you\u2019ve learnt. This is just part of the process. Just make sure to remember all you\u2019ve learnt.\n\nEdit: And as a PhD student who burns out hard, spirals hard, conflates their work with their essence as a human and blames themself, this is what I tell myself: you\u2019re a hairless ape, you evolved to run, relax and eat berries, you\u2019re fallable, you\u2019re not a computer, the very fact that you can\u2019t think in abstract is worth celebrating everything else is just a bonus - you can\u2019t simulate something a 1000 times to get it right.

              "text": "Ok this is some massive crazy leap. Firstly, who the hell would manipulate their project to produce shit data? So clearly you did everything but manipulate your project. Secondly, one masters project does not an entire publication make (especially if it was only designed to get a poster), so at most they'll look at your data and say eh, we'll have to repeat it which someone with experience could do in a matter of days to weeks. Lastly, it's a big deal to revoke a degree and it's gonna take a lot more than a master's student producing shit data. It's a vast amount of paper work and frankly they pull you they pull half the graduating class.\n\n\n They know, they already know. You did a weak project, you produced a weak poster with poor conclusions but it's a masters degree and it was good enough for a pass. In addition, the PI probably knows s/he totally dropped the ball in not checking your data (that's a fundamental no, no as a PI) and that the postdoc had basically gone rogue. I'm saying this not to be mean but because you're about to start a PhD and that's a long, long race. You cannot go into it beating yourself up, obsessing about stuff that happened and is gone, placing your whole self worth and identity in a few weeks of bad data collection when you were learning. If you do you're gonna fail, not because you set a flow rate wrong several years back but because you are going to drive yourself nuts, you're going to second guess yourself, you're going to be so focussed on past mistakes and possible future mistakes you're gonna make mistakes right now, and generally undermine yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint, so slow down champ, take some deep breaths and just put one foot in front of the other, slowly, focussing on the here and now.",

      "text": "Don't feel bad, it's way more normal than what you think. A master degree is to learn how to master a subject, not to make a direct contribution to knowledge. That's some PhD level stuff. Most supervisors expectations for the quality of master students' research thesis is actually quite lower than what you seem to think.\n\nThis does not mean that the supervisor is not happy with your work. They can't be disappointed at you for something that was not expected from you in the first place (contribution to knowledge). A good master student takes their research seriously, is up to date on their tasks, does an exhaustive literature review so that they don't ask questions they could answer by themselves and requires minimal guidance. The perfect quality of the research work is an added bonus. \n\nI even heard different supervisors over the years tell their PhD students (including myself) to be careful what work they give master students because the quality of the \"final product\" is not guaranteed meaning that they should not give them critical tasks because they can't assume the work can contribute to the research project (Unless they know the master student is extremely good and reliable from previous experience with them). \n\nIt's not because they are bad master students, it's just a natural result from having less research experience combined with having to worry about grades and other stuff, which results in their focus not being entirely on the research aspect. \n\nFrom my experience assisting in the supervision of master students from 2 different universities in 2 different countries, I would say there is no need at this point in time to tell your supervisor what mistakes you made. There's good chances that they already know about it or suspects it (especially since they didnt pursue your research once you left). The fact that your supervisor gave you recommendation letters means to him that you did a good job. I am sure your supervisor was truly proud of you. We are often more critical of our own work, so don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nAlso, in my field at least, it's uncommon for master students to publish anything from their thesis (not talking about posters and conference proceedings), so don't worry about that. The fact that you have a poster is really good in my opinion! \n\nTo end; The fact that you are now able to go back at your work and see mistakes and be critical of it means you have done good progress in your research journey. It shows you have learned a lot and you should be really proud of that!",

It's super common to find errors in master students work and it's usually standard to double check everything in a master student thesis if we want to use it as a reference for future work. if the work ever gets picked up for future research (meaning at least Phd level), they will most likely redo the work anyways or major parts of it. That's how it usually is for master student thesis unless the master srudent is continuing their own research at the PhD level. \n\nYou left a good impression in your supervisor's mind and he was satisfied with whatever work quality you gave him. Leave it at that. \n\nDon't go back and make him remember that you made mistakes. It's very likely that he might not remember all the good things you did, so you would be effectively changing his last impression of you. He might not even remember that he already knows about the errors since the work did not get picked up. So you would just be making him unnecessarily remember something bad about you.",

During my defense, one committee member said this was a perfect example that sometimes in research, shit happens.  I failed to account for carryover effect, didn't check group equivalency, and did not properly power one of the experiments.  I use my thesis as an example of bad research when I teach research methods.  \n\nAs for talking to your professor, there is a good chance he already knows, but if he contacts you to talk about publishing your thesis, that is when you can tell him that you have discovered some flaws.",

      "text": "I bet if you could speak openly with other professors you'd hear all kinds of stories about their own screw ups, bad data, uninformed analyses, etc. People have brain farts, forget things, and try things outside their wheelhouse/expertise/ability all the time. After all, it's a natural part of growing as a researcher, scholar, and person in general. That said, in academia, is in many workplaces, it's still important to have regular checkups/check-ins, and to seek advice from other experts and trusted colleagues. \n\nTake this realization as proof of how much your knowledge and skills have grown already, but also as a reminder to seek honest feedback and input from others. This can even include your colleagues who don't know a lot about your specific line of research, as they could still find gaps, for example, in your lit review/theory (if you're actively drafting a formal paper) the logic/steps in your setup and data collection, and in your analyses (the statistical tests you used, assumptions made, etc.). \n\nI'm a social scientist so it may be different in your field/department, but it's also helpful to make friends/have contacts in related departments. For example, I'm pretty good with my stats, but if something weird comes along, the outputs aren't as expected, it's a strange dataset, etc, I have certain colleagues in the stats department who I can go to for help. \n\nAs for your ex-advisor, I definitely suggest talking to him. Showing your own growth (in maturity and skills) isn't likely to be seen as a bad thing, and he may even be able to help you rethink/redo some it to make it more \"publishable.\" Even if you don't publish it, just the act of going through and correcting some of those mistakes can be a good learning experience. This can also be a good way to keep in touch with him, and establish/continue your relationship as colleagues (i.e., instead of your previous student-mentor or supervisor-subordinate relationship).\n\nOne more thing - [imposter syndrome](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud) is common among [high-achieving adults](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglazer/2018/06/29/the-imposter-syndrome-paradox-why-feeling-like-a-fraud-may-be-your-strongest-asset/), and thus *very* common in academia. That said, you generally need to have at least some level of knowledge and competence to be a successful fake anyway, so you know you're not clueless or stupid. Someone once said to embrace it in a funny way - you're a trickster and you've fooled everyone because you are actually so clever and smart. Maybe that works for you, maybe it doesn't. But really, it's a natural feeling for many. Even the most notable names in your field have probably felt this way at some point in their career, and might even still experience it occasionally.",

And that\u2019s if there was some intent to return to that area of research. I can see several possible scenarios.  \n 1. Prof has shifted focus enough that your work isn\u2019t relevant to current stuff.   \n2. Prof already knew the procedures were no good but will appreciate that you also figured it out, albeit late.   \n3.

With improved technique it might be worth picking up again. \n6. After you left, somebody else in the lab was using the technique and has already come up with some improvements, maybe yours are already implemented or maybe there are some good new ideas. \n\nMost of those possibilities are going to take time to resolve. Best thing you can hope for in the short term is an acknowledgement of your email. Assuming you left on good terms, that\u2019s to be expected. I could see this getting revived if the line of research was closer to the current interests. But if you think it won\u2019t be, maybe it\u2019s a topic to hold on to for one of those practice research proposals that you\u2019ll be doing for your doctorate. \n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019ve done well.

If so it might be worth testing your hypothesis with the new values a few times to test if you are correct and see how far off your results are. If they're statistically significant I would advise them as it's the morally right thing to do.\n\nBut don't be hard on yourself or your professor. You did what you could with the knowledge you had at the time. Now you have new knowledge that shows you why that might not be accurate but you learned enough to catch your mistake and fix it. That's the whole point of school and science. To learn enough to know when you made a mistake because you\\humanity didn't know enough about the subject at the time. But now you do and how to fix it so you can make the science better.\n\nYou learned a lot more doing this than you think.",
