  "text": "I\u2019m a newly graduated PhD who is going to teach some graduate courses in the fall. Since I just received my degree a few days ago, I\u2019m still feeling it\u2019s unreal that i\u2019ll be a faculty member in just a month. Maybe some imposter syndrome is in play, but I was wondering how your first experience of teaching graduate students was, particularly if you were about the same age as most of them. Anything you would\u2019ve done differently in terms of dealing with graduate students in or outside your classroom? I\u2019m definitely considering to wear some professional outfit to make myself look more serious, but any other strategies you find helpful in boosting your confidence in teaching graduate students and gaining respect from them. Thanks!",

      "text": "Congrats on your PhD! I have taught courses with students about my age that were master courses. The best advice i got was NOT to teach only from my experience. Students will be different and need different things than I did. Instead try to gain some expertise in teaching. Stephen D. Brookfield wrote some great books on teaching! I read 'the skillful teacher'. It gave me a lot of confidence and a great mindset.\nEvery student brings their own skills and experiences to the classroom. I think it is our job, to help them pursue their interests and sometimes there are misunderstandings. Rather than worry about respect , think about how you can provide a good learning environment for a diverse group of people. I think students respect your effort more than anything else.",

      "text": "Oh oh oh me!!!! To some this May sound wild, or untrue, as TBH I was shocked myself. \n\nI did a masters in the US before my PhD in the US. When I arrived at my PhD program, my assistantship funding my first semester came from being a \u201cTA\u201d. What this meant for me was that I was expected to develop lab material (programming and statistics course) mostly programming exercises related to statistical course content. And walk the students through it. The twist. As an incoming PhD I was essentially doing a 55 minute lecture each week with people from my cohort.\n\nMaybe my story is weird. But I received very high evals and was even invited to dinner with the dean after a couple years for my high student ratings.\n\nHere\u2019s what I think helps (Btw I have taught a bunch, maybe like 12-14 semesters of undergrad courses)\n\nTreat them as way more mature and dedicated. They hated when I spoon fed them like the undies. They want to struggle a bit even if they won\u2019t admit it. They\u2019re alll (for the most part) chasing the feeling of success dragon tail that we did. It feels good to work hard and figure it out.\n\nBuuuut, don\u2019t leave them hanging. I make it clear my graduate content takes some time, and potentially communication with me. I always prioritize graduate course emails over the undies.\n\nDon\u2019t feel like you need to establish yourself as Oh so fancy and better then them. In the US students respond very well to feeling equal. (You have not said what country you are now teaching in, but if it is the US this will help). Keep it casual and relaxed. \n\nHonestly now I\u2019m teaching in Switzerland and I feel the opposite, so I would really determine this based on culture.\n\nGive them \u201cbonus\u201d work. The ones who do it are the ones you want to invest resources in later. I love optional assignments, I\u2019m always happy to see the proportion who complete them.\n\nMake fun, adult, examples. That first course was a Generalized Linear Modeling course. We did lots of fun stat examples that adults can handle. Use your field and imagination.\n\nOh yeah congrats. You did it.",

      "text": "Graduate students vary a lot in their knowledge and abilities. Don\u2019t be afraid if there are topics where some clearly know more than you. Let them shine. You are an expert in the course you developed so focus on integrating the knowledge they share with the learning goals of the class. Also, this is a learning experience for you too. You aren\u2019t done growing as a scholar so embrace the opportunity to learn from your students, deepen your own knowledge, and develop your teaching skills. I always think it\u2019s important to dress professional but projecting professionalism goes beyond your wardrobe. I can\u2019t emphasize enough that you need to be confident in what you know and honest about what you don\u2019t know. PhD students are pretty good BS detectors. Good luck!",

      "text": "Hi ! Congrats on your graduation!  I was in your situation last spring. Some of my students were older than I am. My approach was to not try to present myself as an authority figure but to think of the whole class as a group of people who are learning together. Sure I gave lectures but it was always from the position of just giving background info to facilitate a class discussion on the deeper concepts. We\u2019re all lifelong learners. You learn from your students and they learn from you.",

      "text": "Insecurity and imposter syndrome are the devil. It tends to feed on everything. Benign questions from students are misinterpreted as them being difficult. If you stumble upon something that you don't know, you can't acknowledge that and you get stuck instead. Etcetera. You got the job for a reason. Someone who knows what you know wanted you to teach these people.\n\nOther than that, my main tip for any teaching is to never overestimate the students' prior knowledge and never underestimate their intelligence. They are just as smart as we are. They just know less about stuff that we care about -- and that is why they are there in the first place. Often people confuse the two. (It's a bit like talking louder to someone who doesn't understand English.)\n\nEdit: And congrats! Welcome to the club!",

      "text": "Congrats on finishing your PhD!\n\nI\u2019ve been teaching Masters and Doc level courses for about five years, shortly after earning my doctorate. My greatest advice is to be transparent about the course outcomes (what they are going to learn and be able to do at the of your course). Communicate weekly about the outcomes and, if possible, build flexibility into how the students demonstrate the outcomes. This may seem obvious, but I\u2019ve found the more I clearly connect the content and work with outcomes, the more grad students appreciate the class. Knock \u2018em dead!",
