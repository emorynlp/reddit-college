  "title:": "LPT for picking a PhD advisor",
  "text": "Was emailing some of the first years and thought you all could help with suggestions. This is what I came up with:\n\n1. Pick an advisor and lab first, then a project. Essentially you are 'married' to that advisor and most of the lab for several years, if not much longer so you had better get along well. Projects might change, your relationship with your advisor is paramount to your success.\n\n2. If the students in the lab and past students do not have many papers, that is an indicator that you will not have many papers. In a STEM field if the student is looking for an industrial job, then 2 first author papers seems  average. For academia, 4 or more first author seems average (unless Nature, Cell, Science...). Can your career goal be achieved in the lab?\n\n3. If the lab is a mess and the equipment is constantly broken or not well maintained then that will only add extreme difficulty to your PhD and should be avoided.\n\n4. Lab alumni should have jobs in areas where you want to get a job.\n\n",

      "text": "The lab equipment part is SO important. The PI of the lab where I did my MS bought everything used on eBay and then cut corners on maintenance to save money, and the functional outcome of that was that nothing worked properly, if at all. Parts for repairs were often unavailable. That PI was so proud of all their equipment, but broken equipment is useless, and not-quite-broken equipment can completely torpedo a project you, as a student, have spent hundreds or thousands of hours on. I ended up more than six months behind and having to drop two experiments from my thesis because of my PI's cheapskating with equipment. I think I learned more about networking to use other labs' equipment than about any single other aspect of research in  the two and a half years I was there. ",

While you can forge your own path and follow your own ideas (and your PI might even encourage you), this is much, much more difficult than persuing the research ideas the PI suggests you do, in the way they want you to do it. \n\n(I was a statistician with grandiose ideas in a lab full of modelers and ecologists, and while it didn\u2019t turn out horribly, it could\u2019ve gone much smoother if I hadn\u2019t been too stubborn to do some research using ecology and modeling). \n",

          "text": "That's an interesting point. In your PhD you have to prioritize what's most important to your end goals and you as a person. I forged my own way, as you say, by coming up with a new hypothesis that no one in the lab had pursued before. It was tough, and getting started took a matter of years. I developed my own in vitro model and conducted a 1.5 year animal study with (luckily) exciting results. It's finally paying off and I'm starting to publish in my 5th year. But it was/is a slog, and I could have just as easily ended up with a hypothesis that was dead wrong. Of course you can publish negative results but it's harder, and it's also just a downer that I imagine can sap your motivation. I feel proud of what I've done, but it would have been easier and more \"productive\" (in terms of deliverables like papers) to continue a previous lab member's research question. ",

The latter will likely have very little time to devote to any one student of theirs, and will likely also be less invested in the success of individual students.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much of a difference this made to the experience of my cohort of PhD students. I was lucky enough to choose someone who was young and motivated; a lot of my friends in the Master's program went after some of the more senior and better known faculty in the department. The amount of personal attention that I received from my adviser was incomparable.",

Pick a younger PI.\n\nIt sucks not being able to buy things you need or to be hindered by cost. Also it\u2019s a good sign of your PIs success.\n\nOld and well funded, however, will not be as hungry for publishing and may only want to publish big papers. Kind of a Captain Ahab syndrome. A younger PI will be more cautious and most likely will be willing to be more prolific.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that your PI is at the cutting edge of his field no matter how obscure. Sure, top journals may not be interested but you may kill it in some more niche journals. You don\u2019t need to publish in Nature for your PhD and having a lot of first author smaller papers will give you good experience and still look good on a CV. Better than being 3rd author on some high impact paper IMO. Also, the benefit of being on a cutting edge is that anything you do is new while if your PI is piggy backing on a high impact field, the chance of you doing something the actual cutting edge PIs haven\u2019t done is slim. \n\nFinally, it may be late but go somewhere interdisciplinary. Step out of your comfort zone which would be your undergrad major. ",

Not many bachelors or masters grad can \"know\" what a good supervisor for them will or will not be.
