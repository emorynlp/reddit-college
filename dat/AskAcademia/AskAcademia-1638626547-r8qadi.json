  "title:": "Is it possible to make corrections to a thesis after it has been defended?",
  "text": "I realized that I made a mistake in one of the arguments of my master thesis, fortunately for me, it is not something very noticeable and does not change the conclusions of the project or what I wanted to say, and my advisor already graded me with a relatively good grade. However, I have to defend it before the rest of the jurors in a few days, and I do not know if they will notice it (to which I can argue that it is something correctable and that does not affect the conclusions), or if they will not notice it and will give me another type of corrections or comments.\n\nMy question is, in case they do not notice it, would it be ok if after the presentation and before submitting the thesis again to the faculty, I make that correction? \n\nI do not know if the question is ethical or disciplinary, if it is ethical, I would run the risk, since I have fully clear that it is not something that affects the conclusions and that I can correct, if it is disciplinary, I do not think I run the risk but I do not know if it is then I would like to know what you think.\n\nGreetings and thanks in advance!",

She gets graded for your dissertation? \n\nSo for a PhD thesis you almost always have corrections you have to do after the defence before you can pass your PhD, but I've never heard of it happening for a master's (doesn't mean it doesn't, just I've never heard of it). You should find out what the process is and whether the decision to pass/fail is made at the defence etc. Then I would ask, is your master's dissertation deposited anywhere? If so, you do need to ascertain now whether you can make amendments after the defence. If you can't I'd say you have two options, one is to tell your advisor now and see if you can correct it and the other is you might be able to put in a corrigendum page at the beginning of your dissertation alerting the reader to the error and the correct information. \n\nIf your dissertation isn't going to be made available to others then I wouldn't worry about it. You can acknowledge the error in your defence and forget about it.",
