I work in his lab\npaid during this semester, and the day before he\ntold me he would also support me next semester.\nI am only a UG researcher paid for 6hr/week (barely\nbecause i'm dual enrolled through my high school)\nwith no support from any other UGs or a grad\nstudent. I also end up working more than this 6 hour\nmark a week because of his expectations. I also\ncontrol the research direction in it's entirely, unlike\nother labs where there are grad students facilitating\nthe direction of a project. After this, I feel very\nunmotivated to continue in his lab.\nIs this a red flag to continue working in his lab?

      "text": "About a month ago I reached out to a professor to ask if he wanted to do a project together this summer and he said that he would supervise me for undergrad research if I could get funding for the summer. I said I would love to and also sent out another email when I completed my portion of the funding application. After I didn't hear anything back from him I asked another professor whether I should send another email and they said that I should just send a reminder because he's probably just super busy. So I sent that third email 3 days ago and still did not receive a reply. Is this common? It feels like the professor changed his mind about working with me. I have been told that I should try to go to his office hours to talk to him face to face but after 3 unanswered emails I am unsure if that would be a good idea.\n\nIt would be great to get some advice on what would be the best thing to do in this situation. The part of the application that he needs to fill out for the funding is due in February.",

It doesn't matter why you had the file as you could have had it for any number of reasons, so including documentation of the side business and the fact you gave it to someone else doesn't really matter. You could have used it for your business and still intentionally submitted it.\n\nInstead, you should try and demonstrate that your original work was completed before the due date, and explain how you made the error (eg. similar file names.) \n\nYour punishment will depend on the policies of your institution and you should familiarise yourself with the academic misconduct policy of your university.",

Not in the sense of how to make people live longer, but the philosophical implications. But this will all really depend on your school, you say you're in a top 5 so i bet you can find something.\nIf you do something like an honors thesis that would be another good way and would also get you good LOR.\nAnother piece of advise -- schools tend to have academic advisors. Depending on where you go and the size of your department they could be very specialized, so how much they can help you may vary. But I definitely recommend talking to them just to see what they are like, you might find they are very helpful (or maybe the opposite, who knows?)\n\nIts also not a terrible idea to approach your professor and ask them what they think. They did it themselves, they should know and would be very happy to help\n\nPhilosophy is out of my area but I am gonna make an educated guess and say you need to do well on the verbal section of the GRE, studying for it in your summers could give you a boost.\n\nFinally don't forget that good letters of recommendation are just as helpful as good grades, and can even make up for a bad gpa. Most schools will require three (at least in my field they do, I am pretty sure most departments will require three tho)",
