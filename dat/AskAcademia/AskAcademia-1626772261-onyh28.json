  "text": "This is something I\u2019ve been mulling over, especially in the wake of the UK\u2019s UCU \u2018postgraduate researchers as staff\u2019 and \u2018stamping out casual contracts\u2019 manifestos. I know that there have been some big rows in academia pre- and during COVID regarding workloads and the above matters, and I\u2019d love to know what other ECRs think, if it\u2019s something that\u2019s frowned upon and if it\u2019s ultimately worth it?",
