  "title:": "The student that just brings a notebook to class...",
  "text": "My whole academic career I\u2019ve never brought more than my notebook, a pen, and an open engaged mind to class... I do it for myself, and I\u2019ve never really questioned it - for me it allows me to make the most free form / interconnected notes, when I hand-write things I feel it helps me retain the things I\u2019m learning better, not having a computer in front of me forces me to engage in the lecture or seminar - there\u2019s no distractions, there\u2019s no laptop to hide behind - I\u2019m not just attending I\u2019m present. \n\nThis has never been something I\u2019ve questioned much, in my undergrad sure most other students had laptops but I never thought anything of it and they never thought anything of me. I\u2019ve recently started grad school, at a quite elite institution with lots of very wealthy international students (that\u2019s far from my socio-economic background). I\u2019ve been showing up to class with my trusty notebook and pen, stowing my notes in nicely divided folders... my usual thing. \n\nBut for the first time ever I\u2019ve been getting comments about it from my peers - \u2018oh that\u2019s so old school\u2019 - \u2018how do you work like that?\u2019 - \u2018we\u2019re going to need you to type up your notes for our google drive!\u2019 Etc. It\u2019s suddenly made me very self-conscious about my approach to learning, and I have noticed that when I show up to the seminars I\u2019m the only person in the room without a laptop in front of me, when I get out my paper and pen I almost feel naked in the classroom. I wonder what my professors think, because clearly the other students with their shiny MacBook Pro\u2019s have noticed it... it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have a laptop, it\u2019s just my entire life I\u2019ve never been encouraged to use one in a classroom environment - in school electronics were banned! \n\nSo I wanted to get the perspective from ideally academics and other post-grad students about this, am I doing something wrong? What\u2019s your perception of the student with just a notepad?? \n\n[reminds me of this meme (which I feel on a spiritual level!)](https://i.postimg.cc/CMjjkRP0/565-A61-B2-A899-4-AD9-B974-1-AC0-C27-A44-AF.jpg)",

      "text": "I actually beg my students to take notes by hand because multiple studies shows it improves information retention - the brain processes info differently when it's written vs typed.  Students also tend to take notes that reflect more processing of the material when writing,  whereas typed notes tend to be more of a transcription.\n\nI always think better of a student who does it \"the old school way\". They tend to be my better,  more engaged students.  So keep bringing that notebook!",

                  "text": "Summarizing what you've just listened to (or read) and putting it into your own words (or trying to explain it to someone else like in \"Learning by Teaching\" model) is beneficial to learning. Playing stenographer and only lending a quarter of your attention to the professor, not having a sliver of mind space to even really internalize what's being said, much less engage with the professor on it, and just trying to keep up is definitely not.\n\nNote-taking with its best foot forward would be something like an inverted classroom where students on their own time and at their own pace can watch a lecture at home. They then are required, once they come to class, to either submits a set of original notes in their own words for marks, or simply submit to a conceptual quiz on the content (they can then use whatever learning technique works best for them). Then once in class you focus on the active application of the concepts learned with a constant back-and-forth of the ideas and concepts with the professor. The class is not an info-dump, it's a guided activity based around applying and reinforcing the course content.\n\nOn its worst footing is a professor who doesn't follow the textbook (or give a textbook) and refuses to (or is too lazy to) provide a comprehensive set of notes and thus force the student to play court reporter lest they simply miss the content forever and the purpose of the lecture is then not for the student to learn anything but rather a supervised stenography session.\n\nAdd to this that in something like STEM most teachers are below average and most lower- to mid-level courses across the world follow the same handful of textbooks, then submitting to the traditional lecture format is basically  having a sub-par educator orate a textbook to you poorly and then doing assignment questions on your own time from the back of the book.",

      "text": "I believe that most real academics will not care how you register information, as long as you achieve the goalposts of your academic curriculum. A professor will always prefer a student who is articulated and well organised regardless of how organises his learning.\n\nEach one has a different approach to learning, so if you feel that pen and paper do the trick for you that's absolutely fine. Many academics I know (including me) will jot down first the important piece of information because that will help register them in their mind.\n\nDon't cave in to the peer pressure of the other students, especially if that will screw up your  learning process. Many academics do not understand that we develop our knowledge through processes of learning, which are different for each one of us; many people in academia, especially students,  think that collecting the information counts as learning, but that is completely wrong.\n\nWhat I would suggest you to do is to look into how you could enhance your learning process, so you could manage the curriculum of a grad school (that is much heavier than an undergrad program). This may include use of special paper notebooks, mind-maps etc or the use of software that will help you improve your learning process (e.g citation managers, academic apps, electronic lab records etc) but that does not mean you'll have to quit pen and paper.",

      "text": "Fellow grad student here. I can afford to take my notes on computer. I prefer them handwritten. I find that my ability to focus is considerably greater if I'm not constantly looking at a screen. I write faster looking away, and there are a million things I can do to make my short hand legible that just don't work on a computer.\n\nWhich isn't to say I don't computerize notes. But mostly because I'm shit at indexing and so I transfer what I consider important into things like one note since I can search those better. And I tend to make annotations and reviews in solo work on computer, since there I'm working at my own pace. Its a little different in zoom world obviously, but that's mostly because of the physical limitations of my workspace.\n\nPoint being, you're not doing anything wrong. As an instructor, I couldn't care less about what medium my students use to take notes. As a student, I use what works best for me.\n\nI would however offer a somewhat sympathetic explanation for what your colleagues are saying. Notes on computer, as I said, are easier to cross reference. They're easier to find when you're looking back through months or even years of material at short notice to complete assignments on crunch (such as comps). It is possible your colleagues are talking about drive and such like mostly to figure out if you've got a comprehensive indexing system down. If you don't index, then you might want to consider migrating your notes regularly. Without a detailed index, if you're looking for that one idea from a discussion a year and a half ago and you need it urgently for an assignment due next week, you'll be wasting a lot of time. Whether you work digital or analog, make sure you can work your way through the weeds of your material. For handwritten material, referencing and indexing is key.\n\nPS: Online notes are also great for the mechanical aspects of note taking, specifically referencing. I maintain a roster on word off every book or article I've ever cited properly laid out so that when I need to cite, I just copy the citation quickly without wasting time digging. But in the long run, this just saves minutes in time. So if its not something that works for you, its not exactly a killer.",

I personally went through all of grad school using a metal clipboard with a storage area, I don't know what they are called, but something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Clipboard-Storage-Holder-Capacity/dp/B07F6YLHKC/). But that was in the late 90s and people didn't really have laptops in class then, though many had palmpilots for our calendars, etc.\n\nThere are only two advantages I see for laptops in class now.  One, you don't have to kill a bunch of trees to print out all of your papers, though it is still easier for me to make notes on paper than annotating pdfs.  The second is that some students will do lit searches in class.  Someone will ask an interesting question that no one knows the answer to and then a couple of people will start looking on their own until they find a paper that they then can share.  Everyone once and a while when I'm talking I will vaguely recall a relevant paper or new story, and some student will track it down.  I guess a third one is when we are using software in class, like for stats analysis, the student gets to use it on the computer that they will use at home instead of on a university computer which could be different. \n\nBut for everyone that I have seen use laptops in a very productive manner in class, I have seen at least twice as many using it to do stuff unrelated to class.  This is more often with undergrads, but I've seen grad students doing it also. \n\nThis was a long way around to say you keep doing you.  As long as you are prepared for class, your professor does not care if you do not have a laptop and possibly likes it.",

              "text": "I appreciate your comment. I have one-on-one conversations with all students who have a disability accommodation. (If I learned they needed to use a laptop, but the form didn't specifically list it, I'd just take them at their word. It hasn't happened yet.)\n\nExcluding laptops/phones from class outside of specific tasks doesn't put students at a disadvantage. It **actively supports** their ability (and motivation) to take notes. There's plenty of data on this. If anything, I remain committed to this position *because* I'm professionally and personally invested in setting a more equal stage and reducing the achievement gap. (Also worth noting the digital divide plays a role in that gap.)\n\nFor me, claiming this approach disadvantages someone is akin to saying discussion-based classes disadvantage students used to lectures. I understand the logic, but it doesn't hold up because encountering **difference** isn't the same as **disadvantage.** And, like with laptops, the research shows students learn more from facilitated discussions/mix of pedagogical approaches than from pure lecturing.\n\nI expect students to learn several new skills in my classrooms. It's okay if taking notes by hand is one of those, especially since notes aren't the only review materials they have access to. One scholar put it well: *students don't need a transcript of the class--they need to pay attention.*\n\n(And, to be clear, undergrads aren't especially weak-willed. We're *all* susceptible to online distraction (and what's now being recognized as a form of addiction), whether it's in a graduate class or a faculty meeting.)",

That\u2019s fine. That difference is absolutely fine. \n\nI\u2019m concerned about the students who have (documented) attention and processing disorders. Students with hearing issues. ESL students who are already mentally transliterating spoken English to the language they understand best. My default is to level the playing field using the form most comfortable to the student. While I understand there are different ways to effectively run classrooms I do believe that, really, if a student wants a transcription of the class then they should have it. This feeling is biased. It comes from being in multiple classrooms where my assistive technology was pointed out by the instructor to be a \u201ccrutch\u201d or \u201cnot feasible for \u2018the world outside the US.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s made me acutely aware of how important it is to some students to appear competent to an instructor, for the instructor\u2019s definition of competent, at the sacrifice of their own comfort.",

                      "text": "Oh, I absolutely agree with you that students with documented disabilities should be accommodated so that they have the same opportunities to succeed. I also agree it's important to make sure students know you're actively invested in making the necessary changes for their success. I work closely with ESL students, because I grew up in a multilingual household, often translated within my community, and have professional experience in translation, so I'm aware of certain challenges that arise in that context.\n\nI also agree with your third paragraph. I didn't make it clear that when I say \"pay attention,\" I don't mean to imply some sort of monolithic, Platonic ideal of perfect, unwavering attention. That doesn't exist. Instead, I understand attention as an active state of focus that includes moments we think of as distractions (thinking about your crush, an upcoming interview, lunch, etc.) and moments we don't think of as distractions, even though they technically are (thinking of a point the professor made in a previous class, trying to see how this new concept can fit into the paper you're writing, etc.). It's also, as you say, affected by our differing human processing capabilities. Because of my research, I take this more complex idea of attention as a given, but that's not the common understanding.\n\nI will disagree on one point: even if a student wants a transcription (which is something I'd be willing to discuss), **the student should** ***not*** **be the one producing it.** Note-taking ceases to be effective when it becomes pure transcription (akin to highlight everything on every page). A student can't pause to mull something over, formulate a follow-up question, participate in group work, flip through the text to make a sudden connection to another concept, or respond to their peer if they're concerned with copying every word.\n\n(Transcription also gets into complex territory because of the question of the professor's intellectual property, as well as the other students' right to privacy. But I could imagine a scenario in which the university paid a transcriber, and there was a secure procedure for that student to access and permanently erase the transcriptions once the semester ended.)",

Personally, I find pen and paper to be better for me as well because it allows me to draw arrows and scribble around if I want to connect multiple things together and I don't get to do that when I am at home working on the computer. Also, I think you memorize things better when you actually write them down by hand and not just type it. At least, that works for me as well.\nHope it helps!",

Things may be different for most people. But for me, it works in grad school and not during my undergrad because:\n\n1. The pace of material at grad school is so hard, intense, and voluminous that my handwriting speed can\u2019t keep up. Instead I am forced to type since typing is faster than my handwriting. \n\n2. I realize that I don\u2019t go back and re-read my handwritten notes. This is a personal thing to me. I re-read printed materials and printed PowerPoint slides. I go back to my handwritten notes if I forgot something and I want to look it up. But personally I study from the textbooks, YouTube videos, and printed materials. \n\nNotebooks can also be a hassle to take along. I have to bring my laptop anyways. So I might as well type my notes. Since abandoning notebooks, and borrowing books from the library, my book bag is lightweight and mostly just my laptop and charger now. \n\n\nThus different strokes for different folks. Quite literally, I guess.\n\nThere are cons with having a laptop:\n\n1. finding a charger in a lecture hall or classroom (solution: get to class early and find the nearest port or buy a laptop with a strong battery)\n\n2. the constant distraction (this I really struggle with. Thus, sometimes I turn off my WiFi or I install a software that blocks distracting websites until class is over). \n\n3. It\u2019s hard to type math, physics, and engineering equations. So I\u2019m learning how to type in latex now. \n\n\n\n\nI do have to study and retain information by restudying the material and writing things down on a whiteboard or chalkboard. \n\nBut that\u2019s how I study.

Retention and engagement is much higher when you don't have a screen and when you're writing things out. The bottom line of these studies is:\n\n* When you can type, you can literally record conversations/lectures verbatim, which -- funny enough -- does not actually do all that much for you. You'd then have to go back and read it again later to recall things, talk it out with others, etc. Not saying it's bad but it doesn't DO much for you.\n* Whereas when you're using pen-and-paper, you're forced to decide what's worth writing, and so your brain is identifying key points, transferring ideas into your own words/notations, etc., and what that does is actually gets your brain working at a deeper level with the ideas/lecture than those who are just transferring every word mindlessly onto a new medium.\n* And then of course there's engagement, which is not really contentious: you don't have amazon, FB, discord, or reddit on your notebook lmao. \n\nPoint being, 100% do you. I had a buddy who took notes by hand during PhD coursework while I used a laptop. I \\*100\\* wish I could go back and follow his model, it's so much better. I have switched to that model for lectures and seminars--only take notes by hand, my laptop stays in my bag.",

I find it easier to remember and I find myself more engaged in discussion when I write out my notes on paper. Personally, I bring a laptop to classes just in case I have to look something up, but notes are all pen and paper for in-person classes. To successfully get through grad school, it's important to use learning techniques that you know work for you. In the end, it won't matter if you used a laptop or not... nobody will care or remember. All that matters is you did your best and you are happy and comfortable with your approach to grad school.",

I still keep a small notebook in my bag if I want to jot something down during a seminar, use a physical notebook as my lab notebook, and also keep a physical planner with my calendar, but I also incorporated an iPad with an Apple Pencil into the mix and it has actually really improved my record keeping and helps supplement my written notes. Also, once I started teaching it became essential to have digital help. I swear by the program OneNote because it seamlessly syncs your devices and can be organized like a real life notebook! You can upload PDFs and write on them\u2014 it\u2019s brilliant!",

Most of my graduate courses had PowerPoint presentations densely packed with specific info and figures from journal articles. I ended up downloading these and using OneNote to take notes/draw over the slides on my laptop. I think every one of my classmates did this too. It took getting used to but it can work very well if teachers provide their slides. \n\nOne thing I really like about it is now I have a great repository of  searchable grad school notes so it's very easy to find specific pieces of knowledge. One thing that is worth considering is what software to use and what storage options there are. I don't recommend using an academic affiliated account for your personal notes on a cloud based software because those licenses can change and transferring data between accounts can be a huge pain.",

In seminars I usually bring the books weve read and a notebook, usually with my reading notes. Ill jot down interesting questions or points, but even here I much rather prefer to be engaged in a discussion then writing down copious notes. \n\nI used to do my notes all in the same style of yellow spiral bound legal pad.

      "text": "Your way (notebook only) is unquestionably the best for learning and retention.  \n\nStudy after study has shown that taking notes on a laptop (as opposed to writing in a notebook by hand) is *detrimental* to retention. \n\nEducation scholars theorize that writing is actually more difficult than typing, so the additional complexity of writing a note (versus type a note) helps to retain it. \n\nMe, I think it's more ephemeral then that--it's your brain not having a *de facto* barrier between you and \"knowledge\" that is coming in.    Also, part of our own brain's \"storage\" system is spacial, so if you write a note on (say) the bottom left hand page of your notebook, you're more likely to recall it than if you type in into an infinitely-malleable blank space.  \n\nAlso, notebooks help the learning environment.  As a classroom teacher, I *hate* laptops.  And usually ban them where possible.  There is no quicker way to kill a discussion (of a book, article, text, whatever) then to have students have open laptops in front of them.  (This is based on 20 years of teaching at the university level.) \n\nNow, this doesn't mean there's no place for laptops, of course.  They're fantastically-useful machines.  And your fellow grad students are right in that laptops are incredibly useful for storing and sorting information (i.e. those notes). \n\nMe, I would love to have a way to scan paper notes into a computer after class, and have them \"turn into\" flawless text for storage and further use/manipulation.. but that's not possible yet.  (at least, not with my handwriting... :-) \n\nSo, in short, there's a cost-benefit calculation here:\n\n- notebook-only aids retention, and facilitates the learning experience of the classroom.\n\n- laptop-usage aids storage, transmission, and further usage/manipulation, but sacrifices retention and classroom experience. \n\nI think you're right to choose the first.",
