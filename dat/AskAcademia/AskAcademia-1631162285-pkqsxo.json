  "text": "I recently started a masters program in biomedical engineering with my only prerequisite being a bachelors in biology. Now being three weeks into the program i definitely feel that i lack a lot of background knowledge in engineering that seems crucial to the program. Is there any hope of me learning 3 years worth of calculus and engineering in the next few week?",

      "text": "I joined a PhD program in finance. In a program like this, you need to take several Economics and Statistics classes. At this level, Econ is basically applied mathematics.\nThe last time I took an Econ class was in HIGH SCHOOL. The last time I took basic calculus was over 15 years ago. I was in over my head.\n\nHow did I make it? First, I reached out to classmates and formed a great study group. We would meet every week to go over the homework. Second, I searched online for other study materials. Third, I tried to find books that were like Cliff\u2019s Notes. The one for Econ was called Schiff\u2019s Math for Econ. It was a lifesaver. Maybe they have something like that for your field? Finally, talk to your Professor. They are much more flexible and accommodating to grad students. Particularly if you show how much you care and how hard you\u2019re working. Hope that helps. Good luck!",

I plan on working with a calculus tutor to get me caught up! I guess i just wasn\u2019t expecting to jump in at such a high level",

      "text": "Masters programmes take people in from all sorts of backgrounds. You may well find that the engineers on your course are finding the bio side as equally unassailable.\n\nGet together, share your knowledge with others and get them to share theirs. /u/simo808  is absolutely correct - study groups and collaboration are a huge asset in Masters settings and will make ALL of you better biomedical engineers.",

          "text": "This is great advice too thank you! I wound up talking to a few students who were struggling with the bio class im in and it definitely made me feel more at ease because this class is basically a beginner level cell bio class for me. Basically a \u201cthe mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\u201d class. The hardest part about this program is finding other students in my position or even other students who are also starting their first semester; especially with covid and some of the classes being on line. The campus is also huge and ive always been shy so its challenging to find first year students in my program but I do realize this is one of the keys to success",
