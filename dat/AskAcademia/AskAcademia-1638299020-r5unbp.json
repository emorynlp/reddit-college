You can always preface with a very short intro about you to help calm yourself if that helps. Don't be afraid to ad lib a little, don't be afraid to skip reading every bit of text on a projected image. Check that the projector etc works beforehand, with enough time to problem solve if there's an issue. Don't rush through it. If there are challenges to you at the end from an audience member, (if questions are allowed) address what you can and if they're are really severe and possibly legitimate (rare) then say you'd love to discuss with them afterward. Then do so to help you clarify, they may or may not have seen something you missed. If you're like me you'll come away feeling like you did a crappy job and second guessing things. I've learned that's just what I do, even when things go great. So I now try to slough off my hypercriticality.",

If you think about you talking as you being horribly nervous and falling apart you won't have anywhere else to go with it because you haven't actually thought about how doing it well looks, only how badly it can go. It gets easier over time.",
