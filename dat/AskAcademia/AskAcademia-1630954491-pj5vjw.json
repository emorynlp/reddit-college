  "text": "I'm a DMA (doctor of musical arts) candidate expecting to graduate in May of 2023. In a nice gesture, my university provides doctoral regalia to all students graduating at that level.  \n\nHowever...\n\nI think the university provided regalia is cheaply made and doesn't look nearly as nice as the regalia worn by our professors at commencement. \n\nI'm looking to go into a career in academia, and would like to invest in a nicer set of robes for myself. Would this be gauche, or am I within my rights to do so, as long as they adhere to the design laid out by the university?",

I only wear regalia once a year, tops, at commencement and we aren't required to go. Some places have convocations and other events where it is expected though. \n\nYou are free to buy regalia, it is just a pricey investment (close to $1000 for me) and just wouldn't make sense from a return on investment perspective for me. I just go with the cheap version that my university pays for each year when I do go to commencement.",

But if you are not entering academia you will 100% never wear the gown again. But it's your money \u2014 do what you want, ultimately! I would push for a more functional gift, personally. ;-)",

We newly minted PhDs got the hood provided by them as a gift. The hoods are perfectly nice quality, but of course the caps-and-gowns are more cheaply made than those that most of the professors wear, which cost 5-10 times that. Does it matter? No! The graduates look nicely symmetrical on the pictures and the faculty are more colorful. Also. The cheapo regalia have their own dignity - they're made from recycled plastic and burn cleanly, if desired. (Some professors, from countries where regalia aren't used, also have a set of the plain versions for ceremonies. Including some eminent ones. It's fine.) \n\nI'd definitely wait until wearing regalia becomes part of an annual tradition for me, if ever, to get a nicer set to wear with my hood.",

My graduate school R1 had very nice doctoral gowns that they loaned to graduating students each year. In my year, they let us keep them because they were replacing them the following year.  I wore that for 32 years without any problems as it gradually faded and started to look pretty tacky. When I became the senior faculty member (I just survived longer than anybody else!) I had to sit on the stage and my sewing-handy wife told me I had to buy a new gown. I told her it wasn't at all happy to pay $1000 for a twice a year event that is focused on the students. So, she took my old gown, took it apart and used it as a pattern to make a new one with cheap-o fabric she found on clearance. The small amount of felt she had to buy was the most expensive part of it. Thirty dollars later I had a very nice gown. She even put a pocket in it!",
