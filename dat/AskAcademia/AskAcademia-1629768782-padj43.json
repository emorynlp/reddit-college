He didn't think a simple \"I won't be in class today\" was sufficient.\n\nObnoxious/Common: That student had a friend in the course, and they would routinely sign for each other on the sign-in sheet and do each other's homework assignments. When caught and punished, they accused the dean of being prejudiced against their nationality, and threatened to call their embassy and have us all fired. I think they got dismissed for their violations, and never called anyone.",

      "text": "I think my least favorite part about TAing was the students begging for points or extra credit at the end of the semester. \n\nOne of my worst semesters was the very first time I taught Genetics lab. I fixated more on minute details, like grammar and spelling on the lab reports, than on making sure my students understood the concepts behind their experiments. This majorly backfired, because it took me longer to grade the reports and I had students fighting tooth and nail against things that weren't so important to focus. After that, I learned to focus on the comments and made grammar a small component of the grading. \n\nOne tip for grading, whether a long test or a written report, is to do the same section for all students at once, in the same night. Our moods change night by night, and one night grade more strictly one night and more lax the next, which isn't fair to the students. If you grade the same section for all students at the same time, it's a bit more equitable.\n\nMost awkward thing that ever happened was a student waiting to turn in their final exam after everyone else had left so they could ask me out. Their rationale was it was the last class so I wasn't their TA anymore, but I still had to grade their exam and final lab report...",

I could easily say 'X part of the answer is worth 3 points, Y part is worth 2 for everyone'. The rubrics didn't take that long to write and probably saved more time while grading anyway.",

      "text": "TA\u2019d organic chemistry here. Honestly, most students are good, but you get the stupidly entitled ones that make you lose all hope for humanity. Or, at least, medicine since literally every single one of my problem students were proudly premed\u2026\n\nAt my university, grad students were paid to TA and not research, and TA evals affect our pay. Had a student come into my office and not-so-subtly threaten to report me to the lab director in front of my lab for taking marks off \u201cunfairly\u201d with no explanations after the first lab. If ink was blood, I\u2019d have died from blood loss. Her observations were incomplete and her lab report missing big discussion points. I wish I can say the rest of the semester only went up from there. They demanded all my attention and complained loudly if I even tried to help another student. They\u2019d bully the students nearby to get them to doing their work. Near the halfway mark, my strategy was to essentially unload them on the poor lab director who came in to just check on everybody so I could go help other students. \n\nI had a habit of sending emails out the night before the lab to point out stuff they need to have for their pre-lab and what to watch out for during the lab. Totally optional on my end and I had a student email me to complain that it\u2019s very frustrating that I email them the night before instead of days in advance since THEY do their pre labs days ahead. I teach early in the week so I\u2019d be emailing on weekends if I followed their demand. Also I know for a fact many of my students procrastinate so emailing any earlier means they\u2019ll just forget and ignore the email. Of course this is also me as a grad student in my last year when I\u2019m pulling crazy hours to collect all the data I need for my dissertation.\n\nDespite the occasional bad student, I did find TAing to be a rewarding experience and did get pretty good reviews from most of them. A lot of students get told going into university that they\u2019re just a number, and I tried to make sure that wasn\u2019t the case. I made sure i was openly communicating my expectations and emphasized that they are more than welcome to ask me any questions they may have, even telling them the best times to try to get ahold of me and making sure to be more available before big deadlines. I try to get to know them a little bit and build some rapport since I found that students are more willing to come talk to me about their issues in the lab if they\u2019re not afraid I\u2019ll bite their heads off. It\u2019s more work - I\u2019m exhausted after every session - but it was worth it because it helped save a lot of time when marking their lab reports. If they come to me about their questions before they write their report, I can usually guide them and the. it\u2019s usually a lot easier to mark them. Much better than trying to figure out what went wrong and how to mark the report when the experiments gone belly up (I find that it\u2019s very rare that a full zero on their results/discussions is warranted, but sometimes their presentation of their work makes it difficult to figure out where the marks should be).",

      "text": "TA'd a large course where a student came up to me after a quiz and said one of the questions was \"wrong by definition\". Really got in my face about it with ludicrous arguments about why they should get the points back. I was new to the job and it got to me and I yelled back and finally said \"I'm sorry but no. Next.\" Now, us TAs have a system where if any disputes over grades arise, we ask students to submit their reasoning in writing. About 90% never do, and it cools emotions among those who do.",

      "text": "I don't really have a worst experience, but I will say that the worst part about TAing large courses is grading. If your course has weekly or biweekly assignments per requirements set by the prof, and if those assignments require reading essay responses or checking work in-depth, then all your research/writing/coursework prep time is often sucked away. Be mindful of how many hours you spend on prep/grading and don't let it take away from your progress in the program.\n\nI would also say to keep strong boundaries with the students. You are not their peer, even if you are similar ages.",
