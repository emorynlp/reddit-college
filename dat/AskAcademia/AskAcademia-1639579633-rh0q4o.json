  "text": "Hi guys I have two questions regarding my academic path in biochemistry field and would greatly appreciate the advice.\n\n1. I have 2 options of master thesis: either do it about the topic that I am more interested in but limit myself from learning new methods and techniques, or do thesis in a lab that has all the fancy equipments I want to study but the topic is not very near to my heart. Which one would be more important for a job search in industry or for PhD position: knowing many methods or the topic you have chosen for master's thesis?\n2. Does doing the PhD in industry prevents you to re-enter academia later, as a professor for example?",

Knowing methods is helpful but you really want to be part of the lab that has alumni doing things you\u2019d might want to do. \n\nIndustry postdocs are rare in my field but from what I know, if you want to at all have the option to stay in academia, do an academic postdoc.",
