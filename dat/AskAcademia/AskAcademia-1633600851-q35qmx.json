  "text": "Hello,\n\nI want to become a better lecturer. Are there any online resources or books for example that people might recommend that have perhaps been beneficial to them? Youtubers/Udemy courses etc? My institute has some resources but they're mostly pretty poor so looking to take better ownership of it.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I actually did a teacher training qualification. You get ones specifically for teaching adults. There's not a whole lot online that isn't very niche or useless \"aspirational\" TED talks. \n\nVague but practical, unsorted advice:\n\n* Work to formula. I had two lecture templates that I basically alternated between and that was fine. Students don't need constant novelty. It also made planning a lot easier. \n* Think about \"flow\" in structuring lectures. Managing attention is a large part of managing learning, and an up-down-up-down approach can work well. Brief \"engagement\" starter activity, then introduce the topic for the day, then something practical (even if it's a quiz or a discussion or something), then more theory, then something that engages them again as a final thing. Add in more ups and downs as needed. \n* Keep notes short and concise and put them online. Notes on slides should summarise or support what you're saying. Don't just read slides out loud. \n* Even grownups like things like Kahoot interactive quizzes, as long as they're used sparingly. Try it and read the room. Classes often have a \"culture\" that you'll have to tweak stuff for. \n* Avoid gimmicks. Don't try to be cute. If you've got a really good mnemonic that works as a song, give them a youtube link, don't expect them to sing along there and then. \n* Don't try to reinvent the wheel. If something online is fine, then use it. Ask your colleagues if they have any resources on whatever you need if you know they have taught the module before. \n* Acknowledge that some things are just hard to learn, whether they be conceptually quite complex or abstract or just things you have to memorise until one day they click. Again, this helps with managing student motivation - it helps ease problems like worrying about imposter syndrome and encourages students to trust you and feed back about what they find difficult. \n\nStuff like the [5-minute lesson plan](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/product/5-minute-lesson-plan-2021/) can help with planning, although it was written for schools so skip the bits you don't need.\n\nI'm a fan of Neil Postman's book *Teaching as a Subversive Activity*, which sounds more radical than it is. It's a good book on basically being aware of your own bullshit. It's very 60s, but the core message still stands: if your students aren't learning then you clearly aren't teaching them, are you?\n\nDweck's work on \"Growth Mindset\" is a good model for student feedback. It's a bit heavy on the branding and jargon and the core of it is nothing new, but if you can find a condensed version I think it's helpful.",

      "text": "It depends a lot on your weak points. There are really two roles that you fill as a lecturer: writer (of lectures), and performer. If writing is your issue, then there is a wealth of academic literature on how to structure lectures. My favourite was The Lecturer Toolkit that I had to read for my training. If performing is the issue, then in my humble opinion as a young academic is that nothing beats watching videos of your favourite teachers and emulating/appropriating what you like about their style in order to make your own. My personal influences were videos of Marvin Minsky, Patrick Winston, Gilbert Strang, with a lot of influence from my own teachers when I was in my undergrad.",
