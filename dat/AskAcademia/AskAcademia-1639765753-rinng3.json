  "title:": "Second Round TT-job Interviews (Campus Visits) for 2021-2: In-person or Online?",
  "text": "Hello everyone on the job market or in search committees. Have you seen any hints of whether the campus visits for this cycle are going to be in-person or online? I'm looking at jobs in the US and am trying to figure out how I should best arrange my schedule in case these are still going to be in person and involve the hassles of travel. Thanks!",

We would prefer to do the final interviews in person, but given the new variant, are not sure that is a good idea. Either way we decide, we will have to do all the interviews in the same format (in-person or online). I am interested to know how others are thinking about this.",

          "text": "We did phone interviews for the prelims from the 1990s into the mid-2000s, then moved to skype. Then to zoom. I really hated Skype, as we often had technical issues-- usually with the candidate's lack of bandwidth --that really made it less useful than a phone call. But zoom has worked well in more recent searches. I think it's fine for the first round, which for us is usually 10-12 candidates who get cut to a short list of five.\n\nThe final interviews really must be on campus though...ours are usually two nights/two full days and there's really no way a zoom would replace the experience of being on campus, getting tours of facilities, meeting various groups, meeting with students, etc.  We pretty much stopped hiring during the lockdown in 2020 but returned (cautiously) to in-person interviews for finalists last year and it worked fine. That said, with the latest variant causing concern I don't know what will happen this winter-- but so far this fall finalists have been on campus for all searches.",

The school was very willing to work with me and my risk preferences in setting things up, and I was very much appreciative of that.",

There's no way I think you can generalize on this-- you'll have to ask the specific search committee chair or wait to get an invite unless there is something in the job posting.",
