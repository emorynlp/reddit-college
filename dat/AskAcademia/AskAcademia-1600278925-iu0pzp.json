  "text": "Hi, AllWondering what the best path to take is if all my inquiry emails have gone unanswered.I'm still early in the application process but it's wildly frustrating to send out tens of emails and only have 1 response. I know academics have an extra burden with the state of education today but geeze, a simple \"not seeking students\" would do.Should I send out a round of gentle reminders? Researchers, how would you respond to follow up emails? Would that just be irksome?Thanks for any insight!\n\n\\*EDIT\\* Maybe a \"geeze\" was too aggressive, I realize everyone is extra busy right now - I'm just seeking guidance on what the people on the other side of things (PIs) think about the matter and what efforts would improve my chance of a response. I do not think I'm entitled to one.\n\n For those curious about how personalized my emails are, here's an example. Any critique would be appreciated!   \n\n\nHello, Dr. Name specified \n\nMy name is Mysterioussugar. I graduated from the University of State's Earth science program in a year. The weirdness which abounds in 2020 has nudged me back towards academia and I\u2019m very interested in the University's ESS program. My background is in paleoclimate. Specifically, I worked with my advisor to evaluate the stability of the EAIS during the plio-pleistocene transition as an analogue for future warming. At the time this seemed pretty cut-and-dry, a very obvious and tangible indicator of climate forcing. It wasn\u2019t until I started considering how exactly the data was integrated with models and the immense number of uncertainties and challenges that went along with the process that I became interested in proxy/model synthesis work. \n\nYour research seems positioned at the intersection of the paleoclimatology I\u2019m familiar with and the more complex and uncharted territory of climate modeling. While much of it was beyond me, I was floored by your publication on what glaciers can tell us about climate sensitivity. It revealed to me a whole host of information contained in ice that I had never considered. Additionally, some of your work has clear policy implications and I noticed you teach a course in geoscience communication. As the world burns outside my window (it\u2019s a west coast window) I think it\u2019s imperative that some climate science be conducted with policy and societal relevance at the forefront. Who knows what education will look like in the fall of 2021 but I\u2019m curious about any graduate opportunities you might have on the horizon, or if you know of others doing similar work who might be seeking students. \n\n\tI\u2019ve attached my CV for some fun reading in your spare time, please let me know if anything else would be helpful!\n\nThank you and I look forward to hearing from you, \n\n\\- Me ",

I don't teach grad students, but when undergrads are asking for research experience with me I like to know three things: 1) that they've read my work, 2) they are interested in education research not just fishing, and 3) that they have an idea of a project we could do together. Anything beyond that takes a lot of time and I'd rather have a phone/zoom conversation about it. Being a non-trad is important to point out, but you have a lot of extra detail I'd save for a follow up phone call.",

Although this time there were some good people responding.\n\nAlso, there was a prof I emailed in my first attempt, along with a reminder - he didn't respond. I again emailed him the next year, quoting my previous email - he didn't respond again. And I am not mad at him. \n\nBottom line - it is a part of the application process : sending out bazillion emails and getting no replies. Don't take it to your heart.

Now that I am on the other side I can tell you that it is not personal it is simply survival. I receive many more emails than I can answer in a day, meaning that some will go unanswered and I cannot do anything about it. \n\nI personally do not take offense when students contact me again to remind me of their interest because I know I am busy and because I see that as a signal that this student is seriously interested (and not spamming lots of labs). Here's the trick tho: you absolutely need to be professional and non-accusatory with your follow up. \"Dear Dr. Whoever, I am not sure if my previous email reached you so I am following up with a gentle reminder of my interest in your lab and research.\" and then copy/paste your original well-crafted inquiry email. \n\nFinally, I will \\*lightly and gently\\* point out that receiving 1 reply after tens of emails (as you say) is not a terrible response rate but, are you sure your inquiry email is sending the message you want it to send? If you haven't done so already, be sure to have a trusted mentor look over what you have drafted. Perhaps they could make suggestions to the text that would improve your response rate (although of course I can't say you need help with your email just something for you to consider).",

      "text": "I have to say I do not like your email at all, for various reasons.\n\nFirst off:\n\n> The weirdness which abounds in 2020 has nudged me back towards academia \n\nThis 100% reads like you've chosen grad school as you have no other options (even if that isn't your meaning). Why would someone spend time and money on you when there are plenty of applicants who *want* to do a PhD, not just fall back on it?\n\nSecondly, your email is long for an introductory email. There is a fine line between \"so little detail that it just seems like a cold email\" and \"making them read a whole essay\" and you have fallen on the essay line. If you are busy, and eyeball an email that looks like it'll take several minutes to read, much less reply to, then you'll skip it to (maybe) get back to later. I wouldn't be surprised if this is happening to your emails.\n\n> While much of it was beyond me, I was floored by your publication on what glaciers can tell us about climate sensitivity.\n\nI personally do not enjoy hyperbole (floored, really?) in a professional email, and admitting that much of it was beyond you doesn't really paint you as knowledgeable about the field.\n\nSpeaking of professional emails, your tone is *massively* off here. You are very informal: \"weirdness which abounds\", \"As the world burns outside my window\", \"I\u2019ve attached my CV for some fun reading\". If this is a professor you know well then that could be fine, but for someone who doesn't know you this could really rub them the wrong way. You're basically applying for a job; is this how you would do so for an industry job?\n\nFinally:\n\n> I\u2019m curious about any graduate opportunities you might have on the horizon, or if you know of others doing similar work who might be seeking students.\n\nSo having gone to great lengths to convince them you're interested in *their* field, you hedge your bets and ask if they can recommend other people too. I think you'll find if they are inclined to tell you of other opportunities they will likely do so unprompted (this in fact happened with me; I was redirected to my eventual PhD advisor when I was making enquiries), so you could just leave that out.",

Be courteous, concise, straightforward and clear. \n\nKeep in mind that this is the first piece of writing from you that a potential advisor will read. What do you want them to think when they read it? You need to identify your audience and write to them. I don't see you doing that in the sample email.",

This statistics excludes mailing lists and other communication from automated jobs that I'm filtering out for later or just automatically archive for later reference, this is just the emails that I receive from people and that I should work on. So, assuming I'd only do email, I have 20 minutes per email. In practice, I'm sitting in video conferences and things like that for 5h or so per day right now. Add to this that I should also do my research,  administration, and so on,  I only have 1-2 hours for my email - read: on average I have less than one minute per email. It's rather obvious that this requires prioritization, and that means that unsolicited emails from people who don't know how the field works (e.g., apply through the official channels and things like that) are dealt with when I have time or never. The likelihood that I don't answer at all increases if the person emailing me shows that they have not done their homework, e.g., are inquiring for PhD positions that have nothing to do with my field, are generic emails that are clearly sent to multiple people (because the person does not know how to use bcc), or are very short emails asking for information that 5-10 minutes of googling could have answered.",

As others have mentioned, there\u2019s a lot going on, especially now. I wanted to add a longer-range observation on these emails though, which you may find useful:\n\n*Most of the application emails I receive are extremely low-effort.*\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the applicant is interested in my area or that they have read any of my lab\u2019s work. This makes it really, really unlikely I\u2019ll respond.\n\nI\u2019m in a clinical department but do basic work that is only tangentially related to the department\u2019s specialty (long story; it works well for us). So if you email me saying you\u2019re really interested in <specialty>, that\u2019s even worse. \n\nI\u2019m in the US, where graduate programs are centrally administered (though I trained in the British system where one applies to individual labs). If you send me a graduate student application, you are telegraphing that you haven\u2019t even visited the university website to see how the whole graduate student thing works. Not good. \n\nCold calling is an art. \n\nYou need to hook the person in a couple of sentences, and make it relevant to them. You may find you receive more responses to well-researched, brief emails stating why you are interested. And please don\u2019t just say \u201cI found your paper <title> very interesting\u201d - I\u2019ve heard it before. \n\nTell me _why_ you find it interesting. Demonstrate your curiosity to me; tell me why you want to travel this road of pain and woe we call research. Ok, that\u2019s an exaggeration; but pique my interest. A form email won\u2019t do that. \n\nGood luck!",

I'd love to discuss with you further over email or Zoom any upcoming positions you may have, thank you. \\[puff up their research more if you feel it appropriate\\]\n\nKeep in mind that sometimes faculty do not know if they have spots until the January before you'd start in the Fall. At our university, spots are sometimes decided at the meeting where they look at everyone's applications, so in other words the department gets 5 slots but they don't know which mentors/labs get the slots until that meeting in January. \n\nI don't take offense to double emailing as long as there's a decent amount of time between emails (10 days?). \n\nFor perspective, I emailed no one before applying for PhD programs (I applied 10 places, received in person interviews at 3, out-right accept at 1, online interviews at 2, denied at the remaining places).",
