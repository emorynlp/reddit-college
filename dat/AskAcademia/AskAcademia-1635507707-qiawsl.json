  "text": "I recently became aware of a Doctor because they are working with a patient of mine. \n\nWe will likely have no professional contact through this patient although we do work within neighbouring health boards and have a crossover of colleagues. \n\nA quick Google search showed they had written thirty articles but I am interested in reading three of them. They are relevant to my job as they specifically  discuss the demographic I work with.\n\nWould it be appropriate to email them and ask if they could share these articles with me? It would be purely for my learning and to develop my practice. \n\nI have tried to access them through alumni channels with no success.",
