  "title:": "Applying to a new PhD position",
  "text": "I am a PhD student suffering from many related problems: an absent advisor that exists only in papers, lack of research activities, lack of experts around me, a very bad and non-healthy working environment, ...etc. Despite all that I managed to learn few things in my field and do research on my own at the point to write a paper and submit it. Recently I found another PhD position abroad in a country very known for its traditions in mathematics, and its very good universities and laboratories, the position is very appealing to me and I want to apply for it, and I would like to be advised in that matter in regards to some points, which are the following:\n\n\\- How can I motivate the fact that I want to resign from my actual PhD and go for another one? Even though  I have my reasons but I find it somehow non-professional criticising my department and advisor, and this is what I have been told before. \n\n\\-How can I mention the issues that are pushing me to this change and be professional? \n\n\\-Anyone went through the same process? Please let me learn from your experience. \n\n\\-Are there any pieces of advice or tips that you would like to share with me, please? \n\nThank you so much in advance!",

      "text": "Don't criticize your current university/advisor/committee/etc. in your application or during interviews. Instead, emphasize how the new place has XYZ opportunities, XYZ scholars to mentor you or collaborate with you, XYZ specialized institutes/centers/organizations, XYZ specific curriculum element, etc.\n\nIn short: **focus on your positive future, not your negative past.**\n\nThe only thing you should say about your current institution is some version of: \"*Though my current institution is no longer the best fit, I'm eager to bring my skills/experience in Y and Z to the XYZ department of New University, where I'll be better equipped to continue my research on...\"* Stick to making this about \"fit,\" which is a sufficiently vague and diplomatic term that we all understand.\n\nIf you're committed to academia, don't leave your current program until you get an acceptance elsewhere. Good luck.",
