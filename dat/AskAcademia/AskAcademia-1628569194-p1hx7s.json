  "text": "I've read a LOT about how difficult it is to become a professor, how the odds are 90% against me, etc.\n\nSo, how does one go about becoming a professor? If the odds are so against me, what can I do to guarantee I succeed? If anyone's Canadian- which universities for Phd and Masters would be most likely to get me a job? I'm thinking about doing my masters and Phd in economics or business.\n\nEdit: Hi guys!! I wanted to thank everyone for providing such helpful suggestions! I really appreciate it :) You're all amazing in my book ",

      "text": "You can not guarantee success, but there are some things that you can do for a strategic planning. Some scientists despite strategic behaviour in academia, but you can be a good scientist, a good person and a good manager at the same time. There is no contradiction here.\n\n1. Understand what you like. You have to find a field that you generally enjoy in order to be able to make it through and stay motivated. At this step don't overfocus on something specific and maybe list a range of subfield/themes which interest you. You can simply ask your professors and some postdocs what they think are interesting popular frontiers in their field now.\n\n2. Try to understand the job market in academia within those fields. In many countries the University calls are public. Ask your post-docs where to find the information. For Europe you can use euraxess, but it's hard to search inside. National websites are usually better. Try to spot some patterns. A typical example in my field: applied mathematicians get more positions than pure mathematicians, with data science and machining learning toping it all. A lot of job opportunities in PDE are related to Fluid Dynamics etc.\n\n3. Choose wisely your advisor and collaborators. Try to work with the best in your field, but don't snob people. Imagine that you are in a hiring commission. You are a professor who does not really care, but who is required to look through a dozen of technical research proposals. What will you do? Look at the first page/introduction and check the article/teaching list. You have 2 min to capture this person's attention. Big names in your CV really do work. \"Wow, he/she worked with X!\", \"Ah, a student of X, cool!\" On an early stage this really increases your chances of getting hired. But don't treat like shit people who are not big/useful. Being and asshole is the worst strategy in the long run and rumours propagate in academic circles very quickly. \n\n4. Do good research. This is usually the part that almost everyone gets done, so the other points are actually those that make the difference \ud83d\ude00 The only point here is to do something that is actually useful for other people, don't do spam research.\n\n5. Be active, do marketing. People have to know your name, almost no one will google your papers on their own. Go to conferences, organise events, meet people, talk to everyone from students to profs, always use every opportunity to present your work. If there is someone in the hiring commission, who remembers you in a good way, this highly increases your shot at getting an interview.\n\n6. Learn how to write good research proposals. There is only one way to do it - practice writing. But! Do not simply submit them immediately after you finished. Have a group of people who can proofread and help you polish it (profs, colleagues, supporting stuff of the uni). This is likely to be the only feedback you will have. Here you will practice exactly the skill of capturing attention in the first two minutes.\n\n7. Know the unwritten rules. There are a lot of unwritten rules that depend on the country and on the community, which you will have to discover as you go along. Is it seen as a bad thing if you didn't teach every year? Is there an unwritten bias for people coming from a certain place? Maybe submitting a letter of recommendation from someone, who is not your collaborator will give you and advantage or a disadvantage? Do you need to be able to obtain the habilitation at the moment of hiring in order to get a tenure? This is the most tricky part and gets to a level of superstition sometimes. But it's better to be informed.\n\n8. Adjust overtime. The journey is long and our future selves are different from our current selves. The environment changes, the rules change and we change. But the same principles apply, just use the new knowledge you gained and adjust. \n\nThere are other factors, but those are some of the first principles that I wish I knew \ud83d\ude05 And remember to take care of yourself, of your physical and mental health. The humanity needs you safe and sane \ud83d\ude09",

                          "text": "This is great advice.\n\n/u/sublimeatomica, if you are still reading, there *is* one exception I've heard which is that for teaching, it might actually help you to go to the school that you want to teach at. If you take a purely teaching job - and bear in mind these pay less and are much less prestigious - then schools weakly prefer to hire those that are already a \"known quantity\". And if you go there and TA, faculty there can vouch to your teaching ability. But, this depends on people liking you a lot, both your teaching and as a person. (People like good colleagues!)\n\nNonetheless, it's much easier to get teaching positions than research positions, and if you have strong geographical preferences you basically can only look for teaching jobs. For a research position at UBC, I would assume you would both need a lot of luck and need to be among the top people graduating that year from any PhD program, or the very top person graduating from another Canadian school like UofT or McGill. (This is field-specific, so I'm likely incorrect by a little amount, but you get the overall message.) And even then you would need a ton of luck that they happened to be hiring in your area that year. In actuality, most people have zero choice over where they go, so you would have to be comfortable with ending up in the middle of nowhere in another country.\n\nSo if you want to stick around in Vancouver and that's important to you, sure, go to UBC, but focus on teaching and be sure you are okay with a teaching track job (which you may or may not be). Also network with other nearby Canadian schools just in case it doesn't pan out. Good luck!\n\nETA: But don't tell people you are interested in teaching, at least not in your application materials. Wait until you are there, and then get involved in pedagogy.",

The first is that they don't need to hire their students because they already employ the supervisor.  It is very likely that what ever you train to specialize in, that your supervisor is better and more accomplished in that area.  Second, once you are a trainee at an institution, it becomes difficult for the faculty to treat the same person as a colleague.  I thought this one was BS while I was training, but it's very true.  I'm a tenured proff now, and occasionally collaborate with my former supervisors or colleagues from those schools, and there is a difference in how I am treated by then compared to others.",

Meanwhile you have to make sure your are top dog + doing well with your promotor.\n\nBut that's the hard way, the easy way is starting a new discipline.",

Okay, are there government agencies, or even private industries, willing to fund research in it. \n\nA lot of academic research is funded though government grants, and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to somehow convince those agencies that they should give you a grant in a brand new field that they presumably don't even have any experts in to judge the merits of your proposal. \n\nMaybe you somehow convince a company to give you funds for your independent research. Now you want to be a professor, in a new field that a university doesn't have a department of? Good luck convincing a university to create a new department, with only one faculty member to be in it, within a new field. That just wouldn't happen.\n\nOkay, so maybe you can't just get a new department started, so you say you'll just join an existing department tangentially related to your new field. If it's truly a new field that's very exciting and showing a lot of promise, some departments might be willing to bring in a new professor in that field if they are interested in expanding into that area. But that's not going to be a brand new field that has just been discovered by you. It's going to be a younger, but still established field, that they are interested in getting involved in.\n\nThe odds of this plan working, starting a brand new discipline to become a professor, are definitely not full proof as you say. Your efforts would certainly be better served going a traditional route, which while difficult and pretty low odds statistically, aren't almost impossible.",
