  "title:": "How to Specify You Are Using a !Word Because of an Author?",
  "text": "Okay, the title is a mess so let me try to explain (I'm having the biggest lapse in word-retrieval??).\n\nI've submitted a paper to a journal (my first!) and it came back with reviews. One of the points in the review is that I switched to the term \"males\" for one paragraph when discussing a particular study (rather than using \"boys\" or \"men\", which I had been doing previously). To avoid confusion, the reviewer suggested to specify that the switch is because the author I am referring to uses that word.\n\nMy question is how can I do this without sounding unnatural? Can I use \"\\[sic\\]\"? Is there a phrase that I should know that can handle this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much in advance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just realized the random exclamation mark in the title...I am so sorry. I need to take a break from my computer, lol.",
