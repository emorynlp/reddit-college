  "title:": "Is a PhD really an impediment in job search?",
  "text": "I plan to do a master's in computer science and am considering a PhD after that. I despise teaching so I have no interest in going into an academic position afterwards, and would like to continue to R&D related roles in industry.\n\nI see in many threads here, and also hear, that a PhD is often an impediment in non-academic jobsearch and can make you considered overqualified for many jobs. It seems most of this is talking about humanities/social sci and I was wondering if it's really the same for industry roles in software dev/R&D? \n\nIs it a chance that if I have a PhD I would be seen as overqualified for software development work and would be instead urged into management or leadership or something like that? Thank you.",

However, the actual level and amount of research in \"R&D\" jobs varies a lot.  \n\nThe only solution here is to read enough job ads and talk to people in the industry so you can figure out if the jobs you want are the ones that that require (or at least value) a PhD.",

      "text": "Short answer : In CS, no you won't be overqualified. And no it won't add much to your resume either, unless its a research job you're looking for. \n\nMost companies only consider skills in CS (a diploma is extremely good ofc, but not the final deal maker).\n\nBut keep in mind that your three years (or more, depending on country) might not count as actual 'experience', or maybe reduced experience (so you'll count as a junior mostly), unless you can really prove some heavy work software development in those years of your PhD.",

Talk to recruiters and let them know your skills and how you can contribute to their unmet needs.",

      "text": "No. I work in R&D in technology, and computer science PhDs are exactly the kinds of people that many tech research & development teams are looking for. You won't be overqualified.\n\nYou may be considered a little overqualified for an entry-level software developer position on a product team, but you could explain that easily in your cover letter and interviews with the right language. \n\nAlso, PhDs are not urged into management or leadership in industry. PhDs aren't necessarily better in management and leadership, and in most industry jobs (particularly in tech), education can't really be substituted for experience at the management or leadership level. (It could potentially help you advance faster when you do have the experience, but not skip it altogether.)",

In fact, I'm seeing many positions in this sector asking for postdocs as well now. If you want a leadership position in STEM, education is sexy.",
