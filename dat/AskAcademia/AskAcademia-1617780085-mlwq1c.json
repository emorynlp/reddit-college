  "title:": "Starting a research group after achieving financial independence",
  "text": "I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, graduated in 2012 from a U.S. institution. I've been working in the tech industry in machine learning and doing well, so I expect in the not so far-off future to achieve my \"FIRE\" goals and be able to live modestly off my investments.\n\nI miss the academic world and I'd like to rejoin that community and contribute my ideas to the research world, but I'm not sure the best way to go about it. My primary goal will be to work on my own research projects (i.e., I'm more interested in research than teaching, although I'd enjoy giving special topics seminars to interested students) and to build up a community of like-minded people to work on problems of interest with me.\n\nDoes anyone have examples of people doing something like this successfully? I don't think it makes sense for me to try to get a tenure-track job since these seem to favor new graduates, and I won't need the salary. But I would like to be associated with a university just to be in the right community to discuss ideas (in my case, I'm interested broadly in human-style AI (AGI) as opposed to mainstream machine learning).\n\nIn an ideal world, somehow I would raise the funds (e.g. through external grants etc) to run my own research group, but again I don't know how feasible this is unless I'm a tenure-track professor as opposed to a crazy independent scholar on the fringes of some academic institute.\n\nLooking forward to suggestions here. Thanks!",

                  "text": "Part of my concern is how I've been told by some faculty that they basically don't want to hire anyone unless they're fresh out of the Ph.D. or are a professor elsewhere. I felt some extreme age-ism coming from these folks, like \"you gradated in 2012? you're too old to start as a prof.\" Maybe it's not like that everywhere, but I found it discouraging. And also sort of baffling since most academics seem rather \"woke\", but they don't seem to mind discriminating based on age. Witness things like the Fields medal, with an explicit age requirement.\n\nI am wondering if I'll have more success, though, since I won't be asking for a high salary (and could very will skip compensation completely).",

I don't think he's affiliated anymore, but someone like Yihui Xie used to be (iirc), and could easily apply for and get, a research faculty position. Even at my own institution there are two scholars with a similar position and title as research faculty, but their primary work is in other industries (medical/government). They have a small office space and university affiliation because both institutes benefit from being associated with the other when stuff comes out in the paper/grants/fellowships/etc.",

Having said that, dept chairs have burdens on making sure there are enough teaching faculty, so it's a pain for them. So I recommend building some networks with departments that do work similar to yours (i.e. where you would apply for jobs) and then start discussions with them, and see what would be feasible. If you're not looking for much salary, they get an extra faculty, and you'd bring in grant money (overhead fees sometimes 60% goes to college, they're happy, it's a win-win. I would DEFINITELY reach out to depts you'd envision yourself in and start discussions. (Cos we don't really know anything, particularly as it pertains to specific departments).",

If so, reach out to a program you're interested in and see if there's any way to get involved in the programs activities: participating in seminars, student supervision, supporting internships, etc. Use this to eventually become an affiliate, which is fancy speak for someone who hangs out (see e.g. [https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/network](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/network)). Then apply for grants w/university. Or just cut out affiliate and go for grants. Better to do this while employed and in industry because you can go after certain grants with an industry connect better than just some solo random FIRED person. NSF and others are increasingly about research/industry collab these days (e.g. [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm\\_summ.jsp?pims\\_id=504709](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504709)).\n\nIf grants hit, work with researchers and  build your publication profile. Use this as currency to bring in more grants. Build up a network that allows you to churn out grants and papers and grants and papers.\n\nI have no idea why you'd want to do this post retirement. It's super hard work. Applying for grants and managing researchers is stressful. Cut throat competition. It's not like a fun (but stressful) PhD. Impact is questionable: the goal is to be a paper mill. There's basically no fun in it. And the money's not worth it. If you're FIREd why go down this path?\n\nEdit: happy medium is reaching out to profs now and just say you're interested in collabs and happy to hook students up with internships and serve on dissertation committees. Basically the affiliate 'fuck around' position. No real responsibility but some space to engage with university at your own interest/level. If I wasn't burnt out with research I'd do this.

Someone who has been out of the academic research game for a decade or more doesn\u2019t have quite as much to offer the university as they think they do, and in general, the university isn\u2019t going to just give them a research position. However, it is entirely possible for someone in that position to join the lab of an existing faculty member, initially in a volunteer capacity, and work with them and their students and then begin submitting their own research proposals and gain independence that way. That\u2019s how I have seen it done, and in both cases the person has gone on to be very successful on their own.\n\nIf I were you, I would find one or more faculty members with whom you might enjoy collaborating and get in touch with them.

You would need to keep track of academic interests by going to conferences but I assume you would do that anyway out of interest so I see this as certainly viable.\n\nA good way to start would be to pick your favourite open source projects, and make contributions that favour some direction that fits in with your research agenda. Contributions includes hiring people to make said contributions. Open source projects are usually linked to some university/research groups.",

      "text": "Just spit balling here, but I think the viability of this very much depends on where you live. If you live in an area with a R1 university that has a good CS department that is looking for and interested in talent, you could try to slowly work your way into their community. I would arrange a meeting with the chair of the department, introduce yourself, and state your interests (personally, I don't think you will be able to apply for grants, but you could be a useful asset the department through volunteering your time), and start attending and making good contributions to departmental lectures. If you do this consistently, and aren't a creep / weirdo, the faculty may start to acknowledge that you can make some free / valuable contributions to departmental life (that also takes some stress off them as they won't have to field as many questions from students). BUT this is the best case scenario, it really depends on where you are and what the departmental culture is like. Same goes for being an independent scholar, you can approach it through consulting, attend / submit your work to conferences, and gradually you can start to build a reputation. That's what it's all about - building a reputation for good work and expertise, so people start coming to you.",

To do that, they have to see prior results (papers). It is like running your own business - you need to worry about your \"employees\" getting paid. Could you convince an investor to give you money to start a company and hire five people for at least three years (several millions) with what you have already achieved, and a promise for some results? \nJust because you have industry experience that does not mean that you have the skills/training to run a research group. You can definitely slowly work your way back to academia, with ways that others here have nicely elaborated, but the way you write you come off as a bit conceited. For better or worse the return cannot happen on your terms, but on academia's terms.",

      "text": "The question is: is your goal to produce new independent research or is your goal to enjoy the intellectual mileux of a university? If it's the former, you don't have much chance. As others have said, you're a bit far out of your PhD to be a compelling new hire. If you haven't been publishing or going to research conferences in your previous job, you might lack the reputation and network to land a job. Basically, the question is: why would a university spend scarce resources on you? This isn't just salary. It's office space \u2014\u00a0the most important coin in the realm. It's administrative support. It's having to account for your views in faculty meetings. What are you bringing them that will help their goals? \n\nIt isn't impossible. My BIL was a research scientist at a company and one day decided he wanted to be a prof, made a few calls and now has a tenure track job at a R1. But, he was heavily involved in producing new research at his old job. \n\nIf you're looking for an intellectual mileux then I would say start by adjuncting and kind of worming your way in. Many departments have professors of practice in many departments that are involved in the school's intellectual community. \n\nThere are...other, less natural ways to get into the community. Give enough money and you can hang out with the cool kids. Epstien donated so much money that he got an office at Harvard, a really choice prize!",
