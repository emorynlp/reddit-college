  "text": "I have a little analysis that I made in financial agriculture that would be insightful for the professionals of agriculture (like farmers). I was thinking of publishing it in an agricultural magazine instead of an academic one. It\u2019s very empirical and doesn\u2019t have much theoretical background. Is it a bad idea ? Would it have any value in the academic world ?",

In which case the question is could you get it to that state? If not then why not do an article? But if you could further develop the research into a journal pub worthy state then professionally that seems worthwhile, and still leaves scope to write something for a magazine on top.",

Farming magazines are for farmers and those working in the sector. Agricultural journals are for academics. Odds are academics won't even see the work if it's in a magazine and it won't come up in a literature search.",

The thing is I talked to many farmers who are tired of how unstable the market is (in conventional grain production), so they want to switch to organic crops because of that mainly (and not really for environmental reasons).\nBut yeah ! It\u2019s better if I try and publish it in an academic journal first !",
