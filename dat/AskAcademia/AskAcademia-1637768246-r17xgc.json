  "text": "I'm trying to apply for a postdoc grant, but it seems the Universe doesn't want me to because about all of the things are going wrong. Anyway, while my PhD supervisor has already written a letter of recommendation, my second referee just told me they don't have time as they're about to leave for several weeks. \n\nNow, I'm not sure how to proceed. The grant I'm applying for is based on a project I wrote with someone else (they gave me permission to use it), so I could ask them as they were clearly willing to work with me, but they are also away at the moment. I am working on another project with another person, but it might be a bit weird to ask them to provide a letter of recommendation for a different project. I can ask someone else from my lab, but they're married to my PhD supervisor, so that doesn't look as good. Lastly, I could ask my other co-author, but they are in a different field so I'm not sure how valuable their opinion is... \n\nSo, what would you suggest?",

      "text": "I don't think people being married is a total disaster if they work on the same things. Academia is incestuous, it's not that uncommon when couples work together for these problems to arise. \n\nI did my postdoc with a guy who was married to the head of department and two of the other PIs (in a small dept) were married to each other and effectively ran a joint lab. It never seemed to be an issue.",
