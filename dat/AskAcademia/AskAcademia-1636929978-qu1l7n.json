  "title:": "Should I tell my PhD advisor I want to MS out now, or wait until I get my degree?",
  "text": "To put it briefly, my mental health is in disarray, I'm extremely unhappy in grad school, and I think it'd be best for my health and safety to leave with just a MS this spring. I'm funded independently from my advisor, but through my school, so I'm unsure if I could continue to receive funding (stipend and waiving of tuition) if I communicate my intentions.\n\nI'd like to tell my advisor now and leave the lab to take some pressure off of me while I focus on classes. Additionally, I don't want to pretend that I intend to take my quals, wasting my advisor's time in them helping me prep. But I fear being truthful could bite me in the ass financially (loss of stipend/tuition waving).\n\n...to those wondering, I didn't enter my PhD program with the intention to MS out. Some unforeseen circumstances have taken their toll on me, and I'm confident this isn't the path for me anymore.",

      "text": "I agree that you should have a conversation early with your advisor so that s/he can prepare for next year. You should look at the paperwork that was involved with your funding. It should have information concerning what happens if you drop out. It might well be important to register for classes next semester and have them paid for by your tuition waiver before you make a final decision/notify your advisor. On our campus that doesn't happen at preregistration but rather the week after classes start in the spring. In any case, once your classes are paid for I think you should talk with your advisor. That would help him/her prepare for next year and perhaps bring in an additional student.",

      "text": "You could talk to the administrator in your dept before your advisor, just whoever is most sympathetic. You want to get through the master\u2019s before losing your funding. Make sure that you have the appropriate credits for graduation. Is your dept\u2019s MS a project or thesis? Do you have enough written up for a thesis? Don\u2019t do anything vis a vis the funding agency until you\u2019re ready to graduate. Honestly some of our students are leaving w a MS bc a PhD can make you less competitive in the job market.",

      "text": "Once you\u2019ve figured out the funding question (as so many other folks here have commented, and, as a former department administrator, I would say please go talk to them if you can\u2019t find clear answers\u2014they are there to help!), tell your advisor. TBH, if things have been tough for you, any advisor worth their salt knows this already and wants you to do what\u2019s best for you (which is not only their job, but also what\u2019s best for them!) \n\nOpening up the discussion allows the two of you to make a plan together.\n\nETA: re, talking to your administrator. There is an expectation of confidentiality, and if they do not know the answers, they can inquire confidentially on your behalf with other university offices within or outside your department. And also, it\u2019s good information for them to have if they don\u2019t already, because the reality is (without diminishing how monumental this is in your own life) that students master out ALL THE TIME.\n\nSending you strength, and wanting to also say that this is the most powerful thing you can do\u2014to know what it is that you need, even if it goes against the flow of your own expectations and/or those of others.",
