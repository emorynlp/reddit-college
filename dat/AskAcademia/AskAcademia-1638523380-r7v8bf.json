  "title:": "Paper on 'awaiting admin processing' for two months now",
  "text": "Hello, so I've submitted my paper after applying the revisions requested by the two reviewers. And for two months it's been on 'awaiting admin processing'. Should I contact the journal? I submitted this paper in 2020 and I am getting frustrated. It's a top journal in linguistics (and related disciplines) so I understand it might not be the swiftest experience possible, but holy moly. Do you think I should contact the journal and inquire about the status of my paper or is it too soon? Many thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "I'm in ling, not your subfield though so I probably haven't submitted to the same journals.  I've never seen \"awaiting admin processing\" before, at least not for any notable amount of time. Did you have relatively minor revisions and perhaps the editor is reviewing in-house rather than sending it back out? Or perhaps extremely major revisions and they need to find new reviewers if one refused to look at it again? (Or medium revisions and the reviewers just bounced for some other reason.)\n\nI PERSONALLY would wait until the 3 month mark to do the nudge, especially since we're approaching holiday/end of semester season. But that's just me, and I totally understand the frustration. I had a paper that was 6 months from initial submission to first reviews, and then 7 months after revisions to second round reviews/accept... and then another 8 months from my final version to proofs.",

          "text": "Thanks! I think that the editor probably sent my paper to someone else (they have another specialization). So far, the process has been very slow... I don't know if they will send it to different reviewers from the first round, or if they will be the same. I am a young scholar and this is making me very stressed.",
