  "text": "Hi all, \n\nAfter submitting a paper with a journal, say you leave the team and get a new position. However, the reviewers come back with a bunch of comments and basically overhaul of the paper- as first author, is this still your responsibility if you no longer work for those PIs? Or does the new hire take over the revisions and get authorship?",

The most common one, in my experience, is that you finish off your own paper.\n\n> as first author, is this still your responsibility if you no longer work for those PIs\n\nI find this a bit of an odd perspective.  The responsibility derives from the fact that you are first author: it is *your* paper, about *your* work.  None of that depends on who is paying your salary.  If you've left research and don't mind burning some bridges then sure, you can refuse to work on it and the professional ramifications will be fairly limited.  But in most situations you're the person who has most to lose by dropping the paper, and the most to gain by finishing it.",

I'd suggest an upfront conversation with your former boss about this.",

          "text": "This is absolutely how it works, but it is also an unfortunate part of how academia is structured that this is how it works. Most post-docs in my field pretty much end up moonlighting unpaid in their PhD labs for a year or two to get papers through the publishing process, on top of their already pretty strenuous workloads. Yeah, they ultimately benefit most from those papers getting out but that doesn't mean that it isn't an exploitative system.",

      "text": "So my take is this, if this actual wet lab work required and you no longer work in this lab, there is no way you can do it. Therefore someone else would have to step in and do the wet lab work and in turn would be granted authorship (not first unless that person gets involved in writing etc too). If its just editorial revisions than of course you can find an agreement with the previous P.I and/or your now one to dedicate time to finish up.  \nI have been in both scenarios:: bench  work I could not finish as well as editorial stuff that I did actually  while working on another project, my P.I. gave me some dedicated time to finish my old stuff.",

They then get included on the new authorship list.  The position will depend upon how much work is needed, from a middle of the pack up to joint first author if revisions are large (and by this I mean a lot of experimental required work).  So far I have never deprived an author of the first, first place, and normally that is discussed with the person taking over the work.  \n\nThe alternative is to drop expectations and go for a lower impact place, so the original sole first has to be on board as well.",

You can make the changes yourself and work on your free time at the previous lab even without being officially employed (or getting hired as part time worker).

In my experience it depends mostly on how much you (as first author) want the paper published. In the end you hold the cards.",

              "text": "Which author the new hire would become depends on how much work they do. If you have a good relationship with your previous boss, you can say you don't want to be bothered about it (if you left your scientific career) and someone else can take over. Consider that if they decide to overhaul the entire paper and add new data, you may become second author instead (I have seen this happening multiple times). You are still expected to help the new hire if necessary (such as explaining some code you wrote, understanding your notes, etc).\n\nIf you are in a bad situation with your previous boss, then you can abandon the paper but make sure to have it clear that they can't publish that specific data without your name. Again, you are still expected to help with small details, info, and check the paper as one of the authors.\n\nFinally, I do believe that, as a research assistant and not the grant recipient, you should be paid to continue the work/revision. If your time allows, you could negotiate it with the PI. Have it all clear in a contract and, preferentially, get an hourly rate. In my work, we usually pay previous workers a \"consultant fee\" for doing that kind of stuff.",
