  "text": "Hello,\nI am preparing presentation of labs \"big project\" for some conference. Last slide will be QR code to repository with pdf copy of presentation. But which repository would be ideal for such thing? Definitely NOT Academia edu (since it is crapy and anoing). I am considering between OSF, ResearchGate, SlideShare and FigShare. Which of these do you recomend? Or is there any better option for sharing PDFs of presentation?",
