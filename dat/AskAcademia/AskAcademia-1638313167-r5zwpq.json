      "text": "Depends on the class and the prof, probably also what department youre in. \n\nIm in the humanities (history) and Ive only ever gotten answer keys if its been a multiple choice or fill-in type situation, even then thats only been some of the time. I've personally never gotten a rubric for essays either, though I know some professors will hand those out. Really at my Uni the grading standard is totally up to the professor both in terms of setting the standard, then doing QC to make sure you follow it. Some profs are very hands on, will tell you what you need to do and what kinds of answers theyre looking for, some will just give you a rubric and tell you to grade to that, and some will just give you a deadline and let you do it on your own. Pros and Cons to each approach I guess. Most of the profs I have graded for will give you a meeting the week of or after the exam to go over it, talk about their expectations, and let you ask any questions RE: answers. When I was newer I used those meetings pretty vigorously to figure out the answers to the questions, but now that I've been a TA/GA longer I really dont need to, and when asked I've told profs the meeting is unnecessary. I find if you've been going to the classes and you've kept up with the readings the exams shouldn't be that tricky. Depending on kinds of questions being asked its also pretty easy to figure some of the stuff out. Grading to the mean and all that. Plus if there is a tricky question or a thing youre not sure about you oughta ask the prof what they want the answer to be. I've always approached grading from the standpoint that my job is to act as a screen for students, the fewer complaints I have to send up the chain the better. Asking a question now will save you time and headaches later if you make a mistake. \n\nFWIW I find grading to actually be pretty straightforward. Hard work, but simple work. When I first started out I was super nervous that I would make a mistake, cost a student 2pts on the exam, theyd lose their scholarship, and end up a hobo because I was careless or misunderstood something. To my knowledge at least thats never happened. Id say look over the exams and if there are answers you dont know, ask the prof. Surely theyll be willing to help you out to save  you both a bit of heartburn later. But this is also maybe more field dependent. In history a lot of answers are interpretive. Take the class materials and analyze them. Pretty squishy On something like a math test, the answers are absolute and showing work is also very important. Maybe thats a lot harder and requires a more structure evaluation style. IDK I've never done that.",

      "text": "Hmm, I'm a grad student in philosophy.\n\nPart of Teaching Assistants duties are to read the course materials for the class you're grading for (such as papers, book chapters, etc. whatever the students are reading for the class) and it is sometimes, though not always, required that the TA attend the class lectures, so that we have a grasp of the class we are grading for. The hours that go into preparation to grade are paid and included in our contract, at least in my program.\n\nThere is an assumption that you have at least some familiarity with the discipline you are grading for. I have graded for classes in other *areas* of philosophy that are not my specialization (i.e. I do political philosophy and graded for a medical ethics course). It takes a little extra work to become familiar with the literature your students are reading, but it's assumed that someone grading for philosophy has a pretty solid grasp of philosophy in general.\n\nAre you in the philosophy graduate program yourself?\n\nEdit to add: Occasionally professors provide a rubric that they want you to use, but never an outline of the \"answer\" to essays.\n\nPhilosophy is about argument analysis, and there are often numerous ways to approach a singular question.  So, students arguments can take many different forms. There's not usually just one right answer in a philosophy essay, unless the prompt asks them to explain something specific, such as summarizing an author's view, or something like that.",

My focus has been more on the applied side(ethics of emerging tech) and my undergrad was in psychology. I wasn't originally told I had to attend classes or read everything the students were reading( it's a modern phil class). I imagine they just assumed I knew that, but I didn't and was never explicitly told that by the prof.  I should add, I didn't apply for this position. I randomly got an email one day from an administrator if I wanted the job. I agreed but wasn't told much about it and the prof didn't give me much direction on how it should be done. Did you apply for the GA position? Or did they reach out to you?\n\nedit: I often wonder if no one else wanted the position from this particular prof so they contacted me as a last resort.\n\nI see what you mean. I am used to grading for psychology and not philosophy at all. I also wasn't given much guidance or set expectations. The position was sort of thrown at me and I thought it would be similar to psychology grading.  Hmmm!",

Because if they just wanted someone who could grade mindlessly, they'd have given a multiple choice test. You can, of course, cop to being ignorant about this (there are multitudes of unexpressed expectations in academia, and it is part of what makes it such a mine field for people who don't know them) \u2014 but that's the one part of what you've written that makes you look especially unprepared.\n\nThe rest of the situation, though, is totally absurd, and you should in any event send a very polite e-mail explaining that you are just unable to do the duties requested of you under the current conditions. And leave it at that. It will be up to them to decide how this should be resolved. But you can be just firm that you are in no way capable of doing what they are asking you to do, that it would be completely unprofessional for you to complete the job in this way.",
