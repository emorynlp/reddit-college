  "text": "I am pursuing an MS in Statistics. I have currently completed my Bachelors in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics (triple major in India). The universities ask for research statements. I haven't had much research experience in my bachelor and I thought that research statements were for a PhD. I was wondering if you guys could give me some insights regarding this. I am clueless about research ideas. I would love to work with Survey statistics, Biostatistics and Quantitative Biology but I don't know much in-depth. I am kind of stuck and don't know what to do about the Research statement. Please help!!",
