  "title:": "Ghosted by a recommending professor in eleventh hour",
  "text": "I am totally new to this, so bear with me if I dont know what I am talking about.\n\nAbout 7 months ago, I began by application process to graduate school.  I emailed around asking former professors if they would write me a letter of recommendation.  I secured one (so I thought) from a former professor of mine.  He had said in May that he would he happy to write me a rec as long as I used a medium like Interfolio, and I agreed and paid for the subscription.  Since then I have sent two or three reminders of my earliest deadline (today).\n\nFlash forward to last week, I sent one final reminder to which he responded very quickly saying that he would get it in on Monday or Tuesday (two days ago and yesterday).  It came to yesterday at 4:30 PM and I emailed him again telling him that I was getting a bit nervous and asked if he'd still be able to get it in.  No response.  Now, today, the day of the deadline, I have emailed him again and even called him office.  Both of which have not been responded to.  I am panicking a little bit and don't know what to do.  I feel like I have been completely ghosted in the eleventh hour and am now left to scramble to find a recommendation before the end of the day.  \n\n\nAnyone have any advice? Is this normal?  Am I the asshole?",

      "text": "I manage the applications for a graduate program, this is a pretty common issue. As for resolving, I'd suggest you look up their graduate officer/graduate admissions rep and let them know (with minimal personal details) that you have not been able to get in touch with the recommender, and that you would like to have a different letter writer, ask if they would allow you another couple days to have that letter in. Express apologies for the delay and that you understand the urgency. Have that letter writer ready to go and get the letter in. \n\nAny program should understand some wonky things happen when we're depending on faculty letter writers from all over the world to get their letters in by a certain date, not always the applicants fault. \n\nSide note - be nice to those office folks! The good ones keep the program in line and are tight with their faculty.",

It feels like a bigger deal than it probably is - admissions offices will likely have some wiggle room on a letter of rec deadline.\n\nA professor did something similar when I applied to graduate programs.  He was very incommunicative despite approaching deadlines.  Eventually he sent out a few letters before deciding he was done - before each program I applied to received one from him.  After that, he stopped responding to outreach.  I luckily found a last minute fill in and everything worked out.\n\nI realize professor's schedules can be busy, but at the end of the day, he was an asshole.  Unfortunately it sounds like the professor you're trying to work with is too.  Good luck!",

      "text": "First off, I\u2019m very sorry. This is an unfair situation for you to be in and you have a right to feel hurt and anxious.\n\nI will tell you what I did in a similar situation. I was applying for graduate programs and had asked a professor to write a rec. This professor submitted a recommendation to one school (out of the five or so I was applying to) and then completely ghosted me. She didn\u2019t respond to multiple emails (and was in a different country so I couldn\u2019t call her). She had been so kind and communicative up until that point. I had done really well in her class (which I took in her home country where she still was). She had seemed enthusiastic when I asked her to write the rec. and then, ghosted. I still don\u2019t know what happened and it\u2019s been years. She never got back to me, but her social media accounts indicate that she is alive and well and doing just fine. It was very frustrating for me.\n\nI ended up approaching one of my college professors a week before the deadline. I was honest about the situation and extremely sympathetic. Thankfully, he was gracious and he wrote me a great letter in time. I ended up getting into a fantastic PhD program and am about to graduate with a tenure-track job lined up. I say this just to give you hope that this will work out, because I remember feeling so burned and frustrated.\n\nSo, my advice is, approach a former (or current if you are still in undergrad) professor of yours. Be very honest about your situation. You may be surprised by how understanding people can be. But now is certainly the time to reach out for other options. Good luck. I wish you all the best,",

So getting a letter in is a low priority. \n\nThese deadlines are flexible.  Every grad program I know of accepts letters stringing in 1-2 weeks late.  (sometimes I've had letters creep in a month late... we incorporate them.)   \n\nSo, probably don't sweat it... just keep on top of it.\n\nThe email from Monday or Tuesday from him WAS A GOOD SIGN.

If the faculty member wrote a letter that said, \"I agreed to write this letter and got caught up in required activities on my campus. The student went to the dean on the day it was due but before the end of business hours because s/he was afraid I was going to be late with the letter. The dean then came to my office and demanded I write the letter. So I have now written the letter; this is it.\" And signed it.\n\nAlso, note that the first letter is due today. The student wrote the post 5 hours ago, so about 11am EST. There are a number of hours left in the day. The faculty member may simply be not responding to the student until he sends the letter so he can respond then and say the letter has been sent. This may not be the most polite thing to do but it's something that I'm very familiar with as a chair-faculty doing things at the last minute and ignoring email reminders until they can respond with a, \"I've done it.\" statement.

He's damaging not only a particularly driven student who is looking for a graduate degree, but also the reputation of the department. I'm sure OP will have second thoughts about recommending the department or donating now.\n\nAlso, this has everything to do with tenure.

He\u2019s a tenured math professor whose college tried to fire him because he vocally protested against the administration\u2019s decision to dumb down the curriculum.  Did tenure save him? Kind of. But not because it\u2019s some magic word that prevents him from being fired. It saved him because tenure provides *due process protection.* That\u2019s literally all it is. It\u2019s not some lifetime sinecure that so many seem to think it is. His tenure status meant that the college had to hold a hearing in order to remove him, which gave him the opportunity to retain counsel and fight back.\n\nThe movie version of tenure (which you seem to think still exists) would have him saying \u201cI\u2019m tenured. You can\u2019t touch me.\u201d But that\u2019s not what it happened. His job was in serious jeopardy, and he would not have kept it if his attorney hadn\u2019t been able to make a strong case on his behalf. Tenured faculty members can be fired for cause and they frequently are. Tenure status isn\u2019t some silver bullet that insulates you from accountability. It simply means that the university has to demonstrate cause before they can opt not to renew your contract. NTT Faculty members don\u2019t have that protection; their renewal can be declined whenever their contracts end. \n\nSome faculty members are abusive to graduate students. Some of them are untenured. Some managers outside of academia are abusive to subordinates. All of them are untenured.",
