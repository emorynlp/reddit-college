  "title:": "In an interview right before receiving the 2013 Nobel prize in physics, Peter Higgs stated that he wouldn't be able to get an academic job today, because he wouldn't be regarded as productive enough.",
  "text": "> By the time he retired in 1996, he was uncomfortable with the new academic culture. \"After I retired it was quite a long time before I went back to my department. I thought I was well out of it. It wasn't my way of doing things any more. Today I wouldn't get an academic job. It's as simple as that. I don't think I would be regarded as productive enough.\"\n\nAnother interesting quote from the article is the following:\n\n> He doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: \"It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.\"\n\nSource (the whole article is pretty interesting): http://theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system",

But mine has done nothing to resist NT/contingent tracks and the growing army of Instructors: dead-end \u201cfaculty\u201d who are postdocs by any other metric.\n\nThe union fights for compensation and working conditions, not for the restructuring of academia, which is a highly competitive enterprise completely dependent on government funding. The Max Weber reference in this thread shows how the term \u201cquasi-proletarian\u201d was used to reference US academic faculty over 100 years ago. Resources are limited and local unions cannot change this. Unions don\u2019t create endowed tenure lines.\n\nI claim no authority on this subject and would welcome rebuttals that I could take to my own union.",

This is a trend not just in America but in Europe, Asia and middle east.

Now you better come stacked with publications and at least one nature/science. American universities are even more competitive. How many publications, how many conferences, how many patents...",

That means only about $2.5B goes to the kind of scientific research that NSF would fund (and their service lab research is funded out of this as well).\n\nHere's a better analysis:\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF10553.pdf\n$105B from fig 1\nResearch classification from table 1\nPercentage, $2.5B from fig 3\n\nI'll fix the numbers, but my point is that the DOD research budget is not gigantically bigger than NSF'S research budget, which seems to be a perception. The funding for similar research is significantly smaller, and even when including other categories it is only comparable",

This isn't the fault of nebulous \"market forces\" or even society \"not valuing\" intellectual work--it's a deliberate plan executed on the part of university administration to replace expensive and troublesome tenured faculty with a never-ending stream of cheap, expendable labour, thereby also eroding the capacity of academics to organize, allowing administration to cement their control over the institution.",

I think it can include a breakthrough on a particular point of a larger collaborative effort.  \n\nBut for many, a career in research no longer allows the kind of time and space for rumination that these sorts of breakthroughs require.  For most of us, they need to percolate in the mind over a period and the pressures to produce quantity over quality substantially undermine that effort.",

It doesn't mean that they don't draw upon the existing research or engage in collaborative discussion, but that people operate best in different conditions and breakthroughs are achieved by multiple avenues.  \n\nIdeally we want to enable different types of thinkers in order to maximize novel thinking and progress.",

          "text": "I think his point may be that some breakthroughs require the kind of thoughtfulness that really only comes through having time - and that the busy, productivity-oriented way academia is going takes people who would be able to make breakthroughs away from the brainspace of making breakthroughs. (And the people agreeing feel like their \u201cproductivity\u201d actually takes them away from creative, groundbreaking thought which they could do, if not for the constraints of the academic world).\n\nI am on the side of agreeing with him. So much petty, dumb work is done simply because it can be published, not because it\u2019s actually important or valuable. It has turned into a rat race - and \u201cwinning\u201d it does not mean producing the best work or even good work, just producing work.",

While I've been aware of all the career issues in academia since my college years, especially in my field (arts and humanities), I guess that universities are still the most welcoming places for research. I hope there would be more diverse paths and solutions in the near future, but currently, most researchers still need to rely on academia and conform to its conditions, and I think this wouldn't be a source of anxiety or shame for them.",
