  "title:": "Accused of academic misconduct that I never did and I feel like I am losing the case here.",
  "text": " I am a postgraduate student here. Apparently, I got accused of academic misconduct for coding (Collusion). The project is an individual assignment. The accusation is that I copied/shared my code with one of the undergraduate students which are from another course which I never did.   The lecturer told me to provide evidence to defend myself. So the first point I gave him is that he encourages us to use external resources on the internet and use his lecture to help with the coding and of course I have provided all the references that are not my own work when I submitted my work and gave it to him. Secondly, I have explained all my working steps for the code and how I reach my conclusion. The third point is that I have never posted my code anywhere on the internet or GitHub to be viewed or used or exchanged my work with anyone. The fourth point is that I have never discussed my work with my postgraduate friend let alone that I have never discuss it with undergraduate students. I know no one from the undergraduate course (even postgraduate course) and never have the opportunity to be in contact with them since I am working on my project alone from another country (Thailand and the Uni is in the UK). Therefore my main evidence or my defend is that I never worked or even talked to the person or anyone else about the project nad I know no one FROM undergraduate course.  After I sent my defend to my lecturer, he said that he think there is not enough evidence and still think there are academic misconduct and have forward it to AM panel. URGHHH!! In the email, he said to find direct references for the similarity code and provide more evidence BUT I GAVE ALL MY EVIDENCE AND CANT GIVE MORE. and I was thinking if I provide the references that I never used in my code then I am committing poor academic misconduct that I never commit (poor academic misconduct = no references).  So at is point I don\u2019t know what to do.. should I provide the reference for the AM panel or not? should I stick to it since I am being honest with everything and I don\u2019t know what to do next and very stress about it since I have never copied or shared my work with anyone.\n\nEDIT1: just did my academic panel meeting today. From my perspective - I feel like I didn't do that well and didn't explain that good about my working out because one of the panels was looking confused and having a wtf face when I tried to explain my working/method of doing the work and finding the resources.  From the SU perspective - she said that I look confident when speaking about my method of doing the work and showing evidence, she said got nothing to worried about, everything is looking good. Tomorrow the panel will email the result. hoping for the best.",

      "text": "It sounds like you were very thorough in your response. If you didn\u2019t do it, you didn\u2019t do it, and there is no such thing as evidence that you didn\u2019t do it. How can you prove the absence of collusion, beyond showing what you did do and explaining that you don\u2019t know the other person? It\u2019s their job to prove what they think you did, and with simple programming assignments, there are often only a few right answers. If you both happened to reference the same sources, it is likely that your code is indeed similar. One issue may be if they didn\u2019t provide references for the sources they used, or if you both duplicated the same source too closely. Don\u2019t stress too much about it. If questioned by the AM panel, remain calm, helpful, and confident, because you did nothing wrong. Convey that with both your words and your demeanor.",

      "text": "You need to insist that the burden of proof fall to them and that they provide you any proof being made in the accusation so that you can directly rebut it. University disciplinary proceedings often are basically kangaroo courts with a presumption being that if the student didn't cheat it would've never reached the stage. You don't have any rights you don't demand so if you feel they're being unfair, fight tooth and nail. Definitely don't take a \"just apologize and we'll probably let you off\" in good faith - it's a trap I've seen others fall into. \n\nI'd recommend documenting everything. If the process ends up breaking against you, file a freedom of information act and/or GDPR access request for documents pertinent to the proceedings and then take it up with the OIA: https://www.oiahe.org.uk/. If you think it'll be effective, you can say you are planning to raise the matter with OIA if the university do not handle it professionally.",

Even when you are indicted by a Grand Jury, there is no assumption of guilt.  The party asserting you did something wrong must prove it. And what is \"*reasonable* guilt\"? I've been a lawyer for 40 plus years and never heard that term.  If a professor -- or anyone -- claims that you did something wrong and you should be punished -- they must prove it.

Universities are free to set their policies on misconduct, and they aren't obligated to maintain a standard of beyond reasonable doubt or place the burden of proof entirely on the accuser.\n\nEach university typically handles investigations and sanctions by its own methods, and these methods can vary pretty widely. University Honor codes are quite diverse, and while some adhere to legal norms, others do not. Ultimately though Honor Codes are not \"legal\" issues, and thus whether or not legal norms will be followed is dependent on the university.",

As an instructor in the US I can assure you *the burden of proof is on the instructor*. I've submitted more than my fair share of academic dishonesty cases. At this point I've got a pretty good idea of what an honest prosecutor has to go through to get a conviction. Just claiming \"dishonesty\" isn't good enough. I have to provide evidence, I have to show its against course policy, I have to show that that there was no loophole they could have used, and finally I have to show that there's no way in hell that the potential dishonesty could have come by legitimate means.   \nI have had cases go against me because students claimed it was \"in class notes\", even though all class notes are recorded. I have had cases go against me because \"the worked in groups and that was allowed\".  I have had cases go against me because the adjudicators are humanities while I'm stem, and they simply didn't understand the material. The burden of proof is actually pretty damned high.",

              "text": "tl;dr TurnItIn can't be used for code, submit the codes through a real code plagiarism detection system, provide counterexamples showing that the similarities are bogus and the important pieces are original\n\nAs a CS instructor I've turned in plenty of students for collusion with code, you'll need to provide some evidence that the code isn't similar. From what you've describe it shouldn't be hard.\n\nTurnItIn is a shit submission system for code, and the professor as an absolute bellend (assuming I'm using the appropriate British term) for thinking it'll work with code. TurnItIn is designed for prose, not for code. It'll commonly flag code for collusion because it doesn't understand that some things are really really really common (like I don't know, expressions always have a def = use relationship). Its like trying to detect a song was plagiarized by comparing album art.\n\nNotice something important missing from TurnItIn's marketing material?  \n[https://www.turnitin.com/products/similarity](https://www.turnitin.com/products/similarity)\n\nYeah, no github. atlassion, or other source code control system. That's because it isn't suppose to be used with source code.  To properly detect collusion in source code requires a source code similarity checker. Something like MOSS (which is what I use):\n\n  \n[https://theory.stanford.edu/\\~aiken/moss/](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)\n\nIf MOSS doesn't detect collusion then its either not collusion or its so well hidden that it doesn't matter.\n\nA bigger point is the algorithms. Generic algorithms look the same no matter what. Tree traversal, set enumeration, etc have been around a long time and many people have implemented them. Find examples of the generics if needed. For the parts that require originality you should see some obvious differences. Collusion is generally hidden by adding or subtracting redundant lines. If getting from yours to the allegedly plagiarized version requires changing data structures or control flow then it wasn't plagiarized. Without knowing specifics its hard to give you examples.",

I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who doesnt know coding, but does know argument, so understand that what I'm advising may not be possible, because I dont know the subject matter.\n\nThat said, you have a few ways to discredit the idea that you are cheating. I think there are three scenarios here (from the schools perspective. You know you didn't cheat, so that's off the table) but! Either, you both came up with it independently, you two worked together, or they stole it from you. So how do we address each of these?\n\n1. Argue that you both could write the code independently. Are the similarities in the code something anyone could come up with for a similar process? Did you develop those specific parts based on reference materials you can link to? If you show that someone else making those sections of code isn't super unlikely, that's evidence in your defence.\n\n2. Show that there has been no contact between you and the other student. Can you request phone records from your carrier? Email logs dating back to the assignment? Any school site you have communication on? Showing you haven't spoken with the person could be difficult, but would make it less likely that you colluded.\n\n3. Argue that if one person took it from the other, and you're not saying that is so, then the school should assume that an undergraduate is more likely to be stealing from a graduate student. This isnt a moral claim, just, the level of work and effort needed to create something like this is greater for the undergrad. They have less practice. (Do you have a related undergrad degree? Mention it here)\n\nThis would be the \"I wouldn't even need to cheat\" defense. So, if they think someone stole another's work, please dont punish you because someone already stole your work from you.\n\n\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong if either:\n\n1. The two of you happened to come up with the same code (talk up how generic and normal the sections in question are. \"It would be so easy to make that by chance) or \n\n2. Someone stole another's work (talk up how unlikely it is that the grad student is stealing from the undergrad \"do you think I need help from someone working in a degree ibe already finished?\")",

      "text": "If other people's suggestions don't work out (like university ombudsman), and you start to think you might need to see what your legal rights are in this, see\\*\\*\\* whether or not your university or a partnered university runs a law school, and whether they have a pro bono clinic. Pro bono is from the Latin \"Pro bono publico\", \"for public good\", and is thus free.\n\nA pro bono clinic of that level won't advocate for you or represent you, but ***if*** they are willing to look at your case, they'll take a look at your evidence, your contract with the university if you have it, and any relevant university and regulatory policies, and will advise you on your legal rights as well as provide a few options which you might be able to take. Usually, the research is handled by LLB/LPC students (latter soon to be SQE) and supervised by a qualified solicitor (who corrects their mistakes and ensures you get advice that is of a high quality).\n\nSince law students are also trained to consider \"commercial awareness\" issues constantly these days, they may also be able to offer options that don't use any legal processes (such as making complaints to certain bodies etc).\n\nIf you're going to take civil action for some kind of remedy (whether damages or specific performance), it's better to get advice sooner rather than later. I cannot advise you on time limits, but they're short (like, a few months or so short), and calculated based on when a breach occurs usually.\n\nIt's *probably* best to continue being nonconfrontational with university staff, no matter what though. I guess be firm in demanding a reappraisal. At least read through your examination policies and any other relevant university policies to see if they are following their own policies.\n\nOf course in the long run it is usually best not to go down the legal route for academic issues (from what I've been told in passing), but it isn't impossible if it becomes necessary. Students at Uni, being paying customers, have contractual rights after all. It's just legal tests are strict, and pursuing a claim is expensive. It's still good to know your rights though, as sometimes a properly worded letter setting out legal positions (if relevant) can be enough to push action.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Disclaimer: not legal advice, not even remotely legal advice, nor is this to be taken as an endorsement of any university's law school or any legal clinic (whether free or paid). This is not even generic legal advice. Do not rely on this. I'm writing this while drinking. I'm not even fully qualified yet. Never rely on Reddit.",

We don't make plagiarism accusations lightly.\n\nWhat does the Turnitin report say? It's supposed to highlight the passage that is the same. You can't see the other person's writing, but the official in charge of the mediation will be able to. Ask the person to look at both your writing and the other student's and explain what's similar. Based on how Turnitin works, I'm pretty sure the passages sound the same with some words moved around or swapped out for synonyms. It doesn't catch the same thinking; it catches the same/closely similar language. I'm not making accusations, but it's very difficult for Turnitin to give a false plagiarism report. One thing could be that you both quoted the source/reference without quotation marks, and Turnitin picked it up. But when that happens, I tell the student to fix it.",

If somebody plagiarises 3 sentences from another essay they wrote themselves in a 2500 word essay that's otherwise \"original\", I really don't see how doing it intentionally would have saved the student any time or given him any advantage. You'd have to put in extra effort to write the rest of the essay in a certain way to ensure the plagiarism even fits into the flow.\n\nIn some courses like law or most science courses you'll have lots and lots of highlighted stuff by turnitin because there are only so many correct ways how you can word the same thing over and over. For example, \"the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\". There's maybe 10 ways how you can write that, so you will by default write the same sentence as 100 other students.",

If the ideas cross-pollinate your work, you'd be able to express them in different ways. If you use similar language, you pilfered the ideas from your old work.\n\nMy student wrote the exact same essay for the new class as she wrote for mine--the same, every single word. The only thing she changed was the class name in the header. She did it intentionally. That is plagiarism. She plagiarized in my class deliberately. Students like that don't deserve to be in college. They're cheats, frauds.\n\nNow as for intentional vs unintentional, it depends on the professor. Some are lenient. Some are not. It is left up to the professor's discretion. It also depends on the class level. By the time you're taking high-level courses, you should understand how not to plagiarize unintentionally.

Claimant's claim fails and must be dismissed.\n\nAt 241. *He has not lost the claim simply because it is the kind of claim that is a generally difficult claim to sustain... I have not been persuaded on the evidence that the manner of* \\[the delivery of the ISS course\\] *was negligently inadequate*.\n\nThis is a direct intervention in an academic matter by the Courts. If it was outside the Court's purview, they would have rejected it in 2016, but instead heard the case fully and decided on the merits that in this case negligence had not occurred.\n\nYou do *not* need to find a case where an individual succeeded in their claim to show precedent for judicial intervention in academic matters. You merely have to show that in the past the courts have been willing to hear the case; it means that on the matter the student has Standing.\n\nWhen you study for a degree, you have a contract with your university. They are bound by consumer law, contract law, and the law of tort. Just like in any other instance.\n\nA case like this says to future judges \"Yes, hear these cases and apply negligence law to them as you would in any other case. In this case there happened to be no negligence, but that doesn't mean you cannot intervene\". There are *many* legal tests defined at common law which are based entirely on a failed claim in which a court said \"yes but *if* the facts had been X this would have succeeded\".\n\n**Now certainly**, the courts are remiss to allow all options. Eg [here](https://www.sinclairslaw.co.uk/news/court-of-appeal-overturns-zahid-guidance) the Court of Appeal said that students can't preserve a right to judicial review while going through OIA stuff. To my understanding, in 2017 guidance was given allowing students to go through the extralegal procedure and maintain their right to later try JR too through the courts, while now instead it is an either-or.\n\nBut this still tells us that students can elect for judicial review instead of using the Office of the Independent Adjudicator. Which means that where it is relevant and students choose court over OIA, the courts *will* happily intervene in academic policymaking on the usual JR grounds.\n\n* Disclaimer: Not legal advice.

I'm simply pointing out that your claiming that the courts will not get involved in University administrative policy is simply wrong. I'm not saying that OP *should* take this route. I'm saying that the courts *can* intervene. \n\n**Because** it is a contractual relationship, the courts *can* look at it *before* a decision is made, on the basis that it *seems* like the other side will be in breach of its obligations.\n\n**Because** it is a partially public-subsidised entity (being a university) then once a decision is made it can often be amenable to judicial review as well as contract claims and assertions of tort.\n\n**However** regardless of this it is not always a good or smart thing to go to the law over an issue even where one technically has the right to.\n\n**Its it thus** *wrong* for you to claim OP cannot, or that this cannot be a legal issue because it is administrative (they ARE NOT mutually exclusive!) **but** it is *also* wrong to go straight to the law.\n\n**On the other hand** in the event that the OP ends up in a university panel pleading his case, then *if* he has a right of representation under that panel then a lawyer can be a good idea, even if it is not the \"done thing\". Even if he does not have a right of representation, having a lawyer look over the representations you've make in front of a decision-maker *can* be smart. The reason?\n\n*In the event* that you have to take it on to the courts ***in future***, whatever you told the panel can and will be brought in as evidence by the university. ^(\"Your honour, the Student said in our recorded panel meeting that X which conflicts with his witness statement before this court.\") Therefore it makes sense to plea your case in front of the panel defensively while protecting your future rights, and that's the sort of thing a lawyer is good for.\n\nYou seem to be under the misapprehension that lawyers are only relevant where there is a direct interface with the Courts, too. Lawyers handle extralegal remediatory action like arbitration (oh look, industry *panels*), mediation, redrafting arguments to prevent mistakes, drafting extralegal documents, and far more.\n\n***The only problems here*** are that at this stage the cost of a lawyer far outweighs the benefit of having one, and that the *norm* for Universities is to do everything within their power to prevent students from exercising legal rights by dangling a non-court-based alternative route.",

I'm simply pointing out that your claiming that the courts will not get involved in University administrative policy is simply wrong. I'm not saying that OP *should* take this route. I'm saying that the courts *can* intervene. \n\n**Because** it is a contractual relationship, the courts *can* look at it *before* a decision is made, on the basis that it *seems* like the other side will be in breach of its obligations.\n\n**Because** it is a partially public-subsidised entity (being a university) then once a decision is made it can often be amenable to judicial review as well as contract claims and assertions of tort.\n\n**However** regardless of this it is not always a good or smart thing to go to the law over an issue even where one technically has the right to.\n\n**Its it thus** *wrong* for you to claim OP cannot, or that this cannot be a legal issue because it is administrative (they ARE NOT mutually exclusive!) **but** it is *also* wrong to go straight to the law.\n\n**On the other hand** in the event that the OP ends up in a university panel pleading his case, then *if* he has a right of representation under that panel then a lawyer can be a good idea, even if it is not the \"done thing\". Even if he does not have a right of representation, having a lawyer look over the representations you've make in front of a decision-maker *can* be smart. The reason?\n\n*In the event* that you have to take it on to the courts ***in future***, whatever you told the panel can and will be brought in as evidence by the university. ^(\"Your honour, the Student said in our recorded panel meeting that X which conflicts with his witness statement before this court.\") Therefore it makes sense to plea your case in front of the panel defensively while protecting your future rights, and that's the sort of thing a lawyer is good for.\n\nYou seem to be under the misapprehension that lawyers are only relevant where there is a direct interface with the Courts, too. Lawyers handle extralegal remediatory action like arbitration (oh look, industry *panels*), mediation, redrafting arguments to prevent mistakes, drafting extralegal documents, and far more.\n\n***The only problems here*** are that at this stage the cost of a lawyer far outweighs the benefit of having one, and that the *norm* for Universities is to do everything within their power to prevent students from exercising legal rights by dangling a non-court-based alternative route.",
