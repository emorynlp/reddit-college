  "title:": "\"How to work in academia and look after yourself\" A talk I gave last week about well-being and work-life balance in academia",
  "text": "Last week I gave a talk called \"How to work in higher education and look after yourself\" which was also called \"How to be a future research leader and look after yourself\" ....\n\nThe talk was recorded and you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc21eur9E6M) \n\nIt's the second time I've given it, lots of people have told me it was useful for them. It's super hard for me to give the talk (it brings up a lot of personal issues with anxiety) so this time I recorded it so I won't have to give it again! It's got some practical time management, work-life balance stuff but focuses on thinking about the relationship you have with your work.\n\nI'm in the UK so it's obviously focused on that context.",

      "text": "As a PhD students I think one of the biggest things as academics is we need to be kind and not be dicks.\n\nWe had an issue with blackboard a few weeks ago where coursework would randomly not upload and I remember seeing a first year crying in the corridor outside a lecture officer as blackboard failed and she was going to fail the module and year (100% coursework). She emailed him within 5 minutes of the deadline with the file. Still rejected.\n\nFurther that, I was talking to some student volunteer a few weeks back and one professor came up to them, asked them an obscure question and lost it with the SV for not knowing.\n\nWe need to try to be kind more and challenge poor behaviour more often. We affect our students lives more often than we realise.\n\nEdit - fixed some grammar",

Her email was very clear that she had been trying for the last hour to upload with time stamps in screenshots. She couldn\u2019t have given more evidence. Yet here we are the professor would not accept it",

You could have a great professor and a great department, but the lack of job security, the extremely competitive environment, the general culture of overwork, and the constant need to apply for jobs and grants just to keep afloat can get to people. Even if someone personally manages to hold a decent life/work balance, there's the constant stress and worry that you'll never get a permanent position if you don't work like crazy.",
