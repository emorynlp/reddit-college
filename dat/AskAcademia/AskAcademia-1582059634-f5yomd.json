  "title:": "Is 40 hours a week of studying reasonable for one class?",
  "text": "My general chemistry professor is having us sign a \u201ccontract\u201d to say that we have to study 40 hours a week for this class, and anyone with other commitments should drop (jobs or other classes). \n\nI\u2019ve taken a decent amount of STEM units before and I\u2019ve never heard of having to study 40 hours for one class. I can see having to study a combined 40 hours for multiple classes, but not one class. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t really sit right with me. I know that the study hours aren\u2019t enforceable at all, but the fact that it was on a contract is a little weird. The content so far is pretty straightforward but I don\u2019t know how this professor grades. \n\nI\u2019ve also applied to masters programs and this class is a prerequisite. I\u2019m not sure if I absolutely have to take it before or during the masters program, but when I applied for the programs, I told them that I\u2019ll take it this semester. I can technically still take it during the summer but I\u2019m not sure if the grad schools will like that. \n\nIf I were to not take classes this semester, I\u2019ve been offered a research opportunity. I probably won\u2019t be able to do this if I took this class. \n\nOverall I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019ve already started to burn out from school and I\u2019ve done some really self destructive behaviors during my previous class.",

For a regular Gen Chem class I estimate 8-12 hours a week of studying is perfectly adequate for most students. Colleges don't want any one class to force their students into part-time status; it kills the institution's metrics. I'd take a copy of that contract to the Office of Student Affairs.",

      "text": "No. I have so many things to say:\n\n1. Your professor has no business making you sign a contract about the number of hours per week you'll study.\n\n2. Your professor's request that you and other students drop jobs, other classes, extracurricular activities, etc. is completely and utterly unreasonable. For one, it comes from a place of privilege: some students need the money from jobs to attend school and pay for expenses. For two, while studying is of course important to your academic progression, it is unreasonable to expect that your life revolve around this class.\n\n3. 40 hours per week plus class time amounts to a full-time job. For one class. If you were to take four classes that required 40+ hours per week, you'd use literally all of the hours in the week. It's not a reasonable request.\n\n4. A professor's job is to find a way to achieve the learning objectives of the class with a reasonable amount of student work, being mindful of the fact that most students are taking several classes, and have lives and other things going on, too. Of course you could learn more if this were your only class and you could dedicate more time to it, but that's not how this works. Your professor needs to reset their expectations and prioritize what they most want you and your classmates to learn.\n\nConsider talking with this professor if you feel that they may be reasonable. As much as I'm not usually an advocate for going over a professor's head and talking to someone higher up first, this is a case where I can see it being warranted. In particular, your professor's request sounds not only out of touch and unreasonable, but *abusive* in their use of their position of power to demand that students drop classes, jobs, and obligations so that they can dedicate their entire existence to this class. That's not acceptable, and something that a department chair should know about.\n\nThis sounds stressful; good luck with this.",

There were times when I would be above or below this depending on the project,  but he was just trying to ensure we knew the amount of time required to do well. It showed when some students slacked off and spent just the 5 class hours in there (picture the worst of Pinterest fails) and he wouldn't take their excuses because he or a grad assistant had to be there to let students into the locked studio, so he knew who was working when. He also did this to ensure no one slacked off on the final group project as we had to point out and document everything we contributed to the exhibit (there was a minimum for number of pieces and quality/durability as it was an iinteractive display ).",

I know the art majors were taking up to 3 studios plus some gen-eds, but some of their studio classes had lower expectations in terms of hours. 40 hours from one class is still ridiculous though, especially from an undergrad class.
