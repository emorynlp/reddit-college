  "text": "Hello people. \n\nI\u00b4m a physics studient. I\u00b4m not an expert on biology stuffs. I want to read *On the origin of the species* book just to increase my general scientific culture, nontheless I understand that is not a new book and there has been huge discoveries on biology since its relases. Can you reccomend me a good version of it? Maybe with commentaries or something like that to help me to understand the good, bad, the mistakes, etc.\n\nThank you in advance.",
