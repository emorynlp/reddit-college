For me, the dopamine hit when something (eg. a complex concept or system or a pattern of results in my research) \u2018clicks\u2019 in my mind is like no other. \n\nI\u2019m not motivated by money or status, so the usual incentive structures for career progression (promotions and pay-rises) do not work on me. \n\nI feel that I have a lot to offer to the world, and I don\u2019t want to offer it to companies or people that are out to make money. I also gain satisfaction from helping and inspiring others, eg. lecturing or teaching, so research / academia feels like the perfect fit for me.",

Most areas of research I don't have to try to stay motivated about, but marking papers, writing up, commenting on difficult students' work, and dealing with political crap are all difficult areas. Then I remind myself that if I do something, I will feel motivated to do something more. It works.\n\nResearch usually motivates me, and I use it as a reward. Knowing I will help others, that I'm finding out new things that no one else knows, and that I'm mentoring the researchers of tomorrow is such a buzz.",
