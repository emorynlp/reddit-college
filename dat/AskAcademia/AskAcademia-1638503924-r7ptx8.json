  "title:": "[Student:] Accidentally angered a DARPA PM and feel terrible. What can I do?",
  "text": "I was working on a project with my advisor and needed to get it approved for public release. My advisor directed me to send it in and get it reviewed. At one point I asked when they would get it done, and they said 2 weeks too late and suggested I email the PM to request an expedited review. They sent an email back and it's all good.\n\nThe same thing happened almost exactly, except this time around they got VERY mad and angrily called/emailed (not sure which) my advisor, after which my advisor says \"the bridge is burned.\" i.e. we've lost funding from them for future students. He almost fired me, but understood I really had no idea.\n\nI feel absolutely terrible. I've checked my email over multiple times and had other people look at it, and there's nothing wrong with it, I think the problem is just that I emailed a PM at all, they're like a higher-up.\n\nIs this just irreparably up in smoke?? Is there anything I can do to smooth this over, or maybe get my advisor more funding?\n\nEdit: The 15 day deadline is written on the form, but the contract manager basically told my advisor \"don't worry we can get done in a week.\" All of our requests were a week out (his other students too). It seems that he didn't really explain the situation",

The grant is your PIs, as is the project- they need to be explicitly aware of and sign off on all external communications around it. \n\nYes, funding is really hard to come by for a pre-tenure professor, and losing funding could well impact their chances of getting tenure. It\u2019s unlikely that you funding yourself would help. \n\nAlso, I thought you said this was for your defense? Wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re done?",

Since this is DARPA I'm assuming you're on a research contract, which means that is a contractual obligation and there is some (usually financial) penalty to the government if they don't meet that requirement. A PM asking for an expedited review of materials is not a trivial ask, and something they need to be judicious with.\n\nIt sounds like they did your lab this favor once, and now you're presuming they will do again for you whenever you want.\n\n Furthermore, if I'm reading your comments right, you asked for expedited review of your *master's thesis* (which is not something that you didn't know was coming), and wrote an email that made it sound like the review office could expect a reply email from the PM approving an expedited review *without talking to the PM first*. If that's the case, then holy shit I'd be furious too.",

              "text": "I know that it seems like PMs have a lot of autonomy, because they're your sole point of contact at an agency. However, none of us work in a vacuum. I know I flippantly said I wouldn't contract with OP, but the reality is PMs don't have that kind of authority, we make recommendations (which admittedly have a lot of weight) to directors and grants/contracting officers who are the ones who actually have the authority to dole out government funds. We usually do this in full view of other PMs who would call out actions they think are unusual.  A big part of my job is writing justifications for our internal decisions because agencies do get audited regularly.  \n\nWith regard to bias, broadly, the same COI rules that apply to peer reviewers also apply to me. I also can't hold conflicting financial investments and have to prove that annually. \n\nAs far as talking to people, that varies a lot if you're talking about grants vs contracts, and different agencies have different policies. Some simply won't talk to you at all about applications, others only at certain points in the funding cycle. Within an agency, each PM has to make sure they're being consistent, but that doesn't mean acting the same as every other PM. For example, I give every PI one phone call with me per application for a prescribed length of time, and no more. Some PMs don't have the time to respond to everyone so they're more hands off, and that's fine as long as they're fair about it.",

      "text": "Regardless of what happened, the alphabet agencies often see their contractors as replaceable. For someone like DARPA that may not be as true, as DARPA works heavily in cutting edge science for which there might only be a few labs to even turn to. Nevertheless I think many inside the DoD feel like contractors are there for them and their mission, not the other way around. If your lab is contracted out to assist on a project then the feeling is they need to follow the rules DARPA sets, and if they cant then the agency will find a lab that does. If they set a 15 day review schedule they did it because they need for people to use that method. Maybe its just a process thing, or a safety thing, or a security thing, or maybe its written into some statute regarding only defense procurement. IDK, but if they said 15 days they meant 15 days. You made a mistake and that cost you and your lab big. It was a simple mistake, perhaps an honest one, but still costly nevertheless. And the worst part is there really isn't anything you can do to fix it. Certainly if you have the opportunity to submit for review again, I would follow the procedure to the letter and not try to short circuit it. \n\nRecently the USS Connecticut, one of only three of the very advanced Seawolf class submarines the US built, struck an underwater mountain and inflicted serious damage on herself. Possibly she may be scraped because of the damage done to her. According to the Navy's public report, the submarine had collided with an uncharted and unknown undersea formation. Given that its hard to see how anyone could have avoided striking the unknown sea rock while sailing a ship that has no windows and which travels deep underwater. Nevertheless the boat's captain has been relieved of his command, and in keeping with Navy tradition will probably never command another ship at sea again. Not because its his fault necessarily (assuming of course that further inquiries dont decide it was his fault) but because even though it was an accident, an honest accident probably, even one time is too many times. Even this one, first, accident has done potentially irreparable harm to his ship and to the Navy more broadly. You, I think, may find your situation to be similar in some respects.",

Their program managers are god-emperors of large budgets, and have wide discretion to decide who gets funding, with unclear accountability or requirements to use selection criteria that are fair, science-based, or subject to critique. I suspect as a result, funding goes primarily to their friends and people they like on a personal level (OP's anecdote is evidence of this), but of course they don't make funding deliberations public so we have no way of knowing for sure.",
