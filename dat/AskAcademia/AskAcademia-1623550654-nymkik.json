  "title:": "Graduate Student Unions. Yay or Nay?",
  "text": "I'm planning to apply for my Ph.D. and I've been browsing certain University websites and looking through their curriculums and stuff. Came across the topic of Graduate Student Unions. What's up with that?\n\nCopied from the school website:\n\nWe believe that \"Joining a student union and participating in it\" will be at odds with the strong academic partnership that is formed between students and mentors and that represents a central element of the graduate student educational experience.\n\nCopied from the webpage:\n\nVanderbilt recognizes that if **graduate students choose to be represented by a union, that decision has the potential to drastically change the nature of the relationship** between the University and its students \u2013 from one of a faculty/student and mentor/mentee relationship, to that of an employer/employee relationship. Such **a change is likely to fundamentally alter our current students\u2019 academic experiences, as well as their careers and the careers of those to follow**. Our goal is to provide factual information and to allow students make the best decision. Vanderbilt believes that when our students have all of the facts, they will recognize that they are better off without a union, even if a current federal ruling allows such a choice. In these FAQs, and in other communications from the university, we emphasize these points with the common message of \u201ceducation first.\u201d\n\n**Vanderbilt believes that graduate students are best served by remaining union-free for several reasons**. First, the nature of unionization clearly interferes and works at cross-purposes with the close mentor-mentee relationships between faculty and graduate students. Since unionization converts the student-teacher relationship to that of supervisor-supervisee, the fundamental relationship becomes more formal, structured, and legalistic, rather than personal and flexible. We believe that such a change will be at odds with the strong academic partnership that is formed between students and mentors and that represents a central element of the graduate student educational experience.\n\nSecond, Vanderbilt prefers to interact directly with its students, rather than to interact through a third party with its own financial and political motives. **Unionization would replace a collaborative, engaged learning model that has enhanced the experience and opportunities for graduate students with a collective bargaining model, a model originally designed for the industrial workplace that focuses on the use of economic levers, such as strikes, to achieve bargaining objectives rather than on a high-quality educational experience.** Instead of one team united toward advancing learning, discovery and degree attainment, the University and its students could end up being on what feels like two opposing teams, divided by a third entity, a union, that neither knows Vanderbilt nor cares about the quality of the educational experience.\n\nThank you!\n\nThank you guys for all the amazing feedback!",

      "text": "**I want to be clear**: you should all join a union. \n\nThat said, I don't think current structure of graduate school is well-suited for graduate student unions, *as it currently exists in the USA for science/engineering disciplines*. I say this because PhD students are *students* their first couple of years, with a fair amount of PIs paying their students to essentially take classes and train in the laboratory. Usually, the turnaround time for most on-the-job training programs are measured in weeks or months, not years! \n\nI think western Europe does it right when it comes to obtaining a PhD. Most students obtain their master's degree first, with some laboratory training. Then, they apply to receive their PhD based off their performance in the lab and classes. If hired, they are treated (more properly) as employees. The USA tends to go at it with a one-size-fits-all approach for the entirety of graduate school, which I don't think makes anyone really happy.",

TA positions can be a lot less stable and while they provide students with work experience, they don't help forward the students' own research. So it's important that (a) teaching requirements don't take over students' lives and (b) that they are reliable enough that students can not be worried all the time about whether/how they'll be funded. An RA position can certainly be precarious and can overwork a student, but in my experience they tend to feel more like a \"mentorship\" relationship than the TA positions do and they're usually grant funded positions, so the money is less tied to the University budget. I think that's why feelings about grad student unionization tend to vary between fields, it's cause the actual difference in the sort of employment grad students receive.",

Taking overhead from NIH grants? Great, you can't pay any grad student less than $20k/year after tuition and TAships must carry certain protections so students are not being exploited. NIH and NSF have basically done something like this for postdoc compensation packages, so this is just simply not impossible, and the threat of cutting off overhead excisions will be more effective than grad student work actions alone.",

I could be wrong on that, but unions would just \"complicate things\" and make them lose what is essentially these lottery winnings (not to say they don't pull in grants as well). For the other STEMs, I'd guess the faculty largely feel the way you described. Luckily, many of the grads feel different despite generous stipends, but it's a struggle battling that propaganda.",

There is a major power imbalance when it comes to negotiating because most student unions, from what I understand, are using lawyers they can only afford with support from teacher's unions, both with limited resources. Meanwhile, schools can seem like they have a relatively unlimited amount of supplies to get top notch negotiation teams and do unethical but legal things. We have to report union membership to out school and I think a couple of years before I started, we found out they were using the clause in most student contracts saying \"We can access your school affiliated email at any time for any reason\" to basically see what the union was planning next and only technically fulfilling most parts of our contract, like reports due by Tuesday at 12pm would be scheduled to be sent on Tuesday at 11:59:59 out of spite.\n\nI would hope your union tried fighting for better rates from everyone, but sometimes it's just a losing battle, especially when the people you represent are in such a precarious position to start with. Justifiably, most grads just want to get their degree and get out and not be some martyr for other grads, or SCAB grads who have supplemental income such that the stipend doesn't matter to them. Also, though, sometimes unions are just shitty. In those cases, you might just be better off creating department advocacy groups and working that route.",

In my experience, the grad student unions have always done a terrible job at actually communicating with all of the students they're supposedly trying to represent; the engineering faculty. Worse, the humanities tend to dominate the student unions, but at the same time the humanities reps often don't have the faintest idea of how wet labs work or what the needs of wet lab students are, and then are surprised when those same students don't really have the time or patience to deal with the reps or tell them why their (admittedly well-meaning) policy proposals are a net-negative for those of us who work in wet labs.\n\nBeyond that, engineering has a demographic problem; it's overwhelmingly international students and domestic whites. The international students largely just want to keep their heads down and work on their degrees, whereas the domestic students (overwhelmingly white men) tend to not feel welcome in the union groups due to what are honestly best described as microagressions from the (generally) progressive, irreligious, and urban students that compose much of the humanities (and, thus, the humanities leadership).\n\ntl;dr: the problem isn't always the idea of unionization, but the people who actually make up the student unions.",

The people who take issue with it are university administrators. We ARE already employees of the university. So are faculty. \n\nWhen the grad students at my university petitioned the university administrators to take away the fees we have to pay that are not covered by our stipends (and the fees are very arbitrary, and do not really go toward anything that benefits grad students), and asked for a modest increase in stipends, the provost sent out an email saying, basically \"No, you're paid enough, we're keeping the fees, this is in the best interest of the university\" (meanwhile, they increased tuition for undergrads, not sure if they increased it for non-funded/tuition-covered grad programs like many MA programs) and everyone, including faculty, were really quite disgusted. She actually resigned from the provost position soon after, but I think it'd be a stretch to say that was the reason.  \n\nThe university just wants more money.

It was super aggressive. \n\nCopied from wepage:\n\nVanderbilt recognizes that if graduate students choose to be represented by a union, that **decision has the potential to drastically change the nature of the relationship between the University and its students** \u2013 from one of a faculty/student and mentor/mentee relationship, to that of an employer/employee relationship. Such a change is likely to **fundamentally alter our current students\u2019 academic experiences, as well as their careers and the careers of those to follow**. Our goal is to provide factual information and to allow students make the best decision. Vanderbilt believes that when our students have all of the facts, they will recognize that they are better off without a union, even if a current federal ruling allows such a choice. In these FAQs, and in other communications from the university, we emphasize these points with the common message of \u201ceducation first.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vanderbilt believes that graduate students are best served by remaining union-free for several reasons.** First, the nature of unionization clearly interferes and works at cross-purposes with the close mentor-mentee relationships between faculty and graduate students. Since unionization converts the student-teacher relationship to that of supervisor-supervisee, the fundamental relationship becomes more formal, structured, and legalistic, rather than personal and flexible. We believe that such a change will be at odds with the strong academic partnership that is formed between students and mentors and that represents a central element of the graduate student educational experie",

So I'd say: they disrupt in order to do something! My grad student union was one of the oldest grad student unions in the country and they were effective at getting us raises and trying to push the university to pay segregated fees (instead of having grad students spend like 10% of their meager stipend to pay fees). The faculty were always really supportive of grad student unions (the admin, not so much). \n\nOur union also held membership meetings with free beer/food once a year which was nice - the union may provide social opportunities like that alongside their other union advocating.",

The fact that the university extorts an extra ~$40k a year from the department per student isn't really relevant. I don't take classes, the lab space is paid for by grants that my PI gets,  and then the school takes an extra 40k off the top because they can.\n\nAnd that's just pay.

When I was a graduate student we had two unions (and I was our department rep to both, as I was a loud mouth jackass from a union family and not in the room while the election was held).  One we joined as TAs (and also held sessional lecturers and the like).  This was a very good union - we spent about half our time/effort on ensuring people were being paid for every hour they worked, and about half our time/effort resolving sexual harassment cases; both very useful and noble purposes.  Because we were teaching classes 'n' such, we had a lot of leverage if we struck (and we were serious abd professional, so the administration was typically pretty receptive to us).  One of they key things here was that because a lot of the people in this union were there longer term, they could see the benefits of stuff - things  like strikes are short term pain for long term gain - hard to do if everyone is planning to leave fairly soon.\n\nThe other union was for us as research assistants and the like - it  was horseshit.  We spent our time on political causes mostly unrelated to general membership, and general foolishness.  A typically meeting was something like: allocate funds to anti-Israel protests, raise our dues 12% (the most we could without a general member vote), allocate funds to protest the university raising tuition 2%.  The fundamental problem was it was just graduate students who didn't care about long term stuff, and the university didn't care what we did, because we had no leverage.  *Indeed*, where I did my first postdoc there was, for some reason, a postdoc union, and all that ever happened was the administration would send us letters asking if we'd been striking so they could dock our pay.  Researchers who aren't faculty bringing in big overheads have zero leverage over the university, so a union can't help.  And because no one cared about the long term picture, the people running it were all there to play politics for themselves, and it sucked.",

I am strongly supportive of many of the rights and protections that student unions seek for their members.

In fact, I'd argue that PIs should be appealing to funding agencies to take the lead on pushing for trainee rights and protections across the board. If this means that students are now more expensive than staff scientists, then great, let's see more staff scientist positions and less pressure to hustle med school rejects into PhD programs as a backup.",

That really requires concerted efforts by researchers across institutions to deescalate the current productivity arms race, as well as advocacy for affordable housing in university communities where rent prices have skyrocketed over the past 20 years due to landlord graft. Further degrading grad student compensation packages and quality of life does not actually fix those problems.",

In fact, I think that\u2019s one of the great things that unions do. Compensation does tend to differ between disciplines, so I prefer union approaches that raise the minimum without mandating a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cstudy section reviewers\u201d, so this could be where things differ by discipline. In my area, many of the enhanced expectations tied to grant money come at the directorate or program level, passed along by individual program officers. On the institutional side, I wasn\u2019t speaking about any expectations coming from hiring or P&T committees; rather, administrative tasks on the research side that keep getting pushed onto PIs. This trend is probably universal, but the intensity likely varies across institutions and departments.\n\nI will reiterate that the style and hourly distribution of research work can vary quite substantially from discipline to discipline. I do my best to even the flow out and keep things on an even keel for my group; I am also very flexible with time off, but sometimes the responsibilities of research swing above the median (as they sometimes swing below it). I would not want a student to be able to opt out of work that is normal for my discipline, citing expectations that are uniformly set for PhD students across all fields.\n\nAgain- I generally support unionization. I do not find unions to be a panacea.",

In my discipline, 12+ hour days are normal but that's honestly not sustainable or healthy. Rarely? Sure. But not routinely, and if unions are pushing for stricter limits on that sort of abuse, that is actually very reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for administrative tasks, that's above a grad student's pay grade. Faculty unions should be aggressively campaigning for limits on bureaucratic red tape that limits their abilities to do their jobs. This is of course part of a bigger problem of university administrative bloat, with mire and more administrators working for the board and fewer and fewer working for faculty.

I'm blessed with a strong union that's ensured I don't work over 20 hours a week, allowed me to live comfortably, and provided coverage for physical and mental health needs (they do more, but these three have affected me most directly). I definitely wouldn't have gotten this far without them.",

      "text": ">Second, Vanderbilt prefers to interact directly with its students, rather than to interact through a third party with its own financial and political motives. Unionization would replace a collaborative, engaged learning model that has enhanced the experience and opportunities for graduate students with a collective bargaining model, a model originally designed for the industrial workplace that focuses on the use of economic levers, such as strikes, to achieve bargaining objectives rather than on a high-quality educational experience. Instead of one team united toward advancing learning, discovery and degree attainment, the University and its students could end up being on what feels like two opposing teams, divided by a third entity, a union, that neither knows Vanderbilt nor cares about the quality of the educational experience.\n\nMan, what a crock of nonsense. Unions are made up of students and represent student interests. They're democratic organizations- it's not some mysterious \"third party\", just coordinating with your peers who are already at school with you so you have agency, unlike in the \"personal\" model they're supporting.",

Marshall also wrote of incidents in which union members assaulted black workers hired to replace them during strikes. During the 1911 strike against the Illinois Central, noted Marshall, whites killed two black strikebreakers and wounded three others at McComb, Mississippi. He also noted that white strikers killed ten black firemen in 1911 because the New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railroad had granted them equal seniority. Not surprisingly, therefore, black leader Booker T. Washington opposed unions all his life, and W. E. B. DuBois called unions the greatest enemy of the black working class. Another interesting fact: the \u201cunion label\u201d was started in the 1880s to proclaim that a product was made by white rather than yellow (Chinese) hands. More generally, union wage rates, union-backed requirements for a license to practice various occupations, and union-backed labor regulations such as the minimum wage law and the Davis-Bacon Act continue to reduce opportunities for black youths, females, and other minorities.",

In the last 5 years we have achieved: $2,000 base stipend increase for the lowest paid TAs. Fought to tower the amount grad students pay in fees from around $2k a year to $100 a year. Rallied to save 2 departments from getting cut (pre-COVID). None of this would have been possible without a union. On top of this TA's at our uni get an extra $800 per year the union has secured.\n\nI think there are poorly run unions and unions that are captured by the parent unions e.g. UAW are problematic because grad student labor organizing is very different from traditional worker organizing. Our departments have large turnover (TA to RA) and therefore a lot of works needs to constantly be put into getting cards from new members. Because of this situation the parent unions need to be comfortable spending more money on events and info sessions to get unit members in situations for pitches and 1:1s. Our union has found that prioritizing orientations sessions at the beginning of the year works the best. We give ino sessions and pitches at every dept. Orientation.\n\nHowever, if the union is fighting for the material interest of members as the highest priority and trying to build solidarity across all departments then they will continue to win if they can organize.",

It was invaluable--we had one of the better protections and benefits than many others across the US. We went on strike (over contracts). Nearly every department joined in the action--even faculty and staff (who had to do it in discreet ways). Some of the few departments that did not join were in STEM. The PhD students in those programs were directly threatened of being forced out of the labs if they were found to be part of the action. A few still did in discrete ways, but most didn't. When the organizer heard that particular dept faculty were threatening grad students regarding the strike, they ended up setting up a picket line in front of their building (I don't know if you know, but it can get very loud with the chants, etc. lol).\n\nI watched my counterparts in private institutions, where they did get more stipend, but ultimately were beholden to their dept/institutions in ways that were different, some didn't even have proper health coverage. Our union had fought for extensive coverage (basically was a PPO). \n\nThe union also played a role in mitigating issues between students and advisors (if it violated certain issues). It doesn't mean the dept/faculty won't be punitive in other ways, but if it became an issue, you at least had a supportive office (w/ some resources) to help you navigate it--because remember--every office (outside of the union), including HR, works to protect the institution first.\n\nAll this to say, go to a school with one if you can, join one if you can. And, perhaps avoid departments who are outrageously publicizing their union-busting posts on their department pages... if you can.",
