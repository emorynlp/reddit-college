  "title:": "Wanting to take intermission from my PhD",
  "text": "Hi all. Throwaway account. I (24F) am a first year PhD student that is looking into taking intermission from my studies on the grounds of mental health. I'll try keep the problems to why I have ended up at this point brief  - its a very endless list.  \n\n\nIn summary, I have had an extremely rough year from being a victim of domestic violence and having a family member pass away.  Prior to all this, I am also diagnosed with two mental disorders which predisposes me to not handling stress very well. Additionally, the past couple of weeks I have gotten to a point where going into work has made me very suicidal (I am seeking treatment currently). Today I sat in my car for an hour before I managed to step out and enter the building. As its getting to a very bad point, I am finally considering taking intermission as I cannot physically function at work. Even sending out an e-mail takes all my energy. My psychiatrist is willing to file in all the paper work regarding the application for my intermission so that won't be too much of a problem. However, I am petrified of bringing this up with my PI. He has known that I have had to deal with some hardships this year. But at one point when I was asking him to take leave of absence for a couple of days due to my severe anxiety, he said something that really struck with me: \"Do not let your emotions get in the way of work\". Because of that, I really don't know how to broach this topic with my PI. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to professionally tell my PI that I need to take intermission from my studies, primarily because I need to focus on getting treatment for my mental health?",

      "text": "I have two thoughts for you. First, if you need to take a leave of absence to get well, take it. It doesn\u2019t matter what your advisor thinks or said. If you need it, you need it. \n\nSecond, while you can take a leave from your program, it can impact your research project and your funding. If, for example, you are funded on a research grant from a funding agency, then the project has a fixed time window and must continue while you are away. That can affect whether or not you will have funding when you return, or if it will continue for the same number of years, or if you will be able to work on the same project. That is worth investigating before you take the leave.",

          "text": "I took a year leave after some traumatic events. It helped so much. The only issue (and it was a big one) was that it paused my funding (and benefits), so I had to live off my savings and get some help from my partner and family. In my case, my PhD funding was still waiting for me (in full) when I returned. Totally worth it. (Edit to mention that my supervisor, with whom I was quite close, was very supportive. It\u2019s possible that your PI doesn\u2019t fully understand your situation, but it\u2019s also possible that he\u2019s from a subset of academics who turn to work as an often unhealthy coping mechanism.)",

You have legal rights (unless you don't, I don't know and shouldn't assume). \n\nI would do the paperwork and tell the PI after everything is planned and done. \n\nAlso, fuck that guy. I'm sorry he wasn't understanding when you first brought it up. Maybe he'll be more receptive later, but also, fuck him.",

I would maybe explain that your new knowledge about yourself has led you to make an educated decision not only for your mental health but also for the sake of your performance, and that it is not a decision that has been made on a whim.",

I've seen plenty of profs at the college I went to readily dismiss mental health of students working on projects with them, so you never know.",
