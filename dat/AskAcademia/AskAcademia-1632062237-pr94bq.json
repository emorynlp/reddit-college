  "text": "I am super ashamed and feel like ending myself\u2026 I was taking an online quiz worth just 1% of my grade. We weren\u2019t given a table with percentages like we were promised and I panicked and looked up the answer in hopes that I would find the charts.\n\nMy prof noticed this and accused my of academic honesty. I don\u2019t know what will happen to me. I am expecting a letter from a university Judicial Officer but the anxiety/stress that \u201cnot knowing what\u2019s next\u201d is creating is insurmountable.\n\nI take 100% responsibility for my actions and just want to be disciplined sooner rather than later Bc I can\u2019t take this feeling.\n\nAny advice on what usually happens/ What the coming steps are for me?",

It's very difficult for outsiders to gauge the seriousness of what you've done and if you have to face a disciplinary process then you'll have to go along with it. But if you do genuinely feel suicidal, you should have access to your university's counselling services and I'd strongly encourage getting in contact with them because they will be able to give you support.",

It sounds like a good plan to just your brief explanation and apologize as you\u2019ve already mentioned so you are already doing what needs to be done. You got this\nEdit: also\u2026 not sure if this would be in your best interest, but if they did not give you the whole test it almost sounds like you could contest it? Like why would they discipline you if you were looking up the missing part of the test? But I don\u2019t know the full story, either way you will get through this one way or another!",

I'd respond to it whether it's a small assignment, midterm, term paper, final exam or extra credit (yep, you can flunk my class by cheating on extra credit!).\n\nAlso, on my campus, it's something that's communicated with a chairperson simply because the chair might get involved if it all goes south. Letting a chair know in advance is a good idea.\n\nI can't remember any time that professors talked with each other about minor cheating on a small assignment with each other. It happens way too often and we're way too busy to talk about that. Now, the time that a student plagiarized the professor who was teaching the class, copying big chunks of his published paper and then typing them into a term paper that he turned in--that one was talked about!\n\nBut, having said all of that, the other comments about acknowledging the misdeed and apologizing typically results in no substantial penalty for minor cheating. If it happens again, it becomes a different issue.",
