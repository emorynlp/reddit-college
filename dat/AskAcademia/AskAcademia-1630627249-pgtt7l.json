  "title:": "Help! Is it acceptable to pursue my PhD in Social Psychology with a Master's in Interpersonal Communication?",
  "text": "I am currently a first year masters student receiving my masters in interpersonal communication, but I've had this driving passion for the field of social psychology that is not studied or encouraged in my current field of study. I do not want to start over and apply at a different school because most psychology masters programs are not funded and I am currently a fully funded student. So the question is, do PhD programs accept students from different fields that are slightly related, or is that unheard of? I will have my master's in interpersonal communication, but I wish to pursue social psychology. Thoughts? In simple terms, Is it possible to pursue a PhD in a different field than your Masters?",
