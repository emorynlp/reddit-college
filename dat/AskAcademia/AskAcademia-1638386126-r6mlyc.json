  "text": "I saw [an article](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/30/my-students-never-knew-the-lecturer-who-lived-in-a-tent) recently about how nearly half of the \u201dundergraduate tutorials for which Cambridge University is famous are delivered by precariously employed staff without proper contracts.\u201d The faculty member the article featured had been living in a tent.\n\nI see articles like this all the time, but they never seem to discuss *why* universities need to rely on precariously employed faculty when tuition has gotten so high. \u201dWhere is the money going?\u201d seems an obvious question to ask, yet I see so few articles that do.\n\nCould anyone recommend helpful resources that deal with this seeming incongruity?",

      "text": "In the article you linked, the faculty member actually works at a different university - the comments about Cambridge and the lecturer living in a tent are completely separate.\n\nBut in terms of Cambridge: PhD students are barred from working, and you have to sign a financial declaration stating that you have the money to support yourself for the full ~4 years. So the supervision pay is rather low (taking into account the hours worked) and there\u2019s no good argument to be made for it being higher, since it\u2019s only meant to be spare change. If you need supervision pay to afford your rent, you\u2019ve lied in your financial declaration and that could be grounds for expulsion.\n\nAlso, pay is managed by so many different bodies (departments and then the legally independent colleges) so it\u2019s practically impossible to get them to agree to a higher pay. You aren\u2019t just negotiating with 1 university, you have to negotiate with **32** (uni + every college)",

The stipends here are mediocre too (\u00a315k is standard), but are okay if you\u2019re alone or if you have a working partner. Certainly not enough to be the sole breadwinner in a family.\n\nIf you have dependents then they are included in your financial declaration, so you must state that you have all of the funds necessary for them too before you can start the PhD. And it must be proven, either with a scholarship that covers all estimated costs or bank statements proving you have the cash.",

I have previously been an adjunct. I had to leave teaching to make a living wage. I planned to leave higher ed entirely but ironically I ended up with another job at a university, but as staff. I can tell you that lower level staffers like me are not overcompensated or bloating the budget. What we do is essential to keep the university running. If the university outsourced my job to a contractor, which they totally could, and would have to if they got rid of my position, it would cost them way more than what they pay me. I have over 10 years experience and am paid entry level wages. Just my perspective because I'm always hearing about how overpaid all administrators are. Too many positions being adjuncts are a problem but eliminating staff to free up money isn't the answer.",

      "text": "Almost all the answers on here are about the US, but the article is about the UK system which is very different.\n\nPhD students and postdocs have always been used to take tutorials or, on occasion, lectures in place of the academic lecturer so this isn't anything new. In the UK there are almost no private Universities and the problem is that government funding has been cut but only partially replaced with (increased) student fees. The shortfall means that unless you're a wealthy University - of which there are far, far fewer in the UK - you employ fewer staff and try to accept more students. There's a cap to how many students you can take on, however. Admin staff are being lost and the remaining ones spread very thinly. Only the most senior professors (full professors for the US audience) have their own admin support, other profs are given a share of one and anyone else from Senior Lecturers down gets generic support from University-wide depts e.g. finance, HR, admissions.\n\nPostdocs are called contract research staff (CRS) in the UK and are hired on fixed-term contracts for between 1-3 years typically. After the contract ends there's no guarantee of a job so you either hope the PI gets another grant or you shop around for other jobs or apply for fellowships. This cycle can continue more or less forever unless you're lucky enough to get a permanent position either directly or via tenure track. Job security for postdocs is almost non-existent. As they're transient workers they get very little representation at University, are too busy with the day job, and are afraid to kick up a stink as they know they need get another contract in a couple of years.\n\nAt some universities or depts they only employ teaching staff on 9-month contracts as they don't need them over the summer.\n\nSalaries have lagged behind inflation for many years and now we're having our pension benefits [significantly reduced](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/01/on-the-picket-line-at-leeds-university-i-will-strike-for-as-long-as-it-takes). So although the median salaries in UK academia aren't bad they're not as good as the private sector, but our benefits are getting worse and worse. This is the third time in the last 20 years they've attacked our pensions.\n\nIn short student funding doesn't support all that's required to provide the tuition and Universities are struggling to meet the shortfall.",
