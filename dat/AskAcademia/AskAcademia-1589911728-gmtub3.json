      "text": "I'm not in a STEM field, so take from this what you will.\n\nI think this is common, especially when you're dealing with interpreting the work of others and feeling like your jamming a 'square peg into a round hole' so to speak.\n\nI received some really good advice on this: \n\nFirst: acknowledge your first draft is going to be bad.  That's why its a first draft.  The drafts after the first may not be much better, but it will suck less, and thats progress.\n\nSecond: once you've got something bad its time to criticize the paper until it's good.  Ask yourself why it's 'absolute garbage'? What are you missing/leaving out?  Is there an easier way to convey the information? etc.  Find the holes or weak points and fix or remove them.\n\nAlso, sometimes you need to give yourself a break.  The old habit of printing a draft and shoving it in a drawer for a day or two and then reading it will give your brain a break and allow you to approach writing with more clarity, for example.\n\nI can have a fairly pessimistic attitude to my own ideas and I am constantly critical of my writing, so acknowledging that the papers not going to nail it from the get go takes some of the pressure off.  Letting it sit for a bit also helps.\n\nThe mantra I always tell myself is: Your main idea is in there.  It's just a little nugget of gold buried in a pile of shit.  You just need to remove all the shit, and clean off the nugget of gold the best you can.\n\nHope that's helpful! Good luck with your research!",

Keep writing, get to the finish line.  It's so easy to get half way and turn back or take on some new project.  You will have nothing to show for it. No proof you got so close.  If you just get over the line, the whole thing materialises. It's hard to do. Easy to talk about. Keep at it (to you and me both!)",

When I read something, almost everything is just *fullmasse*, insignificant words, and I have to work to extract out the nuggets of wisdom. Everyone else who reads it has to do this too, but what we consider *fullmasse* is different.\n\nI should also add that it's good that you're aware that some of what you're doing is rubbish. This means you have some sense of taste. As you gain more experience, you'll also sharpen your taste.",

Or, it could help you realize how much better it was than what you remember it leading to you realizing how hard you could be on yourself. \n* Have someone interview you about what you want to write about. My supervisor does this with me when I'm stuck. He'd ask me about my paper and take notes of my answers or have me voice record our conversation. It's a great way to organize your thoughts. \n* Start with the easy parts. When I don't feel like starting a paper, I'd just start with the methods section or draw the graphs and figures. It's a good break for my writing brain, and it keeps me on schedule. \n* Drawing graphs in general is a great way to verbalize your thought process even if you won't need the graphs. How you'd explain the graph is basically the same as how you'd write about the process. \n* Give yourself a break. I know it's not always an option, which is why it is important to find ways that makes writing not stressful.",
