  "title:": "I didn't have a supervisor for 2 years and never finished my PhD; what can I do?",
  "text": "Hey all. I feel I was massively let down by my institution and I'm looking for advice on possible next steps. It's fairly long; buckle up!\n\nI studied for a PhD (on a full scholarship) at a British grad school and had a relentless stream of personal problems in my time there, which obviously affected my performance. My supervisor was generally supportive and understanding and we got on well. I used the counselling service and did my best to stay afloat. I managed to jump through all the hoops, did the research, got my data, passed the probationary \u201ctests\u201d, published, taught, secured further funding and won some awards. I guess I was actually doing well for the first couple years...\n\nMy supervisor then moved to a new institution and it was agreed they would continue supervising me because I was almost at the writing up stage. But they experienced a bereavement and had to step back. I\u2019m not sure how \u201cofficial\u201d this stepping back was, but I got an email saying they would only read final drafts and that I should have another supervisor actually at my institution to assist me with putting my drafts together. Okay, fine. But I never got given a second supervisor. I know this sounds stupid in hindsight, but I just accepted this and assumed I had to figure it out by myself. I did not, and my personal problems exacerbated (I lost several family members). I spent TWO YEARS trying to write up with no supervisor, and it was only when a colleague stepped in and raised hell on my behalf that I was assigned a new advisor. They gave me 2 semesters but I was in such a mess I couldn\u2019t complete the dissertation in that time. I never finished, and just drifted away from the institution and academia with no formal withdrawal or communication whatsoever, with anyone.\n\nI realise I could (and should) have fought for more support but I was basically suicidal for a straight year and the lack of institutional support was, to my depressed brain, deserved. I\u2019m no longer in that place, and I have been working (in a semi-related field) for a couple of years. I\u2019m doing well.\n\nBut I\u2019m also now pretty mad. Do I have any recourse here, legal or otherwise, to\u2026 do *something*?? I realise this is a vague question; I\u2019m currently trying to figure out what I want to do. I guess I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s possible for me to finish my dissertation somehow and get my damn degree \u2013 I\u2019d written around a quarter of it and it kills me that I never finished. Could I transfer all this work and write up in another institution? Can I demand the original institution take me back?\n\nRelatedly, the university gave me a 5k loan to help cover living expenses for 1 year and they\u2019re now demanding it back. But they also didn\u2019t give me a supervisor for 2 years ?? Could I fight this? I can afford to pay it back, but I'm petty and mad and don't want to.\n\nAs an extra: I was also sexually harassed by another academic in my field *for years* during my time there (he\u2019s now at another institution). He was a known predator and others complained about him, but as I understand it he was only ever informally reprimanded by members of his department. His behavior was a contributing factor in my self-esteem woes. I\u2019m mad about this too, and I feel it\u2019s relevant as another indication of institutional failings.\n\nSorry this is so long. I\u2019d really appreciate any input or guidance.",

The institution could have supported you better by making expectations clear and giving you guidance as you looked for new supervision. And you could have done a better job advocating for yourself at several points (though it's truly understandable that you didn't -- you were dealt a tough hand).\n\nBut I'm not sure you're *owed* anything. Are they obligated to provide you with a supervisor, or is that entirely your obligation? \n\nA similar situation actually happened with a grad student at my institution in the U.S. -- advisor had to stop supervising their student, the student didn't seem to put any effort into finding a new supervisor (and were told it was their responsibility), and then the student just kind of faded away and no one saw him again. When people bring it up, the question is always, \"was the department obligated to provide him with a new supervisor? they accepted him into the program, after all.\" The consensus among my colleagues is usually that it was at least the student's job to *look* for a new supervisor, and to inform the graduate director if he couldn't get anyone to commit to him. The department can't help him if he never tells them he's having trouble. Maybe the graduate director could have checked with the student every month to see how the process was going, but most people would find that overbearing (\"we are adults, not children\"), so I'm not sure if they took the wrong approach.",

My dissertation advisor took a new job when I had about a year left, and we struck a deal that he could still be co-chair. But the FIRST thing I had to do was find another faculty member who would also stand as the \"in house\" co-chair of my dissertation committee. They told me I couldn't proceed with anything until that was official and clear as day. Then it ended up not being a problem. Granted, this is the US, so I can't speak to the system over there.",

It was accepted he could not be my new advisor and I was told they would find someone else. And then I just slipped through the cracks.

You're probably in no position for any financial support, but if you're just writing up (undoubtedly remotely) you probably don't need any funding anyway. \n\nI think talk of legal action is premature.

Go to a solicitor and maybe start looking for new routes for funding and supervision elsewhere so you can finish your phd.\n\nThis sounds similar to my experience although to a much worse degree. I am at a British university as well. I had no supervisions for the best part of a year and they recorded no paperwork for the entire first two years of my phd. They left and wanted to remain as the primary supervisor but did not contact me. I switched to a new supervisor who also left after a couple of months. I was given a new supervisor who has been brilliant luckily and they have told me I would have a case if I wanted to kick off at the university.\n\nAlongside this I have had to move house four times, had a child, and suffered from mental health problems (pre-existing but obviously made worse). \n\nDuring the PhD I also made a complaint about unwanted contact from a member of staff. This person was a well-known predator in the department for at least 10 years and I was pursued by other staff to make a complaint since the contact was witnessed by them. I went along with it and they were pushed into early retirement. Afterwards I was sent an email 'congratulating' me by the head of department on the outcome. The complaint was anonymous but I was openly copied in among several other people. This was my only contact or support from anyone in the department about this.\n\nPartly this is just to vent and partly to say that OP you are not alone. So many departments and universities get away with shitty behaviour in this country. I am, on balance, very lucky with how things have turned out although they could have taken an easier route. I do plan however on giving my department both barrels when I leave (hopefully soon).",

          "text": "Gosh I'm sorry to hear this. There are so many open secrets at universities, particularly with regard to unwanted and unwarranted contact. The guy who harassed me was not allowed to solely supervise female students at any level; EVERYBODY knew what he was like but he was a rising star and so left alone. \n\nIronically, one of the reasons I chose a British institution over an American one is because it was quicker to get a PhD. All of my US-based friends are literally aghast I could have drifted so long with no formal support as there are so many more layers of support and checks there. \n\nThank you for sharing your story. I wish you all the best for your future endeavors!",

              "text": "Yes I have heard the same thing about American institutions and certainly the committee structure seems to mitigate against it.\n\nThe reason they went after this guy was because he wasn't publishing and was old. There is still a young guy who publishes and its notorious for hitting on young female grad students. I'm pretty sure that wouldn't fly in the States but maybe I am wrong.\n\nThey basically used me to get rid of someone they didn't like. They couldn't care less about me.",

      "text": "I'm sorry to hear about your situation, contending with mental health issues, loss of family and the academic situation... it wouldn't have been pleasant.\n\nI wonder if it would be difficult for you to get a resolution that you want. If you received a diagnosis from a doctor regarding your MH difficulties, did you communicate this to their student disability service? It would have constituted an official notification and they would be required to make accommodations based on that.\n\nThe universities in the UK that I'm familiar with require a primary and secondary supervisor. Did you have one during this process?\n\nWere you doing your PhD full or part-time? If it was full-time, when did your supervisor leave? During your write up years, had your funding finished and you were on the university's write-up fees? Did you pay fees/write-up fees, or did you not after your enrolment finished? They might argue that you left then.\n\nWhere are (or where were you) you within the University -- you said a colleague advocated for you? Are you working at your PhD centre, or have you moved on and they advocated for you from there?Did you inform them of your ongoing MH crisis and bereavement via an official channel?\n\nDid you sign anything, or tick any boxes or agree in an email anything to do with the loan? There were probably Ts and Cs for that and not paying probably won't help this.\n\nIt sounds like you have a 3 year PhD and had to complete within 5; you hit year five and they gave you an exemption for 2 semesters as it wasn't done. Depending on how much you told and engaged with them, what should they have done? The alternative they found wasn't suitable (sexually harassed you), but if you didn't find your own, or make suggestions? I've seen that there aren't many people with specialist overlap in a lab. Also, they probably didn't know what happened to you personally.\n\nIf you asked them to take you back, who would supervise you (or would you be facing the same issue)? Is your data still relevant if its a few years old, or would you have to recollect? Are you subject to any penalities with your funder? Would it be better, if possible to transfer to your former supervisor's institution, if they are working/happy to support you? As you've left academia, would you be happy converting back to an MPhil and submitting your work with some amendments that way?\n\nI'm really sorry to hear of your experiences and my condolences for your family.",

I am also of the opinion that I am unlikely to get the resolution I would ideally like, but I also know that if I don't at least look into options then it will just continue to burn a hole in my brain. I guess this is all just the first step in that process, whatever the eventual outcome.\n\nThank you again for such a thoughtful and comprehensive reply.",
