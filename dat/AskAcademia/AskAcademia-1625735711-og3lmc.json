  "title:": "[Request for Feedback] I built an academic literature search engine/exploration tool.",
  "text": "A couple months ago I released my free/open academic literature search engine, [Inciteful.xyz](https://Inciteful.xyz). Long story short I am a computer engineer with wide ranging interests and not an academic and so would love feedback from real academics who think about this day in and day out :)\u00a0 \n\nAt its core Inciteful uses citations to enable the user to explore and discover academic literature.\u00a0 Currently there are two different tools.\u00a0 The first tool is what I call the \"[Paper Discovery](https://inciteful.xyz/p)\" tool.\u00a0 With this tool you begin the search with a seed paper or group of papers (you can upload a bibtex file). Then it builds a network of papers based on citations and runs a series of graph network analysis algorithms against it to recommend similar articles, important articles, prominent authors, institutions, journals etc.\u00a0 From there you can iteratively add new papers to your search, this makes the search more targeted and your results more interesting.\u00a0 After you are done, you can export all of the results into a bibtex file for future reference.\u00a0\n\nThe second tool, which I just released yesterday, is what I am calling the \"[Literature Connector](https://inciteful.xyz/c)\".\u00a0 With this tool, you enter two papers and it gives you an interactive visualization on how the two papers are connected.\u00a0 From here you can filter the papers, view common keywords, etc.\u00a0 What differentiates this tool is its ability to quickly construct the graph, allowing for rapid feedback to the user and a more pleasant interactive experience.\u00a0 The papers you discover here can be used as the seed for a Paper Discovery search.\u00a0 \n\nWhen doing research you often stumble across a few different papers that seem interesting but don't seem to directly talk to one another in the literature. Closing these gaps and connecting disparate ideas are often the places where you can make a significant contribution to your field.  It's also great for interdisciplinary research! \n\nInciteful was built off the backs of free and open metadata (from Microsoft Academic, Crossref, OpenCitations, and others) and I am paying it forward by doing the same with Inciteful.\u00a0 So anyone, anywhere can use it whenever they wish.\u00a0 Also, if you like the tool, please tell your friends as that is the best way your can help! \n\nI'm actively working on it so if anyone has any feedback, please just send me a message! Thanks!",

      "text": "That's a really neat tool! Being able to visualise with graphs is extremely powerful, but I'm wondering if people outside of IT (and a chunk of STEM) would feel the same about graphs?\n\nI think adding a small sticky feedback form at the bottom of your website (like just a message field+ an optional email field) would facilitate your feedback collection a lot, as it would nudge people to express themselves on the run. Also maybe providing an initial sample of DOI's to visualise the functionalities of the tool even faster for a first-time visitor, without the need to personally go through one's papers to take a random sample just to try it out (we're also not expecting the bars to propose suggestions as we're typing, so most users would think that they have to go through the process of copy/paste).\n\nAs for the graphs, I think it would be a bit more intuitive if they were explicitly directed (i.e. to know which paper is citing the other).\n\nFor the performances, you may be over-worrying about the speed of your graphs generation. For academics specially, I feel like they are not too demanding in terms of real-time outputting because they're just used to being patient in front of systems, take for instance plagiarism detection tools. I think it would also spur some implicit doubt if results were immediate, and it would make the experience feel like we're just browsing through a pre-built database, negating all the work that is actually happening under the hood. In other words, I believe that your tool's context is a bit far from requiring extremely fast processing and it's doing really great now! hats to you.\n\nThe frontend is dazzling <3 what framework is this built with? as for the UX, I did personally not encounter any bugs, but as a random user, the only issue is that I feel a bit lost when I get the graph and see so many tables while having a hard time to link them with what's on the graph. I think it may help if the tables were in a single tabbed parent component (so that we can know exactly what table we're looking at, and we wouldn't have to scroll that far for the tables at the bottom. Finally, a walkthrough video (maybe even on the front-page, or a popup, or anything) would go a long way in guiding your users. So for me the only challenge really is in the native interpretability of what's presented (without going through the docs and FAQs and all).\n\nOn the About page, you're stating that you're reluctant about the idea of charging for the service because your data source was free. Why though? the level of transformation and parsing you're applying on that data is well too elaborate for \"Inciteful\" to be just that data you collected. You wouldn't be selling that data, but the operations you're applying on them so personally I don't think there would be any issue with you monetising your project some way or another, maybe not at this point if you're trying to grow your user-base, but it is definitely worth its cashflow (this category of tools usually offer a limited subset of the results, with the rest being behind a paywall). Even if just to make this project self-sufficient. 6000$ per year + all the time you're putting into it is quite a hefty sum for something you're managing on your own. You're ought to have more confidence in what you built, it's really huge, you just need to package it properly for the public's eyes!\n\nThis is definitely not the small project, can you share a bit of your experience, how you went through it and how the tech-stack you're using evolved through time (and your current tech-stack too if that's not too much asked)? (I'm into computer engineering too, that's why i'm interested in this kind of details x))",

          "text": "Thanks a ton for taking the time to provide so much feedback!  I'll try to respond to what I can here.  \n\n1) There has been some good feedback here about how best to present the tool to users who are new to the platform and/or have different expectations than I do.  I like the ideas of sample DOI's, examples and videos to introduce the user more gradually rather than just dumping them into the tool.  \n\n2) Your comment about differing expectations for performances is a good one.  Insights like this are why it's always good to hear from your end user :) \n\n3) The underlying tech stack is a combination of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Rust.](https://www.rust-lang.org/)  The main front-end interactivity is done with Vue, the styling is done with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), the graph visualizations are done with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) and the back-end API is Rust.  If you really want to get into the nitty gritty then you should read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kfiaqn/just_wanted_to_say_thanks_to_the_rust_community/) from /r/rust as it goes into more detail than anyone here wants to read :) \n\n4) Regarding charging, I'm lucky enough right now to be able to self fund this without a problem and I don't need to turn it into a business to live the lifestyle I want to live.  I originally built this because I didn't have access to the tools that were behind huge paywalls/university subscriptions and so I want to make this fully accessible to everyone.  Honestly I'd love it if it gets to the point where it's too much of a burden to self fund. At that point I'll try to go to some of the larger library systems/foundations to get a check for operational expenses while still keeping the tool free for everyone.  I'm also pretty allergic to putting any sort of advertising on the site.  So frankly, for me, the best thing anyone can do is to tell their friends about it.",
