  "text": "Hello, I recently submitted my master thesis and in my surprise, I got a 30% similarity report from work submitted to the university. This is obviously my work since I reused a lot of the introduction for my thesis from a research project proposal that I made for another assignment and built upon it, but for the same project. Should I be fine, or do the supervisors expect me to paraphrase my own work and write different introduction? I am a bit worried since my similarity score was around 7% when checked online, and now it flags my previous work...",

The issue here is you submitted a piece of work for a grade and now you're submitting the same work again for a different grade. It doesn't work like that. Each piece of work should be an original novel intellectual contribution. There are exceptions to this, based on how the course is run, but in general recycling your work verbatim is a no.",
