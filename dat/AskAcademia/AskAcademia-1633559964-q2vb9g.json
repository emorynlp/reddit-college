  "text": "I am really on the fence about trying to stay in academia.  Adjunct jobs pay close to minimum wage in my area and I found out a few months before I graduated that our field was over saturated.  I'm a social scientist and I became one to talk to write about people.  As it turns out, I love writing stuff for popular publication and don't really like publishing academic articles.  I want to continue to write, both articles and books.  I have an idea for my first book, which would basically be a basic book about concepts, but at some point, I would want to interview people. If I was in academia, I would need to get an IRB to do my second and third book idea.  Is there some equivalent for people with PhDs who have decided to leave academia?  Is this a bad idea that could open me up to a myriad of negative consequences? I don't plan on being employed by any kind of an organization either.",

Then the human-subjects issues are the companies responsibility.\n\nOne such resercher testified before the Senate today. Apparently the in-house researchers discovered that the companies basic business practices were causing severe social strive in society globally, and that one of their products was causing depression in millions of teen girls. I wonder what an academic review board would have to say about that research program!",

The IRB at my grad institution is terrible and nobody, not even my advisor, want to be a PI for some research I wanted to do  on Covid.  I thought I found someone else at an insitution with an easy IRB and he flaked.  I'm gonna try one more time to see if I can get a PI already working on Covid, but I'm not optimistic.",

      "text": "I think the issue you may be missing here is that research requiring IRB approval is by definition higher risk and in order to get IRB approval you may well need significant additional resources to cover information security and also insurance amongst other things. Journalism provides a number of exemptions to research requirements but again you'd probably need insurance and possibly an agreement with a publisher in order to qualify as a journalist in this context.",

That includes just talking to them, which is was journalists do all the time with much less scrutiny. I honestly didn't need any money for any extra security when I wrote my dissertation.",

Generally ethics is something that is taken seriously and IRBs are part of that ethics process. This is according to my friend who is in social sciences and sitting next to me. \n\nIf you are just interviewing for a book that is not academic in nature, perhaps looking at journalistic ethics and standards may prove helpful?",

There have been a lot of things I've done lately that have had some very negative consequences I wasn't expecting, so I want to make sure I'm just not missing anything.  I'll definitely look up journalistic standards though, I have a friend I can talk to about it who I've been talking to about my book idea.",

Social science scholars often assume interviews will be anonymous while journalism tends to identify sources unless there's a compelling reason not to.\n\nI don't think you're opening yourself up to any particular negative consequences.\n\nIf you decide you do want to go through an IRB, finding a collaborator who is affiliated with a school would be a good way to go.",
