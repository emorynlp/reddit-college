  "text": "Please. If you tell your students to keep their presentations at a certain length, do not praise the ones who go above the set time limit by half an hour and praise their work for its depth. This has happened to me second time now. My professor asks me to cover one of the most controversial and comprehensive subjects in social sciences in 10 minutes and rolls their eyes for it not having elaborated enough in certain aspects while praising the 40-minute-though-supposed-to-be-10-minute presentation of my classmate for covering more on the same subject.\n\nIf there are any professors reading this; please don't do this. Some students put a lot of work into making the damn presentation as concise as possible and literally rehearse a few times so that they do not go over the time limit. Covering more by going waaaay above the limit you yourself set is not something to be encouraged. Nor is it fair.",

One way to think about it is to use your speech impairment to your advantage -- if it means you have to be more deliberate, then that's a built-in reason to keep things more clear and concise, something we all struggle with and many people abuse just by talking fast. Talk with your professors, rehearse your presentations, and look into groups where others may deal with similar concerns e.g., the National Stuttering Association. I've known a few, and seen many more, people who have speech impairments who regularly give great talks. It may be more difficult, but it can certainly be done so don't be too worried or get discouraged.",

These are students at multiple different universities all reporting that they\u2019ve got one or two professors who don\u2019t respect the time limits. Perhaps professors like these are why you\u2019re getting so many emails about staying within scheduled boundaries.\n\nThe fact is: whether or not OP is upset over their grade, there are professors who do not immediately cut students after they\u2019ve been presenting too long. I\u2019m not sure if they outright praise them, but it\u2019s common enough for others to mention in their comments on this subject.",

As far as I know, he still goes over and they\u2019ve never changed the course to a 90 minute class so...we tried. I\u2019ve warned a lot of fellow students that that class is great, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t schedule anything immediately after if you choose to take it. \n\nI\u2019m not arguing about if OP is exaggerating, more so that you implied that professors very rarely (or never) allow students to go over on presentations or run their own classes over time. It\u2019s very common, unfortunately, regardless of if it\u2019s to the extent of OPs claims. And, from anecdotal experience, some professors are taking advantage of online classes to do this.",
