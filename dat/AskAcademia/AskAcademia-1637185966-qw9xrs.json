  "title:": "TA dealing with a condescending student",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nHave any of you had to deal with a condescending student? How did you deal with it (or did you?)?\n\nI  (30F) have a student (19M) this semester who emails me frequently with questions that have always seemed to insinuate that I didn't know what I  was talking about. But I assumed I was being oversensitive or paranoid, so I have always answered him promptly and cheerfully. However, today,  the student got in a long back and forth with me (over email) about a basic statistical analysis in which he is FULLY incorrect, but has continued doubling down no matter what I say (or how many resources I  send him). Finally he wrote back something along the lines of \"fine I  still think it means xyz but I guess I just won't include how we got our results.\" To be clear, he literally added a new statistical test that is not part of the assignment, and makes no sense with the data.\n\nThe last email especially was honestly very rude, and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nI'm leaning towards just leaving it alone, since he apparently cares so much about having the last word, but I'm worried about grading his final paper if he continues to double down on this. Has anyone else encountered something like this, and what did you do?",

I'd recommend this as a CYA move regardless.\n\nI had a student a about 3 years ago that I caught plagiarizing. I emailed my direct supervisor about it the night before I returned papers. When the student questioned me on it, he became so hostile that he tried to corner me so I couldn't leave, then demanded to follow me to my next class. When I refused, he went immediately the department chair and told him that I'd failed him on \"common knowledge.\" (It was a straight copy and paste from the internet.) By the time I came out of my next class, I already had an email and a missed call telling me I needed to see the department chair. If I hadn't already given my direct supervisor a heads up, there would have been an issue. \n\nIf there's a potential problem, ALWAYS CYA and let your supervisor know.",

You don't need to win an argument with them and you don't need to prove anything to them. You are right, you explained it to them, and their mind is closed.

I had to do that once because (absurdly) a student apparently complained about me wearing flip flops to class. I know that seems trite and I hope it doesn't come across as a belittling example. Anyway in that case the class took it well and I didn't have any further problems with them. A silly case I know, but there just a little \"I'm actually at work, not talking sh*t in the pub\" helped.\n\nHopefully things improve for you soon.",

It isn't TA's responsibility to ensure all the students following the lecture, the OP tried to help but faced repeated arguments. That contact address is to be used when you have serious questions or urgent issues not for random questions. You can email them to set up meetings to go over methods you do not understand. I don't think it is the OP's responsibility to ensure the student apply right method for their assignment, when the student gets back the grade it'll be shown where and why they are mistaken. I find it super strange everyone thinks a TA should reply random questions via the emails, that isn't TA's duty and they aren't online support. There should be boundaries, you can't reply each question all day and online education isn't an excuse, it has been discontinued in many places, which is hybrid at the worst case.",

But I assumed I was being oversensitive or paranoid, so I have always answered him promptly and cheerfully.\n\nI (33M) manage the TAs in our school and that's something I regularly observe and have to intervene on. The female TAs (or at least female presenting, without making any assumptions) tend to second guess themselves a lot more than the others, who tend to be a lot more combative in their beliefs. Both approaches are incorrect, because in one case you let the student walk over you and in the other (combative) you let them waste your time. I second some of the other comments here which say that back and forth e-mails are pointless and give the impression that you are a resource to be used at will by the students. If a student asks you a question, state a definitive answer (double check with colleagues if needed) and make it clear that it is the end of it - if they want to negotiate, argue or whatever that's what office hours, labs, seminars, etc. are for. Those students are far from brave enough to make this kind of insinuation to your face, in public.\n\nIn your specific case, if the professor is supportive, I would forward them the entire conversation with a warning like \"heads up in case this student approaches you because I have had to deal with them on this matter\".",

In my case, I suspect the student I'm dealing with has some narcissistic traits, which seems to be the case with the student you are dealing with, too.\n\nI personally think the best way to deal with narcissistic people is to understand how their minds work. The bottom line is they seem to be very confident, but they are not; they are extremely insecure, and are always craving for admiration, because their self-value depends on how much admiration they get --they will not settled down with just being validated, they need to be admired. They have a very unstable and polarized self-image, they feel either superior or inferior, but there is no middle-ground. They greatly fear rejection and disapproval, because that makes them feel worthless. And this last bit is what you can use on your favor.\n\nAs you mentioned, they will always try to have the last word, and if you don't engage with them, they will try to [bait you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HNK07Khk9w).  Note that if he is engaging with you that means he is trying to get ***your*** admiration. Making clear you don't feel any admiration towards him but instead disapprove his behavior will be hard on him, and is something you can do.\n\nMy advice is to be assertive and straight forward. Tell him that you have already provided the explanations that were pertinent but he seems to give no credence to the things you are trying to teach him. Also that if he thinks he cannot learn anything from you, he is free to directly ask the course director for help. But if he is willing to listen to you, you are willing to help.\n\nFinally, you can always tell him that you consider the tone of his emails to be rude and to address you more respectfully. Finally, just wanted to reiterate that showing your disapproval to his behavior will be hurtful for him.",
