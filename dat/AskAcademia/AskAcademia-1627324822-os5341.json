      "text": "I try to write back a brief letter along the lines of \"I'm honored that this article will be published in Insert Journal Name Here and look forward to seeing it published.\" Admittedly, when acceptances have come during busy times, I've forgotten to do this.\n\nMy sense is that responding to an acceptance letter is a good idea, but that it's not a major issue if you don't (it won't change your outcome if you don't respond, and journals have so much other correspondence that it's unlikely someone would think about or remember that you didn't send a reply).\n\nYou do note that you want to thank the editor for the decision. I would advise reframing this. Publishing your article is not a favor, and thanking them for accepting the article implies that it is. You can thank the editor for something else, if relevant (e.g., if the editor provided guidance when you were deciding whether to submit to the journal, if they provided praise for your article), or otherwise respond to acknowledge and celebrate the acceptance.",
