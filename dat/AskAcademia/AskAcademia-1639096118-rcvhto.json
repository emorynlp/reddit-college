  "text": "is ultimately a good thing, I guess. But it also seems a little out of hand with unrealistic expectations and unfair resentment toward the offices that provide counseling.\n\nAre other campuses experiencing this?\n\nI was in school a little over 20 years ago. People barely knew therapy services were offered on campus, let alone having any opinion about them.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just old but I can\u2019t help being a little judgmental about Gen Z\u2019s neediness, lack of self-sufficiency, and entitlement. Other than passing class if I put in effort, I had zero expectations from my school when I was a student. Now it\u2019s expected to be nonstop fun and entertainment, an easy A, and a psychiatric ward all at once. It\u2019s getting absurd or I\u2019m just becoming an old crank.",

      "text": "People who could have been amazing academics decades ago may not have been able to because they lacked mental health services.   \nYou said that demand for more mental health services is a good thing. I agree, but I don't think the demand is unrealistic. If a university's goal is to produce more high quality capable academics, we should be willing to invest in students from the ground-up. \n\nAnecdotally, I don't think gen z's are as needy orr insufficent as you describe them.   \nFrom my experience, they are just as capable and smart as any otherr generation.",

      "text": "I did my first degree and PhD 15 years ago. 5 years ago I went back to school for a master's. I was absolutely astounded at how hard students were working compared to when I was an UG. Even in the middle of the night in the less busy parts of the semester the library always had a lot of students in it. In addition, I was really struck at the salaries many of those students were accepting as they graduated. I got offered a job from my UG which I didn't take that was \u00a316,500. 15 years on from when I turned down that job students were taking jobs that paid around \u00a318k-\u00a322k while the cost of living had gone up at least 50%. I rented a room for \u00a3175pm as an UG, doing my masters I was paying \u00a3450pm and that was a steal. On top of that students were paying massively higher tuition fees than I did.\n\nStudents now are facing enormous debt, incomes that haven't increased anywhere close to in line with the cost of living, and add to that climate change, a pandemic, the rolling back of civil rights if you're in the US, the loss of opportunity if you're in the UK (other countries have their issues), a housing crisis, and so much more. I can't blame them for having mental health issues.\n\nAt the same time, historically universities took on almost exclusively white upper middle class men whose parents would have gone to university and their parents before. People who didn't fit in either didn't get in or were kicked out. Now universities are far more diverse but increasing diversity means providing support to people whose families have never had access to university, or who otherwise would have been excluded historically, and who don't have the same support systems that privileged, wealthy white men have.",

      "text": "I think there are two issues here; firstly universities having to act as mental health support providers isn't good - in UK, this is where NHS clearly needs much more investment so professionals can help these individuals. But also...why is there increased demand? This is a very different generation of students and I take your point re entitlement as I have experienced this with some students. But they have so much more debt, increased living costs, it's going to be harder for them to find jobs when they graduate than it was for us...and then there's the pandemic. I think they have many good reasons to need more support!",

I guess part of it is that at a large school there will always be a limit to the mental health services that can be provided at large.\n\n>I think they have many good reasons to need more support!\n\n\nThis is true. It was true for my generation and all the ones before mine too. The \u201csuffer in silence\u201d mentality is pretty well ingrained in me, to be honest. And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing, just how it is.",
