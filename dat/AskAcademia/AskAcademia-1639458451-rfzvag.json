  "text": "I\u2019m kinda freaking out because my article got published on Sage as Sage Choice, which is their version of open access. But from what I read about the process, you have to e-mail them to get it then pay before publishing. I never did any of that, so I\u2019m worried they\u2019re going to come after me for fees I can\u2019t pay or make me retract my article. Anyone have any ideas?",

Also check with your library in case there\u2019s agreement between your institution and the publisher that you\u2019re not aware of.",

If they don't have enough open-access papers it will hurt their impact factor.",
