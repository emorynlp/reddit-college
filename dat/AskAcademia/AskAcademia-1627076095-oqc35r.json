  "text": "If someone ended up not going into academia but had substantial corporate work experience beforehand, could they use a PhD in something like strategy or organizational behavior to go right back into industry where they left off? Or would the 5 year gap in experience effectively kill their corporate career?",

      "text": "It's a risky proposition, but not for the reason you think. In a PhD program, you'll be trained to do research, publish, and teach; so the whole time you're there, you're thinking \"This is so stupid. I can't wait to get done with this so I can go back into industry.\" That's a tough mindset to deal with when the chips are down and you inevitably want to quit the program. If you decide to go through with it anyway, you can never tell your advisors that's your plan. They're not in this business to train executives. They're in this business to train researchers. Nobody will want to work with you if your relationship ends at graduation. Some DBA programs exist that are more than happy to have you go back into industry. Some have executives doing both things at the same time - school and work.",

      "text": "I don't personally think a PhD is valued outside academia, doesn't matter if your PhD is in business, science, engineering, etc. PhDs are for doing research. Employers will never look at your resume and be like \"Oh wow, what a smart person, I definitely want to hire them for a high position and pay them a lot of money, that qualification really will add a lot of value to our company\". The truth is, if you can do a Master's degree instead, then do that. I have found that Master's degrees are value way more in industry as opposed to PhDs. A PhD won't necessarily kill your career because of the gap in time, but because it doesn't really add much value to you as a prospective employee.\n\nI wish it would be different, but as many employers with less qualifications than me have told me many times: a PhD is only useful for doing research. Companies don't need to do research, they just need to do simple work that any simple-minded person is capable of doing. All they want to know is: (1) can you work in a corporate environment and pretend like you give a shit about building rapport with clients or co-workers? (2) Are you ok with doing repetitive boring work and probably doing a lot of overtime whenever your boss feels like giving you overtime? -- if the answer to both questions is Yes, then you are made for corporate. If not, look elsewhere",

Hard to know if you're Australian, British or American from this, as having lived and worked in all 3 countries they are full of sad little ignoramuses like you who think their country is better than everyone else's and that their racism, xenophobia and bigotry is justified because of their imagined superiority. Perhaps look closer to home as to where \"be white, don't be foreign, speak the language\" is the prevailing culture.",
