  "title:": "Google scholar linking to dlib.hust.edu.vn: What is it?",
  "text": "In my current literature search on numerical simulation of mechanical systems, frequently Google Scholar gives me PDF links to [dlib.hust.edu.vn](https://dlib.hust.edu.vn). It demands that I log in using either \"Microsoft Office 365 Authentication\" or \"DSpace Username and Password\".\n\nThis has me concerned on several levels:\n\n* If the PDF is behind a login, why does google scholar even know about it?\n* When clicking \"Microsoft Office 365 Authentication\" I am not redirected to a Microsoft login site, but within \"asso.hust.edu.vn\" as origin. \n\nThe latter part especially has be concerned. I have two possible explanations for it:\n\n* Usage of the website requires an on-site Office account which I don't have (I am basically on the other side of the world), so Google Scholar sending me to the website is a Google Scholar bug.\n* It is a website fishing for Microsoft login credentials.\n\nAny idea what that website is and why Google Scholar links to it for PDFs?",
