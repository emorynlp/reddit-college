  "title:": "Is a PhD / academia not a good path for a generalist?",
  "text": "I tried searching for this kind of advice but didn't find anything so helpful, so I'm posting here.\n\nIn my undergrad, I majored in psychology with a good amount of math, computer science, and humanities courses. After a few years traveling and doing non-academic things, I'm now getting my Masters in religious studies, with a focus in East Asian religions, while working in a computational neuroscience lab on the side.\n\nI've loved each of these stages of my life, and think I'm happiest when I have a healthy amount of variety what I get to think about. But I feel like this breadth doesn't lend itself to a career path. On a gut level, academia as a whole still feels like thing that fits my personality and interests the best, but I don't know if my interests are too stubbornly diverse to go into a PhD and potentially academia.\n\nIn the course of trying these various disciplines out, I have realized a few things:\n\n* I seem to get tired of one topic or one discipline very easily and really crave novelty / variety. Even though I'm in a religion studies masters, I can only really tolerate taking two religion courses or else I starting getting a little miserable. But a mix of religion, philosophy, psych, and something math-y has been keeping me pretty content. (In the past when I was a math major and then a psych major, I also was pretty unhappy when I was taking only courses in those departments.)\n* I do have some underlying driving questions. In particular,  my ultimate goal is approximately understanding how humans behave and think and how people's lives can be improved on a psychological level. That's essentially the only reason why I'm doing religious studies right now, in service of that goal. But if I pursued a PhD, it'd almost certainly be something in psychology, probably clinical psychology. I want to be able to think about this question in a rigorous way that it seems like only academics have the freedom to, which makes academia seem like the route I lean toward most. I just wonder if, given my track record of constantly switching from subject to subject, I am a prime candidate to find a PhD project interesting for a year or two and then get really sick of the narrowness and demotivated. I know that this happens to a certain extent to everyone, but it seems like some people are better at pushing through it? And I don't know if I've had that fortitude in the past.\n\nI know it's impossible to tell how any individual will find doing a PhD. I guess I would just like some advice if there are signals that I might be more or less likely than average to make it through a PhD. Are there people in academia who successfully are able to be generalists and draw from many different disciplines and to be thinking in a variety of different ways? Or if you really want to succeed in academia, do you really just have to specialize and only very marginally draw inspiration from side reading (which is not necessarily bad either! Just hard to tell what that will feel like in the concrete).\n\nAnyway, if anyone has any insights, that'd be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :)",

      "text": "Do you get tired of subject or type of work?\n\nIf it's subjects.... yeah, frankly, you're going to have a bad time. You're not only focused in one discipline, you're focused on one piece of one question within a sub discipline for years. You might have a few related projects but you can't realistically hope around like that. Your best bet is probably keeping one as a hobby -- I did this with my college minor. \n\nIf it's type of work (writing, reading dense documents, coding, math, teaching), academia might actually be a good fit because you do have to switch between a lot of types of work. I always had really diverse interests and part of what I really like about academia is that you often are involved in every piece of a project and doing lots of things, so when I'm fed up with my code, there's probably a paper I should be working on instead and vice versa.",

I would say that it\u2019s not so much discipline as it is about type of thinking + scope maybe? \n\nAs for type of thinking, I think you\u2019re right that academia actually includes a diversity of different activities and skills, and that is quite appealing. \n\nMaybe scope is the other key kind of diversity? Like what I like about doing both neuroscience and religion is that I get to think about super granular things (computational models of specific cognitive functions) and then more high-level stuff (what motivates people? what frameworks do people live by?) And maybe my fear is that the PhD is really heavily the former without much stimulation on the latter side? At least until you\u2019re a old professor who can pontificate about stuff and have people care about it?",

You'll find plenty of people game to have those conversations in academia at happy hour or coffee procrastination hour and some of it sneaks into grant applications or paper intros, but the day to day work is going to be chipping away at something much smaller. It's probably worth considering what you want to get from your job vs the rest of your life -- would reading about big topics outside your field be enough? or a book club? listening to lectures? blogging?",

              "text": "I actually have a contrary assessment to mediocre-spice. Probably 80-90% of my time is doing the same stuff: reading, writing, teaching. But what I'm reading about, writing about or teaching about can differ wildly from day to day. I could be reading about animal movement and behavior, writing a paper about organ transplantation, and teaching spatial analysis. Now, it helps that my discipline is very broad and amenable to engagement with a wide range of topics, but that's evidence that academia isn't always topically constrained.\n\nI'm not sure that I'd call myself a generalist, but I'm probably as close as one can be. It's pretty essential that I have that sort of latitude and I've been happy so far.",

So you'd say that the variety that you have is more a product of the fact that your particular field is pertinent to a variety of different other topics? Maybe it seems like some disciplines have variety in the type of stuff you're doing (maybe science where in addition to reading / writing, you're also coding, running experiments, etc.) and then other disciplines have variety in the topics (maybe where what you're doing day-to-day is more limited to reading/writing but over a larger breadth of topics).",

And in my experience, the generalists are typically the best at what they do, for they have a broader perspective, allowing them to not get stuck in the dominant thoughts of a single field.\n\nNow, if you just meant that in your PhD you need to focus on a single topic for a while and that that usually involves doing research from within a single discipline, then sure. But after that, it's certainly possible (and often fruitful) to branch out.\n\nThis is not to say that this is an easy path to take. There is so much to read, and only limited time in the day, that it is hard enough to keep up with the latest literature in one field, let alone several, which means you still have to make choices. And with the current pressure to publish, there is still some expectation of a steady stream of results. \n\nBut though difficult, I know plenty of people with PhDs that are working in academia who still try and are well read in multiple fields of study, so it's certainly possible.",

But then I think that in turn maybe depends on the fantasy vs reality of what being a professor is like and how likely it is that you'll achieve the goal in the way that you want. So maybe it seems like a potential pitfall is people being convinced of the goal (being a professor seems great) but then not having an accurate sense of either what that's like or how likely it is that they'll achieve it.",

      "text": "I can definitely relate to this. I consider myself simutaneously a generalist and a specialist. What I mean by that is I have a core topic that I invest in, but I branch out to other stuff when the interest strikes. I even branch into other fields sometimes for fun, and into different mediums aside from academic journals. Why? Well, the questions I ask change, and I don't believe in answering them all the same way. I also think journals are a shit way to share our work. Openness to ideas and ways of exploring them is the foundation of creative problem solving. I also have ADHD, which I didn't know until pretty recently, so like you, I'm very interested in something for a year or two, and then the boredom really kills after. So I keep myself entertained by basically doing whatever I want (the benefits of tenure).\n\nSo, you say your goal is:\n\nmy ultimate goal is approximately understanding how humans behave and think and how people's lives can be improved on a psychological level.\n\nThat's really big. You mention that you have an interest in religion, and there is neurological evidence that having spritual beliefs provides long term positive benefits in life that those without them don't have. What you're talking about is apparently a whole new interdisciplinary field https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3968360/\n\nSo my question to you is, do you need a PhD to accomplish your goal? If so, then go for it. I don't know anything about that field other than what I pulled from that article, but just a quick skim of it it looks like you might look into cognitive neuroscience. \n\nA lot of people are going to tell you that interdisciplinary work is rubbish. In the case of academia and tenure and publishing and all that, that's very true. But your question isn't how do I become a tenure track professor. Your question is how do I discover ways to make life better for people psychologically through religion/spirituality? And that can be accomplished far outside of academia.",

What do you want to do with your PhD? \n\nIf the PhD is something you really desire/actual need, the goal is finding a flexible advisor. Someone who has students who work on a variety of topics and tends to do collaboration with other departments.\n\nA PhD needs a theme. If you can spin your variations interests with an overall goal, you can become an export in that goal.\n\nI\u2019m getting my PhD using a niche device. Funding is based on the whims of industry so it\u2019s not uncommon for PhD students in my lab to have to dabble in various areas to meet the criteria of the funding source, all usually using this device. Our advisor is good at figuring out a common theme to tie the research together. His students are very successful at large tech companies so I would say this is a success method. It helps that we aim to publish at top tier conferences/journals. It\u2019s hard for a committee to say you haven\u2019t become an expert when you have several papers published at the best conferences/journals in the field.",

Being broader in your interests and endeavors definitely seems more possible at that point.

So you have to pay your dues before you have the freedom. I'm curious, considering that you do get bored of things after some time, how did you pay your dues enough to get to the point of being a tenured professor?",

If you are Media studies, you might also study French media, but you will teach media studies classes. So your idea of academia is not really lining up with the realities of the job. Your research can do a lot, but you will have to be trained and proficient in a main field, in which your comps will be based, and in which you will teach. You will go to the conferences of your field mainly, and meet people in your field. You will submit to journals in your field, and publish with book publishers who publish your field. Your book will have to sit on a shelf. Is it French studies or media studies? It might appeal to a broader audience, but it's still going to be pegged as one thing.",

PhD programs allow you time to think and develop your ideas but ultimately you have to write a dissertation that is focused, with a clear contribution to a specific aspect of the field. You would also need to talk about this dissertation for years on end and people will identify you as an expert in some subfield related to that. Also, browse the listings for tenure track jobs- they want people with a clear consistent research agenda.

But it isn't the same as being an expert in both disciplines. You're just as specialised as anyone else and no more general.\n\nA generalist isn't a researcher almost by definition these days because they don't have any expert knowledge in one area. If you do a PhD, any PhD, you're no longer a generalist. And doing multiple PhDs is rare or impossible, depending on circumstance.\n\nIf OP can't bear to stick to one niche area long enough to get a PhD in it then academia isn't for them.

In university, I ended up studying computer science, math, physics and cognitive science and doing research on math and evolutionary psychology. I started a masters in quantum computing but got tired and moved to a cancer research center to write papers on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. Around that time, I found a creative and exploring outlet by running an [academic blog](https://egtheory.wordpress.com/) that mostly became famous for its more philosophical content.\n\nAfter sometime, I realized that I couldn't have a career thinking about random things without getting a PhD so I went to Oxford. Just recently, I finished my DPhil (their version of a PhD) in Computer Science working on evolutionary biology.\n\nSo I was also torn on topics of interests, but I combined it with building a depth of knowledge in a given technical field (in my case, the mathamatics underlying theoretical computer science and evolutionary game theory). Now I can apply that tool in all kinds of places.\n\nSince the intersection of psychology, religion, and math interests you, here is a [pretty old paper of mine](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0041) that you might enjoy.\n\nAll said and done: if you want to maximize your chances in academia (and even then have super slim chances of success, since academia is a bad job market) then you should focus. But if you want to use your PhD to have fun then be a generalist. As long as you can form good research questions on your own and put in the work required, you'll do fine.",

I used to be a fox and a kind professor warned me about it, and - after a year or two - I started following the advice and actually made some real scientific progress I'm still proud of. Unlike the scattered little first-attempt \"blips\" I'd dropped before, that don't have much value - unless you build something longer-term and deepened-out on them. (\"Foxes\", to my mind, can also be exploiters and bluffers, jumping on ideas rather than doing the hard word. But they can also be honest but scattered, like I believe I was.)\n\nHowever, on the other side: You can be a hedgehog workng on something that naturally \"on an edge\" between methods fields and methods. Psychology is a pretty good place to be that. You can bring in all the fields of psychology which is already very wide behaviour, but also movbe towards biology/neuroscience, or applied stuff with AI or computers in general, or funky data analysis in general. Combinations could open up possibilities and produce meaningful progress, as long as you're working towards something theoretically coherent and consistent over time. Even if that umbrella is broad, that's OK, but you have to have a story - like \"how do psychological properties of forms of religion help/harm people and society?\" You could a zillion directions within that but I'd say you might be defining your research well enough to not just be a splatter. Then you could focus on aspects for specific projects and grants but they'd all build up into a coherent body of work.",

I'm in biomedical engineering/neuroscience and I'm working on what I think of as a really fox-y project, multisensory integration.\n\nAs a fox, it does feel like you're in a world of hedgehogs when you start on an academic path, but if you can find an advisor to help keep you interested and motivated, it can be really rewarding to be forced to do a deep dive into one topic. Also, many foxes are dedicated and very good BS artists, and a stint in academia will usually nip that in the bud (this happened to my dad). I am hoping to go in a more science communications & policy direction (in which it really helps to have a STEM PhD) following grad school, but I think learning the ways of the hedgehogs is a really important step for anyone dealing with scientists.",

      "text": ">Are there people in academia who successfully are able to be generalists and draw from many different disciplines and to be thinking in a variety of different ways?\n\nThere are definitely people in academia who are successfully interdisciplinary. This isn't just about their discipline but has to do with the **types of methods** that they use.\n\nI've listed some folks below who are well known in my field, who do interdisciplinary work :-)\n\n(Ex. Eric Rice \\[trained as a sociologist and social worker, director of USC center for AI & society\\], Rediet Abebe \\[algorithms for social good\\], Mor Namaan \\[studies social psych and also builds computational social systems\\], Duncan Watts \\[sociologist who also does network science\\], Douglas Hofstader \\[wrote Godel, Escher, Bach; talks about consciousness, math, physics\\], Clifford Nass \\[communications prof but highly affiliated with HCi and CS\\])\n\nMy field of work is at the intersection of computer science, design, sociology, and algorithmic fairness. In undergrad, I ended up doing a mixed major (human-computer interaction, design, and critical theory) and in order to do that, I had to write a research thesis where all of these fields intersect and formulate a problem. Although I had an untraditional major and wasn't a completely a STEM degree or a social science degree, I was accepted into several Computer Science PhD programs (that had professors who studied AI fairness, HCI, or social computing), a cognitive science program, and an Information School. There are several folks in my program that had degrees in Sociology, Urban Planning, Math, and even Demography.\n\nI think, ultimately, it depends on the professor who you want to work with and if their research interests align with yours. Alliances to discipline don't matter as much, as long as you display that you're capable of finishing the classes in their program (for instance, I definitely would not have gotten into CS programs if I took 0 CS classes in Undergrad) and that the professor's work speaks to you/they find that your research experience is relevant to theirs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I just wonder if, given my track record of constantly switching from subject to subject, I am a prime candidate to find a PhD project interesting for a year or two and then get really sick of the narrowness and demotivated. I know that this happens to a certain extent to everyone, but it seems like some people are better at pushing through it?\n\nThe thing about a PhD is that ***you're supposed*** ***to specialize, but this doesn't mean you have to be confined to a certain field for all of your work.*** If you feel burnout with a project, there's always another one you can start. If you hate working with a certain professor, you can always go shopping (within your department or when picking schools)  to find who fits your work style best and who is kind enough to guide you to reach your career goals. Another thing is, the benefit of specializing is that you can do collaborations with other folks in different fields and product high quality, cutting edge research. One good thing about having studied math or religious studies in your undergrad, but focusing on one of them, means that you can speak both languages fluently without spreading yourself too thin. The future is interdisciplinary. \n\nIMO, given your interests, I think you'd fit really well into a Cognitive Science (Pysch, Computational Neuroscience, Philosophy, Math). Find a department or school that respects interdisciplinary work or a professor who has the same interests. Don't think too hard about the discipline & let it bog you down and highlight the research questions that you want to ask.\n\nAnyways, I'm always open to chat OP! I'm in my first year of my PhD and am fresh out of the application process. PM me if you need anything :)",

A friend of mine is a Neuroscientist who does all kinds of experiments in insects and vertebrates (seals, ponies) and collaborates with a variety of other researchers in aligning fields, all related to vision, with a huge variety of methods.  \nApparently one of the feedbacks her hears most from committees is that this shows a lack of dedication to one project and science overall and makes his CV seem undecided, so he's often kicked from the list of potential candidates early on. Doesn't matter if we talk about funding or getting a tenured (or tenure-track) position. Him not binding himself to a small subfield is seen as disadvantage.  \nSome established researchers can afford that, which is partially because they already have tenure, so less pressure to \"fit into expectations \" and partially because they anyways only supervise others who do the research and are experts on their narrow project. So the supervisor only needs some general ideas and overview while others concentrate on the details of each sub project.\n\nI have the feeling one of these wide-range consulting companies might be a better fit for you, where they work on a variety of problems in all kinds of fields. There you could really become a versatile advisor that works on many different problems each year and don't have to narrow down your interests. But that's of course more problem solving that research.",

      "text": "I will go against the grain here and say that it is certainly possible to dabble in several broadly related disciplines, especially if you are using more or less the same tooling. I'm in bioinformatics and I work in projects ranging from ecology to agriculture to human health, and these are topics I personally decided upon and my PI encouraged exploration and thinking about what sort of scientist I want to be, rather than throw me a topic that's already decided upon and outlined in a grant and tell me to get working for 5 years like some PIs in my department. The unifying feature is computational analysis, since nucleic acids are nucleic acids whether it comes from a diatom or a tumor. \n\nYou really gotta find a PI who is somewhat scatterbrained and collaborating with a lot of different people and has a few different grants with broad scope. That's the hard part. I have no solid advice for finding a PI like this since I kinda stumbled into mine. I would say, take your question that you want to try and answer in grad school and see how the field approaches it, and who is approaching it with tooling from other fields. Look for PIs that are working in this area then scope out their papers to see how broadly they publish. There are generalists out there, despite the sentiment this thread. I work for one and collaborate with many more.",

      "text": "Probably not, but then again, it is was you make of it. I have several personal side projects that keep me entertained so that helps a lot. I also work in a lab that is all over the place in our field. I have one project on a protein structure, one on cancer cells, and I\u2019m assisting with a project that deals with biofilms on teeth. So that really helps break up the Monotony for me, but this is definitely the exception not the rule. A lot of labs take one thing and do that one thing over and over again.",

      "text": "The issue is that to get a PhD, and work in academia, you need to become an expert in something. And expertise takes time. There is the proverbial 10,000 hours \u2014 I prefer to say \"5 years of research\" \u2014 and whatever you feel about the exact time interval, it takes time. It is what separates the dilettantes from the expert. Generalists are not, by definition, experts.\n\nCan one become an expert in _multiple_ fields? Sure. It just takes _more_ time. Or taking an explicitly interdisciplinary approach where you become sort of a half-expert in two fields, centered around one kind of interaction. Over the course of a long career, people can move around quite a bit, and that's another road to expertise. But it still all takes time.\n\nThere are some fields of academia that make this professionally easier (I am a historian of science and that gives me license to be interested in _many_ things, both humanistic and technical, but it also constrains the modes of interaction I can have with topics \u2014 they are largely historical in nature) but ultimately at the end of the day you need to be able to claim a specific expertise both for your PhD and to have any chance of getting a job. \n\nIt is entirely possible to pursue one line of main expertise and to, on the side, pursue other topics of interest as well. I try to read quite widely and I have some \"pet topics\" that have interested me for many years now (like, say, approaches to the mind-body problem). But there is a difference in being a \"reading expert\" (you can read expert literature and understand and comment on it) and a \"writing expert\" (you can contribute to the growth of expert knowledge). The latter is much harder than the former; the latter is what you need to be in at least one field in order to get a PhD and be a member of academia.",
