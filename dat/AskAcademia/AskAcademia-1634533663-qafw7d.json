  "title:": "PhD in Australia versus US",
  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m applying to PhD programs in computational bio and bioengineering and am wondering if there are any advantages or disadvantages to doing my PhD in Australia. It is paid for and will take about 3-3.5 years, but given that so many international students come to the U.S. to get their degrees, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s better and if so, why, to get a PhD in the US. I\u2019ve heard the \u201ceducation is just better in the US,\u201d but as a graduate student, the gist of my work will be research. Does it make one more employable to get a degree from a US accredited school or will I also ve employable here with a degree from somewhere like university of Melbourne or Monash Uni?",

      "text": "The idea that \"education is just better in the US\" is laughable unless you're comparing US to developing countries or Asian countries with poor academic culture. My undergrad in Australia was more theoretically rigorous than most of American peers and certainly had more useful practical components, not that those really apply to a PhD student.\n\nIn Australia you'll have a shorter PhD with no coursework with an honours/master's required. In the US, you'll have a longer PhD with coursework. \n\nThe difference between the two won't be huge beyond that, but if you plan on moving to industry afterwards, it's easier to stay in the country you do education in (Academia is less picky). If the US has way more industry options for your planned field, taking advantage of that can be wise. \n\nIf you plan on doing a postdoc, go with Australia 100% because our postdocs earn livable wages ($90k AUD/yr), assuming you find a good group to do it in.",

          "text": "Having worked in academia in several countries including the US, I can attest to this. My collaborations with Australia also support what you're saying. \n\nOne thing I found in the US was people had several misconceptions about US vs rest of world education.\n\n1) in the US you need at least 90% for a good grade whereas other countries it's more like 70%. This is because all the US UG education I was involved in was graded almost entirely on weekly MCQs, with multiple shots at getting a passing grade. In other countries grading was a combination of essays, and short and long answer exams usually only with one shot. There was much more focus on concepts and principles unlike in the US where facts predominated. I still remember talking a student through \"how many bases are in 25 base pairs\". Yikes. \n\n2) PhD courses in the US require students to take courses while many other countries don't. This is because in the US the UG favours breadth over depth (something very positive in my mind, you get much more rounded students). However, people think it means overseas just don't get that education. They do it's just in UG where their degree are more specialised. \n\n3) PhDs in the US are much longer than many other countries. Again people see this as more education/more in-depth but it just stems from point 2. US students are effectively only part-time in the lab for at least the first 2 years. Overseas they hit the ground running. \n\nThere are upside and downsides to both systems, and each work better for some people over the other but the idea the US is better is really not correct.",

      "text": "A big part of getting a job in academia is networking. Your education will be just as good in an Australian program, but depending on where you want to work you may not have as easy a time making contacts. For instance, I live in California and am within driving distance of dozens of conferences and universities, the professors in those schools know the ones in mind, they recognize the names on my letters of rec, and so on. Australia is a little more isolated just given its location, and that can make networking a little more difficult depending on where you want to work. Not impossible, but just not as easy.",

If you don't mind having a career anywhere else, it probably won't make a difference.",
