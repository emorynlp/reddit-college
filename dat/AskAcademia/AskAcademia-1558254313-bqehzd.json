  "title:": "Should I report an undergrad to their summer research supervisor for bullying and harassment?",
  "text": "Basically, I don't know the student's name but I do know that they have been bullying and harassing a particular person to an exceptional degree, going so far as to spread some very damaging lies about them, post their private information online, and try to get them fired and expelled. I don't know why they're so adamant on doing this, but they are. A few comments have me suspecting that it's race-based harassment. \n\nBut I also know who they'll be working with for summer research this year, and I know that I wouldn't want that level of toxicity in my lab. It's a small group and I doubt they're taking more than one undergrad, so even if I can't provide a name, they should know who it is. \n\nShould I reach out to the head of this lab to warn them about this individual? I'm only a graduate student so I don't really have much power in anything, plus it isn't behaviour that's tied to their research group or to mine, it'd be more like a character anti-reference. And I'm worried that even though I have the name of the head of the group from this person's own mouth, they could be lying and my anti-reference could get tangled up with a completely innocent student.",

Too many details will risk making both parties known. I\u2019d rather it be dealt with in-house. \n\nIt isn\u2019t my place to assess why this guy is stalking and harassing another undergraduate student. But it is probably my place to report his behaviour, especially given the chance that it may escalate once he has physical access to her.",
