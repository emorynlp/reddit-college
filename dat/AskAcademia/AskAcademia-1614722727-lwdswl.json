Also, it is said that when you are moving abroad it actually makes the difference to hold this name on your CV.\n\nI wanted to know if you have heard about the Universidad de Buenos Aires before, or any other in such countries (UNAM in Mexico, USP in Brazil, etc.)\n\nThanks.",

I'm a French academic working in Norway, so I'm quite aware of what the good institutions in both countries are, and what field they are more active in. I spent enough time traveling to conferences and courses to meet people from a lot of institutions so I know a few names, but what's a good Italian engineering school? No clue. A famous Spanish University? The Royal University of Madrid that I just came up with and probably exist because Madrid is the capital city of a monarchy...",

Professional networks are much narrower and often do include developing country universities - or even specific advisers or research groups within a university - that are considered high quality, and belonging to such an institution will make it easier for you to advance in that specific profession, even if mentioning where you went to school doesn't make random people gasp. For example, there's a university in Italy (yes, I know that's not a developing country but example supports my general point) that is very well reputed among economists and that I'm pretty sure is virtually unknown outside the field.",

They may have some good scholars in some specific areas (say Latin Amrtican Literature or some sociologists or anthropologists) for obvious reasons, but their intellectual vigour has a very limited scope. I'd say that, rather than renowned as institutions, they have very few renowned scholars in more humanistic areas as well as access to specific natural resources and settings (think the Amazon or communities that speak Maya languages).\n\nBeyond Latin America, Portugal and Spain are the countries where, due to shared language and historical relations, these schools might engage in some conversations and get international respect. However, even in these cases, you're talking about countries that are home to schools like Uni of Coimbra, Lisboa, Salamanca, Barcelona, Basque Country and Auntonoma Madrid, among others. These are world class institutions, and their interest in the universities you're talking about is mostly strategic. \n\nFinally, not being \"renowned\" does not mean the institutions are bad. Schools in English speaking countrues invest a ridiculous and obscene amount of money in marketing strategies, like football teams and stadiums, and the quality of students in many American universities is subpar to those in so called developing nations. \n\nI'm talking from the stance of the social sciences.",

I can immediately think of two prominent graduates from your school in my discipline (political science) who are among the biggest names. \n\nI'd guess that a typical undergraduate student is very unlikely to have heard of your school, but in a given graduate program--certainly in the social sciences--there will almost always be faculty who have expertise in their topic related to Latin America, and those faculty will know that your school is of high quality. This fact is very important if your research will have anything to do with Latin America, because applications to graduate programs generally refer directly to individuals from the faculty who you'd like to work with. Those people who you might work with are by far the most important for judging your application, and they are the ones who will be able to recognize the high quality of your institution.\n\nEven if you are not planning to do research with a regional focus, it doesn't necessarily matter that an application selection committee does not recognize your institution. It is their job to evaluate your application, and if they don't recognize it, they will likely check it's standing and see that it's the best in your country. People in the US are, unfortunately, very focused on prestige of those institutions mentioned in other posts, but they aren't so biased that they don't understand that talented and well-educated people don't exist in every country.\n\nWhat's your discipline? Will your research be region-oriented toward Latin America?",

Tambi\u00e9n viene mucha gente a hacer posgrados de distintas facultades y universidades porque son de gran calidad acad\u00e9mica. Muchas personas que vienen de afuera y conocen las universidades argentinas te pueden llegar a decir que un t\u00edtulo de grado ac\u00e1 equivale a estudiar un grado y un master en Europa, por el simple hecho de que un grado en Europa es de 3-4 a\u00f1os y nuestros estudios de grado casi siempre son m\u00ednimo 5 a\u00f1os. Pero tambi\u00e9n porque la calidad acad\u00e9mica es buena.\n\nPor otro lado, creo que es un gran prejuicio argentino pensar que la UBA es dr\u00e1sticamente mejor que cualquier otra universidad. Se infla mucho la imagen de la UBA y la realidad es que si bien se mantiene estable en los rankings de publicaciones e investigadores en Latinoam\u00e9rica (que por cuestiones de presupuesto nunca va a poder estar a la altura de universidades europeas o norteamericanas), hay otras universidades que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os le compiten y pueden llegar a destronarla dentro de poco tiempo. Adem\u00e1s hay cosas de la UBA que quedaron obsoletas, como por ejemplo las carreras con planes de estudio de 6 a\u00f1os, cuando podr\u00edas tener m\u00e1s graduados que accedan antes al posgrado y que produzcan investigaci\u00f3n de calidad.\n\nLa realidad es que si quer\u00e9s hacer carrera acad\u00e9mica muy pocas veces importa tu t\u00edtulo de grado, lo importante es lo que hagas en el posgrado y que te enfoques en insertarte en institutos de investigaci\u00f3n que sean l\u00edderes en el campo que te interese, ser becario/a de investigadores/as que tengan un n\u00famero alto de publicaciones en revistas con referato, etc. Eso es relevante en todos lados y da cuenta de un buen nivel, no importa la instituci\u00f3n.",

But I only heard of it during my Master's for the first time.\n\nI also heard of USP because my first PI went to school there and another lab member in a previous lab is from there.\n\nI never read papers from them in my field but I never see papers from some very renowned universities in my field either.\n\nBut I am mostly in circles that are international but not necessarily top-tier, so I don't know how representative my perspective is.",

But within my field I have never met anyone from a Latin American university. I had a professor who studied at the University of West Indies, but nothing else that I'm aware of as far as third-world universities.",

Maybe that affects how well known some universities are outside?\n\n(French researchers publish in French and Germans write in German, of course, but then it is usually meant for national audiences.)",

I'm not worried about it not being respected in the US whenever I do finish.\n\nEdit: fixed an autocorrect",
