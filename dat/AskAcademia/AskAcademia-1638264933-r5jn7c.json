  "text": "Hello. While reading a research paper and I got some questions and I would like to email them to the corresponding author, however,  I thought that maybe asking all the authors will be more beneficial because I will get each one point of view, and also increase the chance of getting a reply. But, I am worried, how would they feel or react if they know that? What do you think if this happens to you? Thank you so much in advance.\n\nEdit: Actually, there is no corresponding author for this paper, there are all the authors' emails.",
