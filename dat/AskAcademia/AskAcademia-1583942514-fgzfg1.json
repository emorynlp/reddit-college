Back in undergrad, I would always make an effort to make sure my profs knew who I was, so I would always ask questions after the class if I could think of something. One prof once offered something along the lines of being willing to explain lecture material to me if I need it.\n\nFor some reason, I interpreted what she said as her offering to reteach a whole lecture to me in her office hours. I went in, and basically somewhat asked this. I could tell from her reaction that I had made an interpretation mistake. Thankfully, I was passionate enough in the subject that I bullshitted my way into sounding like I actually knew what specifically I wanted to ask, and had a really good discussion with her. And there was a happy ending anyway, as she became my current adviser in the end.",

If it's the difference between a D+ and a C- (affecting your ability to take future courses, risking academic probation, etc), then I think this is a pretty awful move on your prof's part. But if it's the difference between a B+ and an A-? (Or *especially* the difference between an A and an A+)? It's sucky, but in the case described you just straight-up didn't follow the directions and it's completely within the markers' prerogative not to allow that.\n\nIn my experience, students who got a 99/100 would argue themselves blue in the face for that final mark. It had nothing to do with their understanding of the material, or any consequence, they were just perfectionists. As an example, on of the places I was teaching, A+ was 4.33 and A was 4.0, but GPA maxed out at 4.0. There was literally no difference between an A and an A+, and yet some students would go to the ends of the earth nitpicking every grade.",

The kind of student who obsesses over grades instead of the actual material, and/or one who will be sloppy about the process in the name of results, is probably not a great fit for many grad programs.\n\nThough I'll concede that many funding opportunities use GPA as a first hurdle for applicants. In that case a single letter grade might make a difference between being offered a package or not, which does suck. But that's a little removed from the consideration of \"did you succeed at this class\" and I'm not sure it's a fair assessment for an instructor to make in terms of bending the rules for a single student.",

At the end of the day, you're approaching your lecturer for special treatment, and for grades you don't necessarily deserve, based on the course's listed requirements. The way you ask for that special treatment absolutely matters (including not just the request but your behavior in class up to that point).\n\nYou talked about an admissions committee that cuts off consideration at 3.7. In that case, the difference between an A- (3.7) and an A (4.0) in a single class  doesn't \"matter\" for that specific consideration. For the student, it matters in terms of bumping their overall GPA, but why should one instructor bend the rules to help a student make up for a potentially poorer grade in a different class?\n\nUltimately I guess the broader question is... Is it fair for a teacher to consider things outside the class in making that decision (including a student's trajectory for grad school, problems in their family life, personality/attitude, their financial circumstances)? It's not *fair*, but it's definitely the case that people do. Is it fair for me, as an instructor, to consider things outside your individual circumstances in making that decision? (for example, risking being accused of granting one student special treatment if I change your grade but not someone else's, contacting all the other students who took the same test and allow them to increase their grades as well, or potentially needing to change the way I grade in the future to allow answers anywhere and exponentially increase my marking turnaround time).",

Doubly so when it sounds like you're used to getting special exceptions made from other professors. It definitely comes with the territory, and to be honest we have enough on the line that it's often easier to just acquiesce to student demands (negative student evaluations can harm our careers as much or more as a 2% difference on a transcript, and students with a grudge tend to leave negative evals).

You were asking for your test to be considered/graded in a way that differed from the way the tests of everyone else in the course were considered -- that's special treatment, unless you also expected them to extend the same consideration to everyone else in the class, which could be difficult or impossible depending on the number of students and the timing.\n\nThat one grade wouldn't be the entire reason your GPA was under 3.7.

I have seen tests where marks are deducted for not putting your name on the front of the answer booklet. I have heard of tests that ask students to read the entire  test before beginning and have a note at the end that tells them to skip a question. I've given assignments where students are told that answers beyond a certain page limit are not considered.

Mainly, these questions are like, \"oh, well how do you know there is a double-bond based on a molecular formula?\" or something conceptual like that.\n\nAlso, just for clarification, I have never (and would never) say something to one of my students or TAs about this and put them in an uncomfortable situation.

As a sophomore in college, I can say that my professors who intimidate me the most are the ones that come across as insanely smart, goes through material quickly, and asks if anyone has questions and moves on a second after asking (so not giving students enough time to process or come up with questions). That being said I\u2019ve gone to office hours with the professor described here and probably what made them seem less intimidating was when they shared with me a challenge they had with humanities courses (the prof is in the hard sciences). Also, at the beginning of the semester, they shared with the class their grade in the course they were teaching (and it was an average grade, but it\u2019s a course that\u2019s known to be extremely difficult).",

If it's course content, then it's much more helpful if they can bring up specific things that they are struggling with.  I hate when students just say \"I don't understand anything\".  Come with some specifics, at least something like, \"I understand everything up until this point, and then I'm confused.\"  The \"I don't understand anything\" office hour meetings are still better than the end of the semester ones where students complain about their grade because they never came to office hours to get help before the final weeks of the semester.\n\nI'm also fine with having meetings about grades (e.g. a test grade), but would prefer if students came prepared to explain why they think their answer was correct, for example, and not just complain that it was hard and ask for a higher grade.  I'm more than happy to give students back points on a test/quiz if they can make a convincing argument, but just saying that it was hard is not a convincing argument.\n\nOn an etiquette note, it is also helpful if you shoot the instructor an email beforehand to let them know you will be dropping by (potentially also outlining what you'd like to discuss).  I've had office hours where I didn't know anyone was coming, ran down the hall to make some copies, and then later found out that a student complained because I 'wasn't in my office during office hours'.",

But I also do like getting to know students, so if that happens when they come by, then that's great. I also prefer them coming to office hours than to have them struggle through the material and either not understand it at all or to be sending me panicked emails close to the exam.",

      "text": "Yes, so long as you are interested - or at least engaged - with the material. A also (usually) quite enjoy students who come by to just talk about other topics falling under my areas of expertise (international studies; political science).  In such cases I not only get to know the student better but get to to have interesting discussions on topics I may otherwise not have - good students make me think as much as I hope I do them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso: In at least a few cases, it has helped students who demonstrated a consistent command of facts and nuance about topics falling under the topic of whatever I was teaching at the time. I may get an essay response that seems a bit lacking on detail from them, but I'll be much more likely to give them the benefit of the doubt - and a higher grade. This is especially true of a couple students who would come so often that I knew when a week of theirs was really busy and their written response that week would reflect that, again leading to me giving them a bit better score than I otherwise would have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is *me* though. I can honestly, and sadly say, there are a good number of professors who really don't like engaging with students - this is more likely at a large R1 style university than a small liberal arts school in my experience since R1s attract professors who are often more interested in engaging in research than teaching. Professors at liberal arts schools are more likely to be focused on their teaching - and to have pursued a PhD to teach in the first place.\n\nThe use of office hours for discussions with professors likely differs significantly in STEM fields from the social sciences and humanities, so this may be less applicable to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome general advice: \n\nDon't come by simply in order to 'show off' what you know - it is annoying and we see right through it. This goes doubly for name-dropping podcasts. \n\nDon't come by looking for all the answers or extremely specific directions on what you 'should write' - come by to learn more, understand more, not for me to do your assignment for you.\n\nDo have a sense of humor. Office hours get boring, and can drag on (yes, we're people!) on slow days - help make it entertaining.\n\nDon't come by without having read the material; looked at the syllabus; checked the website; or whatever is relevant to what you want to discuss (unless you are just looking for clarification or something of that nature). I'm not going to be particularly happy if I'm walking you through a few study questions for a particular reading on an upcoming exam and I find out you haven't even done the reading half-way through. \n\nDo learn to read moods - professors obviously have good and bad days like any other person. If you're professor seems particularly distracted or short in their responses, it is probably a way of saying - purposefully or not - that you should get to the point and move along. If they seem happy and start getting excited about what you have to say - don't be afraid to sit and chat; it's a good way to make connections that can help you out throughout life.",
