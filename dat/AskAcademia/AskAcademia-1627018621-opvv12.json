  "text": "Hey Academics! I need some advice. I completed a research degree last years and didn\u2019t get along with my supervisors all too well. My supervisors had a tight grip on my output and we\u2019re very secretive about a lot of things. They were also unnecessarily harsh and claimed some of my ideas. They also wouldn\u2019t let me be the first author on our first publication together.\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t agree with a lot of it, I grit my teeth because I needed to get accepted into my PhD. I\u2019ve now been accepted. When I originally chatted to my main supervisor, I suggested brining in another academic who is very experienced, who I have got along well with, and who I know would have my best interests. This particular academic has also given me a lot of opportunities to improve as a researcher and presenter. When I spoke to my primary supervisor, he mentioned he didn\u2019t want the other academic involved because it would cause friction with my associate supervisor. I acquiesced because I felt that I didn\u2019t want to take anything away from their Test. Both of my supervisors have got a lot invested in my project (it\u2019s a new diagnostic assessment that they designed).\n\nI\u2019ve now been accepted into PhD and have recently started. This time, however, I trust my supervisors less than I did last year. I really want this other academic involved to balance things out and to ensure I don\u2019t miss out on any opportunities. Long term, it\u2019s probably going to be better for me to have a good relationship with the academic I want on board. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to have this conversation with my supervisors. They\u2019re going to push me in the direction that they want and I\u2019m a little bit concerned because one supervisor in particular is one of the most cited, well known, and respected researchers in my industry.\n\nWhat would be the best way going forward to get what I want. I\u2019m stuck because they designed the test but it\u2019s my PhD. \n\nThanks guys!",

      "text": "Honestly? I think it was a huge mistake going into a PhD with people you knew you had fundamentally opposing values and views to. Your PI has actually been very clear with you about how they expect this to work and you've agreed thinking you could find some way around them later. \n\nI think you really need to take a hard look at this situation and decide can you work like this for the next X years to the completion of your PhD. If the answer is no, I think you need to find a new PhD program/supervisor. \n\nThe only thing I can suggest is a frank and open conversation with your PI about your concerns about the control on your work and your desire to collaborate with this other person and outline how you see the project going. But you have to be open to them saying no.",

      "text": "Why did you do a PhD with these supervisors that obviously showed they do not care about your wellbeing?\n\nIf that first publication was your based on your idea and you did most of the work, that was really shitty of them. Like the other commenter, I think you need to really have a conversation with both your supervisors and since its still quite early, the conversation can make some difference to you. Based on the outcomes of that conversation, decide what to do next. Remember that you are not stuck. It's just that whatever comes next will take a lot of courage to do. Think about how long you are going to be in this PhD. Are you ready to work in this way with your supervisors?\n\nGet ready for the conversation to turn the other way too because from how you described them, I don't think they will take it well. It's not a good position to be in not to trust both your supervisors. They are going to play a big role in your PhD life.",
