  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm on the academic job market right now, and I'm curious what it means when a position asks for \"contact information for references.\" Does this mean the search committee will reach out to the recommenders at some *later* point for references?\n\nthanks!",

      "text": "In my field (humanities) they will often make one round of cuts, and then they will ask semi-finalists or finalists for letters by either emailing the dossier service address on your reference sheet, emailing you to ask you to submit your letters, or reaching out to letter writers directly.\n\nI find this approach to be a bit more distressing, because it is one more aspect of the process out of the applicant's control. You don't often know if your committee is being contacted, so you can't keep up with them to make sure they respond on time or see the email. I'd rather just submit the letters in the beginning.",

          "text": "The advantage for you for asking for them later is a) you can tell your advisors about the specific job you made the short-list for, and the letter can be personalized for that job, b) the letters will be better if they are not a single generic letter for all jobs, and c) a committee that wants to hire you is not going to be put off by one of your letters being late (we know how academics are \u2014 we're them!). What you really want is the best possible letter, and the best letters are never the \"To whom it may concern\" letters that get written for Interfolio with the goal of being sent to a million places. (In any event, I don't think the letters matter as much as people think they do, anymore. This is no longer the world of kingmakers.)",

              "text": "True. We don\u2019t accept letters from the applicants. The system is setup to ask the applicants for referees contact information and then it automatically solicits them for letters - very standard in US academics. The applications without the letters are flagged incomplete. Letters, past productivity and research statement are probably the most important pieces of the package. So in our case it\u2019s difficult to rate the applicants without any rec letters. Typical junior search will have hundreds of applicants, so a robust rating rubric is important. This is different for senior or special opportunity hires - in these cases letters are usually requested much later",
