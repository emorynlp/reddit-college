  "title:": "How do you cope with lecturing and teaching the same subject over and over for decades of your life even during times of personal crises?",
  "text": "Non-native English speaker here. \n\nIt seems to me that, teaching the same subject or courses for decades must get extremely boring to a point that it must be excruciating and downright maddening. How do you cope with it? \n\nAlso, how do you cope with giving 3-6 hours lecture every day of your life for decades? Even a single lecture takes a lot of concentration, focus and its like a presentation/a performance. With lots of students making jokes at you or making bad comments, people yawning, being disrespectful/mocking, interruptions, disturbances etc etc. Doing that for decades. And even during times of personal crises like when you are divorced or dealing with grief in your personal life etc---how do you deal with it all anyway?",

      "text": "I can't speak to decades. I've only been teaching for about 15 years, give or take.\n\nIn that time, I've taught 30-odd sections of 20+ different courses, grad and undergrad. Only a few of them have I taught more than once or twice--and with those, to be honest, it's mostly been great: I just keep refining the course, seeing what's worked and what hasn't, tinkering with my own sense of what I want and of who my students are, revising as the students themselves change. It's pretty intrinsically interesting.\n\nPersonally, if anything I was teaching got truly boring (I don't mean a bad semester or whatever: I mean really boring), I'd just stop teaching that and teach other things--or, if stuck with a course for some reason, would start teaching it totally differently in ways I thought would be interesting.\n\nIn fairness, all of my courses are organized (to one degree or another) around live questions for the discipline (which I try to pitch at different levels to meet students where they're at), so they're kind of by definition interesting to me, at least.\n\nFor the life stuff, it's harder.\n\nMy little brother killed himself in my second year as a professor. My parents are in the middle of getting a divorce right now (granted, I'm an adult and they're their own people, but still: it's weirdly difficult). I've had some deeply rough patches in my own relationships, including one that ended when I was in grad school and taught a lot of courses and, at various points as faculty, in my marriage. We're all living, collectively, on borrowed time--both as higher ed and, still more, with regard to climate catastrophe and likely associated social disruptions.\n\nIt can be hard to live with the difficulties of being somebody while also going in and setting up conditions where students can have transformative (or at least intellectually useful and personally meaningful) experiences.\n\nSome people compartmentalize hardcore. They treat their teaching persona and teaching life as fundamentally separate from their larger self, and sort of set aside other aspects of their lives in order to teach effectively.\n\nPersonally, I find that heavy-duty compartmentalizing doesn't work very well for me. I live a more satisfying life when I am pretty much who I am across all domains of it, when I'm well-integrated. That said, to a certain extent, there's no way around it--if you're having a really hard time, you can't just drop that onto your students' shoulders. So, some compartmentalizing is necessary. If you just had a rough argument with your partner or with a colleague, you can't come in and offload that on students.\n\nBut, again for me personally, I need to be a pretty well-integrated person or else I kind of fall apart. That's especially true for the big stuff, but also means that I try to work through moods I'm having before teaching (instead of stuffing feelings or just setting them aside).\n\nI also pray before I teach, asking whatever it is that helps me to help me get out of the way and offer something useful to my students. Often, what happens is that aspects of my own personal difficulties (when these arise) then get incorporated into the work of the classroom--not explicitly, but as a kind of private subtext. Other times (like with talking about climate change or overtly destigmatizing mental health difficulties for my students), I end up talking pretty directly with my students about the things that comprise my various crises (in general, but not so much in a \"here's my life\" way, except when my little brother died--I had to leave for the funeral, and there was no functional way to avoid disclosing that; my students were very kind to me when I returned).\n\nFor the lecture thing, I dunno. I give impromptu lectures about things that students seem to be struggling with, but for the most part we do a lot of active classroom stuff. I'm still \"on,\" but it's not quite the same.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that, in my experience, it's entirely feasible to be a professor and be a \"whole person\" (at least, to the extent that this is feasible for any labor under capitalism). Also, lest I give the wrong impression, I'm for the most part fairly sunny in disposition (in my way); you asked about the difficulties, though, so that's what I've tried to speak to here. I hope that's helpful!",

I offered to answer any questions since the room seemed to be chatty that night.

I change them every time (different readings, lessons, prompts) and of course the students are always different. That said, I do not teach at a place where faculty simply \"lecture\" for hours a day; our classes are small (all <30) and interactive...most of the class time is used in discussion rather than lecture, so every class period is different.\n\nThe other thing that makes it \"bearable\" is the rest of the teaching load; while I do have a few courses I teach every year and likely will until I retired, I've taught/developed over two dozen different classes in the last 20+ years at my current institution. The variety and excitement of teaching something new helps offset whatever negative there is to repetition.\n\nIf you really are at the sort of institution where faculty simply walk into the room and talk at the students for a couple of hours, the upside is that it's relatively easy to do, once you have it down there's little new prep, and it gets better with practice. I once interviewed for a job like that in Utah where the committee straight up told me that the teaching was a drag but the repetitive nature of the lecture-style required courses meant you had lots of time to go hiking since the prep was simple.\n\nI don't know where you are teaching OP, but in my 25+ years as an instructor and 10 years of college/grad school before that I have never seen a faculty member in a US institution directly disrespected by a student or a class disrupted by anything like that.

      "text": "Whenever I get tired of teaching a particular course, I don't teach it for a year. I teach something else in that time. Sometimes I make new courses. Sometimes I revamp and remix existing courses. The act of teaching is not boring, though when you've done the same thing back-to-back over two semesters (or more), it can feel like it is time for a change. That's OK for everyone, including the students \u2014 my boredom is their new crazy class. \n\nI don't teach every day. I usually teach 3 days a week at max. One day is set aside for meetings and service. _Those_ I could do without. One day is always set aside for writing and research at a minimum, and I don't go into campus on that day if I can help it. I find that very refreshing and something to look forward to each week. \n\nI've never had students make jokes, etc. Sometimes you get a disrespectful student, or a disruptive one. I don't take it personally. The students who are enthusiastic, interested, eager, etc., more than make up for the one or two who are unappreciative. Sometimes I find out later that the latter were going through a rough patch in life themselves. I don't judge them. We were all 19 once. It's not the easier time in one's life emotionally.\n\nAs for the difficulty with the rest of your life \u2014 it's the same thing as any job. Maybe you get someone to fill in for you (good colleagues can make a huge difference). Maybe you cancel class and make an alternative assignment. Maybe you soldier on through it, if you can. The up-shot of it is that when you have a student who is going through something like grief, you can be the person who understands it and relates, and maybe even cuts them a little slack. \n\nUltimately the positive interactions, for me, vastly outweigh the negative ones. There is no job in the world that I know of where I simultaneously get to teach young people interesting new things that they didn't already know about, and also get to directly play a positive role in their lives. It's very rewarding. Yeah, sometimes teaching the same content can get a little stale. But you mix it up.\n\nDoes it take a lot of energy and concentration? It does. But who would want to live a life where you didn't need to use energy and concentration in your day to day existence? It's tiring, but it's also enlivening.",

For example, there was one class that I got burnt out teaching after about 6 years, so I asked to be rotated off the class.  I was only going to take a 1 year break, but then other teaching needs came up and I jumped on those instead. \n\nAs for 3 hour lectures, break them up.  Don't just stand up and read from powerpoints for 3 hours.  Have activities, show videos, have class discussions, break them into small groups, etc.  Just the act of walking around the class and not hiding behind the podium helps with engagement. \n\nAs for what is going on in my personal life, work, especially lectures, are an escape for me.

Although basic biology is pretty well entrenched there are always fun new story threads to incorporate - crispr babies! Life on mars? Darwin & Lamark vs. Epigenetics! etc. This makes things better for the students and for your sanity teaching the same thing every semester.  I love opening a class with a sensational news headline semi-related to that weeks lesson(s) and then tearing ot apart so students learn how to apply their science knowledge to what they hear in the media. It keeps things updated for me and the students.   \n\n>With lots of students making jokes at you or making bad comments, people yawning, being disrespectful/mocking, interruptions, disturbances etc etc. \n\nThis must be incredibly frustrating if you're teaching in your non-native language. But again, shouldn't teaching the same thing over and over only make that aspect easier?  Also don't be afraid to tell a student, in front of the class, that you found their \"joke\" or mocking hurtful.  It can make a surprising impression on them if you're heartfelt about it and it was a legitimate issue to address (not something petty). Classroom moral can also be boosted by sending anonymous surveys every month asking for feedback.  If students feel like they have an outlet to share their issues they may be less likely to \"voice\" frustrations during class time.    \n\nAlso remember what it's like to work in any other work environment! Disturbances/interruptions are part of running a classroom/lecture hall, just like any other kind of interruption that occurs in any job anywhere. \"How do you deal with coworkers who make \"jokes\" about you\" \"How do you deal with processing the same paperwork day in and day out?\" \"How do you deal with having to send the same emails out everyday\"? A lot of problems we think  are unique to academia are actually universal workplace issues just in a slightly different context.",

It helps to stay current on the changes in the field-little things change all the time.\n\n For some of us, we've decided to move beyond the traditional lecture model and instead have the students engage with the material differently (for example, the\"flipped classroom\"is one model). I don't put PowerPoints up and then just talk about them...I recorded those years ago so if a student wants \"traditional\" lecture, they can watch those videos. Instead, during class, we do Kahoot (a trivia like app, one of many options) to spark discussion and gauge understanding, I have group work, mini presentations, role playing activities, videos to watch, etc. \n\nWe don't cover 100 percent of the material but it's on the students to use the q&a time I set aside at the beginning of class to ask about the difficult concepts they're struggling with.
