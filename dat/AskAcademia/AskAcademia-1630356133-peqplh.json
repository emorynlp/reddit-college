There are a lot of papers out there and it would be a nightmare to find out that your words aligned even if for a single sentence.  My sophomore year of undergrad I was accused of plagiarism. The saving grace I had was that the TA had helped me through a section of code and  was sitting with me checking in as I wrote it. He knew I hadn\u2019t and vouched for me. \n\nBut, I would talk to a professor and ask if they have turn-it-in. There are free ones online that I\u2019ve used that do an ok job.",

You could try scribbr. they have a benefit of also providing proofreading services as well. Or you could just do that yourself. In terms of doing a really detailed plagiarism check, chec out plagiarism checker x. You'd have to purchase its lifetime license to scan a journal article because that word length would be difficult to check with its free plagiarism checker because that one is more for students).",
