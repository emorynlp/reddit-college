  "text": "Hi,  \nI'm not sure if this have been asked before, but I hope someone can help. I have what someone described as 'Thomas Sangster problem'. The first semester no student believed I would be substituting the professor and one even mocked me saying that I was just hazing. They didn't believe me until the professor had to show up himself and explain that it was part of the graduate program. Every time is the same thing. Which tips do you have to look older? I tried changing my clothing style and wearing only dark colours, but it didn't work.  My tutor suggested wearing glasses and only speak with my lower register, but I didn't try it yet. In some study groups, the feeling is very similar, the difference is that they know my age and it's very frustrating. How do you manage those situations?  \n\n\nThanks",

      "text": "I had this issue when starting out, plus a soft voice. Practice \"looks\"...raised eyebrows, one raised eyebrow, look of incredulity. Look of warning.\nBe precise in your gestures.\nUse open body postures ..wide arms, striding walking - Never curl your arms around your body or cross legs until you have the command style down. Then it can be done in a commanding way. Stand in the superhero pose as it is a command pose.\n\nyes to the glasses.\nAdopt a style of clothing from 20 years ago or wear mostly black. If you are female wear a pin that conveys dangerousness, like a dagger. If male something with camoflauge might grab attention (not over the top..a tie perhaps). \nNever wear lace or pastels or anything feminine until you are fully used to being in charge.\n\nCheck your posture, be alert but confident appearing (faking is completely fine). Half ofnleadership is appearance.\n\nPractice in your classroom as the room associations will help. Consider your entrance...own the room, put your books down with an audible thump, step up and start talking. \n\nIf someone talks over you deal with it immediately as it sets the standards for the rest of the class in terms of what is acceptable. \n\nBe as hard as you will *ever need to be at first. You can always get easier but you cant get harder.\n\n Find some children to babysit for and practice speaking to them...that will get your voice pitched.\n\nBreathe from the diaphragm and maybe speak to voice expert for tutorials...if you are female there is a tendency for culture to encourage you to keep a childlike voice and there are exercises that can reduce that...maybe by now you can find them on Youtube.\n\nResearch \"classroom management\" for more ideas.\n\nIt can be done. Ive seen a 5' woman boss alpha males around and they jumped. Ive seen 4'7\" person take charge of a herd of undergrads. Be the alpha in that room. Later in the term you can become the gracious queen and still later the colleague. \nBest wishes",
