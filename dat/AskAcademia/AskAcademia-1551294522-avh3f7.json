  "title:": "We're in this together - followup on yesterday's high-traffic post, and discussion on what we can do about unemployed PhDs.",
  "text": "Hi all - Humanities Anon here. [I made a post yesterday on how dismal the job prospects have been on my job hunt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/av383v/reconsider_before_you_sign_onto_that_phd_program/?sort=confidence) \n\nWhen I logged into Reddit this morning, my inbox was annihilated and the post had entered the top 10 links of all time on the subreddit. It sparked a lot of support, and dissent. My purpose in posting here today is to better organize some of the points touched upon in the comments and answer some questions that came up. Hopefully this will serve as another jumping off-point for discussion.\n\n---\n\n# Mental Health Struggles\nThis sufficiently answers a query put forth by /lindenlinden69er \n\n*I suppose what I am asking is: were you unhappy during the PhD?*\n\nRight off the bat I need to address the mental health struggles that come with this kind of work. I received three(!!!) private messages from users who wanted to privately express to me that they were happy I posted what I did because they were up against similar negative outcomes and experiencing intense anxiety and depression as a result. One messenger had even gone on academic leave because of it. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression throughout grad school. **Please take care of yourself and get help early and often, on campus or elsewhere.**  I intend to write a full post on this topic at a future date.\n\n\n---\n\n# Who Are You?\nA lot of comments asking for more details about my situation. I wish I could give them but I am terrified of being doxxed - it would probably destroy my academic job prospects. To recap from the other thread and elaborate a bit more: \n\n- In an Arts/Humanities discipline\n- ABD\n- Diss written\n- Defense scheduled\n- Work presented at all major conferences in discipline\n- Work presented at major conferences in tangential disciplines\n- Multiple solo-author pubs\n- Teaching experience\n- 0% success rate after 113 applications submitted to various academic and industry positions\n- \u201cFully funded\u201d - according to university calculations for cost of living, etc. (I was politely told to fuck off when I explained to the department head that their calculations were very low for the area where the university is.)\n- Still have accruing debt from undergrad/master\u2019s and have taken out loans to offset cost of living during PhD. Large debt now. \n\n---\n\n# Pyramid Scheme\n\n/u/lumabugg points out:\n\n*The PhD market is oversaturated because it\u2019s the only way big universities can afford to teach everyone, while knowing full well most students won\u2019t get a tenure-track job because too many people graduate from PhD programs (while the colleges continue to use grad student labor instead of hiring more faculty). Meanwhile, we were brought up with this idea that if you just work harder, you\u2019ll succeed, which has created a bunch of graduate students and post-docs who have convinced themselves that their lack of career prospects is their own moral failing and not the failing of a system that churns out more graduates than the market could ever handle.*\n\nThis enhances the point on **Mental Health Struggles** above. **The lack of career prospects is not your fault. There is a systemic corruption that is inherent in this system. Information about such corruption is not highly visible, that\u2019s what inspired me to write my last post.** Can you imagine if I shared my real name with the last post? It would be instant academic career suicide! In this manner, the institution protects itself from any dissenting voices. Lack of these dissenting voices cause otherwise mentally healthy individuals to question if they have \u201cdone enough\u201d by getting a PhD (something that less than 1% of the population has accomplished). \n\nIn case it needs said - I think you have worth as a human, and if you\u2019re getting a PhD you likely have an above average IQ and are at least somewhat more industrious than most of the general population.\n\n---\n\n# Rationalize, Rationalize, Rationalize\nInstead of getting justifiably angry at a systemic problem - an emotion that may lead to systemic change - countless commenters offered advice on modifying my job hunt. I appreciate the good advice, but others suggested that I leave the US behind for greener\u2026err beiger pastures. /u/duderightnow comments:\n\n*I\u2019d say try one of the Persian Gulf countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, etc)*\n\n---\n\n# The University Question\n/u/ph0rk responds to my assertion the the university is on the decline:\n\n*I assume you meant enrollment. Enrollment is on the decline in small regional schools and less prestigious LACs. Large research universities are seeing an enrollment increase.*\n\nAgreed. Without giving out doxxable information, I can report that my own institution just set a major record in this regard. I am not suggesting that enrollment will take a massive and immediate hit. **Instead, I am suggesting that the value proposition of college-as-service is failing. A weak value proposition is the harbinger of massively decreasing enrollment.** \n\nI encourage you to hit the pavement and ask undergraduates some questions. I make a point to socialize regularly with undergraduates on campus not involved in my own classes. Most of them in the first couple of years of study report that **they are attending college largely because it was expected of them by their parents, or for some other status-signaling reason.** Once it becomes common knowledge among a new generation of parents that college has no value proposition in terms of new knowledge to be acquired, attendance will severely and maybe irreversibly drop.\n\n---\n\n# Boomer Logic\n/u/brock_coley suggests that I\u2019m not trying hard enough:\n\n*For instance, go to specialized job fairs to network and introduce yourself, make yourself known to industry headhunters, make friends with previous grads who are now in industry, look up people on LinkedIn in the companies/positions you want to work in and ask them out for an informational coffee. Just as you are probably ready to relocate for an academic job, you should also expect to move for a good industry-based job.*\n\n[Which inevitably comes off like this.](https://i.imgur.com/DXhOUy4.jpg)\n\n---\n\n# Industry Work\n\n/u/nbbby27 asks:\n\n*\u201cWhy is the PhD a count against you in industry?\u201d*\n\nSome good answers in the comment area but none illustrating the main issue I have had with this - those in industry don\u2019t want to hire PhDs because they believe us to be overqualified, i.e. they won\u2019t be able to offer a good enough salary to keep us. Corollary - PhDs are a risky hire because as soon as that R1 job offer comes up we\u2019ll leave. This is actually what I\u2019m planning on doing. **I\u2019ll get whatever industry job I can drum up, tell them that I don\u2019t want anything to do with academia anymore, and leave immediately when I get a good offer from a school. I have no conscience about burning a system that\u2019s stacked against us.**\n\n---\n\n# Other Paths\n/u/pastaandpizza muses:\n\n*Why not pursue \u201cvirtually any other path\u201d than a PhD, right now ie if you were qualified for excellent industry jobs or other non-PhD jobs before you pursued your PhD, surely you\u2019re still competitive for those same paths now?*\n\nYou\u2019re right those paths are still mostly valid, and this is largely what I intend on doing. It is now a very uphill battle though. Consider it from the non-academic\u2019s point of view, this is what they see - one candidate with 5 years of solid industry experience, another candidate that was in school for 5 years, probably slacking off and avoiding the real world - who do you think they will choose? I have received numerous rejection letters from industry jobs so far that say I don\u2019t have enough real-world experience. \n\n---\n\nI think that summarizes most of what was generally brought up in the last thread. Many of you in humanities/arts PhDs are going to come up against the same struggle I\u2019m up against right now. For this reason, I ask all of you, **What do we do about this broken system?** I think not only could this be a productive discussion, but also bring up possible solutions or workarounds that will be actionable for current and future grad school graduates.\n",

Now, I'm at a funded master's program, where many of our students go on to PhD programs. My goal is to give my students kickass methods training so that they'll be well-equipt to either make lots of money as a data scientist or get a methods-focused academic job.

I thought that I could wait out the economy and get a valuable skillset in the meantime. I had no idea how to search for a program that would get me a job in academia afterwards - I bought Barron's and Princeton Review books and applied to the schools they identified as top schools, and managed to get in one. \n\nWhen in my program, I received no guidance. My advisor had 30 advisees. I saw him once per semester, for lunch. That was it. I thought that having lots of publications would be \"good\", so I published about 12 papers while getting my PHD. Later I learned that these publications were in topics that were too diverse, making me illegible to hiring committees. TheProfessorIsIn also told me that having so many publications hurt my chances of getting a job at a SLAC in spite of my many years of teaching experience. \n\nThere is so much I wasn't told and didn't know. I didn't know that I should be networking at conferences -- I would go to the panels and diligently take notes and then rush to another panel rather than hang around at the bar and get to know professors in my field who could eventually help me get a job. \n\nI was very naive: I thought that doing good work would get me a job, and it really doesn't work that way at all.\n\nSo, I'm glad you are prepping your students for the future.

MS in chemistry is useless. Every single chemistry and biochemistry major in my graduating class went on to a PhD program. \n\nNow that I'm done with my PhD I look back at myself in undergrad and beginning of grad school and think I was incredibly naive. But I don't necessarily blame myself-How was I suppose to know at 20 years old the things I do now? Especially when everyone I respected- my PI, my undergrad professors, my parents, my colleagues, etc were telling me one thing. \n\nI sometimes consider trying to become a professor because I really like giving advice and mentoring students. I feel like academia is so filled with terrible mentors who suffer harshly from survivor-ship bias and/or don't actually have any interest in being a mentor they just want to do research and advance their own career. But I hate everything that is involved with a career in academia, all the politics and bs. And I do think it is a corrupt system. It's something I don't want to support. So I won't do it. ",

Before unionization, there was no limit to the class sizes the TA's could have, nor the hours they could work, nor the number of papers they could grade, the amount of office hours they could hold, the duties they could be assigned...after unionization, the TA's job duties were clear, their pay was higher, and their hours were clearly limited. It was good for the TAs, and good for the undergrads. \n\nObviously, it wasn't good for the professors who could no longer have their TA's, say, drive them to and from lecture or make them coffee (which some of them were actually doing, btw) and many faculty members were therefore \"standoffish\".\n\nEven so, it's a tradeoff I would gladly make again and so would a vast majority of my colleagues, I'd wager. \n\nThis, btw, is another challenge inherent to getting adjunct and PhDs paid what they are worth: There is a cognitive barrier to viewing academic work as \"labor\", which in turn prevents identification as \"workers\" and the ability to stand up for one's rights. \n\nTenure line are not your friends if they are upset and \"standoffish\" because they no longer have free reign to exploit your labor.

However, the job market + my husband getting an MFA (which is the terminal degree for his field) are both reasons why I'm on the fence about getting a PhD. I wish I could find it because a few years ago I read this report from AHA that came out on job placement for people with advanced history degrees. The immediate prospects were not great but within 5 years a high number found jobs within the field (although I think this included working for museums/archives/K-12) and within 10 years that number bumped up quite a bit.

I don't really think of things like k-12/museum/archive/heritage studies positions as safety jobs but I can see where a lot of people do. Personally, I would genuinely enjoy that work. On that topic, I've had a few interviews for museum work but they were art museums based off of my undergraduate degree rather than my graduate degree but those ultimately went to internal candidates and I was asked to apply for lower-level positions. And I agree with the sentiment that if you are tied to another person's career or your family it's going to be difficult to find a job within your field. I have a toddler and a husband who wants to go into academia, if I'm being honest he has less transferable skills/job experience than I do so it makes more sense that we go where he can find a job vs. waiting for me to finish a PhD then find a job.

It's a very tight labor market, and even in positions where a PhD is a requirement (i.e. you're not competing against all the people with a master's and 5 years experience in the field, who will usually beat you hands down in positions that don't look for PhDs), they will usually want proficiency in a specific language *and* the quant skills,  and if this is international-oriented, in-country field experience. So if you have all that, you might be a few classes and an internship away from being super competitive - but otherwise, idk.\n\nAdditionally, I have some curator friends, and that is also a very tight market. Forget about the one class in museum studies - we're talking people who cannot find a salaried job with benefits after 3 years of unpaid internships. Especially if you're not willing move to Dyersville, Iowa to assistant curate the National Farming Toy Museum, it's a tough field to break into.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, to the people in these fields, these fields weren't Plan D after a failed academic career - they were Plan A since their early 20s, and they have had 10 years to optimize their careers to get this position that you think a couple classes and an internship qualify you for.",

I also said those types of strategies would make you more competitive, never implied it would be a walk in the park.  I've seen multiple people pivot this way.\n\nAs for social science folks, there are lots more options than what you mentioned.  I wouldn't even call those kinds of position \"industry\", but more like public sector (I've worked in that sector as well). I'm an applied qualitative (mainly) social scientist in an industry where there are lots of us.  Getting the first job can have challenges, but I know loads of folks who have done it and setting yourself up just a bit better while finishing your PhD (e.g., internship, a few different courses) moves it from being \"quite the riddle\" to being \"a bit tricky\".  Once you are in, the PhD positions you much better for a lot of roles than work experience alone. \n\nAny career pivot is tough.  It has risk and requires a ton of hustle (I went through a mountain of rejection before I got the shot I needed).  There are tons of tradeoffs and it is good to be realistic.  We don't always get what we want so you have to be honest with yourself about what you want to optimize for (e.g., location vs. stability). From my friends circle it was the ones who chased academic jobs that ended up in more out of the way places and those of us that transitioned out of academia that stayed in the bigger, more trendy urban centers.  Important to be realistic about all of that though.\n\nThat said, there are definite steps you can take if you are in the final years of grad school and either see the writing on the wall or want a better backup plan.  The more you do, the more you increase your odds of getting a non-academic gig after your PhD.\n\n",

The Ivies are richer than God himself and can bring in visiting scholars, provide conference funding, etc. This is a structural advantage, not simply \"snobbery and obsession.\"\n\nPrinceton doesn't have its PhD students teach, which means they have five years to focus exclusively upon writing a high-quality, state of the art dissertation. State universities (to use your example, MN State) don't have that ability. And you're out of your mind if you don't think that disproportionate amounts of teaching don't make a high quality history dissertation/articles/etc. far more challenging. \n\nAnother history program I visited told me \"we give you $1500 a year for books and conference funding, but it doesn't roll over.\" How many history programs in the entire US can do that?  \n\n>Thank you, however, for pointing out one of the major problems with academia: the snobbery and obsession with brand name over capability and ability. \n\nI'm not saying people at lower-tier programs are incapable. I'm saying that they're structurally disadvantaged. It's not just \"pedigree\" and \"snobbery\" that allows Harvard to place its students better than the next three programs combined. And by the way, there are some very \"high pedigree\" universities that have students producing mediocre dissertations. They don't get placed, despite their advantages. ",

And of course, there is the structural advantage that comes from being at a school that is, itself, extremely rich and well-connected. \n\nThe incredible part is that even the good little liberals in the humanities tenure track so often mistake all these advantages as evidence of simply being better scholars, or, alternatively, blindly replicate this privilege in their hiring practices. At my university, for example, I assisted a prof that was on a search committee. Everyone on the search committee went to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton and so did everyone on the short list. Some of those short listed had mediocre teaching reviews and/or no publications, in contrast with the many other applicants on the long list; but no matter. They had inhaled the magic fairy dust at the ivy leagues, so they got short listed. ",

But a disproportionate majority.\n\n> The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network\u2014who hires whose graduates as faculty\u2014we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News & World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.\n\n\nNot only that, this has implications for how knowledge is produced, disseminated, and accepted within the disciplines.\n\n>  The close proximity of the core to the entire network implies that ideas originating in the high-prestige core, regardless of their merit, spread more easily throughout the discipline, whereas ideas originating from low-prestige institutions must filter through many more intermediaries. Reinforcing the association of centrality and insularity with higher prestige, we observe that 68 to 88% of faculty at the top 15% of units received their doctorate from within this group, and only 4 to 7% received their doctorate from below the top 25% of units.\n>  \nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005",

You won't pay someone who needs the money because that would be \"exploiting\" them and then you'd \"feel bad.\" \n\nSo, to avoid discomfort, you instead give the job to people who don't actually need the money?  \n\nI'm also struggling to understand how this person's labor-- the person who doesn't even need the money-- is now magically not being exploited.   Their labor is STILL being paid \"1/4 of what they are worth\" even if their spouse is making a living wage, and even if they have a day job that values their labor appropriately. I'm not a business major so perhaps this is obvious to someone who is and it's a silly question. \n\nFWIW, it's not just you. I saw this at my own university as well in the humanities. ",

It is shocking to me that you could get through a Ph.D. and find it surprising that it is hard to get a permanent position as an academic researcher. It was certainly something discussed frequently during grad school from day one in every department I've spent time in. I believe you when you say that you (and some of your friends) *didn't* know this, but it is hard to view this as a systemic failure when the knowledge is so widely dispersed (it is available on any academic website, popular shows like the Simpsons, etc etc).\n2. The actual outcomes of Ph.D. students are not so bad! Yes, leaving the academic system was stressful (it was stressful for me too), but labor statistics mostly say that Ph.D.s have lower-than-average unemployment and better-than-average jobs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think these two outline the way many of us in the system think of it: a Ph.D. is a not-unpleasant way to spend a few years, and it can set you up for a decent job at the end. This modest goal doesn't seem so awful to me, and (at least some parts of) the existing system seem to already do this, at least on average. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*PS:\\* While I'm not a boomer, I am in a currently-popular area of STEM and did industrial research for a while post-Ph.D. (as did most of my Ph.D. classmates).  It was rough learning how to get these jobs, and some people took a while... but it did happen.",

A degree is now easier to get (in part due to overabundance of gov't loans, in part due to \"student as commodity\" models of many universities) meaning having only a degrees is less valuable. Yet, by that same logic, someone also looks that much worse on paper for not having the ever more present degree.",

You need to write up your cover letter and shop it around to get feedback and revise. You can help your employers connect the dots by emphasizing your problem-solving skills and not just subject expertise. \n\nI remember a few years ago when I was prepping a PhD student to go into industry - he was adamant on putting his exact PhD thesis title on his cover letter.

In the late 1980s we were told the opposite: \"Now's the time! All the boomers will retire soon and the world will be your oyster!\" I was already keen on an academic career, and was encouraged to pursue that dream. By the mid-1990s (two graduate degrees down, one to go) I started to realize it wasn't quite as we'd hoped. By the time I was on the market in the late 1990s it was quite clear: there were far more Ph.D.s than jobs. It's only gotten worse since, and it's not a secret at all. That is why so many of us tell our students not to get Ph.D.s in the humanities-- there's no future in it.\n\nOP, I'd suspect, is among the many who (logically) feel they will be exceptions because they've \\*always\\* been exceptions. Obviously some people are getting jobs, so why wouldn't they be among them?",

And even those students aren't guaranteed to get jobs in the field. These days, doing a postdoc is more of a necessity in many fields if you want to stay in academia, including engineering fields, but again some of the aforementioned labs will support anywhere from 3 to a dozen postdocs (discounting some heavy outliers in hot fields).\n\nBefore going into it, I thought I was prepared for the PhD, I'd read the advice.

I've seen multiple posts here and at /r/professors and articles around the internet for the last decade or so with people outlining why there isn't much room for humanities PhD's in the market and those numbers won't be turning around anytime soon. I've seen tons of posts from people who are saying they can't find gainful employment with their humanities PhD, but for some people this is still shocking. If you must study buggy whips, better get yourself some technical training in phlebotomy, or HVAC repair, or billing and coding, or auto mechanics as well so at least you can have some more reliable income while you search for the job that requires your knowledge of buggy whips.",

By how much? That's the most important question, but the data to answer that does not exist. Does the MLA even cluster its errors? Then there's the exogenous controls - # of pubs, # of conference presentations, adviser prestige, whatever else matters in humanities performance. If I don't have more granular numbers and contextualized spread info, I can't make the inference that having all those things takes me not far from the mean outcome, which is the anecdotal story I hear.

These numbers are not adjusted for age or experience, so that might explain part of the surfeit of income and lower unemployment rates. These figures also do not identify how many are working in academia. But it does appear that relative to folks without PhDs, PhD have higher  earnings and lower unemployment rates.  It may be the case that many of these folks are doing jobs that don't require a PhD. Nonetheless, they appear to do better than folks without a PhD (Professional degree holders being the exception). So while the academic job market may pretty bad, someone must value these degrees.",

There's very few applications of these particular PhDs outside of academia: NGOs, policy, etc., are among them, but those also require training and certification that a professor of comparative literature who has only ever been a professor of comparative literature (for e.g.) cannot provide to students.",

That said, it's not unusual to apply for 50+ positions before you find something, regardless of degree level. I have a PhD in a field that has a lot of practical applications and degree specific jobs, and virtually everyone, including me, who has gotten an industry job has applied to 50-100 positions before they got a viable offer. I also know people who graduated from college with STEM degrees and also taken 45 interviews to get a job. \n\nPart of this is, as you said, that you learn how to refine your job search process. Part of it is also just that it's easier to apply to jobs online now, so you're competing with the 300 other people who also found the position. I remember interviewing for a position with 600+ applications that required at least a master's in a very niche field. ",

Which means not needing to work nor take loans for a normal duration of the PhD.\n\nThen, maybe it'd be a good idea if there could be a place on the internet where everyone can post their PhD stipend/income and (itemized) living expenses in the area, describe their PhD lifestyle and money problems (or lack thereof) - anonymously, but mentioning their department/school or at least town. Maybe some sort of academic worldwide repository of job/employer reviews, as it exists in some countries for jobs in general (e.g., Glassdoor - which I don't find academically useful enough because to access most information I'd need to post a salary/review of an employer in the same country). So that prospective students (and postdocs, and adjuncts...) can see how their stipend would (not) work, and not accept financially insufficient offers but have the data to try to negotiate livable income. Which should force schools to increase stipends, and thus probably also accept less people.",
