  "title:": "As a felon, should I apply for a lab job?",
  "text": "I'm an undergrad seeking research/lab experience, as grad school, internship, and work opportunities seem to consistently require it. Although I've kept a spotless record for 13 years, I have a single felony conviction, unrelated to violence, drugs, sex, or theft/fraud. Several times, on-campus employers have been enthusiastic about wanting to hire me, but I never heard back from them; I infer there is some barrier in HR, probably a ban on hiring felons. Although I am open to opportunities anywhere, I like my school's city (it is where I grew up) and would favor continuing to attend here for grad school. Today I spoke with a lab supervisor, and he encouraged me to apply for a paid lab position that just opened. If I apply, he'll likely discover the felony and word could get around the department. If I don't apply, I'll lose a rare chance to get experience and money, plus he'll think I'm a flake since I was enthusiastic in approaching him (offering to volunteer). I wouldn't lie in either case. What do?",

      "text": "It's going to come up, whether you pursue a position there now or any time in the future. Especially if you go to grad school and may teach undergrads who may be minors. And unfortunately that barrier will stay with you as you progress and encounter stricter requirements up the ladder.\n\nI looked up the policy at my institution and negative background check results are handled on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of the offense, its relationship to the position, and time/rehabilitation. You just have to be up front about it when filling out any hiring paperwork, and keep your expectations in check just in case. It'll either work out or it won't, all you can do is try.\n\nI would personally not have any problem hiring a former felon if they are honest, enthusiastic and work hard (my expectations for anyone), but I'm not sure how my institution would feel. Good luck.",

Then in my first year I was going to get a \"without compensation\" appointment at the VA hospital so I had to disclose it to my advisor, she was great about it and no one else knew about it for a couple years. Then when I applied for a summer class at the NIH I had to disclose it to some more higher ups, who were providing letters of support, etc.\n\nWhen I went on the job market after school my rule of thumb was to explain it before it came up through HR. In the case of tenure track jobs I would wait until I got an offer, then say \"I am really interested in this position and think it would be a great fit, but I just need you to be aware of this situation [explain situation] because it will come up in the background check process\" or something along those lines.",

He ended up talking to a labor lawyer who helped him out (in some way I am very unclear on, but is apparently common enough that this lawyer does it for college students frequently - go figure) so that he could get DHS clearance to work on a study with disadvantaged youth; the topic the guy was passionate about.\n\nIt seems to me like being up-front about your felony is the way to go, and it might be really helpful to visit your school's student legal assistance office or equivalent, and asking them if there's anything you can do proactively to help this history not be an obstacle to your academic success.",

      "text": "So a couple anecdotes that may help. Usual disclaimers, ymmv etc...  \n\n1) I have a grad student with a felony conviction. While I happen to know because he worked for me as an undergrad at a different institution (unpaid for course credit) it came up in conversation over the course of time.  I was not told about it when he had the background check for grad school at the institution I moved to. It was non-violent, drug related, not sure what that means from the HR side, but after asking my department manager, the university doesn't actually automatically exclude anything, though they reserve the right to. My department has no policy, we leave it up to individual faculty. I'm going to guess that is true at most similar institutions (I'm at a top 20ish engineering R1 in an engineering dept). \n\n2) When I was in grad school a fellow member of my incoming class had a felony conviction and served 10 years in the state prison that was right near campus. He had a BA and MA in an arts field, but being bored in prison he took advantage of a program offered by my university to get a BS in a science field. When he got out, he enrolled in the PhD program in the same dept. The only reason all the faculty and students knew was that he was an outspoken advocate for criminal justice reform and spoke very openly about his experience. (This was a peer institution to where I work now).\n\nThis leads me to some advice:  \n\n> If I apply, he'll likely discover the felony and word could get around the department. \n\nThis information is going to be FERPA protected. He (or the departmental business manager) really shouldn't share the info. I never have about my student now, though he is upfront about it. (He also got pulled over here with some pot in the car and I was actually his first call, so we have a trusting relationship, but still I'd never share that kind of personal information). Not having any other information about the other positions and why they fell through, I'm going to say it had nothing to do with HR. Unless you officially applied, it never even went to HR.\n\nAll this amounts to is apply to work in this lab now, if you really want to avoid the conversation, ask if you can work for research credit (all the better if it has a letter grade scale rather than just pass/fail); don't worry about grad school, while HR may see the background check, your advisor may or may not, tho I'd err on the side of being forthright it's up to you. \n\nIf you want to be really sure of what will happen, call the generic HR number on your school's jobs site, introduce yourself as some one considering applying to a wage position, and ask what the policy is. You shouldn't even have to give your name.",

I worked in an elementary school with a dude (he was in his 50s) who had a \"colorful\" past (dramatic stories from his 20s) but he got a pardon so he could legit say NO when asked those questions.\n\nSuck it up buttercup and apply for the position.
