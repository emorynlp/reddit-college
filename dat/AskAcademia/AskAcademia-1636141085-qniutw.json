  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am a second year masters student finishing my masters thesis soon and I get asked by my thesis guide if i want to join the department as a researcher. I always wanted to do a phd (probably for the wrong reasons that people would call me Dr.), and i am considering it. \n\nHowever, I do not have much idea about the life as a researcher. I have had a couple years of job before my masters so i know how it is in a company. You do well at the job, take up other responsibilities and impress your boss and you \"grow\". You always have specific \"tasks\" to work toward. \n\nSo i had the following questions about life as a researcher, to make my decision. This probably matters that I am talking about phd in an engineering field from a german university.\n\n1. How is it in a phd? How well are such \"tasks\" defined? I am a kind of person who can easily get lost unless he has a very well defined target to achieve and a deadline to achieve it. Do we have this in a phd?\n\n.\n2. Also, how do people \"grow\" in the field of research? I am sure just researching one topic and teaching some lectures is not it, right? We have to keep scouting for more research projects? Is it competitive? How proactive do we have to be and towards what?\n\n.\n3. And how is the pay compared to a starting job at an industry? And the growth potential also in comparison to job?\n\n.\n4. How much does the uni matter? Or even within the uni, the department. I am told the research team at our uni in this particular department is not so big, but growing. (I dont have much idea about this though). Does that matter? Or just the topic, which i actually find interesting (the first research topic i am being offered)\n\nBasically what im asking is, what all should i know about this life before getting into it, or rather deciding if i want to get into it?\n\nThanks for the time :)\n\nPS. Also, does research mean phd? Is the phd-commitment of 4 years a given? Or is it like i can be a researcher for like a year and if i dont like it, i can find another job.. i am told research in germany is equivalent to a job experience.",

      "text": "> well defined target to achieve and a deadline to achieve it. Do we have this\n\nThat hasn't been my experience: the target is \"how can we spin this into a publication\", the answer to which changes (sometimes several times in the week leading up to a paper deadline). \n\n>how do people \"grow\" in the field of research\n\nBy doing research. So yes, mainly researching one (one-ish) topic, but you'll find that getting deep into one field will require you to pick up both deep expertise in one area but also an understanding of a wide array of fields. Teaching is perhaps a valuable experience but not really your goal research-wise.\n\n>We have to keep scouting for more research projects?\n\nNo, your advisor will do that. Based off of what grant funding you have, you'll be provided problems to aim at.\n\n> Is it competitive?\n\nYes.\n\n> How proactive do we have to be and towards what?\n\nYou will have to be very self-directed. To some extent this depends on your advisor, but in general you are not being provided day-to-day direction, you are being provided very high-level goals and it's up to you to make it happen.\n\n>how is the pay compared to a starting job at an industry\n\nAs a robotics/software researcher in a major US city, I'm making about a third of what I could be making in industry. But, it's enough to comfortably pay my rent, bills, and a bit more, so I'm not too bothered by it since I enjoy what I do. Being in Europe (PhD stipends are higher and engineering salaries are lower than here) that difference will be less dramatic, but still present.\n\n>growth potential also in comparison to job?\n\nWell, you can't get a PhD working in an engineering firm, so there's that. But the comparison here isn't really fair, you don't go to a uni for the same reasons as going to a job.\n\n>How much does the uni matter?\n\nIn my opinion, not at all. Your advisor is substantially more important: it's more about what they can provide for you, it won't be the university providing that (connections, opportunities, equipment).\n\n>does research mean phd? \n\nNo, some people work in R&D in industry without a PhD, and some people are working in research after having earned a PhD.\n\n>Is the phd-commitment of 4 years a given\n\nNo, the PhD takes as long as it takes to finish the work necessary for your dissertation. In some countries that's typically 3 years, some 4, some 5 or 6. But in all of those, some people will take longer.\n\n>if i dont like it, i can find another job\n\nThere's no contract saying you're stuck there forever, so yes.\n\n> i am told research in germany is equivalent to a job experience\n\nThat's somewhat true for any STEM PhD: it's effectively a research apprenticeship in the field of engineering, so you'll be working on engineering projects in your day-to-day. Future employers may or may not count it as job experience, but I would.",

          "text": "Thank you v much for the detailed reply. \n\nI think one followup question would be - could you tell about the grant funding? Or rather funding in general? \n\nAs a researcher employed by the university, do i get a fixed salary or do i have to proactively look for projects for higher funding (or higher salary)? From your post i would think again, this is done by the professor. But how does that trickle down or get distributed amongst all the researchers?",

Different countries fund PhDs differently but ultimately you need to ask your PI what they're offering. \n\nAre you absolutely sure you are being offered a position on a PhD program and not a job as a researcher/research assistant? I believe in Germany PhD students are employed (in other countries they receive a stipend or get paid for teaching) but while a PhD student is an employee that doesn't mean an employee is a PhD student.",

They say, \" if you eat gummy bears with us for the next four years we will pay you less than minimum wage and eventually you will get a cool nickname.\" You think gummy bears are cool so you say, \"Great!\"\n\nA couple years later you realize, \"oh my god, what did I do- I like gummy bears but I don't want to eat them all day. I also want to spend time with my family and get a dog- help! these people are insane!\". \n\nMy point is that normal people don't enjoy getting PhDs- weird gummy bear addicted people do. I don't know if you want hang out with that strange group unless you also have a weird gummy bear addiction as well.",

          "text": "Haha, nice analogy. But i, on purpose, did not go into \"whether i want to do a phd or not\" in this post. Coz its a whole other thing.\n\nBut yes i get the point. You need to really be addicted to it,  if you wanna keep motivated for it. \n\nI have just been thinking to myself whether that is the case :D. I enjoy studying sure, working towards some projects or even my masters thesis which was essentially a research task. Whether ill like it for a long term, i cant really say. Depends on other factors like money, growth and even recognition in the field. \n\nBut i think that is where the distinction between phd and researcher comes into play. As a researcher i am just another employee doing research as my job. And if i like it, i continue it and probably for for a phd. I like this idea tbh, takes the pressure of \"commitment\" off. I hope im correct with this logic.",

              "text": "I think I disagree a bit that you have to be addicted. It's a common trope that academia is a vocation and you have to commit body and soul to it. Certainly, if you want a long term career in academia you'll need passion for it to compensate for the lack of pay and lack of career/job security. However, I don't think you have to be addicted to do a PhD. You have to be focussed and committed but if you're willing to do the work it doesn't have to be your life's mission. It's a role that requires self-starting and probably more than a 37.5h week (although if you're smart not a lot more).",
