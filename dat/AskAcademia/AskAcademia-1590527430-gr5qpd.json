  "text": "TL;DR- Will professors view me asking to interview them about their career as an inconvenience?\n\nI am doing a project that requires me to reach out to contacts all around my academic field and interview them regarding their career.  However, when I reached out to some of my professors, most were willing to provide me contacts from their networks, but one came back and said that he discourages me from interviewing people within the field.  He said that often times professors or other professionals view students asking to interview them as an inconvenience.  Is this a common consensus? I feel discouraged to continue with this project now because of this.",

You know, a lot of Americans now work 70, 80 hour weeks. The life of a professor isn't too bad. If you can't make time for students, then you shouldn't be working with students at all. Graduate courses that teach interview techniques also often have assignments like this; it is critical for social science grad students (as an example) to understand how to interview, how to take notes, how to properly quote and attribute, how to transcribe, etc. Skills which are essential in political science and sociology. I'm sorry you work 50 - 60 hours a week. \n\nIf that is because you are doing more than most professors, perhaps overseeing an extracurricular club (as most universities require a faculty member to have an official 'club') - or if it is because you are doing a 4/4 teaching regimen like most professors at liberal arts institutions - then bully for you, politely decline and explain that you are simply too busy. You have zero right to tell another professor how to teach or what assignments are beneficial *for the students* \\- it isn't *about you* \\- it is about educating the students at your institution. Unfortunately, the attitude you present is exactly what is wrong with many professors who have lost sight of their educational mission and think the world revolves around their research (and, 99% of the time, I'm sorry to say - no one cares about your research except a handful of people doing the same thing - very little research, particularly in social sciences, actually affects policy outcomes or the like - admittedly, this is field dependent). Do you have office hours? Perfect time for students to have 20 minutes to sit down and ask you questions about what it is you do, how you go about it, why you are passionate about it, why you think other students should be too - instead you want to act like you know better than 'whoever is making these assignments'.\n\nI don't know why, and I really don't mean to sound offensive, but I found your comment rather disturbing - and one I've seen among a subset of professors at Purdue. They tend to be those that don't get along with other faculty members and who are rarely chosen to join dissertation committees (or refuse to). \n\nI've know professors who would barely speak to undergraduates, but would with grad students. Fact is, just like with people generally, some professors are just assholes who don't give a damn about students. They shouldn't be teaching, they shouldn't be within academia (aside from those focused on lab research in the natural sciences). If you find students inconvenient, and you are a professor, it really sounds like the problem is you - and a lack of passion for your profession and a total lack of respect for students and faculty members who teach in a way you don't like.",

Use questions that can only be answered by the individual being interviewed.

Hopefully, those students grades reflect their lack of enthusiasm. Any class is going to have its lazy students who don't care, and it's ambitious students who are fascinated by everything. Some are going to enjoy and get into these assignments, others aren't. However, for many fields understanding proper interview techniques is absolutely critical (this is especially true for graduate students in social sciences and history). Our political science graduate course on qualitative methodology involved two assignments involving interviews - one with a professor or other profession, one with a student - each on a different topic, and the assignments were very rigorous. Most everyone took it very seriously (you will have fewer undergrads take this sort of thing seriously, but anyone going into media studies, journalism, communication, polling, campaigning, etc. needs training *and practice* in proper interview techniques. \n\nThere is often too much self-segregation among different fields, and this has led to a widespread attitude that professors only need to give attention to students majoring in their field - perhaps minoring. I find this a rather insulting viewpoint, and one that undermines the gains we're finally making in promoting interdisciplinary studies. Part of the idea with some of these assignments is *precisely to interview someone from a field you know nothing about*  \\- this is really helpful when learning how to interview and if you are going to, for example, ever do field research for a dissertation then you need to know how to do this - it is critical training. Professors should be there for students - if I ever had a student reach out from a totally different field I always entertained it, so long as they could meet during office hours. I have always felt that education, that teaching - that is the real job of professors; research has become too dominant and universities are losing sight of students in some cases.\n\nThis is one reason why so much education had already begun moving online before the pandemic, which has exacerbated it (I read an article a few days ago suggesting that roughly 40% of adults who were in lockdown in the US took online courses during that time - hell, my husband actually got a TEFL certification during the lockdown). The kind of 'my research is my work, teaching is just what I have to do in order to be allowed to do my real work' attitude is part of what is driving students away from traditional university educations - and it is why tenure-track positions went from being a dime a dozen 15 years ago to almost impossible to find today.",
