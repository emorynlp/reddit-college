  "title:": "What do you do when you think the topic you got your PhD in is no longer research worthy?",
  "text": "I got my PhD in a topic related to a specific energy generating device. \n\nThis particular energy generating device has been researched continuously for the past 80+ years, and scientists have always said \"It's 10-15 years away from widespread public use.\" Yet, there is still zero successful commercialized products using this device. (There has been the odd \"Look it's actually possible\" device, but nothing worth mentioning.)\n\nAs a PhD in my position, I am expected to have a research group, but I do not believe that this particular energy generating device is worth researching anymore. If anybody is qualified to make that decision, it's me. I know more about these devices than 99.9% of all people in the world. I've seen/read the \"heyday\" of this device (30-40 years ago) and I've seen a decreasing interest ever since.\n\n**The simple fact is, we have better options nowadays.** Solar is great. Batteries are becoming great. This device doesn't have a leg to stand on anymore. They COULD BE useful for some very niche applications (manned space travel) but that's not really research worthy when we also have better options there (nuclear). Furthermore, no one wants to really fund it anymore. \n\nSo what do I, someone who spent 5 + 2 (grad school + post doc) years of my life researching these devices, do? I can't start researching something ELSE because my expertise isn't in something else. I could use one of the few techniques I learned while researching these devices and apply that to another problem, but I'm not an expert in any other problem so why would anybody trust anything I write? Furthermore, I'm not an expert in any of those techniques. I just... used them. (I mean, I know a lot about the techniques, and I'd be an expert to most people, but just because I know how to use a particular spectrometer doesn't mean I automatically know which problems I can apply it to.)\n\nI just feel so... lost. Like I've failed as a scientist. I didn't know any better when I started grad school that the TOPIC in which you did your PhD was important. I thought it was basically \"You get PhD, you qualify for all jobs that require PhD.\" No, it's more like \"You get PhD in a specific subject, you qualify for all jobs that are centered around that subject/technique.\" I know I should have ideas about problems to solve but I always run into the \"I don't know enough to know if this is worth researching.\" Do I sit down and spend weeks/months reading literature to figure out if it's worth researching? Is that my best course of action? \n\nMy expertise isn't marketable.... is what I'm saying. I don't know where to go from here.",

My grad PI for example mostly cared whether a postdoc applicant could answer hard questions about their current research, even if it was completely unrelated to our lab's work (rather than saying \"uh, this is the button my boss told me to press\"), under the assumption that such a person would learn our field quickly enough.",

As now an expert in one area, moving to an adjacent one is much easier.\n\nSo the trick is making sure your applications and resume/CV focus on your skills and capabilities, rather than how you speciaiised in this one tiny little niche on some particular subject. As an example - my PhD was in developing new experimental methods to explore the behaviours of weird flow type 1. My first postdoc was in evaluating computational models of weird flow 2. The fact I had no experience in computational evaluation, or in this weird flow 2 didn't matter, because the PI on the project could see that I had a good grasp of unusual flow dynamics, and a grounding in what real flows and deposits looked like that would transfer well to evaluating the outputs of numerical models. A few years down the line I ended up running a lab on another postdoc-type contract which had *absolutely nothing* to do with flows at all, but the PI saw that I had lots of practical skills and the ability to link experimental and numerical data, with a good handle on experiment design.",

When I started my apprenticeship as a research technician in biology after finishing school I had way different expectations what fields of biology are and totally different plans on in which field I wanted to work. In school you learn so far different things about biology that most biologists have nothing to do with. If I had followed my initial expectations I would have probably done either something focusing mainly on evolution or animal behaviour as that was most of what we learned about.  Totally different from what I now would or will do a PhD in. \nWhen I started university afterwards it was actually fun to see how all the other students changed their views of the field over time and learned about the actual fields most biologists work in and some current states of research but that was all still very late into the studies. Also I thought it was quite little we got to know about how far scientists actually are in those fields. Like for example we were told about how good the chances for alternative antibiotics are and how much research is done and needs to be done and how so many people should start focusing on that. But honestly if I now in my point of studying would decide to focus on that for like a PhD there probably would not be all too much big things to study there when I am there. There already is a lot happening with high potential and the situation probably will be a lot different in the 8 or so years I'd still need.\nI'm very lucky that my uni helps with that and offers seminars at the end of the bachelor degree to show recent research and the state of the field and give tips on where to go and where not. But apparently my uni is one of the few ones from what I heard. \n\nAlso I had absolutely no clue about how the whole thing with masters and PhDs work. Like I knew a master comes after bachelor and after studying longer you can someway get a PhD but nothing more.",

It's always been \"we just need the one super material to make fuel cells economically viable.\"\n\nAt this point it's too late. \n\nUnfortunately, my PhD wasn't in materials development, but rather characterizing degradation when fuel cells are operated using carbon containing fuels. \n\nMy post doc was in materials development... at least it was until I left. The project \"started\" as \"hey, can you do degradation studies on this material that we developed?\" When my initial research uncovered problems with their material (which two of the PhDs had patented), the relationship went downhill fast. I was ostracized and eventually forced out of the program because my research showed their material wasn't as good as they said it was, and I wasn't willing to lie and \"do more trials\" and \"only pick the good ones.\" When I refused to do that they told me to \"find another project.\" Of course, there was no other project, no other avenues of research other than those focused on their \"special material.\" It wasn't just me, 2 other post docs were also trying to replicate their results, and all failed. Except those 2 other post docs had projects to fall back on, I did not. (They were doing lifecycle analysis projects and had other things they could do that analysis on.)\n\nIn the end I figured out they never intended me to do any research. The grant I was hired under gave the lab $20,000 for ever semester I was there. (It was a grant from \"big oil\" trying to keep oil relevant.) This was supposed to be \"support for consumables/lab upkeep\" but instead, the first day I showed up they had paperwork for me to sign saying \"this is what we're buying with the money that's supposed to support your project.\" (None of the stuff ended up in the lab I worked in, but rather in the lab of the PhDs who patented the material.) This was before I even had keys for the lab. Long before the sham of \"you're being hired into a working fuel cell lab\" fell apart. When I did eventually get the keys (literally 3 months later), I found computers with windows 98, potentiostats from the late 80s and early 90s (which was the least of my complaints, they actually still worked well enough), and not a SINGLE working fuel cell rig that I could use. All of the mass flow controllers were so old they would only work on windows 7 with a hack I got from the company themselves. Well, I lie, there was ONE working rig... wanna guess who was using it? Wanna guess what I was told not to touch? Wanna guess what was running a multi 10s of thousands of hour degradation test so it wouldn't be finished even before I left? So another 6 months go by of me painstakingly ordering parts with what little money I had left to try to make this lab work again, I finally got everything \"up to snuff\" as it should be in a research lab. My first dozen or so experiments showed me why they didn't want me to actually have a working lab. Their material was awful, and their results couldn't be replicated by anybody \"outside\" of their lab. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong. This experience sucked, but I fell out of favor with fuel cells and electrochemical cells in general in the middle of my PhD, long before this all happened.",

I mean the papers I'm trying to publish are all about material development, be it for fuel cells or the ones I'm working in via collaborations. And that I believe this can help me establish myself in the area, even if not doing material development for fuel cells.  \n\n\n> I was ostracized and eventually forced out of the program because my research showed their material wasn't as good as they said it was, and I wasn't willing to lie and \"do more trials\" and \"only pick the good ones.\" \n\nThat is awful. Something like this happened with my research group, other people trying to replicate some results and that not happening, but I'm glad to say no one was punished for saying the truth, the material was just let go. It wasn't with fuel cells though, but gas separation. I guess this depends a lot on the research group and the country you're in. I guess I just assume everyone is from the US. I'm from Brazil and, because we don't have a lot of private funding, I feel we have much less pressure to only do research if it's going to generate profit. The goal is for it to be applied, of course, but fundamental research exists. At least it did, we are not at a good moment for science right now around here.  \n\n\n> In the end I figured out they never intended me to do any research.  \n\nThe whole paragraph is scary, so I'm just gonna use it to mark what I'm replying to. Your experience sounds absolutely terrifying. It doesn't sound like there is anything good that came out of it. From what it's worth, I'm sorry. Not that it makes a difference, but I am. I mean, I understand people wanting their materials to be good, but if it isn't actually good, for how long do they intend to try to pretend it is? It's not gonna last forever. If only they can replicate their results, what purpose does it have? I get it's complicated. If you turn science into an endless search for profits, people get entangled in the system and get defensive when they're scared they will lose their grants for not generating profits. But pretending something works when it doesn't will only delay the inevitable.  \n\n\n>Now, don't get me wrong. This experience sucked, but I fell out of favor with fuel cells and electrochemical cells in general in the middle of my PhD, long before this all happened. \n\nI get that. I'm still interested in the subject and I guess still hopeful it could go somewhere, but your post did put some things in perspective for me. The fact that I read it and immediately thought \"fuel cells?\" is probably a bad sign. Here in Brazil things are a little different. We write projects so we can get the postdoc, but the money is for our salary, not for the project itself. We need to determine who our supervisors will be and prove the labs already have the infrastructure, because the project being approved doesn't mean a lot of money for it to be done. So I get to choose what I will write as my project. It's definitely going to be something for material development, but I will think more deeply about the area.",
