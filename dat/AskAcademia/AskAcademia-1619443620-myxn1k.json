  "text": "Since a year back I am holding an instructor position at an ivy league school and I am miserable. I am supposed to be excited and look for the opportunities-grants-my own research questions. I fought hard to get this position, but I am dragging myself out of bed every day. Sundays I have anxiosity and I dont sleep more than 2h a night. I dont know whats wrong with me. An academic career was all I ever wanted. I sacrificed everything for it- constant moving countries (5x), no family,no partner, I have aquintances all over the world but no friends or feeling of belonging anywhere.\n\nI am currently seeing a therapist because, prior to this I was 10y a post doc, in a toxic place with high abuse of people. My strategy to survive was to put my head down and work harder, but the price was that I became exhausted- leading 5 different projects at any time, doing the experiements with only help from 1 undergrad, writing grants for my boss but never getting recogniton, 2 conferences in 10y was our allowance...you get the drill. There was no time or energy for personal relationships. Yes, I got publications but for a TT job it was not enough.\n\nNow, I am on this 2 year contract, in a new country, in the middle of pandemic. I have almost no funding, but I got one RA.  Everything has been painfully slow. Because of lockdowns my experiments are behind. The leadership in the department is struggling to aquire funding and they have asked me to provide them with a strategy-because if they get money, I get money. And I am trying to use my collaborations in the world and create a program grant. Not sure if this should be on me, because if it fails they still have positions but I have nothing. Frankly, I have never put together a 2.5 milion program grant before.\n\nMy advisor is a clinician that never had anyone with my background-or seniority-to mentor. His advise for me is to ask his post doc of 2 years to join the project- like a new pair of hands. \n\n I am also not happy in this country.  I have been isolated for a year and I have no social network, and besides my therapist- no support. Maybe I  am just not being honest with myself, maybe I am beating a dead donkey. I am just deeply heartbroken.",

I did the reverse, had an industry research job and switched to PhD which im in now, and felt 99% of what the OP is doing. Plain fact is switching careers and most likely moving again isnt going to immediately get you friends or an SO, and will probably just make it take even longer. \n\nAll of this is a non-issue if its specifically academia holding the OPs personal life back, but I kinda doubt it. If you spend 10 years putting everything except your career on hold, youre only gonna be ready to fix career issues",

          "text": "Agreed. I've met so many people in academia (and also in a few other professions) who had a fantasy about being an academic long before they had any understanding of the reality of academia. Then when academia isn't what they expect, they refuse to accept their expectations were wrong and spend years drifting in search of the promised land being miserable and unhappy. \n\nThe sad and unpleasant reality is that there are few places interested in someone who did 10 years of postdoc and hasn't landed a faculty position. Industry on the other hand (and a handful of research institutes) are far less interested in whether people hit arbitrary career milestones at the right moment and much more interested in skills and vision.",

Don't underestimate the impact of this on your experiences right now. \n\nPerhaps trying to engage in these social aspects of life will also help with some of your experiences at work?  Is there some local group you can join to share some common hobbies with others maybe once per week or month? For me, I know this helped, but the process was slow due to pandemic-related challenges.

Here's what worked for me before:  take a weekend off, go for a walk, get some air, and start daydreaming about what your ideal position would be like (including working conditions). What did you want to be doing at this point in your career? Where do you want to be in the future? Can you find a vision that sparks something inside you?  \n\nFinding a vision won't solve anything per se, but if you have a clear idea of what you want -- and can feel how good it'll be to have it -- then you'll have the motivation to start making the necessary changes towards it.  Be mindful of other motives that might be getting in the way of that vision too. In my case, I found chasing prestige was killing my creativity and love of research. \n\nThis is probably terrible advice for most people (and you certainly shouldn't follow it) but I tried to forget about papers and grants for awhile, and allowed myself to relax and play again. Not worrying about falling behind my peers helped tremendously.",

When we were called into boss office for our weekly dose of shouting or being degraded to idiots, I could dissociate and think about that random stranger that was kind to me...I still believe in kindness and I have developed high treshold for pain. Its just that now, I dont recognize myself anymore, if that makes sense. I look at myself in the mirror and I dont know where 10 years went. I dont regret things, I just dont know whats next.\n\nLike most of us, I went into science, not for money but to make a difference by solving challenging biological questions.

From personal experience, when I started questioning my identity and future it felt like my whole life was unravelling.\n\nReevaluating foundational assumptions can be painful, but it's also giving you a blank canvas on which you can recreate yourself. Surprisingly, I found the movie Tomorrowland to be particularly helpful in this regard.  As a children's film, it's a bit out of place mentioning it here, but its themes of hope and optimism helped dig me out of the funk I'd fallen into. ([Clip here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oif6ASSDe-c))\n\nYour comment on having a tribe also resonated with me. Unfortunately the high-stress, high-churn nature of academia seems to be particularly poorly-suited to building these deep relationships. Don't have an answer on that front, but if you ever want to talk about these things with a non-judgemental stranger, drop me a DM. I'm not the most prompt at replying, but I'll be happy to chat.",

      "text": "I'm on the same boat, except I don't want to stay in academia, never apply for a grant, and I have my husband. I stay because of interesting research projects that keep stimulating my mind, and because I need time to get my GC.   \nI have worked in different research labs and carefully watched how PIs run their labs. I see how challenging PI's job is, how PIs play politics with each other, how PIs have to deal with special Ph.D. students and nightmare collaborators.\n\nMany of the PIs whom I worked with stay single, or if they got married and have kids, a few years down the road in their professorship, their job duties ruin their marriages, if their spouse doesn't work in the same lab. I also had an opportunity to observe an old professor who was kicked out by the university because he's in his early 70s and didn't bring funding to the university for some years. It was very sad, he still came in every day, young and new people didn't bother to greet him, and he didn't have his office anymore. They took his office to make room for a new faculty member. He had to close his lab, so new faculty could start a new lab.\n\nI have seen PIs who established their lab for 10 years but still struggling to find solid research questions/direction and lacking leadership, management, and collaborative skills, so their lab can't take off even though they got good funding due to the supports from their former bosses.\n\nPersonally, I think, if you don't have a passion/call for a specific research topic, if you are interested in many research topics like I do, if you don't develop a solid research question/direction, or don't bother to obtain leadership, management, collaborative, and politic skills, please don't waste tax money and your personal life by becoming a PI. \n\nTo OP, I think loneliness is touching your soul. Besides, you have given to academia for a long time but the rewards couldn't be compensated, so your resentful level starts to rise up and that bothers you. It's also a good sign though... I was there 6 years back, then I made some changes. \n\nI treat my postdoc work as a 9-10 hours/day job. Evenings and most of the weekends are my time. It's annoying at the beginning and at many times I fought between going to work during the weekends or not.  But that feeling faded since I developed new interests in other fields like psychology, human interactions/politics of promotion, the stock market... Reading a lot about these fields help me to understand why I was at that place. After that, I pushed myself out to date, luckily met my husband. Now, I know what next steps are for my career, and what I want for my life besides work, so I know when I need to stop a working day and go home. Sometimes, I still slide back to the old habit of overworking, but the marriage life reminds me that if I want a happy life, I need to balance between my work and personal needs.\n\nHope that gives you some ideas to improve your situation.",

Although I still work in academia I decided to head down a different career path. I probably could have gone the tenure track in my country but in the US it was just bonkers how rigid they were, and even the big research universities seemed to struggle with people who hadn't come through the US system. I'm now a senior member of staff in a leading institute which operates quite differently - it blows my mind how many good people are lost to academia because of this rigidity.",

I kept thinking that the reason for my depression were irrelevant but due to the pandemic and some other reasons I came back to my home country (I was also living away). In the beggining just to work remotely but after 6 months I took a sabbatical and got another job. Now, this allowed me to try something different without having to let go of the \"dream\" of academia. I feel more relaxed, connected and fullfilled than I have felt for many many years. And this, during a pandemic! The only thing hard now, is that I need to tell the university that I am not returning at the end of my sabbatical. For me, life was better on the other side. Perhaps it will also be for you. Do not hold so tight to the academic dream. It might be an illusion.",

      "text": "I've been through a similar path, where many of my grant applications have gone nowhere, despite working tirelessly and with great teams, and amazing research data. \n\nI hope to give an economic explanation, that will at least provide insight and clarity of why, and solutions forward. \n\n1. There is a massive influx of scientists into this field due to the university sector pyramid scheme. They sell millions of student courses, degrees and PHDs. Also like me, they found science/medical research sexy. \n2. There is no supply central control of scientists into the field. Unlike Medicine or Big Four accounting firms (graduate programs)/ Defence Force. While there are big budgets for research, there is no system that projects what the number of scientists should be based on the budget. In Medicine Big four accounting and Defnece force, they calculate backward, based on the needs and demands of the global requirements, and their measured turnover. \n3. There is little to no monetary Return on Investment on Institutional research. In the scenario 2 above, it would be ok to train an infinite amount of 'app' developing software programmers, because they would then make apps that make money for companies, that would then pay them a cut. However, scientists usually 99.9% of the time don't make money from their research, they produce publications and data. However, they can't eat, or pay the bills with publications and data.\n4. Grants are an economically unsustainable method for sustaining continued long term financing both projects and salaries. As we have seen in socialist and Marxists economics, it is very difficult to control economies based on central planning. Inevitably, something falls thru the cracks, or some error gap in the system, starts getting bigger and bigger. Capitalistic industries and economies (though have weaknesses), are dynamic, fluid and self-correcting. A boss will redirect an employee's job or role to ensure the company continues to make money for example thus paying for the employee. A common mythology in research funding is 'this small grant will lead to a big grant' ' this big grant will lead to further big grants' etc. How can everyone all get big grants? the only way this can happen is if research funding exponentially grows faster than the research is completed. However a country usually fixes their research funding at 0.2-3% GDP every year.     \n\nSolution: \n\nBoth Scientists and institutions are to blame for this messed up economics, which wrecks pple's careers. Its evolved over many decades, however the solution is to bring research back to it's original origins, which was to develop a new product or service, which can be commercialised and sold for money. With this money, you use this to pay yourself a wage. \n\nMy challenge here is to take responsibility for the value of the research that you create, and to channel it into something that people will pay money for. If someone is willing to pay money for it then it is of value, and your research is of value. If no-one is willing to pay money for it, be it a company, the medical field, hospital, patient, etc. Then it has no value.\n\n**TLDR: Align yourself in a supply chain that produces or supplies an in-demand product or service.**",

However, essentially you are starting over. \n\nI dont believe this bs \"if you cant make it academia you go to industry\"- it is a lie they tell us to control us so they can feel better about themselves and we can continue to invest into their dreams while burning ours. However, industry jobs are also tough to get because of so many PhDs trying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course I agree on the last paragraph referring to entrepreneurship.",

No wonder you feel miserable- you are living in a war zone: a civil war.\n\n Worse still- you are at an Ivy League college where the hatred is at the highest level. \n\n No one outside rich politicians, their friends/family n donors is happy. \n\n   Find another country. Or go home. Please do not be miserable in a country whose leaders entire existence is to make us more miserable. \n  Not worth it.",

I need stability, somewhere where  I actually can set some roots.\n\nBut I do agree with you that Ivy league colleges are a trap. The previous lab, loved international post docs because of the \"visa threat\". It is a super powerful motivation to produce data when you can be cancelled by the end of the week, which sucks for an H1B.",

I think it might help you to take a step back from the big picture and your life goals and aspirations, and instead to think about what might make you happier right now. THen you could always adjust your long term plans and goals accordingly is what is makes you happy no longer matches. Is there another department, another job, or activity you could try out?",

I think the taking a weekend or week off to do something entirely different is excellent advice. You have the credentials, experience and drive to do big things and none of those things need to be done right where you are now. \n\nFinding literal coping strategies for the year until the contract is up will be important. Hobbies, job hunting, house hunting in a different place, TikTok (\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), writing poetry that lampoons your school, anything that buoys you on your way out of this contract. Anything to keep your head above water. Consider perhaps that you are already done, so going in isn\u2019t a life sentence. It\u2019s ok if this dream dies. There is always another dream. Always.",
