  "text": "I\u2019m curious to know what are the defining moments or reasons that propelled you into a pathway towards PhD and perhaps, subsequently tenure track and lifelong pursuits in academia?\n\nI\u2019ve been accepted to a PhD program - after a decade of working in research from start ups, large global organizations, to universities. With all this experience, I feel like I should know by now but I don\u2019t - and how could you know without going for it? What was it that prompted you to dive in?",

My favorite part of working with other people is generating ideas together, which research involves a ton of \n3. I love writing, constructing arguments, and I get sucked in to data analysis \n4. I resent censorship and I\u2019ve seen how power can constrain truth in other sectors \n5. I get bored easily and I need a lot of novelty, stimulation, and opportunities to work across multiple projects\n6. Working on substantively important topics is way more valuable to me than money or free time even \n\nI\u2019d say if you check all of those boxes you\u2019re in the right place.",

The publish or perish element doesn\u2019t really sway me, I think it\u2019s important to present your ideas and experiments often and in a coherent way to ensure you are doing good science. The ideas themselves can be published if the work is sound on its own merit and relevance, even if there\u2019s no clear way to monetize the findings in the near future. \n\nAnd, similarly, there\u2019s simply no avoiding deadlines in either academia or industry. It might affect the overall \u201cpurity\u201d of the work but unfortunately there\u2019s simply no way to avoid this in almost any career. \n\nI\u2019m at a big and competitive research intensive school but there are still many faculty members who I admire considerably who have the intellectual freedom to ask questions and pursue topics that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a company setting. For me, lifting those constraints is a big reason I\u2019m open to a career in academia.",

After reflecting, I do feel like I\u2019ve dodged a bullet, though. In my time there, I really felt like I had to push and believe in a product I didn\u2019t have the time to understand completely yet, and I lost myself a little bit in the process. Despite the blow of getting fired, I realised that I feel truest to myself most when I\u2019m doing research, and having that \u2018intellectual freedom\u2019 to challenge and discuss ideas, rather than \u2018believing\u2019 in something I wasn\u2019t sure was going to work.

              "text": "Sure, no problem: After my MSc in economics I worked for the Dutch federal government, mostly on international economics (stuff like: how to help businesses go abroad, how to get embassies to help them). After 2 years I applied to an economics trade magazine where I worked as an editor. Lots of contributions from academia in that magazine and it really got me reinvested in academia. In the Summer of 2009, I decided to make a real effort to get into a PhD program. From there, I did two things: 1. Kept my eyes open for any PhD opportunities, and 2. Took some time on evenings and holidays to write a research proposal for a PhD (on international economics - took about a month of full time work all in all). In economics, it's somewhat common that you work on your own proposed research for a PhD, although there are also PhDs with predefined subjects, usually when they are funded externally.   \n  \nIn October of 2009, I applied for a PhD on banking in the Netherlands with a supervisor with an excellent reputation, and in December I applied for a PhD with my own proposal in an Italian research institute. I figured these would be the first in a line of rejections, but surprisingly I was invited for an interview at both. Likely I got lucky that most students didn't start looking until after the Christmas break. I aced the banking PhD interview and did fairly mediocre in Italy and they liked me enough at the banking position to take me on. So: I suppose my advice is to make an honest effort, put in the work, don't dismiss too many opportunities and get slightly lucky.  \n  \nBy the way, disclaimer: the academic job market is horrible, a PhD is unlikely to lead to an academic job.",

      "text": "I decided as a sophomore in college that I wanted to pursue an academic career, but it was some time in high school (probably around age 16) that I decided I wanted to do a Ph.D. and go into research. My HS biology teacher had a Ph.D. and left a research career in botany to teach (and raise horses) after losing his teen daughter to a rare genetic disorder. He was inspiring, encouraging, and a good role model so I wanted to be like him. Chose my college based entirely on biology/chemistry offerings and facilities...then by the end of my first year had shifted entirely into the humanities.\n\nSimilarly, it was several role models among my college faculty that inspired me to become an academic-- I went to an SLAC and wanted a career centered around teaching. In the late 80s when I was an undergrad everyone was talking about the looming shortage of faculty as all those hired in the 1960s boom hit retirement age. Many of my mentors said things like \"I've discouraged students from doing Ph.D.s for years, but things are changing now and the timing is great!\" Turns out they were all wrong, as was the collective voice of academia, as in the 1990s the retirements didn't happen and when people did finally leave they were often replaced by adjuncts.\n\nIn any case, I knew I wanted to do a Ph.D. at age 15-16, but then it was largely \"This is as high as one can go, and I want to do that.\" By 19-20 I had a much better idea of what that meant and several mentors who were encouraging me to do so. I earned two MAs and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. and due to good timing/luck/ideal preparation landed a full time position while ABD and a TT job at an SLAC the year I finished my Ph.D.. That was almost 25 years ago.\n\nMy advice to my students now is **not to pursue a Ph.D**. unless they can answer yes to these three questions: 1) **can you do it without going into debt?**, 2) **do you have a** ***primary*** **career goal that is** ***not*** **related to a traditional academic career?**, and 3) **are you prepared for the long-term impacts of not earning any money, not saving for retirement, not owning a home, and not advancing your career through the entire decade of your 20s?**  If they answer \"no\" to any of those then they should take another path.",

If that's what you want and it happens, *mirabilis deus*, congratulations! But you should have a much more likely/secure *primary* plan for a career. In many STEM fields that means an industry path. In many social science fields that might mean government, business, NGOs, etc.  For the humanities? It usually means *don't get a Ph.D.* because it's going to cost you ten years of your life, a decade of lost income, and you may still have no job at the end.",

So your primary career goals may be working in the industry, working for a company developing tools for the industry, working as an advanced research or medical lab tech (although this is already getting dangerously academic and underpaid). Etc. Anything that is good for you, but is NOT academia. You may pretend that it is your 'alternative track', if academia doesn't work out, but /u/SnowblindAlbino 's point is that it needs to be good enough for a flip, to be considered 'primary'. Because objectively speaking, so much random luck is involved in academic careers, that becoming a faculty is always the less probable outcome. Possible, but very much not guaranteed, due to dumb luck.",

Without tenure as a carrot most of the incentives of academia aren't worth much-- if I didn't have tenure I would have pursued a much more lucrative career path and retired at 55. Instead, I have job security while I will need since I'll have to work to 65 before I can afford to retire due to the low pay in academic in general (barring, of course, elite institutions, certain fields with significant competition from industry, etc.).",

So the very existence of a job where I can do what I want is a plus of course, otherwise I'd likely be working for government on projects defined by someone else. That said, the freedom to work as I wish isn't necessarily what I'd trade for money money and retiring a decade earlier! The job *security* of tenure is however.",

I was self aware enough to know that I could never function in the \u201creal world\u201d, whatever that means - or at least that I don\u2019t think I would be successful in it. \n\nFrom then, I devoted myself to building the skills and CV necessary to be competitive on the academic job market. Along the way, I learned more and more about what academia was really like. Colleagues of mine grew disillusioned or simply didn\u2019t really want to be in academia and abandoned the pursuit in favor of starting their own studios or other careers. I grew to love academia more and more, in spite of its many faults. At its best, it\u2019s amazing. At its worst...well, we all know. Of course, I\u2019ve also had amazing role models along the way. \n\nI am now finishing my second year as full time faculty in a non-tenure track position at an R1 university, and beginning as a tenure track faculty member at a competing R1 with one of the premiere programs for my sub-discipline next fall. \n\nI don\u2019t know that there was one or two defining moments for me, I just continued to fall in love with it more and more. Not just my field, but all the other stuff too. The collegiality, the students, the pursuit of knowledge. All of this, to me, outweighs some of my deep criticisms of the system (the commodification of higher ed, increasing admin, etc). Even the service aspect: I\u2019m non-TT right now, but I\u2019ve managed to avoid the service appointments I\u2019m not jazzed about by volunteering early (and often) for the ones that I think are good uses of my time. \n\nEven at my lowest points, I never stopped loving academia. That could, of course, change very easily as I enter the tenure-track. But, for the most part, I don\u2019t really see that happening. That isn\u2019t to say I didn\u2019t have my doubts early on - I did change majors only to come back to my original major a year later in undergrad, and I almost left the field after my masters degree. Those had less to do with the field as they did with some personal struggles. \n\nSorry for the ramble, but hopefully that communicated a bit of my journey.",

At this stage I was pretty convinced that's what I wanted to do, then I did a postdoc overseas and got a taste of research as a job. I didn't have classes, exams, teaching assistant duties or anything. I just needed to be in the lab to research and I was assigned to a few PhD students in a mentoring role and that's when I really knew that's what I was gonna go for. I was extremely fortunate to have a postdoc supervisor who strongly promotes their early career researchers and we had \"the talk\" one day about what I wanted. I told them I wanted to be a group leader and they said \"ok great! But it means I will be holding you to a different standard and I will demand more from you because publications, for better or worse, are the tickets into academia\" I agreed, and the rest is history.\n\nWhile it's an extremely hard, and stressful line of work, I get to develop ideas and mentor PhD students and still get in the lab every now and then and pry one more small secret away from the Universe about how it works.

Undergrads were a top priority, and we were treated like grad students due to the rigor of the school, so I had a general sense of what I was getting myself into. Fortunately, I was advised by my sociology minor advisor to consider comm/media studies as opposed to English literature (my undergrad major) given my scholarly interests--as well as the realities of the job market for English PhDs.",

      "text": "I worked at research institutes during and after my undergrad and then went to a top PhD program in my field. I knew I always wanted to be a scientist ever since middle school, I was fascinated by the prospect of discovering something new and learning how the universe worked. My father was a scientist and professor (different field from mine) and I was always fascinated. \n\nHowever, life had a few other plans. During my graduate school years I had mental health issues and I could not deal with the isolation and culture shock that came with being in a new country. I got my masters and left, took nearly a year off to recover. Decided to get into biotech/ industry. I\u2019ve been in a few biotech and government jobs and although I love the work life balance, I have more free time to pursue my hobbies etc, get paid a reasonable wage, I have realized I very badly miss research. \n\nI miss being the in the lab, doing experiments that lead to pieces of a puzzle. I miss the intellectual freedom to pursue literally whatever I like and follow where the research goes. I miss the collaborative and open nature of academic science. I strongly feel that\u2019s where I need to be, and something big is missing from my life. I\u2019m hesitant because the path to a tenure track position is uncertain and difficult but if I don\u2019t at least try my best I will regret it. \n\nI plan on applying to PhD programs again after working in industry for about 4 years and a total break from academia for about 5 years. I actually feel like this experience and perspective will help me do better this time. It\u2019s too soon to tell how things will go after that, but academia is my goal for sure because I can\u2019t imagine working where I am much longer, it is not my thing and doesn\u2019t stimulate me anymore despite working in an impactful public health job.",

      "text": "I\u2019m only just starting to appreciate that research might be the path I want to take, and even then, who knows - I might not stay in it forever.\n\nI pretty much went to university to keep learning because I enjoyed it, but I was definitely a bang average student (psychology). I was thinking about a masters in my final year, but I\u2019d started a relationship at the time so didn\u2019t want to move cities. After undergrad at 21, I went into industry positions, but I kept moving around and after a year in a particularly bad job (toxic boss) and going through a breakup, I finally realised that I wanted to do something for myself, continue with my education and get my MSc. I wanted to get my MSc to continue to being a practitioner in the field, but learning more about it, this required another 3 years of training, unpaid positions. I therefore wanted to explore the PhD route, as I enjoyed the aspect of working in the field, but in a different way.\n\nAfter my MSc, I was actively looking for PhD positions, but honestly still wasn\u2019t sure that academia was for me. I had (and still have, every so often) imposter syndrome and I was really lucky (and considered myself a bit of a fraud) to get into a PhD at the university I\u2019d been studying at. It took me until the publishing of my first paper in 2019 to realise that I actually am fairly decent at research, I can write well, and I\u2019m enjoying what I\u2019m doing.\n\nI still always thought I wanted to be in industry, though, right up until the end of my PhD (past 6 months). I was becoming jaded with how PhD students were treated, and wanted to get out into a permanent job. I landed myself an industry position that I thought I could get on board with and it was also permanent - but 8 weeks in, they realised they needed someone completely different for the role (I.e not with my background and research experience), and I was let go. I\u2019ve said in a previous post, but it made me realise three things:\n\n1. I lost my sense of self and what I enjoyed, even in two months of an industry job. I felt I had no intellectual freedom and had to 100% believe in this product that I\u2019d only just learned about.\n2. I was getting nostalgic for research, and missed discussing my projects with passion.\n3. Even permanent jobs aren\u2019t permanent. You can be fired, let go or made redundant. Just because you\u2019re in a permanent job doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay longer than being in a contracted research role.\n\nI really missed research and it\u2019s taken a bit of soul searching since I lost the job, but I needed to separate my PhD experience to what research could be. Whether it\u2019s academia or alt-ac, I want to research and push my intellectual boundaries. I\u2019m happy with the development of my research skills and I\u2019m excited to see where they could go and improve.\n\nEveryone knows that academia isn\u2019t perfect, but the grass isn\u2019t always greener in industry either. I\u2019d say, that if you\u2019re a curious person, enjoy learning and contributing to new knowledge, then an academic position should be considered. I\u2019ve stopped caring so much about the length of contract and being a good researcher is my overall aim.",

I've met a fair number of people in academia who loved the concept of doing research but ended up leaving because they didn't enjoy what they were doing on a day-to-day basis. Personally, I've always been super drawn to the overall concept of doing research and making novel discoveries, but I think I really knew it was the right career for me when I realized how much I was enjoying the day-to-day work as well.",

      "text": "I went to an R1 state school in my state for undergraduate because it was there, it was good, and it was affordable. I decided to pursue a relatively interdisciplinary major as preparation for law school, and was on track to graduate in three years and go off to study the law. \n\nAbout a month before I was supposed to graduate, a professor wrote on a draft of my seminar paper: \"you should seriously consider graduate school.\" I went in and talked to him and learned - much to my surprise - that there was this thing called \"funding\". \n\nAbout two weeks later, I went and sat in on a class with my housemate, and the professor went on this incredibly inspirational rant about work and doing something with your life. I'd been questioning law school, and now it was done: I knew what my real passion was. \n\nTo pursue that, I needed another major and another language, so I went and declared that and spent another year in undergraduate. With the help of an amazing advisor, I went to a good PhD program in that area, and - slowly but steadily - worked my way up. \n\nNext year, I'm starting my \\*third\\* full-time permanent job. I'm not gonna glamorize it; it has been a long journey, full of disappointment and debt, but with a few pleasant surprises. Overall, though, that gut reaction nearly 20 years ago was right.",
