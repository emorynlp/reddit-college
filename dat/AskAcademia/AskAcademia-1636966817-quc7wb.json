          "text": "Not a teacher but I have an XP Pen Artist Pro 15.6 inch tablet - I got it instead of a Wacom Cintiq because it's a lot cheaper and had good reviews. It's decent but requires three cables to plug it in - either one power and two USB or three USB. Not sure how that compares to a Cintiq.\n\nIt works great though, once it's set up properly (which can be a bit of a faff). It's essentially an extra monitor that you can write and draw on. It needs to be recalibrated from time to time but I would have thought most tablets do - also I tend to use mine for drawing, so the pressure sensitivity is more important to me than it might be just for writing or drawing diagrams.\n\nAnyway, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than a Wacom and works well, so might be worth considering.",

I thought you meant the higher end ones though - there are cheaper ones like the Intuos and Graphire that don't double as monitors, I assume you mean ones like that? I used to have a Graphire 4 and they're good too! It takes a bit of getting used to to look at the screen rather than the pad when you're drawing but they work very well.",

      "text": "I\u2019m an undergrad (pre-dental) doing immunology research as part of an internship. I\u2019ve been feeling super discouraged lately because I\u2019ve messed up a couple times on big things over the two semesters I\u2019ve been working in this lab, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how terrible and lazy my mentor must think I am. I just wanted to say how I\u2019ve messed up, and could the professors let me know how they\u2019d feel if they had a student like this? \n\n1. When I wasn\u2019t getting good sleep and struggling with personal issues and anxiety, I would show up to biweekly lab meetings tired and yawning, though I\u2019d take notes and ask questions because I was trying my hardest to pay attention. My mentor pulled me aside to tell me if this was a job, I\u2019d be fired. I was super embarrassed and ashamed because he was right, and I apologized and also told him I was struggling with some things and not getting sleep. \n\n2. Over the summer, I went from going to the lab at 9 am to going at 10 am. I was still working the full 8 hours each day, but I just started going later. Part of it was because he said he didn\u2019t care about what time/how many hours, he cared more about progress. But actually he was tracking these things. He mentioned it to me that he noticed I was coming later.\n\n3. A few months ago, I was doing an experiment with long incubation times. I mean a full week of waiting, times 3. I still needed to go to the lab multiple times a week, so I was scheduling meetings and stuff during research time. (I would ask the grad students for stuff to do, ask the research assistant for tasks, walk around and look for things to do, and then read papers if there was nothing, but there\u2019s only so many times you can do that.) Anyways, my mentor pulled me aside then and told me I needed to make research more of a priority and he basically said I wasn\u2019t passionate about it. I apologized and have been working harder, and today he said he\u2019s satisfied with my work these past few months. But that just made me feel like he hated me before. \n\nThis is not to say that I sit around in the lab all day\u2014I do my best when I can, and my mentor has commented on some of the good things I\u2019ve done (histochemical staining, scanning, mouse brain perfusions, looking for relevant info in different papers, planning experiments carefully and asking questions). But I feel like I appear lazy and incompetent due to my mistakes. What do you think?",

I am really interested in plants and would love to do a masters and PhD within this area of biology. \nI found a research based masters program that really interests me and so I brought it up to my undergrad advisor during a meeting. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t pursue it as I wouldn\u2019t have employable skills and should instead learn programming/ data visualization. Is plant biology not a good idea? (I also found a professor at my university who does PhD topics that really fit with my interests for later.) I feel quite down as I would much prefer to do research with plants rather than do data visualization for a company. Should I follow what my advisor says or do what interests me? Will I end up unemployed if I do plant biology?",

Schoolwork is doing fine, but I have separate commitments to two labs and feel paralyzed on both.\nIts seriously making me question continuing on in academia, if I cant even cut it doing research in undergrad. Do grad students hit this same wall, is this normal? How do you deal with it?? I cant even imagine 6 years of problem solving all on one project, it seemed like the best choice even a year ago but now I want to cut my losses & run. \nIdk if this is burnout or how to even address it? If anyone felt this way in undergrad, what did you end up doing?",
