      "text": "I use Adobe Illustrator. I learned Illustrator really early on (I studied both art and biology in undergrad) so it's been my go-to for diagrams, figures, illustrations, etc.   \n\nI've tried out some other programs that are more focused on flow chart functionality, but I've only used them for organizing information as a part of the design process rather than developing a final result. For example, something like [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [yED](https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/) will resize/reorient connecting arrows/lines when you move an node, so it makes mind-mapping a lot easier. Even though this feature is nice, when I want to make a diagram for display/visual communication, I go back to Illustrator because it has more tools/features for design (and lots of capabilities to manipulate specific elements).",
