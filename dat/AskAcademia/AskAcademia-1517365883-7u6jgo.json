  "text": "I just did a Google Scholar search for \"A tale of two\" excluding articles on Dickens.  It produced nearly 8,000 separate results such as \"A tale of two market failures: Technology and environmental policy\", \"Dioxygen activation and methane hydroxylation by soluble methane monooxygenase: a tale of two irons and three proteins.\"  So my question is: Is this the worst cliche in academic writing or are there others that are just as bad or worse?\n\nI realize that this isn't a life or death question, but it galls me every time I see it.",
