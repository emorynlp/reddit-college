  "title:": "What's so significant about reading/analysing scientific papers?",
  "text": "Hey guys. I am a first-year enrolled into an undergraduate biology degree (majoring in molecular biology). What I'm asking about, is perhaps the most different, yet challenging work that I've been facing since transitioning from high school. For almost any subject, I get given assignments/tasks in regards to reading research papers and summarising it. But the thing is, I probably understand less than 20% of what's in the actual article itself. I only understand basic phrases like \"this treatment was shown to be effective,\" or \"placebo was given to the control group,\" etc. I understand nothing in things in the brackets with all the numbers. \n\nBut I'm okay with not understanding complex words/mathematical notations, because that's attributed to my own lack of knowledge and I can always find what they mean by looking them up. My main question is, why do we need to read such complex papers that take us ages to dissect and understand? Why can't we just go to a published textbook or a reliable website and find the exact same set of information, but written in simple language that could only take me a couple minutes to understand? Like why is my university trying so hard to get their students to develop this skill? Some websites say papers are more reliable, but how do we know that this information is any more reliable than what we see in textbooks anyways?\n\nI really want some valuable information/criticism to get me to appreciate what's so great about scientific papers. I really need some advice. Thanks in advance.",

Use whatever tools you find helpful - youtube, books, websites, blogs - whatever.  \n\nWe do not do research solely using text books as they tend to be a bit dated, while papers show the edge.  Science is about expanding the edge of what we know - the problem is, it takes a hell of a lot of hard work to know where that edge is.....",

By reading the original papers, you get away from that. \n\nPapers are important because they are where all of the data in your textbook originates.",

Use the textbooks and whatever resources you have to gain a better understanding of what you're given to read. But it's not just cutting edge knowledge that this exercise is meant to get you acquainted with. It's also methodology, vocabulary, how a good paper is supposed to look like and read like.\n\n\n\nThe time and place for textbook learning is in high school.
