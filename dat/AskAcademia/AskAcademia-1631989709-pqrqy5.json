  "title:": "Do I really not want to do a PhD or is the \"online classes\" that are making it extremely boring?!",
  "text": "I'm a final year masters student, I'm doing my masters in Biotechnology from a reputed University in my country. \nThe catch is : it's online. \nIt has been that way since day 1, thanks to covid. Now that I'm approaching the end of my masters (almost), I kind of feel that this is not for me. \nI don't enjoy reading scientific papers, I don't think I enjoy learning the subject too. I don't think I have that much interest in the subject that would make me want to pursue a PhD in it. I see other students passionately discussing scientific stuff in classes while I think what I am really doing here, I'm not enjoying myself. It isn't a bad course, I feel I'm done following this path, something tells that this isn't for me, the whole academia life, publishing papers and doing a PhD for five years, I'm not inclined towards it. \nBUT, \nI'm confused whether all of this is actually true or is it because everything is online and I'm not able to do any lab work which would (I'm guessing) make a lot of difference. I know there are a few topics that interest me such as cancer immunology, but other than that I don't think I'm that interested in it to actually want to go and do some research on it. \n\nIs this because my course is online or am I not really into getting a PhD? I do think it's the latter, but reassurance always helps lol. \n\nHow sure is one supposed to feel if they are going for a PhD?",

You don\u2019t like classes, you don\u2019t like reading papers, you don\u2019t like discussing concepts and you don\u2019t like lab work, at least in an academic setting. \n\nNothing wrong with any of that. Masters out, find a job where you enjoy the key aspects involved. Academia isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s just as well seeing as way more PhDs are produced than there are academic jobs waiting for them. Not to mention you can find better pay in industry. \n\nHave a think about what you enjoy doing and what a job involving those things looks like. Also if you listen to podcasts then check out **Hello PhD**, the two hosts have fairly informal but structured chats about getting through grad school and beyond. Or choosing not to. Episodes 24, 51, 127 and 144 would probably all be relevant to you at the moment.",

      "text": "My 3rd year of my PhD was all online due to covid and it was terrible. Like reading and discussing papers in person is pretty engaging for me, but doing it at home and in zoom settings is torture. Also if I wasn't able to do any research and work with real data, tbh I'd be super bored even in person. So it is possible that's the reason why... but it's also totally OK not to be interested in getting a PhD. A PhD is basically just a training program and a license to do a certain kind of job and a Master's is not just a lesser PhD. If you decide it's not for you, it's not like you failed, it's that a PhD just isn't necessary for what you want to do. \n\nI think you should try and get some experience in the field before deciding one way or another. It's not like you have to decide *right now* or you'll never get the chance to go back to grad school. If you get a lab tech job or something similar, you'll get more experience with the research side of things. Maybe you'll love it, and you'd be in the right spot. Maybe you'll hate it and then you might want to consider other options. And if you feel like you want to have more control over the writing and developing experiments and understanding the hows and whys, etc, then you would want to think about getting a PhD, so you could get the type of job where you can do that stuff someday. If you don't have any/much experience with research, it's just hard to know.",
