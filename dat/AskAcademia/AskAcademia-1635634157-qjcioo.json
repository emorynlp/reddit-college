  "text": "When I did my dissertation research, I just got a student visa, but now I'm planning on changing my country to France for a post doc and I'm a bit overwhelmed.  One of the grants that I'm looking into will pay for most of my daily needs, but doesn't provide an income so I will need to probably save up some money and work while I'm in France.  Is the a visa that would be good for this?  The grants are not through organizations or universities in France, so I wouldn't be an employee although I may be affiliated with a lab. I'm in a social science field, if that matters.",

      "text": "You want to do an independent post-doc ? I am a bit confused with how certain you seem to be with describing your role as a post doc without being certain if you will be affiliated with a lab or not?  (To be fair my only experience is in molecular bio and biochem, so the concept of an independent post doc makes my brain itch)\n\nIf this is common in your field (or at least doable) make sure to explain why physically being in France is pivotal to the completion of the research\n\nEdit: typo",

          "text": "Oh, yes, it's independent research.  I've run into this issue so many times trying to get information from other academics because so few fields do independent research. I do primarily anthropology research and it's pretty essential that we live in the country we're researching.  Not only do we do interviews, but we do participant observation, which is extremely difficult to do from afar, if not impossible in some instances.  This is why getting a visa can be so hard. But form the contacts I've made in France, it seems very rare that someone doing research there isn't affiliated with a lab. Not really sure what the affiliation provides exactly, other than maybe some authority or access to IRB.",

              "text": "Yes, to publish research you will need an ethical approval statement - though I believe you can get the necessary approval as an individual (or, at the very least, reach out to a nearby university in the area you would like to live in to see if they will help with this). \n\nFrom a brief google the Fyssen foundation grant seems to cover your needs. Realistically many of these grants will request lab affiliation (as it is the norm), but I think if you convince them that your independent status will not affect the research (and if anything, may help it because of x y z) you may be ok. Smaller grants will probably have a larger chance of success, and you may need to get a few of them.",

It's actually not easy to get one in the U.S. if you're not employed by a university. My own alma matter won't give me an IRB.  I'm timed out of the Fyseen now, they have strict post graduation time limits and they do require a lab affiliation.",

If I understand it correctly, you're a post doc (in the US?) but want to spend some time during your post doc (how long?) in France (to do what?)?\n\nI think it would help to have some more detail as there might be grants that are for specific purposes (fieldwork, institutional visits), for specific lengths of time and /or for specific discisplines.\n\nHave you lookedat Fulbright? Their set up tends to be quite broad and they have a number of grants for American researchers who want to go to France.",

The amount Fulbright pays for it's post docs in Paris is ridiculously low, though compared to a lot of my other options.  After taxes, I would probably not even be able to rent a studio apartment in a safe neighborhood kind of low.  I will look into it for the next cycle if I don't get anything this year, that will at least give me enough time to save up money to live comfortably there.",
