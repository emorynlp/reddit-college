  "title:": "How to deal with a micro-managing professor?",
  "text": "My professor is a perfectionist and micro-manager, who rather write our students assignments than let them deliver a less-than-perfect job. I am currently caught in the middle as a co-supervisor - knowing that whatever I say in order to guidance her, I risk that it\u2019s a waste of time, because my professor will chance it afterwards- and my poor student is looking like she on the verge to a breakdown. Any tips on how to balance this issue?",

Are you a postdoc or a graduate student? \n\nIf this is your research advisor, I would consider changing if possible.\n\nFor a course, just try learning as well as you can and get through it with a good grade.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

              "text": "Since you talk about this professor as \"your\" professor, it seems like you know them well enough. Why not discuss the situation with them? No need to say that you feel like you are wasting your time, or that they are doing too much. You can simply ask them what do they think you could both do to improve and do a better job at supervising students together.\n\nI often do this when I'm co-supervising a project, as I feel transparency is very important between supervisors.",
