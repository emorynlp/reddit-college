  "text": "Hi all,\n\nAfter a few emails from coauthors this morning stating that they were prioritising online lecture prep over revisions and cancellation of data collection plans for a funded study (I\u2019m in social sciences), I was wondering about the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on research productivity. Are you considering any changes to your work? Are your universities/funders/colleagues adjusting expectations in any way?\n\nEDIT: Well, this has turned into a very interesting exchange of experiences (and RIP my inbox, but totally worth it).",

We are not sure when the legal department responds - might be only tomorrow morning.\n\n\nI work with monkeys and there we currently have no restrictions (but monitor the situation closely), my colleague does fMRI experiments in humans that are now slowed down since the institute basically told us to cancel all non-essential external visitors. So he's not allowed to bring participants to the scanner unless they work at the institute. I now signed up as a participant to help him out, so that he can at least run a few scans (I think he does not need a lot more anyways).  \nThe institute already instructed everyone to set up emergency plans (who can work from home, who needs to be here etc), we are currently planning that.",

Our sick leave policies and work from home policies for staff and students are abhorrent. \n\n\nSadly the university is not closing, which I absolutely think it should given how my supervisor has shown up extremely ill and we know a student attended classes all last week potentially spreading it around.\n\n\nI have been working from home since Tuesday. The university is not happy about it. They've made it clear they will only close if the national government forces them too. I couldn't care less. I have a weak immune system, and I'm not chancing it. I'm also the only one of my colleagues who doesn't drive to work, so a two hours on buses and trains every day can't be good for me either.\n\n\nEdit: I'm supposed to be presenting at a conference in the US tomorrow. I cancelled the trip, which the university was not pleased about. I'm so glad I did given the potential travel impacts now. As far as actual research, nothing has changed for me. I was supposed to have a meeting with my very sick supervisor sometime this week, but I'm not happy sitting next to someone with a fever and constant coughing until she gets better.",

Data collection will likely be totally shut down on many campus ... and even if not shut down, community members might not want to come to campus. I'm researching-in-residence in Taiwan, and we've more or less cancelled all in-person data collections. Even if we can get people to campus, we have another issue -- we've been asked to keep all doors open/windows open to cut down on infection incubation and keep fresh air going through the labs. Most of you know that's anathema to keeping a sterile and quiet lab.\n\nWe've made plans to do as much online research as we can, and we're trying to think creatively about how to make psychologically realistic and valid online methods. We're also adjusting the questions we're asking as well as the nature of our work (a lot more descriptive work, for example).\n\nAs for thinks such as pre-registration and registered reports? We've pretty much thrown all of that out the door for now (for the descriptive work). We simply can't afford to have additional delays and check-downs in the process. Instead, we'll double-down on keeping our data, methods, and notes as transparent as we legally can.   \n\n\nOn the flipside, for planned lab studies, we'll actually have a few studies that we will end up sitting on and likely, think much more critically abut pre-registration because we'll likely delay data collection.

It's a larger part of my job than teaching and each basically counts as a class on my load. I can't imagine we can even do them if we can't have 100+ people at an event. \n\nI have student workers including a student trying to do her senior thesis for costume design. I don't think her show can go up and if it can't, I need a completely new plan because all our thesis projects are based on the production work. I also don't know how I can keep the student work-study folks if I have nothing for them to do.\n\nBasically, I can't do my job right now. The college also extended spring break for students so even if the next show is happening, I'd have no one to work on it and only half a week to get people in to have costumes on their bodies before the show would open. That is if those students even come back from break as they're no longer required to be on campus at all.\n\nMy industry is in shambles at the moment as well. Our largest yearly conference was canceled late last night. It's not strictly academic, but it's a huge deal for those of us that teach design and technical theatre. I also have a pretty good suspicion my summer gig will fall through. I'm really happy I didn't go into straight-up professional costume design right now because those poor folks have had all their jobs for months vanish this week.\n\nEdit: I thought of one goodish thing. Because the conferences I planned on attending are canceled, I have about $1000 of personal development money that has just opened up.\n\nNew edit: My department is now talking about how we will move forward. So at least there's that!",

We have had some discussions about relaxing review standards, and my fingers are crossed that they'll actually remember whatever we decide now in January when files are reviewed.\n\nInternational travel has been banned. Domestic travel is being considered on a case-by-case basis. We're supposed to register it with the uni, and they'll decide if we can go (or if we have to self-quarantine? not quite clear yet). \n\nI'm in the humanities, so my research is easy to shift to home. Most of my colleagues are so focused on instruction right now that they aren't even thinking about data collection yet. I suspect most of them will shift to analysis/collation/etc. if it is at all possible- things they can do without being in public. \n\nCampus is still \"open.\" The students are being sent away, but we're expected to show up. I don't know that this will be enforced, but going to our offices, labs, library...all still possible.",

The decision to bring home all students currently abroad was made by the Provost and Chancellor early this morning without consultation from any of our staff, and we've been trying all morning to get an answer about how we can support our students in terms of waiving admin fees, enrolling in courses back here if they're unable to continue their coursework online with the host university (unlikely, given how far in the semester we are), self-quarantining, etc. Our travel policy requires anybody in a CDC level 3 country to return to the US, and with many students in Europe, it makes sense for many to return home. But our students in countries like Thailand feel safer staying there than hopping on a plane to return to the US, and the university is not granting appeals for any of these students. I feel really bad for them, not only because of the lost coursework (which is huge), but also because many of these students have dreamed of spending a semester abroad for years in advance and now their semester is ruined after only a couple of weeks (some students, like those planning on going to China, South Korea, and Italy, either didn't go at all or were only in-country for a couple of days).
