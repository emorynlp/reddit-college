  "text": "Or are they funded partly also by the academic partner?\n\nI am planning to cofound a startup in Germany but also want to do a PhD. The startup doesn\u2019t have any funding as of now and so cannot fund my PhD. I want to know if it is generally possible to find an industrial PhD position which is also partly funded by the university.",

      "text": "German universties consider PhD students 'research workers' and mostly pay the normal wage of about 50k euro yearly. The tech positions are mostly 100%\n\nFraunhofer offers about 65% so part time.\n\nIf a company takes you as a PhD you are treated like a normal worker.\n\nThere are also some programms founded by the ministry of education. The students do a start up that is supervised by the university and get monthly about 1200 Euro for their living expenses. I remeber seeing documents regarding that when working as a HiWi in the industrial machines departament, but I cannot recall the name of the programm. I think you can look under something like Existenzgr\u00fcndung Studenten, maybe you will find it. Then I recommend contacting either the specific faculty of the university or the local Studierendenwerk.",
