  "title:": "Is my professor expecting me to invite her over?",
  "text": "Last week I was supposed to meet one of my professors to hand her some documents that need to be signed. We're doing online classes at the moment, but for some reason I thought that we're gonna meet at the university. The day I was supposed to go there she texted me and asked me where I live. I told her, and then she said that as soon as she's over with a meeting that she was in, she's gonna come to my neighborhood and meet me there. I thought that she wants to do me a favor and pick me up, so I told her it's not necessary because I had to run some errands and I'm near the university anyway. That's when she told me that she's actually home, not at uni. A few minutes later she called me to tell me that's she's not able to come anymore because she had some problems with her car, so she asked me if she can come meet me on Monday. I agreed and now I'm waiting her to text me but I'm kind of confused about this whole situation. I'm not sure if she just wants to meet up somewhere in my neighborhood, as she said, or if she expects me to invite her over. I didn't because I feel it's weird and inappropriate and besides that I don't live in a very fancy place, so I don't feel comfortable having her over. Is she expecting me to? Am I rude for not doing it? Am I just overthinking it? What do you think?",

I certainly would read nothing further into it. If you aren't comfortable having her near your place, tell her you'll be at such and such coffee shop where she can get the documents.",

I don't think she intends to meet at your place -- that'd be weird -- but if that's the case, you can simply say you can't and suggest a nearby caf\u00e9.\n\nI had a bad experience once: I asked my advisor when should we meet, she said \"in two days\". I replied asking at what time, she never wrote back. I didn't know her well, but I knew she was very busy. So I spent the next two days wondering if I should send another message or just wait a little longer. At the meeting day, late morning, I finally messaged her asking about the time again, when she replied \"I've been waiting for you, now I have another appointment\". I felt awful, and later at the uni I caught her talking sh*t about me to another faculty member.\n\nLesson learned: it's always better to ask for clarification sooner than later.",
