  "title:": "Research Quality in Japan??? What is that?",
  "text": " So it has been almost three years since I joined a Japanese university as a postdoc in the field of Physics and I am already thinking of leaving for the following reasons:\n\n1. Logrolling is very common in Universities: they keep adding people to their publication lists, and I promise almost 70% those co-authors have no idea/cannot explain the content of research\n2. Research is done by students Ph.D./Masters who easily make mistakes (I personally have to correct them all the time, and sometimes I wonder how it was done before I joined the team)\n3. Precisions and accuracy have no meaning, cheating; plagiarism is part of the publication (this is done intentionally without intention, I can explain), I witnessed two already!\n4. Rumor is part of their daily life\n5. They keep the tenured positions for their Japanese fellow most of the time, in spite of not being capable of delivering any projects/new ideas\n6. Applying for funds: International researchers have half the chances Japanese have when it comes to fund/grant applications\n\nLet me know what you think!",

Pretty much everything there is spot on.\n\nFor 2, I myself as Phd student planned and execute the research project all by myself, includes material and equipment procurement. I have to justify the reason why a particular NIM module for example needed for the experiment. I found myself in constant position of having explain the research project to them time and time again despite the project themselves are from the funding of the professors. \n\nOne thing I will say, some Japanese physics research(not all of them) are prideful of the Japanese researcher themselves and they tend to look down on foreign researcher that are in Japan. I myself being treated like a total FOREIGNER and I knew they were talking trash about me as I heard through some kind colleague of mine.\n\nI have only myself to blame for making this choice of pursuing research in Japan and naively trusting this professor.",

A year later I tried to reproduce data, and I was unsuccessful. No matter what they still published the data. Since in Japan, scientific data sharing is not mandatory (for instance in the UK you have published in the PURE system), you can get away pretty much easily.\n\nAnother time, the same group published a paper in nature, and I was told the experimental parameter was not as it said. I was surprised since the person who did this was an EU-dual national and nobody felt to raise the question.\n\nOur Phd student prepares proceedings and article with minimum supervision.\n\nConclusion: 1) intentionally wrongdoing while it can be avoided by a proper supervision.\n\n2) pushing papers out at any cost, sacrificing the ethics",

But on the other hand, I think an awful lot of what you've written is, unfortunately, just true for academia in general!\n \n1) I have definitely noticed people on papers who I'm pretty certain had nothing to do with the research or publication, but this is certainly not unique to Japan. I see that happening here in the UK too (and no doubt everywhere else).\n\n2) Well... research is done by students here in the UK too. And everywhere. Of course students are more likely to make mistakes, but I don't think it's a Japan-specific thing to let them slide. I think that's down to the supervisors to make sure their students know what they're doing. But yes it definitely falls to the postdocs much of the time.\n\n3) I haven't personally experienced any cheating or plagiarism, but I'm sure this happens all over the world. Unfortunate that you've found yourself in a group engaging in this practice - must be a tough one to deal with.\n\n4) Not sure what you mean by this?\n\n5) I definitely see that they keep tenured positions for Japanese fellows. Of the few non-Japanese academics I know of in Japan (in my field anyway), they don't speak great Japanese... Maybe this contributes.\n\n6) This is an interesting one. What is this statement based on? Actual figures, or is it what you've gathered from your own experiences? I suspect this is true for a lot of countries though. Whether it comes down to knowing the intricacies of what a particular country likes to see in grant applications, or if it is just a case of people preferring to fund their own, I don't know. But again, don't think it's Japan-specific.",

Granted, my research experience is only in the US and with a few international colleagues.\n\n1) I agree that it's not great, but it's not uncommon anywhere. \"We offered so and so authorship in exchange for their (perhaps tiny) contribution\". I don't see it often myself, but it's my understanding that this is a big thing in some fields. Authorship on a single paper also means accordingly less in those fields unless they're first author.\n\n2) That's certainly the case in the US and I'd imagine all over. Learning to do research, certainly \\*good\\* research, is the point of a masters or Ph.D. The role of the advisor is to help catch the mistakes (which are inevitable and a part of learning) before they go out in publications or presentations.\n\n3) This sentence doesn't make a lot of sense. They plagiarize on purpose without meaning to?\n\n4) I agree that it's not professional, but I imagine you'd find it anywhere. Some people just gossip. I personally do my best to avoid those people.\n\n5) I don't have much to say here. It would definitely be shooting themselves in the foot if they're turning away good researchers on the basis of nationality.\n\n6) If you're referring to grants from the Japanese government, I can't say that's too surprising. I'd imagine that, depending on the topic, the same is true in many countries. I'd imagine the US Dept. of Defense prefers having US citizens working on its defense-related projects, for example.",
