  "title:": "Got tenure track but now burnt out",
  "text": "After about 8 years on the postdoctoral/fellowship circuit, I finally got tenure track last academic year. In the UK, tenure is a bit more of a standard route from tenure-track (in truth we don't have tenure track in the same sense as the US system). So for all intents and purposes, this should be good. \n\nHowever, what I found was that somewhere between Years 6-8 of my post-PhD circuit, I was running on fumes. The last year, with the new position and the increased stability, it was like someone told me that I could now stop running. I bought a house, bought a pet, and bought a toaster (those of you who know what it's like to constantly move from place-to-place will understand). \n\nBut now I am truly burnt out. I find it difficult to focus on work, I find my life being split a million different directions. It's like those past 15 years after graduating from school and working so hard and sacrificing so much---have come back to haunt me. Like that child in our minds that we've all suppressed for the sake of our jobs is finally back and banging constantly on the front door.\n\nWhat do I do? How do I regain that edge that I once possessed?",

In the school I'm currently at, I'm not paid over summer, so technically I could just go camping, but in practice if I don't work on papers / grants / syllabus revising, I won't get tenure, as it is physically impossible to meet the requirements for tenure without these extra three months a year. So, I guess, it's the best of two worlds ;) \n\nThis situation seems rather common for small liberal arts schools. My understanding is that at research-heavy schools people are paid for the summer (usually soft money from the grants), which also means that they keep working. In Community Colleges and many teaching-oriented state schools people often teach over the summer. So my understanding is that the only type of folks who can get the entire summer off are those who are in teaching-oriented institutions, and are already tenured.",

                  "text": "I believe most academic contracts in America pay a 9 month salary, that is, you only *technically* get paid during the academic year and have to provide your own Summer salary. \n\nHowever, this is not to imply that you are not supposed to work during the summer! As I understand it,  the (unofficial) reason for the 9-month salary contract is that it give you personal financial incentive to secure research funding. \n\nSo basically, the school says, \"We're going to offer you $90k per 9 months (FYI - that's a fake number chosen to make the math easy) , and if you have funding you can use it to pay yourself up to 30% of your annual salary in the summer.\" Then you go ahead and get a big ol honking grant, and all of a sudden your annual salary goes from $90k a year to $120k a year. Then a few years later when the money is running out, you can scale that number back to give yourself a little extra $$ for the lab while you are waiting for the next grant to come in. \n\nI think when people talk about \"walking away in the summer,\" they are referring to the fact that in most schools the summer is generally much more chill than the academic year. There are no classes to teach, no (or fewer) students running around, less frequent faculty meetings, etc etc. As such, it is much easier to scale back your personal working hours because you have far fewer  standing obligations eating into your time. \n\nYou are still *definitely* expected to be productive in the summer. In fact, many people say that the summer is the most productive time for doing real research, for exactly the reasons I stated above (fewer distractions!). \n\nHowever, summer can also be a good time to take a step back from the grind and let yourself recharge. You are expected to maintain productivity, but if you are feeling burnt out then sometimes the most productive thing you can do is to walk away and take some damn time for yourself. \n\nThis got longer than I intended:\n\n**tl;dr** - Americans are still expected to work in the summer, but it is also much easier to take things easy because there are fewer obligations outside of the academic year.

It sounds like OP doesn't have children or a spouse (at least didn't mention so in their post), but even without those things, it's exhausting. I decided toward the end of my MA that getting the PhD was not worth it. I stuck out my MA and finished my thesis, but I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I was already getting burned out, but knew that on top of course work, I needed to present at conferences and win grant money. No matter what I did, it would never be enough. Couple that with the atrocious pay (humanities, specifically music history). I figured I'd rather not put off my earnings for another decade to get the PhD and then deal with the awful job market. After all, I would not be getting a PhD to be an adjunct.\n\nIn the last year since I finished my degree, I moved in with my long term, long distance boyfriend- now husband- we got married in June. I do work I enjoy: teaching violin. I turned an eye toward my health and have lost 50lbs so far.

Many people in my graduate cohort acted like you are \"in or out\" not only of academia, but of research and having a worthwhile career, but that simply is not true. Sure, some resources can be harder to access, but really, it's not worth the abuse of academia... and you can still be an educated person living a meaningful life without the PhD.",
