  "text": "Straight to the point: I'm really not enjoying academia as much as I thought I would. I'm currently in a postdoc position many would dream. The only caveat to the position is that you must publish as much as possible in 2 years. I'm now 1.5 years into it and have not published enough to my standard and likely the uni (1 journal 3 submitted - under review). I have many days of anxiety fuelled thoughts and have had thoughts of depression which were mostly addressed in therapy. However the underlying pressure is obviously still there. \n\nI just want out. The thought of applying for grants for the rest of my life with the added pressure of writing papers is just silly to me. I don't think this is a lifestyle for me. I'm pretty entrenched in the faculty now. How do I leave without pissing off my chain of command and without saying I wasn't grateful for this opportunity. I'm sorry I couldn't be a better academic.",

Upon reflection I realised that sometimes ties are severed but this does not mean anything negative. There\u2019s a lot of personal growth and positivity in being elegant about your goodbyes. Hard factual truth makes a reality worth living. Be open, be honest, and stand by your words - that you have enjoyed building relationships around those you find yourself with, but for now, your navigating your life toward another direction. This isn\u2019t offensive, it\u2019s powerful. There are far too many academics I interact with who are miserable and you can simply tell they didn\u2019t want to end up where they are. I don\u2019t want to be like that. Also there\u2019s an inherent toxic side to how it works in academia so I don\u2019t find any confusion to how you feel.",

That said, I understand your worries about \"screwing yourself over,\" but it looks like you're mostly concerned about your relationships with those closest to you/your work, which makes perfect sense. I imagine you'll look for jobs that relate to your PhD, so it's probably important to maintain positive relationships with others in your field (your PI, faculty with shared interests, even fellow students). As such, I'd focus on those relationships and not worry about what others in your department/college/university think. Those folks are also the ones who know you best, so they'll be more likely to understand your decision and legitimately wish you well. \n\nDon't make a big deal out of it (discuss it only with those you think should know, and/or with your closest colleagues and friends in the department), but don't think it's something to hide either. Academia isn't for everyone, and most people understand that and accept it.",

I suspect you may have higher expectations for yourself than your university. That said, it's not clear how much stress is attributed to mismatched expectations and how much is attributed to academia as a whole. If it's the former, is it possible to talk to someone to get a sense of how good of a candidate you are? You can take a look at your institution or department's advance and promotions committee to get a sense of what the expectations are once you're hired as asst. prof.",
