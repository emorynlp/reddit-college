  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nI'm a PhD Student/Candidate in Europe. Kinda burned out, by the end of my 2nd year, but will probably carry over until my 4th. I won't reveal much more about me for privacy reasons, as I work with stuff related to internet/digital tech and wouldn't be hard to narrow down who I am if anyone gor curious lol (ThrowAway account for the same reason).\n\n\\-------\n\nI have always seen the PhD as an opportunity to become a better researcher and better in my field (Psychology) theoretically, to eventually apply said knowledge outside academia. Despite not enjoying the PhD overall, this goal has been made possible here and there, with some companies/organizations with projects close to my PhD Project being interested and inviting me to share said knowledge with them.\n\nHowever, recently, I was faced with something I found conflicting. My supervisors said until the end of my PhD, I should publish at least 3 papers, ideally 4. This was kinda stressful, and conflicting with something else they said, which was \"Your PhD years are the best to learn and develop.\". And I found this conflicting for a very specific reason: while I'm focused on \"publishing\", often, I feel like the scientific process matters less, than the results. For example, I don't remember seeing any article on my field of research in Psychology without results, i.e., everyone has very interesting results. However, I personally have some \"non-results\", which I find interesting but people above me (my supervisors or some other professors that sometimes work alongside us) always make some pressure into \"finding them results\".\n\nAnd this was it. The more I deal with situations like this, the more I focus on being productive and \"getting this done\", do eventually go back to applying said knowledge to a field that is not Academia. And no, I don't exactly intend to give up my PhD, even though I'm very critical about the whole evaluation process. I still find value in it, still want to pursue it and keep trying to learn. Actually, I may have to brind this take on \"learning\" vs. \"publishing\" on the next meeting with my supervisors. Even though they are somewhat young researchers (finished their PhDs around 10 years ago) I seem them becoming exactly what they criticized.\n\nWell, sorry for the rant. Was just feeling like sharing this with someone on the field.\n\nThis being said: have any of you ever felt similar pressure? I honestly thought this wasn't as prevalent during the PhD, specially since I know many people who hardly published anything during theirs.",

Even though they are pretty capable, I sometimes feel like they \"sold their sould to the Devil\" and became what they criticized. It's their way of surviving, so I won't judge them too much.\n\nBut yeah, my biggest problem is this mindset which to me, seems to conflict directly with the idea of \"learning\". Like I do go to conferences (less due to Covid but still), but many times I do so and end up feeling guilty because \"I have work to do\".\n\nI believe here the standard is the same, i.e., 1 first authorship. I believe their argument is that if I have more than that, I not only receive institutional awards, but also make it more plausible that my PhD was totally worth it, leaving no doubts about my work. However, this is sometimes done at the cost of p-hacking and \"nitpicking\" results.",

You don't get a PhD for just taking in knowledge.  You get it for creating new knowledge, and communicating that to the outside world in the manner appropriate for your field.  \n\nWhat you're describing is not actually a conflict.  Yes, you have more time to spend on learning now than you will have later.  But that doesn't mean that \"learning\" is the *only* thing you should be doing now.  You have to balance multiple priorities and requirements in any job, including as a PhD student.  \n\nFor what it's worth, my PhD department had exactly the same rule of \"at least 3 papers, ideally 4\".  It's not unheard of.  Even if you want to move into another topic/field later, it's important to have papers out the door because it demonstrates that you've achieved a baseline skill (writing/publishing papers) that is generally expected of people graduating with a PhD.  They're pushing you to do this because they want you to be employable.",

In our lab however, you need to at least take part as co-author in one paper, to get at least some experience in what publishing and review processes are like.\n\nIf you find ot hard to get findings in your own work, maybe ask your PI if it was a possibility to go for reviews. With two years of experience in the PhD it will still be some hard work, but you should be able to manage given some time. That might also be a way for you to bridge that gap between \"pure\" academical learning and your need to publish.",

While i have my main- and co-autorships that i wanted for my later career, i know that i am quite lucky in how it went, and it could very well also have been the exact opposite.

I ended up with 2 middle-name-author papers + 3 x 1st author preprint (one published a year after graduating, with data produced to at least 2 more)... only to see other people graduate without any publications no problem at all and having jobs as postdocs. So, at least in the UK, the 3-paper rule in a 4-year PhD is rubbish (particularly when a supervisor will not let you publish without his/her name/consent). A way to squeeze cheap labor that PhD students are.\n\nYou will likely be able to access other people's thesis from your institution and field, so set the bar from what you see there. You may well end up on your 4th year having something lined up (preprints, if not submissions) if you work hard, but given how peer-review works these days...\n\nBear in mind to publish something fast, from scratch, you need to produce some nice dataset/theory on year 1, then between year 1 and 2 write the manuscript and start submitting it. While you write, you can't produce new data (you can, but both experiment and writing will go slow). So, being optimistic, there'll be a paper on year 2, paper on year 3 and then thesis. I still have to meet a professor that produce on their own that amount of papers per year (actual work + writing/editing). Only professors with big labs (which have drawbacks), and each postdoc has its own story, can they publish 3-4-5 papers a year. So the work from the PI there is minimal, other than re-writing/giving feedback. And then collaborations.\n\nSo I think it's extremely unfair to ask PhD students to have a performance not even them have. So, long-story short: your supervisor is a dick.",

I published anyway, because wider reading/the internet told me I needed to do that to get a job, but I could\u2019ve used the expectation or external pressure to be more productive. Many  humanities PhDs at my institution don\u2019t publish or publish too little (in the UK so the PhD is short), so they do spend time developing their thoughts but aren\u2019t prepared for the vicious job market out there. \n\nI understand your internal conflict about learning and developing vs publishing as a means to an end, but there are ways to publish consistently in a way that accurately reflects your new ideas as they emerge. Productivity expectations are too high though and many people burn out, and in so many ways the system is broken.",

      "text": "There again turning a draft PhD chapter into a paper isn't exactly the most arduous job. And publications give you a safety net in case you end up with a crazy external examiner (in the UK system). It can happen - but if you have some good solid publications out there, it's hard for them to disparage your work. I'd hope your supervisor would give you help and support in writing them, too, rather than just appending their name.",

      "text": "Not going to comment on the number of papers except to say that it seems high. However, you touch on two points which you've rather conflated - firstly the lack of interest in negative results. It's very difficult to get journals to publish negative results and they often don't get many citations. Your advisors are giving you good advice when they tell you not to focus on publishing negative results especially if they aren't conclusive or it's not a major rebuttal of an established hypothesis. It's a failing of the scientific community but your supervisors have your best interests at heart when they tell you not to focus on it. If you really want to get that information out there write it up and put it on a pre-print archive. \n\nSecondly, the idea that publishing and learning are in direct conflict with each other. I don't know why you feel this way but writing papers is a fundamental skill you absolutely need to learn to be a scientist. Writing a paper is the opposite of interfering with your learning, not only will you be learning to organise and effectively communicate your science you will also be reviewing your science through a different lens and you will learn more about your field and re-examine your own work. It's a hugely beneficial learning experience.",
