  "text": "Unfortunately, my program has no requirement for statistics, and my undergraduate stats class was a joke, so I feel like a toddler when stats come up in any conversation, seminar, or paper. I want to learn, but I'm really unsure how to start. I can do some basic R, but really only to organize data frames and so forth. I really don't want to be applying to postdocs while still having this issue.\n\nI would especially like to hear from people who felt like they were extremely behind and managed to catch up.",

      "text": "My biggest regret about my graduate education is that I did not take more advanced methods and stats courses. I did what was required and then I didn't seek out any additional training, because I saw myself as a qualitative researcher and, honestly, I felt like I wasn't any good at stats and just didn't \"have it,\" whatever it was.\n\nNow I teach the methods and stats courses in my department and I actually really enjoy it - I think in part because I know what it's like to dread those courses and now that I can see how it all fits together, I want to take a different approach with my students...\n\nAnyway. Your interest in learning more about stats is admirable and you should definitely pursue it. For starters, look at courses offered by other departments - you might be able to count these towards your elective requirements, or you might just have to tack them on top of whatever else you're required to take. There are also workshops you can attend, and you might be able to get funding from your program for this sort of thing. For example, [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/) runs summer workshops on how to work with some of their data sets and you can often end up with something publishable. Sometimes there are statistical and methodological workshops at academic conferences, e.g. our major academic conference runs Weds-Saturday, but on the Tuesday there are usually 3-4 \"preconference workshops\" and there's almost always one about a quant analysis technique.\n\nFinally, there's tons of resources online. My husband is a stats guy and recently switched over to R, and he did it entirely through free online tutorials. I can ask him if he has specific recommendations and edit this post later, but a quick Google will bring up tons of resources. I like [this one by Kieran Healy](http://socviz.co/), but it focuses more on ways to visually represent your data than on the actual statistical techniques - still, a neat resource to have.",

The code is a bit out date now but Field does a great job of walking through statistics from simple tests to regression models to multivariate analysis.  Then to upgrade your code skills R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data by Hadley and Grolemund will get you caught up on the tidyverse and current suggested best practices for coding in R.  Then Chang's R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data I would suggest because good visualizations do require a bit of learning.

It also means that \"with proficiency goes employment\", people who can do stats in novel ways are highly employable as academics.",

      "text": "TLDR; Just look up how to do what you need to do in a stats book and do it, repeat until others start coming to you for help.\n\nI thought I was extremely behind on stats during my PhD. Even though I had taken stats as an undergrad and a biostats class as a masters student, I just didn't feel comfortable with it. My program had access to a \"good stats class\" and so I took it but was the same as all the others I had just with a little more detail. \n\nThen I talked to a psychologist buddy of mine that did stats for a lot of people in very honest terms about how I didn't feel like I knew stats. What he told me was there are three types of people when it comes to stats: (1) statisticians/mathematicians who are true experts who understand the theory of what is going on, (2) people who don't feel like they know statistics, and (3) people who know they aren't statistical experts but know enough about stats to follow the instructions of the first group in the books they write telling the rest of us how to do stats. It's really rare to be in group 1 if you aren't primarily a mathematician. \n\nJust learn to focus on the basics and look up the answers to make sure you are right on the simplest level: \n\n* Find a how to do stats handbook you like for your field.\n* Think about stats before you do the experiment (e.g. what kind of data is this? what kind of tests do we meet the assumptions to use.) **this is the most important thing; A stats expert is mainly someone that knows to think about the stats before the experiments**\n* Collect some of the data you need and check to make sure your initial assumptions are correct. This is also a good time to do a power analysis (which I just look up how to do every time I have to) and do initial checks for normality and the other stuff required for your test. If you run into a problem here look in your handbook how the people in group 1 solve the problem and try that. \n*  Finish collecting your data. \n* Do a final check your data meets all your tests assumptions.\n* Run the test\n* If you are really new to this find a friend or colleague with more experience from group 1 or 3 and offer to buy them a warm caffeinated or cold alcoholic beverage if they will listen to what you did and check for mistakes. \n* Repeat until other people come to you for help (and don't forget to collect your beverage), which means you are the expert now. \n",

Pick a textbook; take an online course, supplement this with excessive googling (which would bring you to wikipedia, stackexchange, and random lectures from different stats courses all over the world). But most importantly, try to use R to solve some actual practical problems from your field. Get some data and try to analyze the hell out of it.\n\nAlso, register at https://stats.stackexchange.com and read the submissions daily. Try to ask questions. Try to answer questions, then see how same qustions are answered by other people. r/statistics/ is similar, but in my experience much less forgiving for a newcomer.\n\nStatistics is a strange field: it has a theoretical side, and a practical side, which are not always in a good agreement. Also there are schools of thought who bitterly fight with each other. Finally, methods used by different fields are sometimes very different. The only way to \"learn it\" is to keep learning it on a daily, or at least weekly basis, picking stuff here and there, and trying it out.",

I went back in 2014 and was fortunate enough to convince my advisor to fund it. \n\n[Check it out. ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/conferences/causalinference/frequentist/&ved=2ahUKEwiT2e3g4KDbAhWj5IMKHY82DMMQFjAAegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw21Jl2hRgrwF8C7dnJ-CBtL)",

      "text": "I was in a research lab in the social sciences as an undergrad. My lab does mixed methods research. So I was in an environment that appreciated stats.\n\nI took 2 stats grad courses as an undergrad. It wasn't really until I took a specific regression class that I started to feel comfortable with stats. In and outside of class, through help from some of my advisors, I gained experience which allowed me to really learn stats. Even though I took an ANOVA course, I didn't really understand repeated measures until i worked on a project using it. I didnt fully understand the implications of assumptions for regression until I ran into those issues in my own work. I plan on doing an HLM project next semester, and I am sure I will learn more about multi level modeling from working on that.\n\nIn general, I have a lot of experience running correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, and multilevel modeling, and some experience with factor analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis, and multidimensional scaling. I definitely need to learn more about those last four.\n\nNow I want to take classes in SEM, latent variable analysis, meta analysis, and psychometrics, off the top of my head.\n\nThere are still some things I am not strong on. I am very bad with statistical notation for example, I hope to relearn that soon. If anyone has any good resources for that, I would appreciate it. Another limitation of mine is not the procedures or processes of stats, but sometimes the judgement calls that are taught through experience. So in those instances, I lean on my advisors or PIs for help.\n\nHeck I made a rookie mistake in R with a regression last week or so. But I know now that I will never make that mistake again because I ran into it myself.\n ",
