  "text": "Hello! I am applying to some Clinical Psychology PhDs and one of the programs wants me to redact a diversity statement. I come rom a Spanish speaking country, am Hispanic and Latina, a woman and I\u2019m not sure how to proceed. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m only focusing on these factors to justify my admission as I have plenty of qualifications to be admitted outside of being a minority. Suggestions?",

Instead they should be telling you how their program handles diversity etc. I am annoyed for you!\n\nThey are probably looking at how you understand diversity issues and how it will impact your work in the department. Being a diverse applicant alone will not get you in and I hope you don't feel that way upon acceptance. Your other accomplishments are worthy of admittance.\n\n\nIn your DEI statement you can talk about your background but I would frame it more as \"As a Latina woman I understand many of the challenges faced by my future clients. Here is how I would help my clients deal with this. Here is previous work I have done in diversity. Here is what I plan to do while in the program. Here is what I plan to do while working in the field. etc etc etc\"\n\n\nThey are not looking for you to list what makes you a diverse applicant. I do think it is dumb for them to ask this of their applicants.",

Pretty much anyone thats been anywhere near a hiring committee will know this.\n\nObviously a minority isnt going to get hired if their CV is terrible, but if you have two people with fairly similar CVs or where the difference isnt too great, then there's likely to be an advantage.",

      "text": "I would like to share my experience and thoughts here. When I applied for grad school my statement was like\u201dbecause my identity and background is minority because of xxx and yyy I will add to the diversity pool.\u201d A lame way to open an I&D statement. And I thought D&I statement was merely a \u2018good looking requirement\u2019. \n\nHowever, several years later, after I witnessed and experienced, I think D&I is more closely intertwined into university and research culture   My thought changed to \u201cwhat\u2019s my understanding of I&D and how to practice I&D? For example, I try to think about \u201cIf I\u2019m facing a group of under-represented students how do I make them feel welcomed in included.\u201d when writing my faculty application package. \n\nSo I think what OP can do is think about \u201cas a student how do you understand the whole D&I concepts and how might D&I influence your student life\u201d? For example, there could be minority people in your school life circle (and by minority it could be anyone who doesn\u2019t \u2018look like\u2019 the rest of the group)  \u2014 even like international Stu who just moved in from overseas. What can you do to tweak the group culture and let each other mingles better? \n\nOr, as a future researcher and possibly clinic staff there could be good chances you\u2019ll meet diversified people whose situation deviated from what you\u2019ve been learning from a standard text book based on the analysis of majority of people. \n\nTLDR: instead of focusing on the identity and background focus more on your thoughts to practice I&D in the program and your life. :)",
