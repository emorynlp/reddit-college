  "text": "Applying to grad schools right now and know that to be able to work up to lab manager, I need at least a masters, but I am a bit afraid of being terminal for that role after a certain point and not having time to go back for a PhD. There is also the fact that I need all the funding I can get but nobody really gives tuition waivers or good funding in general for masters students while PhD get all the waivers, stipends, sometimes even housing and insurance (I know its not as glamorous as it sounds). I have also heard that PhDs are overdone rn and that the job market for them is cutthroat. Can someone differentiate the major differences in PhD vs Masters and recommend what you think I need? I can elaborate, if needed.",

      "text": "It's common in biology to do the MS first. Virtually every member of my department did. My alma mater operated on a sliding scale. MS and PhD students had the same classes, labs, committee members, qualifying exams, and thesis/dissertation hours even had the same ticker.   \n\n\nPhD students simply had more. More classes, more labs, more committee members, more dissertation hours. So expectations were higher for their finished product. The system made it seamless to continue into PhD after finishing your masters, or to master out of the PhD program.   \n\n\nSince you want to manage a lab, you might consider a professional science masters, or PSM. They're designed for golden collar working professionals who have to interface at the science and business levels, but aren't explicitly doing bench science. I know many brilliant scientists who struggle with the money side of running their labs, these types of programs do have merit.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t necessarily need a masters to run a lab. I ran two labs over 18 years right out of undergrad, saved lots of money, gained maturity and experience, then went to grad school. I was miles ahead of younger grad students because I had a network. This idea we sell undergrads that they have to go straight through all their school with no breaks to make money and gain experience is doing them a huge disservice, in my opinion.",
