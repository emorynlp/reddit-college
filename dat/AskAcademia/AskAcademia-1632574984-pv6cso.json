  "title:": "\"Reviews received\" (not \"reviewers received\") on Springer's Research Square",
  "text": "Hello! My coauthor and I submitted a paper to one of Springer's journals at the end of August. The main status says *under review*. The timeline went from *Editor invited* (is *editor* a subject or a direct object?) on September 2 to *reviews received* (not *reviewers received*) on September 12 (see pic [here](https://c.gmx.com/@712334740899763441/PSxxEB7SSc6znr_RZpWxmg)). I find it strange that reviewers have already been selected and that reviews have already been submitted in one week or so. So what is *reviews received* supposed to mean?\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "hello! so, basically... Research Square is a platform for preprints which is connected to the journal's editorial manager. I don't know why this platform shows a status for my paper, since I haven't submitted a pre-print, but a regular paper. At first, I thought that research square was the editorial manager platform, so that's why I was checking it. Now I just look at the editorial manager platform. The status for the paper on both platforms is the same, though, 'under review'. I'm confused much",
