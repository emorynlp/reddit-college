  "text": "The numbers are in and the admin is saying to just increase admission numbers of graduate students to fill the teaching shortages. This is Humanities to Stem. With academic jobs the unicorn we know they are, how do these institutions justify this practice? There are no jobs for all these people when they graduate. Do we really need to train PhDs to work in biotech and pharma. Throwaway.",
