  "title:": "Is it Unreasonable to Work From Home One Day a Week as a Postdoc?",
  "text": "Hi All,\n\nSo I recently started a postdoc and so far I really enjoy the research! During my PhD, my advisor was very hands off and allowed us to make our own schedule. I was good at setting my own hours and found that I worked efficiently and well by working 4 long days in lab (12-15 hr days) and working from home one day a week doing writing, reading, data workup, experiment planning, etc. I really liked this schedule as it allowed me to principally focus on lab when I was there and then focus on desk-related work once a week. Additionally, it gave me freedom to have weekends to spend time with family, friends, and enjoy hobbies to keep myself sane! \n\nHowever, now that I have started my postdoc, this schedule seems to be viewed as lazy and not putting enough work in. My new advisor is younger and more hands-on, but before joining the lab, I clarified that her metric for evaluation was on project progress rather than hours worked. My question is whether you think working this schedule is unreasonable or not enough for a postdoc. My standpoint is that if I can complete the work necessary to move my projects forward at a reasonable pace, then the hours worked in lab is irrelevant. However, I also understand that for many labs, the culture for postdocs is to have a very high output that necessitates longer hours in lab.  For context, I am a chemist with plans on going into industry after my postdoc.\n\nThanks for your input!",

Does she have undergraduate or masters students who shouldn't be lone working in the lab? Is there a health and safety aspect to your presence that you've discounted? Does your new role include a large degree of technique transfer to junior lab members?\n\nWith what you've posted here, I don't have the information to say whose expectations are off-base. That said, I'm struck that, when you listed your outputs, none of them involved the lab as a whole, only you, your hours and your projects. A lot of PIs never set foot in the lab before COVID (and far more these days), which necessitates Mon-Fri coverage by the postdocs for basic supervision of junior staff - regardless of how productive you are in your chosen hours - and that's a large and often missed component when making the shift from PhD to postdoc.",

If you are new, there also might not be many papers to be working on yet. They might also want you around because they have more impromptu discussions and value that face to face time. As a postdoc, they might also want you around to help others and be a positive presence overall for the lab. Running my lab through COVID, I'm happy that many were productive at home, but I am also aware of all the intangible things that were lost not having face to face interactions. My advice is give it time. Get settled, get to know your labmates and supervisor, let them see your work ethic, and re-examine it down the road.",
