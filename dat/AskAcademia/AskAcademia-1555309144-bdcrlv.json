  "text": "I used to read a lot of books, but I seem to spend a lot more time on twitter these days. Consequently, I'm now used to digesting information in small bites. And sometimes without context. \n\nSo, I'd like to know if social media has impacted your focus or writing in any way. I ask because I feel as though my attention span is suffering, and I'm very concerned it's because of my time spent online.",

At first I thought it was my assigned readings and papers that were killing my desire and ability to read and write for pleasure, but now I think it\u2019s social media.

They would speak in Czech but write in French, or speak in French but write in Russian, or speak in Russian but write in English etc. Through that, they would bring grammatical and semantic features of one language into the other one. And so what? They are now regarded as classics, and nobody cares. But if you look closely, sure, you can see the influences.\n\nYou are probably all right. Don't worry.",

The informal communication on Twitter has helped me a lot because I did not feel judged for my language skills or my low academic background and I could express myself freely.\n\nHowever, I have the same attention span as a cat... I have always had this problem and I think the Internet and social media have made it worse. I find reading papers and books very difficult, my mind keeps drifting from the content on the pages. I tried to fight against it and I lost miserably, so I am using a different approach now: I jump from one task to another and then back. I start reading a paper, when I lose focus I do something else (e.g. check the emails), then I go back to the paper. Somehow it works.\n\nI have this problem only with academic publications though, especially when they do not go to the point. I suppose social media influenced me in this as well, making me (too) pragmatic and seeking for information I can use straight away.\n\nI don't check my social media accounts often, so they don't usually interfere with my work. Some of my friends have that problem and I know they use apps or browser plugins that do not allow them to browse or to check the phone for a certain time.\n\nSo... I think social media helped me out a lot but they have their side effects too.",

As a non-native speaker, that's where I learn to write. Also, that's where I pick the non-academic lingo, and current cultural trends.\n\nTwitter also helps me to stay in touch with the literature. The trick is to craft a highly curated list of people to read, and not follow anyone (or almost anyone) for purely social reasons.\n\nAs for reading, just turn the computer off, and hide the phone. You can immediately read a book.\n\n(See, again, I wrote too much, and went on two tangents =) Twitter is great.)",

It often looks like gibberish to me and I lose interest. I've tried a number of times and simply cannot successfully engage with Twitter as a medium.",

      "text": "It has definitely been beneficial. When properly used, Twitter is extremely educational and can be a good idea of research ideas, useful sources, and new information about best practices in methods. Also, I don't believe there's any consensus that social media negatively impacts one's attention span. There are a lot of other variables to consider, including burnout.",

      "text": "I think the internet/smartphones in general are basically slowly destroying my ability to read and think. As a kid I'd read whole books cover to cover in one day. In the beginning of undergrad I could plow through a homework assignment in one sitting. Now as a 4th year PhD student I can barely even read a \"light reading\" book more than a few pages at a time, let alone a journal article or long-form academic text. My eyes glaze over after 1-2 sentences. I can still talk about science and understand and learn that way, but I feel like I've become functionally illiterate - I can read the words but have about 5% retention. Apparently I write well but it's hard to write a well-researched paper when I can barely read my references.\n\nMy mental health has never been great but it's been on a steady downward trend for the past ~8 years so that certainly doesn't help. I wonder if I need to get evaluated for adult ADHD or if it's just the internet.",

There is always people that will support me. \n\n\nMy issues with Twitter is my college peers at this rate. I let them find it and sometimes they don't agree with me, people got mad at me I was really vocal and dragged in fustration over how I got treated at this school.  I am no way politically correct and that is what is hurting me and gets me in trouble a lot. \n\nMost of my peers wanna have the right opinion about me even after getting in trouble with the student code,  which we are trying to appeal.  No one wanted to here me out, yes legal action within the school got taken. I am getting somewhere. \n\nIt left me frustrated because I tried a discord to reach out and talk, I just decided to drop everything. People still wanna bickery. On my end I am on the verge of snapping at them that is why I left and blocked people off, I thought this is the right action. \n\nI am narrowing it down to sensitivity is affecting my friendships.",

I gotten personally attacked online, my peers don't even want me to use it to defend myself. .\n\nThe times that I have actually done it, just recently I got someone to help me out and it has worked thus far in getting abusive comments flagged and reported. Just as an update, external source is on this case for me, now anyone that tries anything is dead blocked over an opinion. I am feeling some actual relief.\n\nSchool is rich get a good stalking system lmao.",
