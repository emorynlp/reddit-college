  "title:": "When to give up on academic ambitions in machine learning?",
  "text": "My main interests are in neuroscience & machine learning. My interest in mathematics and biology is about the same, and not that high for either in the pure sense. As for neuroscience & machine learning, I prefer the latter as I think it relies on more novel thinking and is more of an engineering problem than just pure physiology but both are very interesting.\n\nI recently started a highly selective math-program in my country, with the intention of pursuing a career in machine learning research. Additionally, I'd like to move to the US if possible. \n\nThe plan was to do well and study hard during the bachelor's part of the program, and then specialize in CS/ML during the master's section and really put weight on publishing something good for the master's thesis. Here the problem arises; the workload is very high and grades are non-lenient. \n\nTo put things in perspective, I study about 60h/week including lectures, and this is pretty close to the average for the program. The students I know who excel have passion for mathematics that I simply don't have and a work-capacity that is hard to match. Additionally, I have periods where I don't study much at all due to my struggles with depression which really hurt the rhythm.\n\nOn the one-hand I feel like I have the potential. I already have a couple decent (I think) research-ideas and have a good aptitude for math & physics, even relative to my peers. If I were to put 5-10h more per week into my studies, and if my periods of depression reduce, I think I'd be able to become one of the top students. \n\nOn the other-hand, while my program is highly selective, it's quite esoteric, so with the exception of a few semi-famous alumni it's basically unknown in the states. Furthermore, the research in the areas I'm interested in is pretty limited, so I won't really have good research opportunities. Finally, grading is quite difficult here relative to most top US schools. A difference I don't think potential grad-schools would take into account. Even if I decide to do a PhD here it would become very difficult & luck-based to get into the US due to H1b restrictions. \n\nI'm contemplating dropping out and studying medicine instead. The medical school here is a real research institution and is well known internationally (top 10 school). Furthermore the workload is significantly less and I can do a PhD in neuroscience here easily as research is very good. If all else fails, I'd still have a \\~50% of matching for residency for a given year which makes it a much more realistic pathway to the US.\n\nWhen do I decide to give up on machine learning and pursue medicine & neuroscience instead? Neuroscience is a bit of a compromise as I find machine learning more interesting and impactful.  At the same time neuroscience is more realistic as the circumstances for succeeding in it are much better.",

          "text": "First of all, thank you for responding.  \nThere are quite a few differences between many EU-countries such as where I study and the US. Instead of applying to a university you directly apply to program/major you want to attain. In my case, I've already started a 5y program in math & cs and am a first year undergraduate. In other words if I decide to continue I've already locked myself into math or computer science. It's of course possible I get interested in something not directly related to machine learning, but it's pretty unrealistic to get into something in the other sciences. The same things apply to medicine, where you apply to medical school directly after high school, so I feel like I need to make the decision now even if there are many uncertainties and possibilities of change of interest.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is what I do now has a very big impact on my future career, and either path locks out the other. There is really no time to postpone the decision.\n\nDoes any of this change your advice?",

      "text": "1) With a doctorate, particularly in a highly technical field, you'd actually have options to get *other* visas rather than the H1B, and those other options have considerably fewer restrictions because the primary interest is in allowing companies and institutions to snap up foreign talent. But you'd probably want to go to an immigration-related sub (e.g. /r/IWantOut) for this, and you'd really need to indicate your nationality.\n\n2) It's somewhat underhanded, but if you're unmarried you can always date in grad school here in the US with the intention of marrying an American, at which point you get a marriage visa. The only trick will be that you need to be *exceptionally* careful about not committing to a fraudulent marriage *and* actually completing your degree.",
