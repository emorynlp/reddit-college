This is exactly the sort of thing that we handle and we know how to handle it effectively.  I recommend that you do NOT contact the person or their university directly, as you will almost certainly not get satisfaction, you will be upset by the responses you get, and you will muddy the water.",

Full professors with decades-long careers in my department do no more than validate the frustration and shrug in futility when these issues come up. We do have an RIO, and still, the prevailing attitude is one of \"yeah, but what can they really do?\" It's encouraging to know that you and others in your position can be effective advocates.

If it's a third of the actual document or claiming OP's results as their own, the advisor is likely in on it and OP needs to go straight to the office of research integrity.",

Depending upon the relationship you have with your boss (P.hD. supervisors are friends for life unless u get in bad relationship) he/she will listen to you and probably scold the student who plagiarised your work (again if its just intro) but not really go on an take an action that will destroy the career of that student. I have seen during my Ph.D. that supervisors hang to one of the good works of their ex-student and give that as a sample to their new students and they don't really mind them copying some of the part in the intro...For an example, my lab has a long history of working on splicing and there was this student who did a great job with the intro in 2010 and since then every alternate student as used the same format in the introduction of splicing...I tried my best introducing spliceosome etc in my way and with a different there but my boss kinda threw an old thesis on me and he said why don't you do sth like this. He even went on to say do this basic stuff as this ex-student did and focus & devote more time on the part that you would be introducing for the first time...I did as I was told to and I guess what my boss loved the part where I introduce the pathway i worked on. I am sure the next students will copy shit from mine...but hey I will be proud. \n\nP.S. it's my personal view...If you were copied by a student from another lab...go for a fight. if they copied anything apart from intro...go fight. Also, I am pretty sure ur boss knows that this student copied or took idea from urs.",

In practice I would draw the line by actually responding in full force without a warning if somebody plagiarises a result of mine, but actually go to the person and talk first if it's a matter of just the abstract.\n\nEdit: I think it's also worth pointing out the context. In my field, quantum information, introductory sections to papers have lost a lot of value. Like, it's a rare occurrence when the abstract or the introduction actually say anything new. Most of it is just hype name-dropping and meaningless. And also introductions to papers in similar subfields many times look *very* much alike. That's not ideal, I agree, but it doesn't imply that the science coming after is not good.",
