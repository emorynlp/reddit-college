  "title:": "[Humanities] I'm a first year master's student, and I've been asked to write a letter of recommendation for a professor who has been nominated to receive a graduate teaching award. I've never written a recommendation letter for anyone, let alone a professor! Any tips?",
  "text": "Some background: I was contacted this evening by the department chair who asked me to write a letter for this professor. Two students have been chosen by the professor herself to write letters. The other student is a PhD student who is very close with her and they have known each other for years I believe. This is my first semester at this University, so I've only interacted with this professor for the last few months. I got along really well with this professor, and I just found out today I got an A+ in her course. She is super cool and a genuinely awesome professor. She even held the last class at her house and cooked us all dinner! \n\nI want to write a really good letter for her, but I'm not sure really how to go about it. Are there any tips on how to structure the letter? The instructions I've been given are \"The letter itself should be no longer than one page and should reflect your experience of \\[professor\\] and your classroom experience.\" Any tips would be super appreciated. Thanks!",

I worked with them and asked what would be best to emphasize, and we worked back and forth on it. They ended up getting the award they were nominated for, so I was very excited, because it was much deserved.",

              "text": "Sure, unless you think it might be inappropriate for some reason. It might help to ask what they would like to see highlighted, or what they have especially tried to put forward. It helped me a LOT, and I was able to write a much more effective letter for my advisor this way. Otherwise, highlight how they made learning fun or engaged you in learning. Talk about how they helped you or made you feel inspired or supported. Be genuine, but also think about what the qualities of a \u201cgood teacher\u201d are and how this person may have fulfilled those for you.",

These will be the main points. The body of the letter should dedicate at least a paragraph to each one using examples, anecdotes, or other data as proof. I wouldn't go over a page. Conclude by summarizing your main points again. That is the basic formula I use for recommendation letters.",

Maybe they give very specific and helpful feedback, or write clear lectures, or give clearly defined assignments relevant to the real world. Maybe there was a time you struggled and she did something specific that was supportive or helpful. Pick a couple of those things and describe the impact they had on students.",

Are there some anecdotes you can share to illustrate her teaching skill, either about yourself or within the larger class?\n\nOne page is very short for such a letter. Open with a paragraph that explains your relationship, then get right to the point.\n\nThanks for doing this-- I've had similar letters written by former students and it's always such a nice gesture.",
