  "text": "I'm a student who keeps finding bullshit in my assigned textbooks: \n\n>\"For example, most Americans do not leave home without their mobile phone. And, if they do forget and leave their home or office without them, they're covered. While out and about, they buy a disposal *(sic)* mobile phone with airtime for a few dollars. However, disposable phones typically lack most of the features of\nconventional mobile phones.\"    \nFrom *Communicating in Business* by Robert G Insley 2nd edition, Kendall Hunt Publishing 2017.   \n  \nThere's no citation for this claim because no one does this. \n\n\nHere's another one: \n\n>\"As a result, many adverse physical, mental, and emotional conditions associated with chronic stress can be reduced or eliminated with regular practice of PMR. It helps decrease insomnia and posttraumatic stress disorder\". \"The Effects of Music Relaxation and Muscle Relaxation Techniques on Sleep Quality and Emotional Measures among Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,\" by M. Blanaru, B. Bloch, L. Vadas, et al., Mental Illness, 4(2) (2012): e13     \nFrom *Stress Management for Life: A Research-Based Experiential Approach 5th Edition* by Olpin and Hesson Cengage Publishing 2021\n\nI looked into that and the study of 13 people with PTSD tests them with music relaxation and muscle relaxation. The study finds that there are positive effects with music relaxation. But the description in the book claims that the PMR is the effective part. \n\nHere's a third one.   \n>Instead, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator\" (MBTI.,) instrument is a personality assessment tool developed in the 1940s by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs.

Each one of the examples you bring up are the opening points of great conversations to be had in class. Too often the classroom experience overlooks topics related to the sociology and/or philosophy of science because they think they have to rush on to downloading whatever information the class purports to offer. While that stuff can be important, the conversations about how we know and what it means to know are way more fundamental and transferable.",

          "text": "I'm glad this student is asking the critical questions. It means on some level we are teaching students to learn.  But these quotations are drastically different.  The first, if it is true has no citation, does not belong in a textbook unless it represents itself as a possible solution.  There's too little information to know what that is.  The student disagreeing based on evidence is a great start but it shouldn't end there.  The student should seek out data in that field, prove any possible scenario incorrect while possibly offering an alternative hypothesis and corresponding evidence.  This is the way, only that's a lot of work to prove some numbnuts is a numbnuts who wrote a textbook.  If I were a student I'd take my moral victory in knowing I'm learning the proper way to research, provide evidence, and vet sources.  Bringing it up to a professor who is using this sort of text in his or her classroom may stir up more trouble than it's worth.  It may shock some students but some instructors are a tad bit sensitive when it comes to admitting they aren't perfect (it won't shock them at all but that's an entirely different post).\n\nThe second and third quotations I'll lump together as they basically ascertain something and provide evidence.  They are not predicting motive, they are not stating they are the best or only solution (as you stated).  The student can disagree with those findings, with the use of such theory, but that has nothing to do with the legitimacy of those statements.  I'd prefer a student like this who questions the entirety of these statements to find alternative theory and compare them.  Or to show why such theory is obsolete or ineffective.  \n\nIt makes my heart happy to see students ask why but they need to make sure they are using their time effectively when doing so.\n\nAlso, most textbooks suck.  It is very rare that a mainstream textbook does a superior job to other books in the field.  But major publishers recognize we can't have students in an introductory course spend 400 dollars on 20 different books per course.  So they synthesize the info into 600 pages, charge 150 bucks and update the books every year or so so that the older versions become irrelevant and students must buy new books instead of the used copies for 20 bucks already in circulation.\n\nIf I must use a textbook I will always try an older version.  But I don't teach in a field where basic theory has many changes made that I can't reference in a smaller more niche book in my field.\n\nI hope the students are aware that sometimes we are bound by what is available within our subject, what our department dictates we use, and whatever numbnuts writer or editor decides to put into that \"newly updated\" text to charge 150 bucks for.  I also hope the students remember that we are keenly aware of the textbook conundrum, most of us having spent 7-12 years as students buying those paper brick monstrosities.  Most of us have been in situations just like the students we teach where it was grocery or books, eating out or books.  Most of us try our best not to have students overpay to learn.",

That feedback makes it back to an editor either through a sales rep (true mainly for giant intro textbooks) or to the editor directly when a faculty member looks up the editor's name in the front matter of the textbook and emails them. \n\nNow, if you've ID'd bullshit during the semester, brought it to your professor's attention, and they do nothing, then that's now their problem too.

      "text": "I had a student in the past contact the textbook author when they discovered a mistake like the second one you gave (where the reference said something different that what was indicated in the text).  He thanked the student and said he would fix it in the next edition. \n\nTextbooks are huge and things can get by the author, reviewers, and copy editors.  As a professor picking the book, I will not know every study they discuss, nor do I have time to.  I will often read a chapter that I am very familiar with the research and then extrapolate the quality of material from that.  Then I'm looking at topics covered, organization, etc.  The first couple of time I use a new book, I make sure to get very pointed feedback from the students about the book.  I would welcome comments about a book lacking accuracy and would take that into account when deciding if I would use it the next semester.\n\nAs for your specific examples.  Yes, the first one seems just odd.  For the second one, I'm going to trust that you read and understood the paper.  I'm not a clinical psychologist, but there may be a place for muscle relaxation in the treatment of PTSD, though there are other treatments that have stronger research evidence.  Also, muscle relaxation is not alone, but instead part of what they call Stress Inoculation Training which the American Psychological Association rates as having modest research support.  The seminal publication for this seems to be:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10224729/\n\nHere are some other resources:\n\nhttps://div12.org/treatment/stress-inoculation-training-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\n\nhttps://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201100456\n\nAs for the final statement, it is not a statement of the quality of the test, but factual information.  The thing is, if you are in education or business, you are going to run across this test and you need to know about it.  Based on the title of the text, Essential Study Skills, I'm going to assume this was written by someone with an education background (yep, verified it).  I'm going to make a controversial statement, most things said by someone with an education background about how to educate is either wrong on only half true.  As a field, they are several decades behind the literature and seem unwilling to change what they do.  See topics such as learning styles and how to best teaching reading as great examples.  All that being said, knowing what is out there is still important. \n\nWhich by the way, this is why you bring these things up in class.  I would love for a student to question these things so that I could have exactly this type of conversation in class.",

      "text": "The author and the publishers have the most responsibility here, IMO. A textbook author is aware that their work will be used to educate students, and all efforts should be made to transmit accurate, reliable information. There's a difference between small mistakes and lazy work (all of these, to me, fall in the latter category. The first is also an egregious wtf). The publisher should also ensure that the book is accurate, if for no other reason than their reputation will (theoretically) be damaged if they are known for pumping out trash content.\n\nProfessors have a responsibility to be familiar with their selected textbook(s) and pick the most accurate options. I realize in some fields/areas, though, there may be few good options for a variety of reasons. In that case, I think they should supplement the text with other material in the field, or at least make their best effort to clarify where there are mistakes and inaccuracies.\n\nThe student, IMO, bears the least responsibility in this. As a student, you don't know what you don't know. You are here to learn, and it's reasonable to expect that is designed to teach you is giving accurate information without distortion. I would encourage any student to seek out supplemental material and cross-check information with other sources - but we have to teach people how to do that. They don't just learn it by osmosis.",

      "text": "Bring it up in class! Good for you that you are reading critically. Textbooks sometimes have mistakes. \n\nPlease keep in mind though, that your professor probably didn't write the textbook - it's not *their* bullshit. Teachers tend to go through a lot of trouble to find the least imperfect textbook for their course. If the book is riddled with problems, you could address doubts with the book itself. But, being overly combative doesn't start a fun conversation that everybody can learn from. \n\nIf there are some minor or incidental issues, simply saying in class that you don't think that  description is convincing, and aren't there better/newer/more interesting ways of looking at that? can be a wonderful addition to a session, it can make you look good, and it can show the other students that just because something is printed in a text book doesn't mean it's perfectly true. Win-win-win.",

Something like on the left you have sweet receptors, on the right you have bitter ones. So I took a candy and stroke the left side of my tongue with it, and it was sweet. Then I did the same on the right side, and it was sweet again. But as a person with less critical thinking than the OP I just thought that I was doing something wrong \ud83d\ude04 Fast forward many many years later, and I'm in a different country with a different educational system listening to a pop neuroscience talk. And the guy shows that picture with the tongue taste zones and says something like: \"You have probably seen this picture. I don't know why they are keeping it in the school textbooks, because it's wrong\"",

One professor spammed me with articles that backed their claim (that PTSD is a temporary and reverisible condition. Long term cases are in fact learned helplessness and personality disorders... Yeah, wow.). Another, insisted that I wasn't understanding the content. I asked them to \"teach me\" and they replied that it was not their responsibility. I would need to read the text again and get into tutoring if it didn't make sense.  What was the content? THere were literally three different definitions for \"mindfulness\" in a single module.
