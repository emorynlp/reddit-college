  "title:": "Overbearing professor making me feel anxious and depressed .... I literally have no idea how to approach this ... is this normal for academia?",
  "text": "Hey everyone! I'm dealing with a really tough situation here and I need some input. I'm keeping this gender neutral just to be extra careful about anonymity. I really, really don't want anyone to find this. I am a graduate student and I teach - this person is a fellowship supervisor. I am transferring to another program at the end of the year so I will only have to work with this person for one more semester, but I really don't want to spend it like this last one and I want to leave here with good memories.  \n\nThings started out pretty good with my supervisor but went downhill fast. Many days of the week, I started getting/currently am bombarded by emails from them, sometimes it has been 8-10 per day, days in a row, each with several questions (what is this? why did you do this? why didn't you do this? what happened here?), giving me tiny reminders about literally everything, asking several tiny, nitpicky questions in a row. When I submit something for review, they make little changes to everything like bolding and unbolding words, italicizing things ... I feel like I can't make a mistake in front of them and they are extremely overbearing. Once, I was asked to redo an entire project because they found a very small error and I couldn't be trusted because of it. Early on, I caught myself working for them for the whole day, multiple days in a row and this work that I do for them is supposed to come secondary to my coursework and research. I've since been able to stop the \"giving them the whole week\" trend but it's gotten worse in other ways. \n\nIt has made me so skittish and anxious to the point where I avoid the work to stay sane and I do everything in my power to avoid running into them. I am really scared that I'm going to develop an anxiety disorder from this. \n\nThey change deadlines for projects at the last minute and expect me to work over the weekend and will text multiple times and request to call if I don't answer their emails right away both during the week (typically over weeknights) and over the weekend (Imagine receiving \"Have you received my email? I need you to read it and turn in X project tomorrow morning\" at 7:30pm on a Friday night). When we have worked on collaborative projects, they have asked for my portion of it days in advance and I have received many of theirs at late hours in the evening the night before they are due and once or twice the morning of, 45 mins before the presentation. I have set boundaries and they just walk all over them - I told them that I needed time over the weekends to get away from work, for my mental health and to maintain my personal relationships and they still attempt to be in constant contact throughout the weekend - emailing, texting, requesting to call. I tell them \"no, I can't\" and they respond, \"but I really need this done.\"\n\nI have had multiple panic attacks from this situation and the anxiety it has severely impacted my work. I feel like I can't get away from this work that I once loved and it's heartbreaking. It has made my depression really bad. I have no space to be me and it has robbed me of what I once loved. I know however that this is this person's version of \"trying\" at work and I don't want them to get in trouble for it. It's killing me though. \n\nI already tried to reach out to the program director about this when the emails were the only problem and told her that I \"felt bad that I couldn't get to all of (this person's) emails and to set an expectation maybe I should say that I won't be checking emails past 7\" ... she told me that she thought it \"would be mean and unreasonable\" if I said that to someone. I know I won't get anywhere with any other aspect of it if I bring it up. \n\nI have to and will finish this next semester - I want to leave here with a degree in hand for all of the work I did do here. I also don't want to get this person in trouble. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I should do? I would love input\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "First of all, I am glad you are transferring programs, because this supervisor sounds like a nightmare. Their behavior is overstepping every boundary there is and it is not your fault. I have seen that some more established academics are very set in their ways, and part of that is because no one ever challenged them when they made others uncomfortable. Some people are truly and blissfully unaware of how their actions impact others. It seems like there is a large burden on you because this person is disorganized, or at least that's how I have interpreted it. They need you to respond to urgent 7:30pm Friday emails because they screwed up and need you to work to remedy that ASAP. Maybe if they were more organized, or more hands-off and trusting, they wouldn't have to constantly ask you to overwork yourself. \n\nIf I were you, I would start enforcing more hard boundaries. You don't want this person to get in \"trouble\", but what about yourself? What about the students that come after you? Someone will have to say no to this supervisor. Maybe, in anticipation of the spring semester, meet with your supervisor in order to clarify your work hours. Remind them, and clearly state, that you only work x amount of hours a week, no weekends. Frame it in a way that also sounds beneficial to them (\"If we get all of our work done during the week, you can relax over the weekend and won't have to bother me!\") They might not even realize what they are doing... but this is definitely abnormal and unacceptable. If you have a frank discussion with them where you set further boundaries (like please do not text me over the weekend!!!!!!!) and they ignore it, absolutely talk to the program director again because this is more than just emails, and you may have understated the gravity of this boundary-pushing the first time. This supervisor won't get in trouble, their inappropriate behavior will (hopefully) be addressed.\n\nPlease don't sacrifice your own mental health for an overbearing supervisor. This is not normal and this situation would make most people similarly anxious and depressed. You should absolutely finish your degree, but I hope that setting boundaries with your supervisor won't get in the way of that.",

      "text": "First you should check if what you are feeling is also experienced by other students. I had worked with very academically demanding professors and for most of us it was a very stressful but rewarding experience, especially when years passed, and we gained perspective on how much we have learned from it. But for one peer it was too much, and she had to leave the program. And that is ok too. \r  \n\r  \nWhat I\u2019m saying is that this professor may not necessary be a bad person but a highly committed teacher. Or maybe not, but you should check that with your peers to gain perspective on that in order to make the best decision.",

I did find out that the other person that works for this supervisor in particular, someone that is a just a few years older than me and married has had a different experience.\nWhile I like this other married student a lot, I have seen them get more \u2018respect for seniority\u2019 overall than other students across the board (they\u2019re basically treated as an adult and they said that their schedule has been respected by this person), I\u2019m assuming because they\u2019re married and a few years older.",

      "text": "Unfortunately many academics do not know or respect work-life balance. But I think that this behavior is completely unreasonable and it sounds unsustainable for you and your fellowship supervisor. Not only are you going to burn out, but it sounds like this person is going to burn through every RA they get.\n\nA number of emails per day is not out of the norm in a workplace environment, but it sounds like this supervisor needs work on collaborative project planning. There is no reason why they should be panic emailing you giving you assignments hours before deadline, and while many academics in training will have to work over the weekend at least on occasion, it is, in my opinion, a completely unreasonable expectation that a failure to plan on their part should constitute such an emergency on yours. \n\nDo you have a contract or reporting form that indicates the number of hours per week you are expected to work for them? Is there a way this can be enforced? Which is to say, do they realize that they are only given so many hours of your time each week?\n\nIt should be possible for you to schedule your time with this person. Let them know that you will be working X and X days on your fellowship projects each week. You\u2019d be happy to meet at such and such time each week to discuss the project in progress and what needs to get done and to review their expectations of you. \n\nThey need to be forced to plan how they are going to utilize you as a resource. \n\nIf you are leaving the program, can you talk to their boss\u2014program head or the department chair\u2014about this very unreasonable work environment that this person is creating? It is toxic.",

          "text": "I agree with this but I will just pick up on a point about the emails. 8-10 emails from one person can be ok in some contexts - eg you're having a back and forth on one point. However, 8-10 emails all on separate things every single day in this kind of relationship is not ok. If there's that much to discuss it should be in a meeting. If it's lots of related minor points they need to go in one email. It's inappropriate to be doing this and I would argue it's one aspect of a larger pattern of bullying here.",

              "text": "Thanks a bunch for this comment!\n\nJust to clarify to the thread what I think about the email situation:\nI totally agree that 8-10 emails in one day is okay in certain contexts \nSometimes they aren\u2019t part or a back and forth - it has sometimes just 8 emails coming from this one person, each with something little in them, tiny questions, as I said above. Over time, they have slowed the emails down a bit, but we still have days like this and it drives me insane. I\u2019ll be working on my computer, trying to tune it out and thinking in je back of my mind, \u2018If I accidentally minimize this MSWord document, how many emails from this person are trickling in behind it?\u2019  \u2026. It\u2019s so stressful\n\nI think they think it\u2019s organized because they are in separate emails, but it\u2019s extremely disorganized at the end of the day because of all of the unimportant things in there getting mixed with important things and deadlines for projects for 2 weeks from now getting mixed with things that this person wants unexpectedly within a half hour to an hour that are impossible to finish in that amount of time with no warning. \nAs for the last minute half-hour deadline things, these are many times unnecessary additions to projects that they come up with at the last minute that neither of us were expecting beforehand and they want me to finish it for them \u2026 I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because they get tired or bored with it or can\u2019t finish these additional things because of mismanaging their own schedule and then lay it on me",

I recently had to speak to someone because someone in their team was doing this to someone in my team and it nearly caused a nervous breakdown. That person ended up getting a verbal warning about the behaviour because they wouldn't stop. It is serious. \n\nThe advice I gave my person was to filter all of the emails into a separate folder and check it once or twice a day and made it clear that they were not expected to respond to emails as they came in and they didn't have to respond if it was something that could wait until their weekly catch up. Apparently at this point my team member somewhat turned the tables because she used the catch ups to go through every individual email one at a time at which point the emails dropped off. I don't know how much scope you have to implement something similar but if you can limit how often you check the emails and how you respond it may help your mental state.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.",
