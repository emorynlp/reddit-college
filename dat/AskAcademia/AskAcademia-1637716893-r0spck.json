  "text": "I'm a graduate student working at the intersection of art and technology, examining how various ontologies can inform our relationship with artificial intelligence.  I'm not native american (latinx), yet want to incorporate various first nations and indigenous ontologies into my research.  I'm  unsure of how to best approach doing so with sensitivity, respect, and care.  The last thing I want to do is appropriate cultural beliefs or misrepresent them.  Has anyone experience this in their research or otherwise have advice?  I thought about broadening the themes at play to be fairly non-specific and more universal (i.e. reciprocity with nature,  the notion that the sacred, spirit, power, or something akin moves in all things ( though not equally), animism, et cetera.)",

Also, careful with applying monolithic, universal stereotypes - you mention \"first nations and indigenous ontologies\" and this is correct - there is no one, single indigenous ontology, there are ontologies, plural, as you note. I would be cautious with any argument about universal elements of indigenous ontologies such as reciprocity with nature, etc. Many do make the case for these universals, but you will also find pushback against it.",

      "text": "Like the other commenter said, I would be careful of homogenizing \"Indigenous ontologies.\"\n\nImho, \\[anthropology PhD candidate here\\], this is a really trendy move in academia these days, but it's rarely done well. There's a tendency to use \"Indigenous ontology\" (or knowledge, or whatever) as bookends to an otherwise totally conventional project, or to position it as a sort of deus ex machina that will solve all the problems of \"Western\" ontology. \n\nIf I were you, I'd start by thinking about why you want to do this. And not just in a \"Academia has been steamrolling Indigenous thought for a few centuries and maybe we should stop,\" kind of way, but one that's specific to your project. Why is this a good/interesting/necessary approach to the specific questions that you're asking? & this may necessitate more detailed research about actual specific Indigenous ontolog*ies*. \n\nI'd also caution against thinking about ontologies in the way that some academic fields think about theories - like they're sets of propositions that you can adopt and put down at will, or \"persectives\" one can step into and out of with ease. In many cases, they are not. Further, taking other (viz. academia) ontologies seriously may actually entail direct conflict with the goals and assumptions of Western academia. If/when this becomes this case, what will you do? To whom do you see yourself as accountable?",

I'm acutely aware of the trend and want to avoid association with it, as much as any one researcher can while not being native.  To be clear, this isn't a reaction to the noted trend or an ill-advised effort to shoe-horn in indigeneity: my research interests are born from a decade's+ personal and professional experience with puebloan culture in the american southwest.  Moreover, the composition of contested and linked understandings of life and balance have shaped my own personal philosophies - I'd like to formalize that interest as a scholar and bring it into concert with my work as an artist.   If you're familiar with the film 80's avant-garde film \"koyaanisqatsi\", and the Hopi origins of the phrase as well, the notion of an imbalance related to our increasingly technologized age is central.\n\nYour last paragraph is deserving of deeper consideration and, if I fully go down this road, something I will have to grapple with again and again.  I already feel a tension, even if I don't feel the need to resolve it (yet.)\n\nthank you for your note.",

Or is unscientific nonsense only worthy of respect when it comes from \"indigenous people\"?\n\nAlternative perspectives are welcome if they have some kind of empirical content (indigenous views on medicinal herbs, and traditional practices such as acupuncture that can be RCTed, are classic examples). But the idea that artificial intelligence should be sensitive to random primitive woo about evil spirits living up mountains or trees having souls is just beyond stupid. You know as well as I do that none of that stuff is actually true, why pretend otherwise?\n\nThere is legitimate debate about the extent to which artificial intelligence research has accidentally incorporated incorrect philosophical beliefs about epistemology/metaphysics and whether different perspectives can be useful and enlightening (Hubert Dreyfus' famous [critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus%27s_views_on_artificial_intelligence) of GOFAI on connectionist/Heideggarian grounds is the classic example, along with the longstanding debates over embodied/embedded cognition) but the point is that these discussions are based around actual rational arguments, rather than baseless spiritual/religious beliefs. Its certainly possible that aspects of religious belief systems can form the basis for philosophical frameworks if they can be supplemented with rational arguments (several Western philosophers have been influenced by non-Western religions for example) but the idea that religious nonsense should be taken seriously at face value because of \"cultural sensitivity\" has no place in the modern world.",
