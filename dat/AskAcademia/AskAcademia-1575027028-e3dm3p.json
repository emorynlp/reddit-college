  "title:": "Can I be honest about disliking my PhD with my supervisors?",
  "text": "I dislike my PhD for a multitude of reasons*. However, I can't quit this PhD (has to do with my visa status and my partner's job, so please don't recommend that I just quit). \n\n\nI'm a firm believer in not complaining about something unless something can be done to fix the situation. However, I'm finding it really emotionally draining to smile and say everything is fine when I dread going into work and find myself crying on the bus home occasionally. They ask me constantly, nearly every day, whether I am liking the country and the project. I don't want to be insulting their country, and I know that it's in my best interest to just finish and get out. But is it okay to say something like \"No, I'm really not happy here, but I'm determined to finish the PhD.\" I suppose my goal in saying something like that is to (1) get them to stop asking me how happy I am and (2) see if they are able to allow me to graduate a little early. They did mention that they could push the final date up a few months if it was requested.\n\n\nJust as a side note, during my first six months, I really pushed to get the old project back and to also have them allow me to do my own research. We had one 3-hour meeting in which they made it very clear that I was to do exactly what they specified on this project or else the PhD wasn't going to work. \n\n\n*To keep it brief: I moved to another country for it, and the process of getting set up (visa, bank accounts, social security number, etc.) is an ongoing administrative nightmare that leaves me exhausted every day and having to work from home way more than anyone else; the office is extremely gossippy with my coworkers knowing the intimate details of my weaknesses before I do; my thesis topic was changed before I arrived and is something I have no interest in; I'm told what to do in every aspect (essentially I'm an engineer implementing my supervisors' ideas); and my direct supervisor is a yes woman who throws me under the bus in nearly every meeting and blindly agrees to the other supervisors' suggestions even after I've spent months researching those ideas and have demonstrated that they're not viable.",

      "text": "I did my PhD in the country that you are currently in (I read your post history) and I also had two supervisors from the countries you are dealing with.\n\nFirstly, I'm sorry you're feeling terrible about your PhD and the country in general. I know it sucks. I really, really understand. My first year was hell. Luckily my supervisors spoke English well but my colleagues in my lab did not. The administration is a complicated, the people can be cold and standoffish, and the atmosphere can quickly become depressing.\n\nSecondly, my advice about the country: Take a deep breath and get proactive. This country is known for its standoffish people when it comes to language. BUT there are many expats and travellers here. I advise you to seek out other international PhD students in your team/lab/building/university. Look for English Libraries and join in. Check your doctoral school and attend a mixer or two. 100% there are other international students who are struggling too, and there are probably PhDs of the country who can speak English and would be willing to help here and there for translation. Build your support network!\n\nThirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn't even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.\n\nLastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn't working\". But, if you feel you might want to continue, you'll need to consider a few things. HR is not your friend. Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you're not happy. I don't think they would be receptive to this.\n\nBut I strongly advise you to learn the language of the country. STRONGLY. Spend this holiday time putting in the energy and work. It will help you  immeasurably. The fact is, you are in their country and you need to speak the language. If they laugh at your poor grammar, who cares as long as you can communicate! If you choose to stay, take their behaviour towards you as part of the PhD - you need to defend your ideas, vision, and data. Take it as a learning experience, you will be a force to reckon with when you succeed. Good luck!\n\nAlso, I know a large network of international PhD students all around the country, give me a PM if you need support.",

I'm at a baby B1 level now, but it's still holding me back when doing literally anything. That's one area where I feel good about what I'm doing actually. \n\n\nIn terms of administration... It's good to hear that things will settle eventually. I'm 9 months into my PhD and I'm aiming to have all the things I need by the 14 month mark at the latest. That's my goal now, but the goal was 6 months when I first moved here. So it's demoralising to know it keeps getting pushed out.\n\n\nMy supervisors are nice people for the most part. Communication is a huge issue, but despite studying the language as much as I can, I think they will always collectively speak English better. So I'm trying to take steps to minimize that by sending extra emails and being extra clear. We'll see how that goes.",

After that, it's just a matter of maintenance. Take it one day at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if today you decide to NOT deal with the damn insurance.   \n\n\nI'm glad to hear your supervisors are nice.

      "text": "I think you should ask about finishing up early without mentioning how unhappy you are. Sounds like you are in an impossible situation, which really sucks. I know someone recommended seeing the counseling center associated with the school, but from my own personal experience and that of people I know, these university counseling centers are usually underfunded and understaffed and often can't do anything to help students. Could be different where you are at, but if you are already seeing a therapist I would probably just stick with that.\n\nMy advice on continuing forward in this unhappy situation is to try to do at least one thing a day that makes you happy. Set aside some time each day to just do something you want to do. Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed and upset, just try to focus on one thing you're doing later that you know will make you feel just a little bit better. This helped me a little bit when I had had rough days during undergrad -- not a cure-all by any means but a way of getting through school one day at a time.",

      "text": "Ok first you need to take some distance from the whole situation. Take two-three/four weeks off and reset. If you really want to do something in that time learn more of the language and/or more of the culture.\n\nSecond I think you really  underestimated cultural distances. I looked at your post history and know several other people from your country to this country. They all hated it for a long time. The culture gap is real, it's huge and I think it's at play with some of the issues here (not the whole problem; but definitely a contributing factor). It looks like you've been in the country for about a year. That is nothing when it comes to adapting to such a different culture. Nothing. (Source this is the fifth country I've lived in). Some of the communication issues you have mentioned sound like culture clash to me. Companies spend huge sums of money training staff in cultural differences before doing business in another country for this reason. Communication gaps can be HUGE. Funny example. During my (German) boyfriend's interview for a job in France the only German person on the interview panel had to pause the interview to explain that what my boyfriend was saying wasn't rude from a German perspective. My boyfriend had asked if the interview panel could understand the technical topic he had just been talking about. It seems stupid; but huge miscommunications can occur.  ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2014/06/19/how-to-succeed-in-a-cross-cultural-workplace/#2723ec34c972](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2014/06/19/how-to-succeed-in-a-cross-cultural-workplace/#2723ec34c972))\n\nIf I can give you some more advice it's to stop saying that  you hate the country, culture etc. I get it you're sad, lonely, nothing is meeting your expectations. It sucks. But the reality is that if you decide you don't like everything then you are making it impossible for you to find any peace there. So get mad if something specific bugs you and then get over it. Try and find something that you like about the place. Anything. No matter how small.  Because the reality is that you don't hate the place, you hate how you feel right now. That reframes things.  The psychological impact of moving to another country  and immersed in another language is really not to be underestimated.  It feels horrible. But you can get through it and you will. It will just take a lot of time, and you need to stop fighting it so much. \n\nBe nicer to yourself. Take a step back. And if you do want to have a frank conversation with your supervisors read something like non-violent communication by marshall rosenberg first so that you are sure the message they receive is the one you want to deliver.",

Crying on the bus every night  just won\u2019t do for much longer.\n\nI am not sure how this works in your research area, but I would recommend being honest with your supervisor/mentor/ committee. I had difficulties with this, but I eventually said that \u201cI am not happy in the lab, and I am struggling to finish the project\u201d. We have then came up with a game plan on how to make it a little better and more bearable. Mind you, it took me three years to get to that point and I didn\u2019t really have a good relationship with my mentor. I scheduled meetings, stopped running the lab with gossipy people, and got a separate office and nice pair of noise canceling headphones to not hear others.\n\nIn your place I would write an email to your mentor, stating what you are struggling with and asking if there is anything that could be done to help you. Have someone proof it for you (dm me if you want). I would also suggest giving yourself time off. Perhaps it\u2019s time to request a vacation (once again if you can). It\u2019s important not to lose yourself in academia. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Unfortunately I'm not really an expert on the particular country in question, but a few things:\n\n1. If your advisor is throwing you under the bus all the time, I wouldn't discuss the exact details of your problem with her.\n\n2. If your position isn't working out, does your school have a procedure for switching labs/advisors? Is it possible to pick up a co-advisor? If you can find one you trust, they may or may not be able to get you off the project you don't like, but they will be able to defend you in these meetings and fight for your ideas on your behalf. One of my labmates did this with my advisor because her original advisor is/was a raging asshole.\n\n3. Does your school offer sandwich PhDs, where you spend a significant amount of time at a foreign university? You might be able to bring that up with your advisor, especially if there's a better technique or tool that would be available at another university. I'd be careful in how you approach this question with them, because it's changing the agreement on them, but it could be mutually beneficial.\n\n4. Are there internships available in your field? Maybe look at doing one of those? It would at least get you out of your situation while you deal with some of the issues you mentioned.\n\nHopefully someone comes in with more personal knowledge of the systems in your particular country. Good luck, OP. Hang in there!",

So whatever the cost of speaking up is, I don't think it could be as bad as not saying anything.\n\nYour supervisor is rolling over to your advisory committee because she's more worried about what they think than what you think. But letting her know you're unhappy with her unwillingness to go to bat for you will at the very least give her pause when mediating these situations. Your leverage here is that the labour she's getting from you could disappear if you decided to walk away at this point. \n\n> I'm a firm believer in not complaining about something unless something can be done to fix the situation.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to register your displeasure about things that you and others have no control over. You shouldn't be afraid to say that things aren't great, and while some might take that personally, as long as you put it to them as something that's not their fault they should be mature and sensible enough to recognize it. You're only seeking empathy, not necessarily a solution.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear that you're struggling. I am familiar -- although not nearly to the same extent -- with the difficulties you're encountering in that country, which I think are perhaps more specific to it than they would be a few hundred kilometers to the east (or northeast) ... but perhaps not southeast. \n\nNot a scientist, but have lived and studied abroad, and my advice is that no one likes hearing from a foreign PhD candidate that they don't like the research or the country. \n\nPerhaps a more diplomatic tack: don't make it about the country itself or your program, make it about a general (and empathizable) situation. If someone asks how you are, say \"I'm enjoying the adventure aspect, but living abroad is pretty lonely, and I'm realizing just how hard it is to not speak the language natively. Even though I'm taking language courses and progressing, it's disheartening to have to ask people to repeat themselves or to make mistakes and not be understood.\" \n\nI guess best-case outcome would be that that gets you invites into the professors' social circle and some language help, and maybe helps them temper their expectations about how excited they think you should be.\n\n\nEDIT: I also think it's worth considering why you are doing a PhD there on a project you aren't thrilled about, which is bringing you neither personal satisfaction nor great career prospects. I presume the boyfriend is involved in this decision somehow, but it might save you a lot of misery to do it in even another EU country...",

Your situation is very unfortunate and strange. Most people here speak English rather well, specifically the younger generations. Same goes for French honestly. Your department sounds very unprofessional judging from your description. I am shocked to hear that its being run like that. Most universities in these countries are held to a very high standard. Working your ass off and getting a 10/20 score or dropping out is normal for a lot of students.\n\nI would like to reaffirm what others have said, take it up with the counseling services. Generally, the Universities in these regions are fairly well-organized and should have a good support structure. Also, most countries have organisations specifically aimed at foreigners trying to fit into a new country.\n\nI have quite a few friends and family who have worked as expats in the United States and they too felt lost at first. They joined social clubs or participated in local events, often specifically tailored to foreign workers. \n\nLet me know if you need some help with Dutch when trying to find either of these two suggestions.",

I have never worked there, but have visited many times, for both personal and professional reasons (I have collaborators there), and have sent several students to work there for up to a year at a time.\n\nMost of my students loved being there - one hated it, and struggled greatly.  Looking back on the students who went there, I can see that the very social students (amicable, friendly, engaged) did very well, and the more quiet and reserved student did very badly.  It is almost a caricature that people in that country are \"aloof and stand-offish\", but the opposite is true - once you get past that first hurdle. \n\nFor language - yes - you can come across the odd \"if you cannot speak it properly, do not speak it at all\" -but that is generally very rare.  From my personal experience, I get vastly different responses from people if I start in their language, and if I start in English.  The joke is that they all speak English better than I speak that language- (I am dragging from the classroom from nearly 40 years ago!) - but if I start they are normally incredibly patient while I struggle dragging it up - and they really respond to the effort.  \n\nFor the PhD - all I can say is it ends - eventually.  I had a nightmare supervisor - who to my face told me I was just a pair of hands in his lab.  All I can say is that I use him as I shining example of what NOT to do with my students, and I think it makes me a much better mentor because of it.  \n\nA PhD is a learning experience, and both good and bad things are learning experiences.  Stick at it and good luck.",

I was honest and said that I found that topic confusing and that it may be challenging beyond the scope of what I was prepared for (and also not what I am interested in studying, and to be fair, he already knew that wasn\u2019t my concentration), but that I was willing to learn and work on it. I did work on it for awhile while I developed the skills I needed for my actual interest, and have recently transitioned back into my preferred area of study. I\u2019m not sure how far you are into your PhD and I understand you probably won\u2019t be able to completely transition, but you may be able to relate your project to your current interest and graduate early.",
