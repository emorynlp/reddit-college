  "title:": "Very Questionable Scientific Paper in \u201cPredatory\u201d Journal",
  "text": "tl;drGrad student in CFD lab, read an extremely questionable (and supposedly peer-reviewed) paper in an [MDPI journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI) (MPDI publisher seems to be controversial and linked to the topic of \"[predatory open access publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing)\"). My supervisor agrees with the assessment. How should I proceed? Should I even bother with a letter to the editor. I've only published one paper so far, so rather inexperienced with the day-to-day nature and politics of academia.\n\nHello everyone,I'm a grad student in mechanical engineering, doing research in a CFD / Fluids lab.\n\nA few days ago, I've read a paper on my research topic and was very excited by the content of their work. They applied a very novel technique / idea to the problem I am currently working on, and after skipping over the abstract and conclusion, I was left a little underwhelmed. It had seemingly no real content. But when reading scientific work as a student, my first intuition is always that *I* have to read it more carefully and probably am not understanding everything.\n\nSo I completely worked through the paper, and with every additional page it got worse. The paper was written very nicely, good figures \u2013 at a first glance it is not obvious that this might be a low quality publication. But the content was full of mistakes I would expect my undergraduate students to make in their first CFD semester. Some bizarre decisions such as applying incompressible CFD solver to highly compressible flow cases etc.\n\nAfter working through it and making notes on everything that seemed out of place to me, I talked with my supervisor about it, and he fully agrees with my assessment. The paper is not only full of (for ease of writing I call the mistakes now..) mistakes, but also just \u2013 in my mind \u2013 bad scientific style. There are lots of words seemingly describing the methodology, but basically not real content behind those words.\n\nSo, long story short, my advisor and I basically get a few chuckles out of but didn't really discuss anything further. But now I got the feeling \"to do something about it\", hence I talked to my supervisor again, and he said, if I wanted, he'd support me in writing a letter to the editor.\n\nThen I looked up the journal, which is part of the [MDPI family of journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI), and stumbled upon their Wikipedia article.. Puuh, half the Wikipedia page is about controversies concerning journals published by the MDPI publisher, with the phrase \"[predatory open access publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing)\" in the third paragraph.\n\nTo be honest, I am a bit unsure how to pursue this and was looking for some input from more experienced people in the field of academia. Do I even bother to write such a letter? This might sound a bit weird, but I don't want to but my hand in a bee's nest.. But it bothers me that such blatantly problematic research was (supposedly peer-reviewed) and published. What if they don't care at all?\n\nI won't name the researchers, paper or even specific journal at this point in time. This is not about blaming someone or creating drama. I hope some of you have a few insights to help me make my mind up about what to do.\n\nThank you & cheers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall addition: I looked up the authors, first author seems to be a student with no other publications. So no red flag so far. But the second (and final) author has never published anything in the field of fluid dynamics. Some \"meta\" and broad-engineering papers, mostly methods and strategies paper tangent to engineering. But no previous work in CFD or fluid dynamics.\n\nEdits: Spelling mistake, English is not my mother tongue, sorry!",

The former is likely a waste of your time for you and the editor, as many others have pointed out, unless there\u2019s clear evidence of fraud. The second kind (which I believe is the one you\u2019re thinking about, right?) is enriching for research and these \u201cLetters to the editor\u201d are very common in some fields. They are basically a publishable extended academic comment/argument that the authors can respond/reply to. Sort of a [post publication review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor).\n\nI am not sure if this particular journal offers this kind of publications and if they charge fees for them (some journals don\u2019t, but given MDPI history and dubious perception, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised).\n\nWith that in mind and given your supervisor will support you, working on this \u201cLetter to the editor\u201d publication could be a nice addition to your publication history and help others (including the authors) to continue to (re)evaluate their work.\n\nEdit: thank you anonymous kind redditor for the award.",

I was tempted to submit something because they're fast and I'm early career, but: they have a 1500 Swiss Francs publication fee. Even after explaining that I am an adjunct professor, that I have no funding and all that they still said I should have to pay 450 Swiss Francs. I gave it up. I don't earn enough to afford such a fee. Also, I was cited in one of their journals and my name was spelled wrong. The paper was fine, but I wonder: what are these 1500 Francs for if they can't even check whether people's names in the reference list were spelled correctly? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

But unlike mainstream media, which is aimed at your average Joe, academic journals have a very different audience, professionals, experts, and highly critical minds. This is why it matters a lot if we have fake news and shit like mis and disinformation in the media, but in academic journals, any scientist worth their salt or worth anything at all, would spot BS from a mile away. So people publishing BS won't get far in life, at least not just based on these publications. If they approach any positions with real impact, they'd be exposed before they even interview. \n\nThat's one point, the other point is that nothing will change if you contact the editor. And even if they aren't in on it, one paper is retracted, ten come in its place.\n\nOf course this is still not good in general, because sometimes BS academic pubs make their way to the general public, like with the anti vax crap. But something like mechanical engineering.. Eh, worst thing that'll happen is people start believing in a conspiracy like Newton never existed.

I actually don't know why this person published something there, anyway. \n\nIf I were you, tbh, I wouldn't give a shit. But I'm curious, can you share the journal's name?",

Sometimes you need something published quickly for a grant proposal or similar. If it's mediocre, go for MDPI. (Only if their journals in your field are okayish).\n\nFor example, I published a Covid-situation related paper (review/opinion piece, no original research), which received great impact in my community **because** it was published quickly. It wouldn't have helped anyone 2 years later.",

But you, talented PhD student that you are, cannot fix the broken publishing industry and it's not your job to. \n\nYou don't need to fix every problem that you see, and actually trying to is a problem behaviour (been there, did that, tanked a relationship with a boss as a result, learned my lesson). It's important to learn when you need to act and when you need to step back. This is for many reasons, firstly you'll save your mental health A LOT. Secondly, you're being paid to do X, spending your time fixing a, b and c is going to damage your work and your reputation. Thirdly, there's often a lot more to a problem than you realise and you wading in isn't helping. Lastly, managing someone who always needs to fix things rapidly stops being charming and starts being exhausting. \n\nI know you see the injustice here but so does everyone else. Fix the problem by being an advocate for alternative publishing models that will make the market far less attractive to predatory publishing, get involved in iniatives to improve how peer reviewers are treated, support things like PlanS, DORA and pre-print archives, anything to disrupt the publishing industry. That's how you fix this. Slowly, incrementally and painfully.",

I wrote a detailed, numbered summary of everything wrong and recommended rejection. In my comments to the editor I said it was highly unusual to get a manuscript that has already been made ready for publication. \n\nAmazingly, I got it back for a second round and was very disappointed to see that the other reviewers had recommended major and minor revision, respectively. Major I can understand, but minor revision was a ridiculous recommendation; that reviewer was clearly not a content expert at all. And the authors\u2019 responses to my comments were not what they actually revised in the paper! I flat out told the editor this was not a well-designed study, the authors were deceptive in their response to me, and it shouldn\u2019t be published. A couple weeks later I got an email saying it had been published.  Total farce.",

If you did the math wrong, that would warrant a correction or retraction. But, if you think they used the wrong method, but the peer reviewers think they used the right one... well, the editor is not likely to care much about your dispute.\n\n(This largely makes sense, because what's 'right' and 'wrong' can be fairly subjective. For instance, imagine that you wrote an article using example X, but then some reader thought that was an unrepresentative example and you should have used example Y. You wouldn't be keen if an editor pulled the article, especially after your peer reviewers agreed that example X was valid.)\n\nThis is where writing the critique paper will make more sense. You can make the argument that example X is unrepresentative and that example Y is more representative.",
