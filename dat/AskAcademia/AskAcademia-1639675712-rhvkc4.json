  "text": "I don't know if this happens in subdiscipline subs, but both r/genetics and r/evolution have a lot of (I assume outsiders/trolls) baiting people into discussions of either eugenics or \"if evolution is true why does X happen\". It's so frequent that it makes academic Twitter seem more friendly. Does this happen in other disciplines, for example do social science subs get hit with troll bait around \"Cultural Marxism\" or CRT?",

I study things like grading/assessment theory, assignment design, etc. And I've lost track of how many times people tell me that it's completely obvious that grade inflation is rampant, or that it's completely obvious that the best way to motivate students is to give them all failing grades and then threaten them with homelessness and/or mandatory military service if they don't try harder.\n\nThough probably the most common thing I hear is some variant of, \"Well my teacher did it this way, and that worked for me so obviously we should do that for everybody. And if there's anybody who that doesn't work for... I mean, somebody needs to flip the burgers. Problem solved!\"",

These can be kind of fun sometimes, though, because you get to bust out some of that computability theory that you learned ages ago, and thought, \"when the heck am I evern going to need \\*this\\*??\" and now it's like, oh that stuff is actually cool because we know what we really can and can't do.  And that's pretty neat when you explain and some goes \"oh woooow, I didn't know!\"  But you can also sometimes get the people who thing that machine learning (ML) or blockchain are some kind of magic that can do anything and will solve whatever problem they want....   Sorry no, you cannot determine whether someone has cancer from pictures of their cousin's cat, no matter how much data you have to throw at your ML algorithm....  \n\n\nThe much more annoying issue that comes up is more in the practical programming subs, than the academic computer science ones....   Somebody comes in and says, \"I have this awesome idea! This is generally my idea (but I'm not giving specifics so you can't steal it)....  will someone please implement this for me....  in your spare time....  for free.\"  And I guess they just don't know (or care?) how much work, time, and effort it is for even a seasoned expert to implement their idea....  nor how common a \"brilliant, once-in-a-lifetime, genius idea\" is.

Specifically, they don't realize how complex these issues are and how scientific theories are created, tested, and modified or how scientific evidence is gathered, evaluated, and compared with theoretical predictions. With regards to, for example, evolution, it's not a binary yes or no. We do have a wealth of evidence for it, but suppose we did find some evidence that disagreed with what we believe to be true. We would not just throw out the entire theory on a whim. Instead, we have to realize that we've got some aspect of our theory that's too simplistic and overgeneralizing or making some other sort of error. In other words, the phenomenon is more complex than previously thought. Another example of this is Einstein's theory is general relativity and Newton's theory of gravitation. Newton's theory holds for many circumstances, but for certain phenomena, Einstein's theory gives values that align more accurately with reality.",
