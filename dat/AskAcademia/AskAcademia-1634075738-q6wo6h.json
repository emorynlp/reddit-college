A lot of the burden to relocate and support yourself personally is on you. Universities don't invest in those they hire like industry does. The post doc I took had people coming from South Africa, and they went broke and homeless within the first 3 months of starting because of unforeseen costs of relocation that the university who hired them refused to cover. I'm Black American coming from a marginalized background and hit bankruptcy, and nearly went homeless because no university would provide me with what I needed to sustain myself, personally. This -- despite the fact that I was overwhelmingly successful and pulled in over $150k in grant and research money for the universities I worked at. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, I was forced to resign from my TT job and move back in with my parents. And I HAD a TT job. If you're not already well-off, academia is not a viable career path in the slightest.",

Literally anything else you'd do would grant you far more money than an academic career. I know people who left the academic pipeline after their masters, are doing FAR LESS work in industry than I ever even knew was possible, and were making $25-30k more than me as a TT professor. \n\nI'm only just now learning what my skills are worth outside of academia at 30, but that's because I've been in the academic pipeline since Kindergarten with no breaks in between. At no point did I ever have exposure to work outside of this path, so I never knew what I was worth. Academia in the US is a trap unless you've got the generational wealth to be supported by others who are in non-academic careers making enough money to support you. I completely regret this career path, and I'm suffering heavily because I didn't get out when I should have. Don't fucking come here unless you know you're going to the bottom of the barrel.

But it's much less competitive at R2s, liberal arts schools and so on. Plus, economists are often eligible for related positions at business schools, public policy schools, etc., many of which pay better than school of arts and sciences positions.

After WWII, China was a poor country and had no means to create an institution that could rival those in developed countries. The government realized this problem and sought to export their brightest and youngest so as not to waste their talents. I assume they incentivized this through grants and other monetary benefits. Anyways, they sent a bunch of smart kids over to places like the US and Europe, and they went through school just like the native kids. However, unlike the native kids, the consequences for flunking out was going back home to China which most likely meant starvation and suffering. This sort of \"motivation,\" combined with their intrinsic work ethics and smarts, has  driven the success of many Chinese academics. Some have become professors and perhaps some have even become directors of American/European institutions. \n\nFlash forward to present day. China is no long the poor nation that it used to be. They're now considered \"developed,\" which means they have the cash to bootstrap a powerful academic infrastructure. They've got the money, now they need to hire the people with the know how to realize these grand visions. Where to hire these people, one might ask?  Well, it's really simple, just hire those Chinese professors and directors that they sent abroad as kids. Make them an offer they can't refuse. Like a really big paycheck and a yearly research fund with no R01 style funding competitions. This is the long game that China has played and they've played really damn well.\n\nSo, OP, consider this. If you are young and have no family that relies on you financially, then the risk isn't so high. As you get older and as people start to depend on you financially, you cannot take up opportunities like this. If you go to the US, consider keeping a channel open to your home country/institution. Then, take what you've learned in the states and bring them back home so that your country can prosper in the long run. This is a play that would be worth considering. Good Luck.",

But what about moral superiority, supremacy in power, in rank, etc. or other such possible interpretations/usages? If \"objective supremacy\" were a conceptualization, then, again, it'd be fine. But it's not, it's just descriptive words. Hence, the lack of precision and clarity. It becomes more of a conceptualization throughout the text, however, we don't know that by only approaching the abstract.\n\nIn terms of the papers content, I agree. And I don't think it's bad at all. The abstract in your link, on the other hand, actually seems pretty good. It's very clear. It almost makes it look too simple.\n\nThink about keywords (in multidisciplinary contexts): would Ethnography be a good one? I think it would. What about Cognitive Dissonance or Participant Observation? Again, I think it works. We all know what it's about, even if it doesn't respond directly to our own discipline. But Objective Supremacy? Unless it is defined otherwise we'd need to rely on its general usage and/or definition. \n\nIn any case, that's not a hill I'd be willing to die on. It's a continuous learning process for me and I don't claim that I've figured it all out. I still struggle with writing abstracts myself and, perhaps, tend to project some of my own insecurities onto the work of others. If I had to teach writing articles to undergrads I'd simply not know how to defend the abstract we are discussing here. On the other hand, it seems that it tries to do something different and I generally applaud creativity and out-of-the-box approaches.",
