While I can fill these threads with my wise thoughts (try and stop me), are there other ways to use my experience, know-it-all attitude, and time to help students?",

There are a lot of writing resources, but there are literally not enough staff, even before the pandemic, at my university. I've heard some fancier universities have technical writing centers or special courses to teach STEM students how to write. You could probably be an adjunct or tutor!",

It's sort of like raining knowledge on us students, and the department pays for lunch or beer/snacks. Counts as a training offering for the department.",
