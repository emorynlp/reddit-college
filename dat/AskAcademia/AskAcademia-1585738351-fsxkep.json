  "title:": "How to tell your supervisors you're not doing well mentally? [xpost /r/askprofessors]",
  "text": "So COVID-19 is really messing with me. I have a history of mental illness, and have been relatively fine the last few years, but this whole iso thing is kicking me back to my worst. I've got like no work done whatsoever over the last few weeks.\n\nI'm supposed to be updating my supervisors where I'm at - which is nowhere - in the next couple of days. I mentioned that I was having difficulty working a week or so ago, but not to the actual extent. They were like 'that's cool' and we delayed our meetings.\n\nBut I *still* don't have anything to show them, despite the extra time. I'm not doing well in my head - I'm seeing my psychologist again, but that's recent, and I'm flailing and things are shit.\n\nWhat should I tell them about this? I've also only been working with them for like a month, and 3 of those weeks I've been in iso. So saying \"hey I'm in a mental health crisis\" feels to me like an admission that I can't hack graduate studies. I don't know what to do, or what to say, or how to phrase it such that I don't look like a flaky idiot. Ideas? Phrasing? I don't know.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much everyone, all these responses have been so helpful and lovely. I'm going to call disability services today, and chat with a mate in the faculty as well to get his opinion. Not feeling better per se, but I've got a better handle on the situation than I did last night.\n\nThanks again, and all my love to everyone - hope you're taking care and holding up xx\n\nUPDATE: Just heard back from them. They were both really lovely and offered to Zoom just to catch up. For all the grad students who commented who are in similar positions, I feel much better for having done this, and I hope it all goes well with you and your supervisors. Happy to chat/share my email if it would be helpful to anyone else x",

Personally, I\u2019m always happy to give leniency to my students that are struggling with mental illness, especially if they tell me they\u2019re taking steps to improve the problem (as you\u2019re doing by seeing a psychologist). Like other people have said this is affecting everyone, your supervisors included, just be honest with them! It might feel really good to just get it out there - it sounds like you\u2019ve got enough going on without the crippling pressure of productivity. No one knows what the best way to handle COVID is, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. We all just need to take care of ourselves the best we can. If you want, feel free to type out a draft of your email here before you send it!",

I mentioned last week that it was a struggle getting thesis work done; I wanted to let you know that it's still a difficulty at this time. I've had difficulties with mental illness in the past, and although it's been stable over the past few years, this whole situation is affecting it again.\n\nI've managed to get some reading done (and a small amount of writing, although there's nothing really worthwhile in there), but generally speaking I haven't been able to get anything done. I've started seeing a psychologist again, and we're working on getting back to a more stable position.\"\n\n... I don't really know what to say after this? I don't think there's anything I can ask them to do, except just not expect any work for a while? But that feels like a cop-out/not something that's really going to help. Also, I'm not sure if this is over-sharing?",

I think you could just end it with something along the lines of, \u201cI wanted to make you aware of the situation/where I\u2019m currently at\u201d, without a specific ask of them. You could also be more explicit and just ask for their patience and understanding as you navigate through this. \n\nBest of luck! I\u2019m sure your supervisor will understand and be glad that you are prioritizing your mental health and wellbeing.",

                      "text": "Depending on how you're feeling and how things with your psychologist are going, you could end with a call to action for them: that you'd like to work with them on strategies to keep your work moving along; or that you need some time to regroup and plan to circle back around with them when you're feeling better to create some plans, or...something like that. Even just saying \"This is just an FYI at this point and I'll reach out again when I have more\" - so they understand what you're asking them for here.\n\nMy other piece of advice, as someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety most of my adult life? Treat it like any other illness, including in your communications to your advisors. You don't need to dance around it or feel ashamed or embarrassed. You will feel that way sometimes - fake it until you make it - be very matter of fact about the illness and its repercussions just like you would be if you had covid-19 or a sore throat or whatever other kinds of physical illness. People tend to take cues from your demeanor.",

She shared how she was also trying to adapt to a new system etc and asked that I share my ideas verbally, she approved a few of my ideas and told me to run with them at my pace.  \n\n*I hope you are well, I just wanted to have a check-in meeting next Wednesday to discuss my progress so far.* \n\n*I haven't been coping well with working from home for the past few weeks. I am working at a pace that I had not anticipated and am falling behind my schedule. I do have ideas, but I am struggling to put them down on paper. I am also struggling to read.*\n\n*I am working on putting a new system in place ( which I am willing to share with you during the meeting) that I hope will improve my productivity. So far I've been working on my results chapters and I still don't have anything of quality to show you. I am hoping to discuss a way forward and a new date to send you something for review.*",

One of the most important things for getting through this stuff is to build a good relationship with your supervisor, based on trust and honesty.\n\nEveryone has bad weeks. Everyone screws up. In those cases, I find the best approach is to be straight up and honest about the fact, but also remember to paint yourself in the best light possible. Emphasize where you've been putting your efforts, even if you didn't accomplish anything significant. Especially in this situation and at this early stage, your supervisor probably cares a lot more about your effort than your results.\n\nLet me ask: have you managed to put *any* time into school-related stuff? Even 10-20 hrs a week? What have you been working on during that time?",

              "text": "Right, my point is that you didn't do *nothing*. You spent a few hours trying to work by reading and writing. You spent a lot of time dealing with mental health. I don't know exactly what you mean by \"overworking\" but it sounds like that took a lot of time and energy. You're also seeing a psychologist, which shows me that you're trying to change things going forward.\n\nPaint the picture of a human who's trying their best -- that's what you are, right? It might not be as pretty as the person you *wish* you were, but it comes across a whole lot better than just saying \"I didn't do anything.\" Even the stuff you just said to me is already pretty good. I already believe that you're not just some slacker who's using the pandemic as an excuse.\n\nTo make things better: if possible, try to come up with a concrete plan to improve things going forward. (E.g., I'm doing XYZ to try to sort through this mental health stuff.) And show that to your supervisors. Even if your plan doesn't end up working, it shows your supervisors that you're thinking about this stuff and trying. It gives them a reason to believe this is probably just a temporary setback.\n\nThe only thing you can't control is your supervisors' reactions. But honestly, if you can't trust your supervisors with the human stuff, I think that's a reflection of them, not you.\n\nMost of all, take care of yourself! Going through the transition into grad school can be really hard, even when there *isn't* a pandemic on top of it. Like, seriously, really hard. Even for those of us who look successful from the outside. You're not the first person to struggle like this, and you won't be the last.\n\nEdit, to drive this point home: I literally *just* got an email from my department talking about negativity bias and overcoming the difficulties of being a grad student right now. You're definitely not alone here.",

I got a \u201chow are you right now?\u201d Email also asking if I wanted to schedule some meetings to work in a specific part of a project from an advisor, and this was my response; \n\u201cDear X,\n\nRealistically, the transition to work from home has been rather difficult for me. Getting anything done is taking much more effort than it normally does, and my day-to-day motivation to do things is very low. I have an appointment with my psychologist next week and I am making positive strides toward getting things done but it is admittedly difficult. \n\nI think until I'm a little more stable with work from home, I'm hesitant to schedule a bunch of meetings. [Another coworker] and I have met a couple times to talk about a project, and while it's been great for idea generation, I am struggling to then implement those ideas after the fact. Right now I am trying to focus on one small goal at a time, yesterday I managed to read a paper which I was rather happy with, I'm hoping to do the same or more today.\u201d\n\nI then wrapped up with a couple ideas about the project, thanking them for their patience, and signed off.\n\nThey were extremely understanding. Everyone is struggling right now. We\u2019ll get through this, just keep taking things one day at a time.",

The fact that I am a foreigner who lives alone and has been on a quarantine for 22 days really concerned them, so I think your supervisor should definitely understand as well.

This helped to lessen the pressure l had to be 'productive' and allow myself to accept that things are different now, and any good progress is good. I managed to submit a chapter draft last week and got good feedback. This has motivated me to remain positive and  to keep going. I am happy that my supervisor understands how stressful the current situation is, and l am sure yours know too. Try to communicate how you feel to them, without promising specific dates of deliverables. Commit rather to continue to work on your research and submitting something along the way.",

Stress makes us focus on small details, after which become not so important once we step back and see the bigger picture. In many cases a one or two month suspension is ideal for these situations. It\u2019s not a stigma, it\u2019s a strength. It\u2019s also a logical strategy decision by the faculty so you can receive support when you need it most.
