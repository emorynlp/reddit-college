  "title:": "Professors & Faculty Members: When reviewing applications for graduate students, how do you evaluate a candidate's potential for research? What qualities in an applicant demonstrate strong potential as a successful researcher?",
  "text": "Hey there. \n\nAs a prospective grad student wishing to pursue a STEM field (Computer Science), I read Phillip Guo's [excellent article on grad applications](https://pg.ucsd.edu/PhD-application-tips.htm). My key understanding is that for M.S. and Ph.D. applicants *the biggest factor in a successful application is a candidate's research experience*.\n\nLikewise as a corollary, should the applicant lack actual experience the second-best thing would be their *research potential*.\n\nHence my question is: when you review an application, *what are some of the signs that you look for in order to evaluate a candidate's potential? What are the qualities in an applicant which demonstrate a strong potential as a future researcher?*\n\nI'm interested in these answers because I am an undergraduate myself who is applying for a M.S. in Computer Science, but I come from a Humanities (Philosophy/Classics) background without any prior experience in STEM research.\n\nAs an academically-talented student with an aptitude for the Humanities, I want to know how I can best present myself as a serious candidate, with excellent potential for graduate-level research and scientific inquiry.\n\nThank you very much!",

Lots of MS CS programs nowadays welcome students from non-CS backgrounds though you may have to take some bridging courses. \n\nBear in mind though that if you are interested in a PhD down the line, most good schools will not seriously consider your application without some research experience so perhaps that maybe a priority while you are doing your MS.",

You will find that this is essentially what papers (and even grant proposals in a way) do, so demonstrating your skills in the above way can show potential for succeeding in research that requires the above literally all the time. \n\nAnother aspect is self-sufficient problem solving that may be demonstrated in many ways, as well as curiosity and self-Motivation. Hard to say what could work in an specific case but the important thing to note is that it's not enough to just call yourself a word, like \"I'm a passionate and hard working problem solver\", because everybody can write that. The important thing is the ability to back it up with things that you did in a specific way, and that ideally, can be verified. \n\nGood luck with your applications!",

There are two things to keep in mind, however: First, there may not be a mechanism in place for them to easily start formal collaborations with non-students. Yes, even if you want to volunteer your time for free, we may not be allowed to accept it, because of the possibility that we'll be sued later for exploiting free / unpaid labor. There are sometimes formal volunteering programs in place to allow our students to work with us, but again, this might not extend to those outside of the university.\n\nSecond, you need to be exceptionally self-motivated and independent. And that's unfortunately very difficult to convey in emails---it's why I usually only work with a student when I've seen how they are in one of my classes. All too often, working with a new student research assistant means I need to spend a lot of my own time and energy supervising this student, figuring out what they can work on, directing them, etc. At least with students I'm in a formal partnership with (e.g., those taking a research semester with me), there's some expectation that it'll pay off (in the form of a paper, report, work done, etc.). Students outside of the university always have the risk of simply disappearing. That may not be a time sink many professors think is worth the risk.",

You're cheap labor, you do the grunt work for the profs, grade the papers etc.  So dont underestimate that having a BS or MS means you're a well trained person, and not just some random scrub.  It's easy to forget that you have value and are not so easily replaceable.  Maybe I underestimate how good of a candidate I was.\n\nI dont have answers for you.  Just that every year grad schools welcome thousands of students into PhD programs.  They dont do it for charity.  They need the students as much as the students need them.  You are more valuable than you might feel.\n\nPragmatic advice abounds.  Study hard, research what you want to do your PhD in, be flexible, reach out to profs etc etc etc.  All common sense stuff.  Just adjust your attitude about your value.",

      "text": "(research) experience is irrelevant to me unless its led to publications in good venues; its ability that matters. Having \"experience\" would maybe give you a month head start in a PhD, its irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Note that others will feel different about this\n\nWhat matters to be are the things that signal ability and raw intelligence. Your grades during your previous degrees (with some informal weighting according to the prestige of the university you went to), the grades you got in difficult modules especially, your general demeanour during an informal interview, how well you seem to understand things, whether you can come up with ideas on the spot, references (but only from someone you've done a project with), etc.\n\nAside from that, I'd say that level of subject knowledge does matter but its secondary to raw ability since smart people can learn new things fast; I'd rather take a very smart person that has done only a couple of modules related to the PhD area than a somewhat smart person that has a Masters degree in exactly that field.  I usually ask a few basic competency questions to screen out the people who really do know nothing. Then you have general passion for research, whether I think the person seems to come up with good ideas, etc. Then there's the basic \"do I actually want to talk to this person multiple times a week?\" aspect - PhD student-supervisor relationships are ultimately close mentoring and you ideally need a student that you want to be around, and who can integrate into a group.",
