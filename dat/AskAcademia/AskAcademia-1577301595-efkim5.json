If you want to transfer, get a graduate degree, get a certification or do basically anything in the future your degree is worthless.\n\nAccreditation is only suspended when things are seriously wrong.\n\nA degree is a MASSIVE investment (perhaps the biggest of your life) of both money and time.  You should expect a serious return.  There are so many other schools to choose from...why risk it?",

If it was a top tier school and you got a scholarship to compete with other top tier schools then \"being down the road\" would be a big reason. But settling on a failing school for that reason isn't good.\n\nWhat you need to consider is how well do they prepare you for a job in a given field. How will you fit in with the students and faculty culture. And will it financially be worth your time.",

It is still accredited there is just a much higher chance it loses it.\n\nIf what i read is correct -- that the school is tuition dependent and they're only enrolling a fraction of the students they did a decade ago -- then I'd be really wary they dont only lose accreditation but potentially close in the not too distant future. More than a handful of small New England colleges have closed or been bought out in the past few years and i have to imagine that just makes things more difficult for alums down the road.\n\nLike others in the thread say Goddard is progressive in the curriculum but are by no means the only school offering that sort of student experience so I'd consider looking around and thinking long and hard before going there.",

      "text": "Well since few did answer this directly, the risk essentially is you complete the program then apply for graduate school or a job and are told that program does not meet their requirements for an acceptable degree.\n\nFurthermore to lose accreditation, it means things are so bad that student's education are getting affected, and the way this usually happens is in creating situations where students do not graduate at acceptable rates.  So getting a worthless degree is a best case scenario.  It is far more likely you will spend years of your life and a ton of money to walk away with an incomplete degree, credits that will not be transferable and debt that needs to be repaid.",

      "text": "What type of accreditation are we talking about? \nRegional? State? Program Specific? \nIn a general sweep, I\u2019d say avoid the program. However, accreditors usually require schools to publish why they were suspended/put on probation. Some issues are more serious than others, and you can usually look up when the school will be receiving a site visit, which may be occurring before you are attending. I say exercise extreme caution and do your own investigation. \n\nThis is coming from someone who works in program accreditation.\n\nEdit to add: in most cases, students who enroll in an accredited program, which becomes suspended or unaccredited while enrolled must be \u201ctaught out\u201d and barring serious concerns usually receive the degree under an \u201caccredited\u201d program. And if a program has their accreditation revoked after you graduate, your degree is still seen as a valid one from an accredited university/program.",

Even if the school were to get accredited again, you\u2019re likely going to experience significant issues during your time there and then an onslaught of questions about the validity of your degree when you\u2019re trying to get a job. \n\nPlus: good schools don\u2019t lose accreditation. Bad schools do, and they\u2019re often also unknown and/or small. A degree from a school like that is a hard sell to employers on a good day. Add in the fact that it potentially won\u2019t be accredited and you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. \n\nUnless you\u2019re trying to get a unique undergrad degree that is only offered at this one school (bad idea), do what others here have suggested and go literally anywhere else.",
