      "text": "Mathilde Skoie, *Reading Sulpicia. Commentaries 1475-1990* (Oxford 2002).\n\nThree books have come down to us under the name of the Augustan love poet Tibullus. The first two were almost certainly written by one author, the third seems to collect poems from a variety of authors - among them a cycle of poems treating the relationship between an aristocratic woman called Sulpicia and her lover who is referred to as Cerinthus. Some of the poems are written from Sulpicia's own point of view and some from the perspective of a benign onlooker. As the genre of Roman love elegy is based on a male poet-lover desiring and pursuing a (lower-class) woman, these poems are unique in their reversal of gender roles. \\[edit: [Link](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Tibullus.php#anchor_Toc532635330) to a translation, also scroll up.\\]\n\nSkoie investigates how scholarship on the Sulpicia poems has developed since the 15th century and, especially, how different assumptions about their authorship lead to wildly diverging judgments about their quality and qualities - Were they written by Sulpicia herself? All of them or only some? And if so, by a Sulpicia who is just a naive teenage girl dumping her unprocessed feelings onto the tablet/scroll or by a clever poetess self-consciously bending literary conventions? Are they the literary game of some big-name author like Tibullus or Ovid? Or just some (male) epigone trying to imitate their style? With her meta-analysis, Skoie demonstrates vividly just how much your view of the text depends on the assumptions you make, both as an individual reader and as a product of your culture and time.\n\nThat's a good lesson to learn early and I am very glad to have encountered this book in undergrad.\n\n(Also, my PhD advisor still considers it one of her worse academic failings to have once written a term paper arguing for Ovid as the likely author of the Sulpicia poems. These poems and the discussions surrounding them can become deeply significant on a personal level but, by some, they may also be seen as a litmus test for one's pro/anti-feminist leanings.)",
