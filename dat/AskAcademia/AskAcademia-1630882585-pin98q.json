  "text": "I always see academics with these cool headshots and then I look at mine and I hate it. I've never had a picture I like. Anyhoo, my own insecurities aside, the other day one of our staff was leaving  for bigger and better things and drew up an avatar for all of us. They are absolutely fantastic! Mine is also closely related to my area of work - I teach a popular subject involving maths and magic and I've been drawn holding some playing cards.\n\nWould an avatar, rather than a photo, be appropriate to use as your headshot in the academic world? I'm hoping the answer is yes as it's one I would finally be proud of.",

If you ever go to conferences, meet other people, and teach students, it will really cut down on the 'are you Prof. planetniffer?' questions since people will know who to look for ahead of time. And if you ever give invited talks at conferences or other institutes they sometimes post a photo and short bio so you'll probably get people asking for one anyway if there isn't one available.",
