              "text": "These days reputable journals will send a follow-up email to all authors informing them off the submission and either asking for their explicit consent to publish or giving them the opportunity to dissent. If you didn't receive such an email, it\u2019s possible your colleague didn\u2019t use your correct email in the submission (accidentally or intentionally). You can send an email to the editor expressing your concerns, but unless you want to burn bridges within your group I\u2019d recommend speaking to your colleague and supervisor about your concerns first.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m hearing that a lot of journals still don\u2019t do this. As authors who publish in those journals, you should encourage them - more importantly the publishing groups that own them - to adopt this process. It helps ensure research integrity, which improves the profile of the journal and therefore of your own papers. The journals typically also ask each author to complete affidavits affirming that they\u2019re presenting their own work and disclose any conflicts of interest, which helps to hold authors responsible for plagiarism and other ethical violations. Finally, it gives each author the chance to link to your ORCID so that you are uniquely affiliated with the paper (which is especially useful if you have a common name).\n\nNote that this process doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019ll get to see reviewer comments or review the final proofs - typically those communications only go to the corresponding author(s).",

For what its worth, reporting it might allow the student to actually learn from the mistake, which would be a good thing here.\n\nFor your own work, I don't see how it would affect you directly. You are co-author, and I'm guessing its reasonable that you try and get your work published. So if something has been submitted, and you're also developing it further in your research, I don't see why it would be plagiarism. Self-plagiarism becomes an issue when you submit something to receive similar credit on the same writing. Like submitting an essay for two different courses. Its not usually plagiarism for the same work to be submitted for two *very different* purposes (like to a journal and for a grade in a class).",

If it\u2019s not plagiarism it\u2019s still attempted plagiarism, and it sounds like if the labmate had got their way it wouldn\u2019t have stopped at \u2018attempted\u2019. Such behaviour is rarely a one-time occurrence, particularly if it\u2019s not brought to light the first time it\u2019s detected. Both the journal and the department would likely stand to lose if this person were successful, so they\u2019d likely have an interest in knowing of the attempt.",

                  "text": "What I\u2019m reading is that the other person submitted something that OP wrote without OP\u2019s consent. To me, that\u2019s already enough of a red flag to at least warrant mentioning it to a supervisor. However, OP also says that what was submitted was part of their unpublished thesis. To me, this raises two additional concerns: firstly, I think it\u2019s likely that the thesis was not written as part of the lab work or to be part of the article; theses are often individual works on which postgraduate students are assessed\u2014so even if OP drew upon their experience in the lab work when writing the thesis or discussed the lab work in the thesis, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re \u2018the same project\u2019. They\u2019re probably not. More importantly, however, just because the thesis isn\u2019t published *yet* that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t ever be. Many universities officially publish theses after they\u2019re assessed\u2014and even if that\u2019s not the case here, the thesis might well still be due for assessment at some point in the future. What might happen if at that point a significant portion of the thesis were to be deemed to be similar or identical to a published journal article?",
