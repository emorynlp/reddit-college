  "text": "I'm on a research intensive university in the UK, and the main criteria for being promoted really is research income, despite the fact that they say they are also looking at teaching and admin contributions and so forth. But I've seen time and again, people who are collegial, take their share to help their department get stuck in their ranks or not even pass probation (equivalent to getting tenure in the US), while those who make a complete mockery of the system, never help anyone, get promoted faster. What I would like to know is if this is the norm throughout academia, or if there is a better world out there.\n\nEdit: It's been interesting to see the range of responses, thanks. I think some people confused my use of collegial. I don't mean socialising, I mean generally helping the running of the department. Some people completely ignore the tasks that are given by the HoD, or whoever in charge, they increase the workload for others and become a liability because often students complain about their behaviour. But there's no system for punishing these people. \nThere are lots of really successful people around me who can publish in top journals, get grants and generally do what is expected of them regarding teaching and admin. So, I disagree that you need to be an asshole to be a good scientist.",

I certainly wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201cmostly assholes\u201d, but it\u2019s unfortunately true that someone with an outstanding research program can get promoted even if they are unhelpful to students, don\u2019t contribute to the department beyond the bare minimum, and are just generally a miserable person to be around. I\u2019ve sometimes heard faculty complain that there is no incentive to be good at teaching, and in fact there can be a disincentive, because colleagues who prioritize research will always get promoted over them.",

And it really just turned me off the idea of continuing in academia. \nSo I'm pretty much violently agreeing with you because you said what I came here to say. I'm in the US and I learned pretty quickly how broken the granting structures are and how that affects research heavy institutions. Since that seemed to be where all the cool and interesting stuff was happening it was where I wanted to be originally. Just seeing the shit politics this created in a couple departments really just soured the whole goal for me and after being denied I just decided that path wasn't for me. The condescending attitudes of several of the faculty from different colleges didn't help either. There's a fine line between being a knowledgeable mentor and an asshole and some just go way to far.",

A 1st y lecture with 150 students, many of whom are paying international fees of \u00a325k per year, is worth a lot of money if you think about this. But I'm not comparing people who just teach and do no science with grant getters. I'm comparing people who teach, get grants, and publish in big journals against people who just get grants and do nothing else. A department is funded through grants AND through students.

Once someone has committed to a department and is one year in, they aren't leaving over a shitty prof.  Given that bad teaching isn't enough to make many people leave the cost for bad teaching might only be 10K and this is overshadowed by 1 large grant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>comparing people who teach, get grants, and publish in big journals against people who just get grants\n\nThis isn't really the comparison. It is one person publishing much more and getting much more grants versus someone who does more service and is a better teacher.\n\nLack of service will get you in trouble. But a lot of new hires accept way more service than they need to.  Push back when you get asked to be on a committee you don't see value in being on. More than half the time they'll ask someone else and this won't be counted against you.",

But even within teaching positions, sociopathic social climbers who are shameless seem to do well, and so far I've not seen leadership ever dare or bother to push back much on that; I think the incentive there is that the more agreeable people are less of a threat to the personal career aims of middle management, so they get screwed at both ends.",

Other colleague, does nothing to help the running of the department, and what they do is badly done just so others won't ask them for help. They get a grant (with overheads) and get promoted. \n\nI've been through promotion, the form very explicitly asks about teaching contribution, student satisfaction, admin load, papers published and grants obtained.

The task allocation is measured and is fair and tbh we don't have to do a lot of teaching at all (at least compared with workload in my country of origin and most other UK unis). And this is what gets me, everyone has to mark UG final year projects, for instance. Everyone. No getting away from it. But some people won't read the project, for instance. The students complain, as they were unfairly assessed. Do the culprits have any punishment? No. There are also loads of other examples when they don't do admin things they were assigned to, so someone else needs to pick it up. This lack of punishment (for lack of a better word) is part of the reason why harassment (of all sorts) is also rampant in academia. Because people know that once you're higher up in the ranks, almost nothing can bring you down. \nI am safe in my position (\"top tier research uni\") and have plenty of places to hide. This is probably why you're picking up a sense of security? Entitlement? Don't know. Something that minorities usually don't have. I get that. I am successful in my career, I bring enough money and papers and have managed to grow to some extent despite it all. But I'm really wondering whether it's time to look for jobs in other universities, if their culture is better.",
