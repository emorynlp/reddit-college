  "text": "Hi all. I'm currently in a master's program for speech pathology. (I also have a B.A. in psychology.) I love research and I really would like to be (or at least attempt to be) published by the time I graduate from this program. Since I do not have the resources to do a study, I would need to do a literature review of some kind. The problem is every time I start doing research for an idea I have, I often end up having more questions that just make me wish I could do a study. \n\nFor the record, this particular program is online-ish with seminars and clinical placements in person. It's a pretty competitive and nationally ranked program -- but the main caveat is that I can't do a thesis because I'm technically \"out-of-state.\" I have some amazing professors I could consult on this, but since they're all so specialized I'd ideally like to know what I want to do before approaching them. \n\nSo, yeah, I honestly don't even know what to ask here, because I am so lost on how to even pick the right topic. Every time I think I have a great review topic, I start doing research, start asking more questions, and by the end of the night I'm losing it. It never fails. Am I just looking at this process all wrong? Am I making it too complicated? Please help!",

From your post, I think you are aiming for a review where the main aim is to educate yourself?\n\nI would suggest that you do this in stages, where your first step is to do an ad hoc search to get a fair grasp of the key terminology and possibly do more systematic reviews down the road.",

          "text": "Wow, that's super helpful. I think you're right. I'm so focused on the details and looking for something specific that I'm not zooming out enough and seeing the larger picture. \n\nAnd really, it doesn't help that speech pathology is a relatively underfunded research field, so there's really only so much available research on certain topics from an SLP perspective. Both psychology and medicine publish papers on related topics, but it's typically through the lens of their field, which can make it confusing when looking for something particular and/or trying to find some sort of consistent pattern among the available research.",
