I was really disappointed cause I wanted to give my professor a hot pepper. He texted me. Told me to go rate his class on the site. I wrote a really good review and depending on how you read it,  it could have been a sexually explicit work of art or a slightly strange but positive review of a first year bio professor who has the ability to appeal to all students even if they aren't science majors. Anyways he made me take it down. Guess hes got a filthy mind.",

You can just make up any shit you like and get away with it. \nIf this prof had never found out about it this students story would have just sat there online for months or years. \nThen again, what is odd is that the student apparently even threw in a couple of details about the prof\u2019s house that were accurate, like the decoration.

Last summer I taught an accelerated course and failed to submit grades until 3-4 weeks after the course ended. About a week prior to submitting grades, two students submitted ratings 24 hours apart  of 1 and 2 respectively and wrote about how horrible the course was and how I would only dribble out breadcrumbs of help if they begged.  \n\n\nThis is my 3rd or 4th year teaching summer courses (in addition to over a decade of teaching during the term) so that definitely wasn't the issue. I am certain anxiety over their performance, fermenting over time due to my tardiness in submitting grades drove them to the harsh reviews.   \n\n\nThat anecdote leads me to believe that the ratings are largely driven by emotion rather than rational consideration. I absolutely love teaching and believe I have made a positive change for numerous students over the years. But I would counsel folks to interpret the reviews as emotional reactions to the professors rather than dispassionate analyses.",

The extra anonymity is a nice way to get an unfiltered window into their views of your classes, at least to the extent that they're motivated in providing it vs. encouraging / warning off their peers (often students are concerned the official ones aren't actually anonymous). They're probably best not thought of as a measure of raw, unbridled teaching ability (whatever that is) and more as an Amazon-y customer satisfaction consumer response type thing,  capturing less how much you actually taught them and more how entertaining / funny / attractive / charismatic / authoritative / etc. they perceived you to be (and all the sociocultural baggage that entails, e.g. stratifying instructors across gendered, racial, ageist, ethnic, socioeconomic, intersectional, and so on lines :/).",

Another professor was new to teaching and had just gotten her first review. She was so happy (it was a glowing review) that she posted it on Twitter.
