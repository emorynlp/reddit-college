  "text": "Hi all,\n\nLooking for some objective advice.\n\nI\u2019m a lecturer at a UK university, due to staff cut backs in the pandemic my work load doubled as I took on the teaching of one exiting professor, then another colleague went on sabbatical and I took over her programme leadership responsibilities. \nNothing has been taken away my work load/responsibilities to accommodate the extra work (it goes without saying there was no pay rise). Then there\u2019s all the usual pandemic chaos we\u2019ve all had to deal with, switch to online teaching, extra pastoral support for students etc. Lack of support from senior management\u2026\n\nMy lovely colleague I worked closely with died suddenly and unexpectedly a few weeks ago from a heart attack at a very young age (i don\u2019t know, but I can\u2019t help feeling it was stress related). The university would not push back our marking deadlines by even a day to give us time to process the loss. \n\nDue to all this extra work, I\u2019ve barely taken any annual leave (the uni has a use it or lose it policy) and honestly I\u2019m exhausted.\n\nI have so much work to do, and I just burst into tears because my stupid MFA app wouldn\u2019t let me access any of my work accounts.\n\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have a permanent position, but when I picture still being in this job in 6 months I want to throw myself into the sea.\n\nshould I just get on with the job and hope it gets better in a few months? \nDo I call it quits?\n\nHonestly I feel like I have nothing left to give, but my colleagues would be the ones to suffer if I left.\n\nAdvice welcome x",

The deadlines they have gives us as staff have routinely fallen short of the expectations laid out in the teaching agreements, with an expectation that staff goodwill will keep the boat afloat.\n\nTake your leave. *All of it*. If they are not staffing things sufficiently, that is on them. At every opportunity tell them there is not enough time to do a task, and how are they going to address it. Leave a papertrail of evidence that you are not being sufficiently supported. They don't have a leg to stand on, so don't let them abuse you as an employee. If the marks aren't in in time for the exam boards that's for *them* to explain to the students.\n\nWe've all busted a gut to keep things on track, but we've just come into our resit season, where all university deadlines were set ont eh same day. Blackboard shat itself, so they pushed the student deadline back, but not our 10 day (!) marking deadline. I've got leave booked, and will be taking it, whether my marking is finished or not. \n\nYou have to look after you, because your employer doesn't care.",

      "text": "I've been in this situation in a UK institution and it sucks. Even before the pandemic, folk were working with unbearable workloads and now the cracks in the system are turning into chasms.\n\nI'll share my experience: I was in a similar place to you and I ended up going to my GP - I thought I was having an episode of mental illness but after talking it over they said \"No wonder you're burned out, you're doing 3 people's jobs\". Although many factors contributing to my burnout were systemic failures I began to realise my own collusion with this broken system by not taking leave, working crazy hours and picking up extra work when colleagues left etc.\n\nThe GP signed me off work and it took me a very long time to learn how to relax and to begin to recover. I don't think holiday leave would have helped at my lowest point because I just couldn't switch off.\n\nSo, based on my experience I advise consultation with GP and getting a referral to occupational health at your workplace. Take sick leave if you need it. Don't worry about your colleagues picking up the slack - it's really hard, I know, but you can only take responsibility for yourself in this situation. Hopefully colleagues will say no to the extra work and management will be forced to take notice. \n\nWhen I was well enough to return to work I invested in some coaching and learned some skills in assertiveness, saying no to things and managing work life balance.\n\nOf course the pandemic adds an extra layer of awfulness to a situation like this. Every step of the way is so much harder. I very much wish you all the best and to say that recovery from burnout IS possible.",

      "text": "Take all your leave. Now. It doesn\u2019t matter if there are deadlines. If there\u2019s something that\u2019s that urgent then they can get someone else to do it. I know it often feels there isn\u2019t anyone else who can do stuff and it will just be waiting when you get back but that\u2019s a) not your fault - it\u2019s the institutions that already have us all working above 1fte with no extra pay that have caused this and b) not your problem. If there\u2019s something that really, truly can\u2019t wait they *will* find away to get it done. Yes, it will probably get passed onto someone else,  but (hopefully) there\u2019s someone in your dept who has an overview of who\u2019s doing what and will give it to someone who has the capacity to do it. An example - I\u2019ve been at the point of burnout for about 9 months now. Because of all the no detriment stuff we have in place there is only 1 exam that we dont have any students taking in the summer resit period. Out of something like 30 units. So there\u2019s a fuckton of setting,  vetting, coursework setting etc right now. At the same time we were running an online conference for ~1000 people. A couple of days before the conference (a few weeks ago) I was at breaking point. I had teaching deadlines that I knew I couldn\u2019t meet if I took time to eat/sleep. So I just told them. I can\u2019t do it (exam vetting) please find someone else. And they did. No fuss. And in a few days I\u2019ll be on holiday for 10 days.  No fallout from not doing the thing. Because our colleagues are human. They understand how hard these last 18 months have been and (no matter how it seems sometimes) they want you to be ok. \n\nIf you take some annual leave and are still feeling this way when you get back, start looking around for something else. It\u2019s not worth wasting your life in a job that makes you miserable. Especially one that demands so much and makes it so yiu can\u2019t enjoy the rest of your life. Your colleagues won\u2019t suffer (other than being sad your leaving of course!). We\u2019ve had a few take early retirement/voluntary exit and no one is angry at them. We\u2019re happy for them. We miss them, but we\u2019re not sat there saying \u201chow could that twat just leave and make us all this extra work\u201d. \n\nBut please, take some time off. We all already do so much unpaid overtime,don\u2019t give the uni any more of your time for free. You don\u2019t owe the institution anything.",

Spend it doing the little things in life that make you happy. See how you feel at the end of that time. If you need more time, take more. Tell anyone who takes issue with it that you've been doing multiple people's jobs with without a break, AND recently lost a colleague, and that you have a leave entitlement for a reason. \n\nIt's hard to learn to do this but desperation is a good teacher, and you're at that point where if you don't take a break you're going to do yourself some damage. The University shouldn't treat you like this, but they will push you as far as you let them push you. Time to push back. Don't wait until you're pushed beyond your limits. Don't make any rash decisions about your future in this role from the point of burnout. Take a good break first.",
