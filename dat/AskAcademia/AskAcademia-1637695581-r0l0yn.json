  "title:": "Soliciting writing feedback during Covid",
  "text": "I'm an early-career scholar in the humanities trying to publish the best writing I can muster in a pandemic. I was always told that the best thing you can do for your writing is have someone read it and give you feedback. The problem I'm running into is that people obviously have been locked in survival mode since Covid hit. I've tried my usual circles (former adviser, committee members I was close with, grad school friends), but I'm not having any luck. So I have the following question. \n\nGiven the present circumstances, would you be offended if a young scholar you had met at a conference solicited feedback on an article? In the before times, I was told that this is a normal thing to do. Right now, I'm trying to strike a balance between bettering my own writing (and getting my name out there) and being tactful/respectful.\n\nApologies if this isn't the right flair.",

Some of those services I have looked in to do that too, but as I said I have never used them myself and don't know anyone who has.\n\n>Given the present circumstances, would you be offended if a young scholar you had met at a conference solicited feedback on an article?

Right now, I'm trying to strike a balance between bettering my own writing (and getting my name out there) and being tactful/respectful.\n\nI would not be offended at all (and don't think this has anything to do with the pandemic, btw) but I would scratch my head a bit since everyone on any level should have a context to use for this. If an unknown person asked me to feedback an article, I would wonder \"doesn't this person belong to a department, research group, a professor's seminar, etc?\".\n\nI still wouldn't be offended one bit, but I might wonder why I should take time from helping my own junior researchers to help someone else's. There are only 24 h in a day after all.",

                  "text": "Thanks again for replying. In the humanities we are basically lone wolves. There are no formal research groups, PIs, etc. Everyone kind of toils independently, you don't report to anyone and no one oversees your research. Some people set up writing groups with friends or colleagues, but I've had a hard time with that since I have had to move around so much given the instability of the job market (I'm on my third location in three years). Arriving at a new institution amidst a pandemic also makes it hard to establish a relationship of informal mentorship with more senior colleagues since a lot of work is still remote. The most stable academic relationships I have are from grad school, hence why I'm trying to expand my writing contacts virtually since that's about all the pandemic allows for.\n\n(I should add that my perspective is from the US system, from what I gather there is more structure in the humanities at European institutions)",

      "text": "How long would it take to read end to end? Is the topic something stimulating or formulaic? Are you asking people who have previously read your work? I ask because it seems odd that you cannot find anyone with a few minutes to give it a pass. When I decline to review something, it's usually because their writing style is problematic or they don't take feedback well. That said, I review stuff from disciplines I have nothing to do with for readability and structure. For now, as someone else suggested, maybe just use an editing service for now. You could reach out to someone from the field, but I'd suggest building a reciprocal relationship for that.",
