The grief and shame is almost more than I can bear. help.\n\nEDIT:  Jeeze -- thank you all (almost all) so much for the huge number of kind replies -- I cried a lot reading them (but a in a good way).  It helps a bit.  I want you to know that your kindness matters.\n\nThe worst is that I felt it wasn't my decision, but my pathologies' decision.  I felt it was out of control.  There's no reason I shouldn't have finished.  I cannot offer you a clear reason -- even after working with a therapist.  The closest thing I can say is that it felt like fear.  I don't know that it WAS fear, but it was related to fear somehow.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nP.S. It was English Lit -- and I was doing quite well.",

      "text": "I have friends who've quit their PhDs at various points and, dude, they're doing well in life, truly enjoying paths they'd never even thought of before leaving.\n\nAcademia can be a bit of a cult. All your advisors, department heads, etc. got there because they're passionate about their subject and couldn't imagine wanting to do anything else, and so threw enormous amounts of energy (and no small amount of luck) into getting where they are today. That's great if it's making them happy, but the downside is that as a student, everyone you look up to thinks that academia is the ultimate goal that everyone should strive for, and can't think of leaving as anything other than failure. This manifests in obvious ways (e.g. in scientific fields, moving into industry is \"selling out\" or \"joining he dark side\"), but also in more subtle shifts in attitude when talking about other options. \n\nCoupled with this is the fact that, as a grad student, you've always been really good at school. Being smart and good at your subject, and being able to say \"I'm a [subject]ist!\" is probably a major part of your identity, and a big source of self-respect. With so much of your identity tied up in your status as a grad student, it's easy to think \"I'm doing badly at school so I'm a worthless person\". This is NOT true. Sure, being a grad student has sucked up a lot of your attention, but it's not the sum total of who you are. Your friends and family don't love your ability to bash out an essay after three hours' sleep, they love and respect you for who you are, and still will tomorrow. \n\nThere's also a very real chance that this is the first big thing you've *ever* \"failed\" at, which makes it seem catastrophic and life-destroying. This is not true either. People miss life goals, have major setbacks, and experience soul-crushing failures all the time. But we pick ourselves up, dust off, and slowly a new path and a new goal appear. It's possible that you don't have the practice at that, at least not with stuff that feels this big. Don't get me wrong, this would suck for *anyone*, and feeling bad is totally understandable. My point is that slowly, and with plenty of missteps along the way, you're going to surprise yourself with your resilience.  \n\nAll of which is to say: If you choose to leave academia, that's OK. A PhD is a means to an end, not a way of life or the core of your identity. Grief is a totally rational reaction to closing the doors on whatever career you'd imagined, and shame is a totally understandable response to leaving the cult of academia and putting a dent in your self-image. But those will heal. Hopefully you've met some great people and learned some great stuff. If it's not for you, then that's something you've learned too. Life is not over, just because you've quit a course. \n\nRight now: Talk to someone you can rely on (family, close friends). You're probably expecting them to be disappointed in you but, I promise you, their only concern will be that you're OK. Get your support network in place, then book whatever time you can to just crash and get your head in order, including human contact (even if it's just phonecalls) so you don't just spiral into deeper misery.\n\nFinally, for now, get the contact info for your school's mental health services and make an appointment. I guarantee that this sort of thing is completely normal to them, and they'll have some great resources to help with all of this. Even if your changing status at the uni means that they can't treat you, they're the best people to recommend an external service for you to contact.\n\nAfter all this: It really sounds like you can't (couldn't?) write due to stress, depression or whatever. Talk to the schoo's mental health people about this, too. This is really common, and if you want then you might be able to change your \"I quit\" to a temporary withdrawal, spend some quality time with a shrink, and come back to attack your thesis with some shiny new coping mechanisms. Mental health issues amongst grad students are alarmingly common: your school knows this, and will have procedures in place to help you deal. \n\nIt's totally OK to just walk away and try a new path, if that's what you want. It's probably still possible to get help, take a break and then re-attack your thesis, if *that*'s what you want. Either way: what your're feeling now sucks, is totally valid, and will fade with time.\n\n\n**EDITED to add:**\nI'm really touched by all your replies. I can't decide whether it's flattering or horrifying that this resonated so strongly with so many people. Take care of your mental health folks, balance is important.

              "text": "As a rather successful uni professor in engineering, please let me back up what everyone is saying here. I've completed to date 29 graduate students, many who have gone on to good careers. I have also seen six leave for a variety of reasons, and they are generally happy after having come to terms with leaving. \n\nI'm proud of all of them regardless, and it has been an honor to be entrusted with supervising them. \n\nGetting a PhD won't make you happy, and not getting one sure isn't the end of the world. Sadly, many of my academic colleagues make their second-guessing graduate students feel like dirt for even thinking of giving up. I am continually appalled at their behaviour in pretending that leaving academia is equivalent to abandoning some higher calling in life. It won't define your future and who you are, and for some it will close more doors than it will open. Consider that for many profs, all they have ever known is school, and so they are poorly equipped if at all to advise anyone on what choices are best. Don't you take what they say seriously for a second. Get advice from others. \n\nWhatever you decide, you will be fine because you are you: you had the fortitude to do well in school and that will serve you well into the future. After you set yourself straight, you'll go forth and find a way. \n\nGood luck and hang in there. \n",

Some people think their goal is to make it hard, set up roadblocks. Possibly some of that. But there has to be SOME path to success, and when it's just turns and turns and more turns, there is no path. If it's still possible, retract the formal withdrawal, take a break, and if possible, come back to it when there are new players in the game or you feel re-energized. Nothing is final in education. You have those credits banked, and they can't take them away. Find out how long they are valid and use your time. And smile.

After my  bachelors, I did some postgraduate research in a new lab. My PI was a micromanager and was difficult to work for. I was applying to various schools for my PhD to keep chugging on this path, did great on my GRE, etc. As I was doing this, I realized that professors saw teaching as a chore and their lives were more papers and grants than wet lab work. I was thinking about my research all the time and I could barely sleep. This career I had wanted for years just wasn't working for me. In the end, I left it and didn't go to grad school. I had realised that getting my PhD would be going deeper down this hole I wasn't enjoying. I was unemployed for a while, thought I'd try teaching, but then I was offered a job in a totally different field (one I knew nothing about and didn't even expect to like). I made more money, and I loved this new job. It was 8-5 (labs never are) and I never worried about it once I left. \n\nComing to terms with such a huge life decision was hard, I felt like I had disappointed my ten year old self, but I'm happy now and I know I made an excellent decision. Things will be okay OP. ",

But I didn't like the general \"publish or perish\" atmosphere which was felt day to day. \n\nNow I am really enjoying myself in a startup which lets me have fun with what I like doing. For me, the main reason to get into the academic route was because my father has been a researchers all his life.  But, after trying it for some time, I think I prefer more \"practical\" stuff and don't enjoy writing reports at all.\n\n\n\n",

This starts at the Masters level and continues all the way up the chain until you finally get tenure. At any point along the line, through masters, phd, assistant professor, associate professor, full professor and tenure, if you fuck up and don't get promoted to the next level, you're pretty much done at the school you're working at.\n\nYou can sink 10-15 years at a university, go in for tenure review, and if you don't get it you *might* get a second shot at it in a year or two, but after that you're basically done. Some schools even go so far as firing you under the premise that if you aren't good enough to get tenure, you aren't good enough to be working at that school.\n\nIt's rough, and that's one of the reasons that I got out of the academics game.",

This meant that after a few years, he was on the lookout for a new, better position, and this \"you're pretty much done at the school you're working at\" was built into the equation from the beginning - at least until tenure. And even then, he kept moving up by moving out.\n\nSo, I'm curious, has this changed? Is/was it only medical academia? Do you know or know how one could find out?\n\nSide note: this was really hard on us kids - we moved 7 times while I was growing up.",

Women tend to get this much more often than men, especially in the hard sciences but often elsewhere as well. Some schools have a reputation for this (coughPrincetoncough) but in other places you just have to be psychic to know when you're about to waste X years of your life chasing tenure that has already been preemptively denied you.",

And it can hurt pretty badly.  Especially if you have friends that finish and stay in the field.  Worse if you're around other reasonably-educated people and they already have an impression of what an ABD person is (which is someone not quite good enough, almost talented, a woulda/coulda/shoulda kind of person).\n\nI have a friend who quit out of kind of apathy (I've been led to believe).  Married to a PhD, most friends are PhDs, and he has a permanent sad look on his face, and seems to resent it quite a bit.  He talks all the time about how he wished he had finished.\n\nI also have three friends that finished their PhD and immediately walked away from academia with no regrets.  And they're all glad that they can say that they finished and quit on their own terms, that they got the degree and know it wasn't for them, and nobody can accuse them of sour grapes.  I could elaborate on this, but don't want a wall of text here.\n\ntl;dr Some people are happy quitting, some people aren't.  Walking away is a great idea for some, and can lead to a lifetime of regret for others.  Make sure you know yourself before making such a significant decision.",

          "text": "I originally went to do my phd in econ in '97. I didn't realize being a professor meant doing research. WIthin a few weeks, I realized I hated most econ research. I held on for the year but didn't put a lot of effort in. My grades were so-so. I left after the first year and did a variety of things. I left the department on good terms and in 2001, they gave me back my funding to finish my masters (which they didn't have to do and was super nice of them). I then got married, had my kids, and was home with them.\n\n\nMy ex was in academia and an opportunity arose to go back and get a degree in a business field where the job market had high demand.I went back and just defended my dissertation and am now Dr. livvey. The difference is that now I knew what to expect and I picked a field based on liking the research and having a good chance of landing a tenure track job.\n\n\nMy path to academia was a zigzag. If you would have told me in 1998 when I left the program that I'd have a PhD in a totally different field in 2014, I'd never have believed you. I guarantee that I'm happier than I would have been if I would have originally gotten that PhD in econ way back when. it's ok for your path to diverge off from your original plan. I wouldn't be who I am today without that happening. Credentials aside, I'm happy with who I am at this point in my life. Some paths may lead you back to acadmics, some may not. Either way, it's up to people what they want to achieve after leaving a PhD program without diploma in hand.\n\n\nDon't let anyone convince you that you will never get a job in academics - if you are in a field with a well-paying outside market, academics can be very lucrative. Not as lucrative as industry, but still lucrative. I had over 20 interviews the year I was on the market - 3 early flyouts and 2 offers, along with multiple flyout offers after I already accepted a job. FIrst year assistants make 6 figures and chaired seniors with good records can make 300k/year. However if someone insists on a field with more supply than demand, their academic career will always be a struggle and they may never get on the tenure track.\n\nEta..i should mention business school fields often have better job markets.  The reason for that is there is a separate accreditation for business schools,  AACSB. One of the requirements is that a high number of faculty have to have the highest degree in their field and must be tenured or tenure track (i can't remember the exact number and a new benchmark is being phased in). Therefore, we don't have a glut of people with masters willing to work for half the pay while teaching twice as much.  A school can't do that and hang on to their accreditation. Business schools are also not like the sciences because you don't have to do a post doc or chase grant money. We get treated like the prima donnas of academia. ",

My friends all have their Cell, Nature or Science paper. My advisor is frustrated, as am I. Then I get sucked into the working 90 hours a week mode to try to make up for it, which means I have no time to go out and have fun. But I don't know, I don't know if I could leave academia. I love learning and the thrill of making discoveries but I suck at it.",

              "text": "Well, in this environment, finishing--even with a C/S/N paper--is somewhere between a mixed blessing and a backhanded complement at best.  And not just in academia.  The industry employment situation for Ph.D scientists is somewhat of a disaster, as I've learned over the last couple years.  \n\n(Check out this disaster of an infographic: http://www.ascb.org/ascbpost/index.php/compass-points/item/285-where-will-a-biology-phd-take-you)\n\nSo I'm on my way out.  Consulting, medical writing, whatever scientific type thing I can find that's not bench research.\n\nThe thing that did it for me is when I asked a speaker who came for one of our weekly seminars (who's pretty successful in his field, even now)  about his tips on surviving in the disastrous funding/job environment.  His answer was to work harder.  \"If you keep publishing Cell/Nature papers, you see, people will have to let you succeed\".  It was one of the most tone-deaf pieces of advice I'd heard.\n\nIt, of course, ignores the fact that the impact of your findings is ultimately beyond your control.  Which is something that the successful people don't like to think too much about--there but for the grace of god go I, and all similar sentiments.  You can work on a high impact project, but you aren't guaranteed to make any headway on it; you can also work on an easier project that may or may not have a high impact result, but you can't control which payout you'll get.  \n\nEveryone wants to think this is just a temporary thing and that if they work harder, they'll survive the winnowing and things will go back to \"normal\".  But they won't.  If the environment is such that the only advice is to work harder, not to work smarter, it's a sign opportunities are declining.  \n\nLook, I work amid the tech boom.  I see the freedom, the creativity that happens in industries where opportunities are growing, where the attitude is \"this is a great idea, let's take a chance on it!\", where companies are looking for good, competent people rather than trying to shoot them down.  And science is the complete opposite.  \n\nWhat kind of promotion, salary negotiation leverage, and creative opportunities are on the table if I stay in an area that's headed in this direction?  Not many.\n\nYou might not be able to control your success, but you can stack the deck by choosing an industry where the chances of success are higher.  Which makes it insanity to stay in the scientific workforce these days.",

However, there's been issues with my application process preventing me from applying, the biggest being my lower MCAT scores. I've gotten really discouraged, but have been afraid to quit because its all I've seen myself doing in my future and it's what everyone thinks I'll do. Yet its not something I've truly felt passionate about and have always felt a disconnect with that image of myself.\n\nIn the meantime between application cycles, I've been applying to related engineering jobs to try to find other things I may be interested, but nothing feels right. However, just last week I was interviewed for a field clinical engineer position and I've never been so excited for such an opportunity. It's a great mix of everything I've grown to love and have considered putting med school on hold for a few years to experiment in other career paths. If I hear back with a job offer, I think I'll take it. If I don't, I'll look into other similar positions. It's a scary decision, but even more exciting and something I never knew I wanted to do. \n\nHopefully I can finally find what I really want to do in life and your post helps me believe everything up until now hasn't been a waste. Thank you for your words, I'll always keep them in mind.",

I really, really thought I wanted to have a career in musical theatre. I was going to a fabulous triple-threat school with excellent faculty and hands-on classes. However, I loathed acting class. Everybody else seemed to me to be just thriving: they were living the dream! They were having such a good time! But I was in constant misery. I didn't want to have anything to do with the acting work we were assigned. Reading scripts felt like reading Greek. I went through psychological agonies trying to wrap my mind around the phenomenon of trying to *be another person* - and I failed (quite literally). \n\nIt turns out I don't like acting. It took me that year and a half of struggling (so hard!) to like it, and probably another year or so of pondering after I quit school, to figure that out. Pretending to be another person is so contrary to who I am that it nearly made me self-destruct, *even though I was good at it!*\n\nNow, I don't know a darn thing about law school so I have no idea if there is any correlation between your situation and mine, but I recognized a lot of the thought patterns in your comment. Sometimes, knowing when to get out is important. Of course, there are a lot more financial reasons to stay in law than there are to stay in acting, so your mileage may vary. \n\nAnother thought: We tend to think other people actually *are* the shiny, polished selves they present to the world and that we're the only ones with flaws or doubts. Maybe the people who seem to be enjoying themselves aren't flying through as easily as you think!",

I could feel the disappointment from my family when I told them and I felt like a complete failure. But like you said, there are some friends and family members that only care about you being okay and that was my brother. \n\nI was lying in bed at 1 in the morning figuring out my life when my brother texted me asking me what my plan was. I explained it to him and all he said was, \"awesome, let me know if you need anything.\" Man it was a weight off my shoulders, I felt this sadness slowly wash away and could feel my usual self coming back again.\n\nFast forward to now: I am teaching and I absolutely love my job.

I'd been at it too long to have come up with so little, so there was no point in continuing. Fortunately I had been applying for non-academic jobs just in case, partly because I wasn't sure I wanted to be a professor anyway. Two days after my proposal died I had my first job interview, and I got hired and started work within a few weeks. The pay isn't quite what I'd hoped, and I'll be dealing with student loans for a while, but as I look back I realize I'm doing work I like in the city where I've always wanted to live, and I doubt that would have happened so quickly if I'd gotten the degree. \n\nI'm already making more contacts in my non-academic field, and things are looking fairly bright from here. \n\nOh, a word about grief and shame: They are both natural in your situation, and they suck, but you don't need to feel bad *about* having those feelings. It's like breaking up with your SO after 8 years. You'll feel a deep sense of loss for a while, then eventually things will get better. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but not too long from now.\n\nOne more thing: check with your school to see if they provide access to the services at [Versatile PhD](http://versatilephd.com/); their rasion d'etre is helping academics, both PhDs and ABDs, to find good careers in the \"real world.\" You can pay for your own subscription if need be, and it may be worth it to you. I was lucky to get a job before I needed their services much, but I'm pretty impressed with their resources.",

I cobbled together what coursework I had, re-submitted a degree plan and walked out with a masters. I didn't even write a thesis; just couldn't bring myself to pen another thought even though all I had to do was essentially re-write one of my papers. I was done; I signed the paperwork, and five years were gone, just like that.\n\nAnd it was the best decision of my life.\n\nIt didn't feel like it at the time, that is for certain. I thought for sure this decision would come back to haunt me, that it would be a fiery brand upon me for the rest of my life, reflecting on everything I do from that moment on. In reality, even a year later it was nothing but a scar. Nowadays, I rarely think about it, and when I do it is without regret. I have moved several times since then, switched jobs, began and ended relationships. The worries of today far outweigh the regrets of yesteryear.\n\nYou'll be alright, man.

I talked a psychologist at my school into starting a support group for just that sort of thing, and (irony of ironies) it didn't get me over the hump, but a couple of other people in the group said they probably wouldn't have finished without it. \n\nOne difficulty we face as PhD students is that \"diss paralysis\" is never talked about; either you're making progress or you're not, and the professors (who all *did* succeed so they may not \"get it\") have a limited set of ways to deal with it. I'm hoping that that support group, which is still up and running (and spawned at least one offshoot writing group), will lead to more openness and support in that area.\n\nOnce I recognized the diss paralysis problem for what it is I started talking it up at academic conferences. Some people seemed interested in learning more, because they do want to help the students finish and graduate, but it's still a ways from being seen as a normal thing that happens to many of us.",

I wasn't sleeping, I was crying a lot, and I was losing tons of weight.  Like /u/RedBugs mentioned, my self identity was so wrapped up in that MA, and I had spent so much time and energy getting to that point, that throwing it all away made me feel like the biggest failure to myself and everyone around me.\n\nWhen you're thrown into the \"unknown\", which I'm sure that's how you feel right now, you end up doing a lot of soul searching.  You learn a lot of things about yourself you may have not known.  And as the haze starts to lift, you start seeing different paths that you'd never seen before.  I ended up choosing one of those paths, and now I do something that I think I was always meant to do (which I would not have pursued had I not ditched the MA), and I couldn't be happier.\n\nSo basically--you will be 100% fine.  Take time to grieve a bit, but be easy on yourself.  No one's ashamed of you, and you're not a failure in the least bit.  ",

      "text": "I actually got my PhD, and I wish I didn't. Maybe that's a consolation, maybe it's irrelevant, but at least personally I'm seeing a lot of comments here that give me some comfort and empathy.\n\nPerhaps I should elaborate - I finished my STEM PhD about three years ago, my thesis was very well received, my publication history in major journals was extensive, and I found myself in a very promising postdoc specialising in renewable energy. So far so good, but in many ways things get much worse in your first academic role. Contracts are quite a lot shorter than a PhD, you can't take time off and pick up where you left off if circumstances dictate it, you're thrown in the middle of petty factional politics that you were largely insulated from as a student, and it really is \"publish or perish\". The stakes are high, and any significant setback means failure and a ruined career.\n\nLet's just say I faced a few setbacks. It didn't help when the welcoming committee to the new city was waking up to a home invasion that cost me a few thousand dollars all up (without insurance) and left me pretty shaken up. Not long after that, I found out my mother was dying of breast cancer and spent most weekends back home helping to look after her (and took further time off near the end). While we were fortunate enough to get a few more months than we thought, and my supervisors were genuinely nice enough to say \"take as much time as you need\", realistically it would have been more helpful to add \"unless you still want a career at the end\". Because you can't succeed at that point in career unless your career comes first, second and third.\n\nWithout elaborating too much, more family tragedies and scares kept coming and with the election of an anti-science, anti-renewable energy government here in Australia, the final nails were put in the coffin. Funding cuts meant swift reductions had to be made in the staff budget,  and the logical choice was letting go of the inexperienced staff who weren't entitled to termination benefits and hadn't secured funding of their own. So the last few months of my contract were spent as a dead man walking, severely depressed and without the experience, research history, or connections to keep my new career alive. \n\nIt's been another few months since I finished, and I'm back living with my father in my 30s, getting nothing but rejections from job applications (with all the cuts and sackings in Australia, the job market is pretty brutal) and finding it harder and harder to remain optimistic.\n\nNot sure if this really helps, it was more to get it off my chest than anything, but if it wasn't meant to be it's better to find out sooner rather than later. The fall is that much greater the closer you fly to the sun. I'm sure I'll find something, but not without feeling that I've wasted far more of my life than I would have liked.",

Plus you have probably learned all sorts of skills that will still stand you in good stead in the future(I mean, not just specific skills but also cognitive skills, how to read and think, how to plan a project). Don't think of those years as a waste - you learned a ton.\n\nAnd as someone who did get the PhD and has \"succeeded\" since according to the standard benchmarks, I still think about leaving constantly. In fact I did quit science for 3 years to play music. Then I drifted back into science. I'll very likely quit again about 3 more years; I've got a new dream in yet another field now.

I'm leaving academia and what I've worked towards for the better part of my life because, frankly, I can't stand the idea of missing out on having a family while I fritter away my life on adjunct/sessional work, waiting for the elusive TT job.  I don't know what your field is, but jobs are scarce even if you finish.  It may not seem it from the inside of the tower, but we live in an age of anti-intellectualism; TT jobs are becoming scarce while exploitative adjunct jobs are proliferating.  I stuck with my degree for 7 years because I couldn't stand the idea of failure, but honestly, I wish I withdrew in year 2.  I'm 35 now, and I can't live the rest of my life in a holding pattern.  If you are like me, the PhD was a means to a great teaching job - the joy of teaching smart people complex ideas, and watching them grow intellectually.  Now I only feel exploited by my university, and so angry about the way they've used up my time.  \n\nConsider that you may be saving yourself, rather than losing yourself.

I've read every comment, and feel compelled to add another, even though it's at the bottom of such a page of compassion and encouragement that says what I could say much better.\n\nOnce you've started a PhD, I'm not sure there's a graceful way out. The deeper you get, the more you think that finishing is that thing that will make it all worth it.\n\nI finished my dissertation, and my PhD was awarded with distinction. I had a great job, though not a traditional TT job. Things went south not for the \"normal\" reasons (lack of jobs, lack of TT track jobs, too much teaching, not enough publishing, working 80+ hours/week), but because I blew the whistle on a well-known academic in my field, and the university did everything in its power to bury it. So I left on cobbled-together funding to write, found I hated writing in isolation anyway, and decided that setting myself up for a career based on this was a bad, bad idea.\n\nI'd love to write a \"and now I have a magnificent career I never dreamed was possible\" finale, but I'm not there yet. It's hard to imagine what a different career should look like, and applying for \"regular\" jobs with a PhD in my field isn't standard. I can recognize that feeling embarrassed or ashamed is just plain stupid, and yet I still feel that way, 18+ months later. A decade sunk into a career is a long time.\n\nAll of which is to say: be so very gentle with yourself. It's okay to leave. More than okay, actually. It's okay to stay if you *really really* want to write a dissertation. If you stay, you need a solid plan to treat writing like a 9-5 job, and a plan for making connections that lead to jobs after you finish. The job market... well, I think buying lottery tickets to fund a retirement is a safer bet than counting on a well-paying TT job at this point. And writing for publication is how your career advances in the TT. It doesn't magically stop with the dissertation. No matter what you choose, you should be prepared for some emotional and mental fallout. That  Greek chorus sitting on your shoulder telling you how inferior you are if you can't get it together to write/research/finish/stay in/quit/whatever: they're going to be with you a while, and you may as well train those voices to be supportive and understanding.",

The analogy that got me to change my thinking was one mention on an episode of The Survival Podcast where the host said made a comparison to a fly. Think of that annoying fly that gets in your house, the one that keeps pounding itself into the window and making that annoying \"thump thump thump\" sound at all hours of the night. Does it make any sense for him to keep trying? The fly doesn't realize it, but if the door or window is closed, there's not a solution to his problem and it would be fruitless to keep trying (because winners never quit). Even if it was open, if he's trying to break through the same pane of glass, he's not going to see any success by staying on his current course. I'm not saying your situation doesn't have a solution and there can't be success in your future. What sounds like a better course of action (and what looks to have been said here be a few people) is to take a step back and examine your life from a different perspective. Maybe you're just having trouble with this particular pane of glass and a wider view would show you the cracked door or window that would help you move forward. Best of luck to you, OP.",

The stress made me feel that way. There's no shame in not graduating. There's so much luck involved in getting a Ph.D. It doesn't reflect on your character. \nMy best advice is to not be bitter in the future work environment. I worked with a guy who didn't get his Ph.D and was really bitter about it. He blamed everyone, and ranted about how he was robbed. No one cared. They wanted him to be a good scientist and pleasant coworker. \nIt will all work out for the best. ",

      "text": "I have an incredibly motivated friend who has an incredible capacity to keep pushing her way through the stress. She just finished her Ph.D.\n\n\nWhy am I telling you this, you may wonder. Am I deliberately trying to troll you?\n\n\nOh my, no. See, I thought that once she was done, we would go out and have all kinds of fun, she though she would be free to work at a couple of odd adjunct teaching jobs, relax, travel a bit...\n\n\nNope. It's the same grind for her, just less focused and structured. Applying for jobs, applying for grants, there's still an incomprehensible and unending mountain of bureaucratic errands to do to allow her to teach her adjunct courses...she has barely any money, is incredibly stressed about her courses, the deadlines for the grants and job applications are often tight and they involve a ton of intricate and labor intensive preparation,  and then she has to keep up with every conference she can, to give her the best shot at a job.\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to tell you is that once a person gets a Ph.D, they aren't done. The same grind goes on and on and on. If you don't like it and want to get off, you will always feel bad about it.\n\n\nIf you don't like writing, research, a series of open-ended, unstructured tasks in a competitive environment, then now is as good of a time to quit as any.\n\n\nWhen I was a small child, I loved school. I thought school was for the pursuit of knowledge. I assumed I wouldbe some kind of academic.\n\n\nI was a little child, but it took until I got my Master's almost 20 years ago to give up on my childish ideas. They were part of another age that existed a long time ago. \n\n\nIf you want to learn, understand and write, you don't need a the abusive university structure to do so. I am with a man who grew up in a small village in another country. He is a very literate person because he has been educating himself ever since he had to drop out of school after 6th grade in order to support his family. He would look words up in the dictionary to compensate for the education he fantasized he woukd have been getting. \n\n\nIf you want to learn something, go learn it. There are many situations that are learning situations, if that's what you are looking for. It looks like formal education may have run out of things to teach you, at least for now.",

      "text": "WOW.  This hit home hard.  I haven't told anyone any of this...\n\nWhen I was finishing my PhD, I was sitting at home all day trying to write my thesis, cutting myself off from my friends thinking buckling down would help me.  I was almost 7 years in, and for some reason I felt as though I couldn't finish... or at least that I wouldn't finish.\n\nI made it through, but it was probably the darkest time in my life.  I don't know if I was actually suicidal, but for some reason still unbeknownst to me, I couldn't see myself finishing my thesis and starting a career.  I had a job waiting for me, my advisor said I was doing fine, but for some reason I thought I would die before I finished.  \n\nIt didn't help much that I had to cross a very high bridge twice a day when I did go into the lab.  I started to fear that bridge, so much so that I avoided it at all costs.  I was afraid that I would fall off, or jump off, that bridge one day.  \n\nI ended up having horrible writer's block due to what I think was severe anxiety, which delayed my defense enough to cause me to lose my potential job.  It got rescinded when I called to ask if I could start on my intended start date and then take a day off 3 weeks later to defend my thesis.  Soon after, my lease was up and I ended up moving in with a friend.  That, and the fact that I had a persistent girlfriend who wouldn't give up on me, wouldn't let me cut her out of my life, and wouldn't leave me alone, probably saved my life.\n\nIn the end, I took an extra month to write an additional chapter that probably wasn't needed.  I didn't answer my phone or go into school for a few weeks and almost lost my funding.  I caught my adviser as he was completing the forms to cut me off financially.  Luckily, he was understanding of the fact that I had cut off communications to concentrate on finishing.\n\nSoon after, I lucked out and got a job at a small company that was local.  I still work there.  I married my then girlfriend and we had a couple kids.  Life isn't bad now, but I am still haunted by that time.  Things could have gone much worse.\n\nThanks for sharing, and I hope everything works out for you.  You may have done the best thing for you, psychologically speaking.  Life can go on, and you can still be successful.  You obviously are very intelligent, you wouldn't have been in a PhD program if you weren't.",

Just stopped.
