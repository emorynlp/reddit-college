  "text": "We are postdocs at different locations. Originally I did ex situ work to support her work. I gave her all my data, figures, the experimental and results and discussion write ups. She asks me to write whole abstract/intro for paper, too. I tell her no, it\u2019s the job of the first author to write the paper. She says it will never get done, because she is too busy and her English is not good. I say I can be first author/paper writer, and I will put her as my co-first author. She says no, write this and you will be my co-first author. \n\nI know it\u2019s more than I would normally do for second, but I agree so that the paper can be published before I apply for faculty positions. I write an agreement saying what I will do, what she will do, and if other things come up then it will be her responsibility to handle, she agrees in writing.\n\nShe calls me now to say she can no longer honor the contract as she had a grad student do more than me, and she should give the grad student second. She asks me to do even more (for third author). \n\nI know she manipulated me and likely the grad student into writing her paper for her, and I know I have a case with my written agreement, but it might be best to just never work with her again. Should I contact her advisor? I have no idea what to do but do not want to face retaliation or be dragged into a time consuming and emotionally draining experience, for something that is inconsequential(second vs third author).",

      "text": "I think it's good that you tried to work out the authorship in advance, and it's a shame that it didn't go smoothly this time.  However, at least in my field (molecular bioscience), the order of authorship is based on the amount of work done and intellectual contribution to the paper, so any previous agreement as to authorship would generally be seen as a guideline and not a contract.  If it's true that this graduate student has done more than you, than the graduate student gets to be higher on the paper than you.\n\nNow, of course, determining whose degree of contribution is larger isn't necessarily straightforward, so if you truly feel you're being slighted, then I think the only thing for you to do is to get the PIs involved, both yours and the other postdoc's.  Whatever they decide will likely be the way it is.\n\nEveryone goes through this type of thing at least once during a career.  The lesson to be learned is to choose your collaborators sparingly and well.\n\nGood luck.",

In the case at hand, the first author would have needed to ask OP for their OK before they involved a grad student to an extent that made a change of the authorship order necessary. Not asking defeats the point of the agreement and is entirely unprofessional.",

It\u2019s like she promised both OP and grad student same thing so they would both do a ton of the work. Of course no one wants to write 2/3 of the paper to be third author. Seems like this would all have been avoided if 1st author did most of the work to begin with, instead of trying to split the work equally by three and then insist on taking the first spot. I have never had this issue because I have never asked a third author to write my intro - seriously what?",

              "text": "> Agreements can change, but this requires the consent of everyone involved in the agreement. \n\nI understand your point, but don't necessarily agree in practice.  I would expect agreements made between PIs to be honored, but agreements made between postdocs don't carry the same weight, because the postdoc isn't ultimately in charge of the project and doesn't have the final authority as to who does what work.  In the situation OP described, we have no way of knowing what the other postdoc's PI thinks about the situation.  Perhaps the other PI told the postdoc to involve the graduate student; in such a case, the other postdoc has no choice but to do what her boss says.  I can certainly understand that postdoc collaborators who are not at the same university would try to work out authorship issues ahead of time, as I stated in my original reply, and I think this is generally a good thing.  But, in my lab, I as the PI make the decisions as to who does what work, not my postdocs.  Perhaps another good lesson here is for the other postdoc to learn not to make promises or guarantees that she lacks the authority to enforce.  She has now placed her PI in a very difficult situation: her PI will either have to disappoint his own graduate student whose work allegedly deserves second authorship, or he will have to antagonize a collaborating PI by not honoring an agreement that he might never have known was made in the first place. \n\nIt's an unfortunate situation for OP to be in, but my original recommendation stands. The matter now needs to be worked out by the PIs of the two groups, and whatever they decide will be the way it is.",

She either needs to have the PI involved in the discussion of the agreement, or make explicit that the PI can overrule whatever has been agreed on. That would have given OP a fair chance to say no.\n\nShe could also have saved her face by explaining the agreement to the PI. A reasonable PI would understand the situation and accept that OP is second author, while asking her to not make any more authorship agreements without involving him. Of course, unreasonable PI's exist, but there's no indication that she even tried (which would not have removed the responsibility for her initial unprofessional behavior, but at least she would have owned it).",

First, co-authors can write any part of the paper, the author ordering generally reflects the overall amount of intellectual and effort contribution. I'm not sure why you were trying to wrangle first authorship from her when you knew she would be the submitting / responsible author; I'm glad she stood up to you on this, as you can't expect someone to give you first authorship when you as you admit, threw your research data over the wall and said \"deal with this\". Second, did she know that you believed the writing (an email?) was a contract? Or was it an agreement over email. Because if it was an agreement over email, then it sounds like you're trying to manipulate her for giving you second author when you didn't do the 2nd most amount of work. Papers can change, and new people can be added, and if they do more work then yes they will bump down the original authors. But I agree with the others, that a faculty advisor should be consulted here.",

      "text": "If she agreed to make you her co-first-author you would not be second author. You would be a first-author who was listed as second person in the list. In the publication, a small mark would follow your names and something like \"Both authors contributed equally to this work\" would be written somewhere. You would be a first-author by all means.  \nTherefore by not contributing to intro and conclusion you might actually not fulfill the requirements for shared first-authorship, as you two might not contribute equally to the manuscript.  \n\nNow you have a written agreement that states otherwise but I'm not entirely sure how much worth that even is, if the facts changed after the agreement was made and someone else actually contributed more than you do. Because the authorship should reflect how much everyone did, not how much you thought you would contribute at an earlier time.\n\nIs the plan now to add the grad student as another shared first-author or will you actually loose that first-authorship?",

Go discuss the situation with them.  \n\nFor me, an agreement is an agreement - but it is not clear to me whether she had the authority to make that agreement, as I am assuming she has an advisor also.\n\nAlso make it very clear that you do not agree to a submission until this issue is resolved.  \n\nMany years ago I did have a collaborator seek to unilaterally break a publication agreement.  I checked his University website for Ethical/Research policies and it was clear he was breaking them.  Telling the person I would contact his Research Ethics office bought him sharply into line.",
