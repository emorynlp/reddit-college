      "text": "My genuine advice is: if you don\u2019t know then probably don\u2019t do it. \n\nNow - there are a few caveats to this. Are you in a place where being a PhD candidate is seen as a job and you are paid and get benefits as an employee? Are you in a place and field where to do what you want to do you would be better off having a PhD than not having one? Are you in a situation where you could get funding that would provide you a better pay/stipend and benefits than an entry level job with your masters? How long would the PhD take and at what level would be be starting work after that (eg would you be in a better position after the equivalent time in industry than you would be starting your career after the PhD)?\n\nYou also don\u2019t have to do the PhD immediately. You could easily take a year (or more) off and figure it out. In general I would say there is very little point getting a PhD unless you _really want it_. \n\nI assume that your plan is to go into some kind of industry (as you tagged Stem and if you wanted to go into academia then this wouldn\u2019t be a question).",
