  "text": "Recent Comp Sci grad here. I\u2019ve been doing some research as part of my final year project and over this summer. I\u2019ve been genuinely inspired by complex systems science and complex network analysis, and want to go into research. I\u2019ve been trying my luck with applying to PhDs within my field because my supervisors encouraged me and agreed my work was of PhD quality. But I\u2019ve had no success so far, so decided it\u2019s best to start thinking about going the standard route into an MSc.\n\nHere\u2019s my issue: there are so many options! It feels impossible to tell which programmes might be better than others. Should I look for Masters\u2019 in universities where I would want to do a PhD later? Are there any specific online search tools you would recommend? Any other general advice for sifting through the tons of MSc postings?\n\nP.S. To clarify, I live in Europe and would like to stay within the EU, but am very open to relocating within it.\n\n(Apologies if the flair is incorrect \u2014 was not sure where my question fit exactly.)",
