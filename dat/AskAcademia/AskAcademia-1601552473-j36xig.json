      "text": "Departmental culture has a loooot to do with it. I'm at an R1. It's hard. I work hard. I'm 50/50 research/teaching and I looove my job. \n\nI love the flexibility, creative freedom, and interactions with students. I couldn't imagine myself doing any other job. \n\nI am 9 mo. I think the 9 mo pay is the most clever guise to get 12 mo out of someone while paying only 9 (pretenure). Many studies can't just stop over the summer. I can't quit turning around r&rs just because I'm not getting a paycheck, lest my chances at publications suffer.  \n\nIt's a tradeoff. I work my tail off, but I also can leave work whenever needed to get doctor's appointments, take a quick mental health walk, visit with a friend over lunch, etc. as long as it doesn't conflict with meetings or class. \n\nI guess like any other job... you've got to love what you do. That being said, I don't eat/sleep/breathe my job. I did the first two years (TT fear of tenure is REAL) but I've learned that I can't keep up that pace and stay sane. \n\nI enjoyed grad school too though. I feel like my job js like my PhD on steroids with more authority and a better paycheck. \n\nThe politics suck. I won't lie. I hate hate hate them, but most (all?) jobs come with shitty politics.",

I have a CRAPTON of vacation time, even as a postdoc in my first year at the company, and a manager who does not care if me or my coworkers work whatever hours work for our families. For sure this is not the case at every industrial job or with every manager even at my company, but it is possible outside academia. And even as a postdoc I don\u2019t make much less than the TT faculty made at my undergrad institution (though this is an unfair comparison both because time passed and geography is different, but she was the only one who ever announced her salary to me).",

              "text": "Yeah, I honestly think that most academics' impression of flexible schedules and other work world realities comes from their summer job in high school or whatever their last interaction with the work world was. This notion that you can't go to the doctor on work time, take a walk or have a social lunch mostly applies to minimum wage shift jobs. At every job in industry that I've ever had, including my entry-level position right after my BA, the principle was that I could do whatever I wanted with my schedule as long as I showed up for meetings and turned in my work on time. In fact, I feel like my schedule in grad school is way more structured than in any job I had.",

My summers have been spent working on research thanks to additional funds from the university. Last summer was my first without additional research incentive funds, but instead I had a grant to re-do my course. It was a very low-key project so I felt like I was off. I did field some R&Rs since the publication process doesn't operate on a 9mo schedule, and submitted one grant that had primarily been done during the semester... as grant deadlines also do not operate on a 9 month schedule. However, these were also choices that I made to maintain productivity. I could have easily chosen not to do them.\n\nTo me that's the trade off, in my opinion, with my job. I have so much flexibility to do what I want, when I want, but work never really leave me. HOWEVER, this is also how I have structured it for myself. I know fellow academics who ONLY work when they are in the office and it never comes home. I have done both with my MS and my PhD and I prefer the \"work a few hours, go do something fun a few\" and then back and forth. I don't mind working a little on weekends since I don't do 9-5 during the week.",

I have a professional organization that I have been pretty heavily involved in that also posted lots of listings. Job postings should detail the percent effort breakdowns. Some also include service, but my position is \"service on top\" (yeah, whatever..) but keep in mind service is nearly always something that is part of the gig...  I was REALLY overloaded with service my first couple years and now my current chair mandated that I say no... and I'm so thankful for that! \n\nI must have applied for upwards of at least 30 jobs. It was like having a second job, truly. I had three interviews and two offers. While I am at an R1, it's what I'd like to call a \"baby\" R1 since it is fairly new, so the pressure to get mega grants is far less than an established R1. I got my MS/PhD at a long-time established R1 and things ran much differently. I'm expected to get grants and I apply like a crazy person, but it's not nearly the same pressure I would have felt at my alma mater. That would be a conversation with current faculty to figure out. Deans are ALWAYS going to be focused on money and grants grants grants so don't get super nervous about that in the interview. The perk of this is if you're trying at all, generally they will try to help you get those grants with budget support, grant training, and sometimes even editing services!\n\nIt's not impossible to land a TT position without a post-doc but it is definitely getting harder, especially at an R1. I landed mine without one. I know I was an especially attractive candidate since my background is multidisciplinary and I had special training in pedagogy. I had experience writing NIH grants and foundation grants as well. If you don't have this experience (foundation/government grants, even corporate partnerships depending on your field), talk to your advisor and get it!\n\nIt sounds like you're quite well set up to land a TT position, so definitely try. There's surely no harm in it! Vet out the political landscape of your department. I had friends who quickly left their jobs due to toxic work environments. Luckily I've only had a few isolated incidents, and have been pretty well-managed by my university admin. Overall, it hasn't been too bad minus a few characters.",

              "text": "Happy to help! I see a lot of negativity (much earned I will say) about academia, but it's really not all awful. I've done my fair share (and probably more) of complaining... mostly about the politics and effed up hierarchy. I've been threatened more than once by some professors because I don't know how to keep my mouth shut. Personally, I believe TT professors SHOULDN'T keep their mouths shut. New TT professors often have GREAT ideas and should be respected. I digress. \n\nI'm about to go up for tenure. I think what really hit me is that I can still be productive without killing myself. The first year (two for me) was SO new that I felt like I had to work 2x as hard to be as productive as my colleagues since I didn't know enough about how things worked at the university to work \"smarter\". I was often going to seminars and educational sessions to learn about the systems the university used which did take a chunk of my time though I'm so glad I did them. I was also OVERLOADED with service due to pretty dismal leadership. Much has changed in the last few years and I'm very happy to say our leadership is more than satisfactory now. I adore my chair, she is incredibly supportive and not conniving. Imagine that. \n\nIt was a combination of what you said- I felt like I had set up some projects and partnerships to start getting things going. I have, at all times, a TON of students I am working with. This is a \"light semester\" and I have seven... yikes! I have gotten better about training the trainer which makes my lab more efficient. I've learned some little tips and tricks of how to keep students on track as well. I also tell incoming students \"I'm hands off- if you are not self-motivated, you will not graduate\" which helps to get the students out that need more spoon feeding. I'm not a spoon feeder, we have some in my department and that's great! It's just not me. \n\nI also have done a major mental shift in the last two years. I have had several unexpected deaths in my family, very close relatives. I'm also expecting my first child any day now! WOW! I told my chair when I knew: \"I'm sorry the timing is SO BAD!! I'm not even tenured!\" and, like the amazing human she is, she told me that the timing was perfect, I was on track, I would be just fine. \n\nIt has just taken me a little while to realize that this is my job. It's not my life. I love my job. I work hard at my job, but at the end of the day this job will not make me happy. It will not provide all my fulfillment. I'm going to do my best and that's that. \n\nIf it helps, the culture you're in isn't unusual and it can pass. Just try to be cautious of burnout. Focus on getting some good projects going with good people and multiple components to them. That way you have multiple data sets to play with (helps with students coming in \"I need a project!\") and some good grant starting pieces. I'm no sage, clearly, but I have had a few blunders of my own that will hopefully help others!",

But this IS where the politics get really disgusting. \n\nYou do have to worry how your higher-ups (associate/fulls) view you. Similar to not wanting to royally piss someone off in your committee. Best advice... find a mentor in your college/dept (at least somewhere with the same TT guidelines as your dept) to guide you. Someone you can trust. Even if you do trust them, be on high alert so they don't take advantage of your work ethic. It's doable. I have an in-department mentor who has helped me a TON. This person has done a few things that were head scratchers, but I don't think they were malicious. A bit hard to describe. Also get to know your dean. Similar to your advisor, your chair is your best advocate. Listen carefully to your annual reviews if you have them. Those can be an asset. \n\nKeep your PHD/MS advisor(s)/committee members (whomever you relate best to) close, mine has helped me through a lot as well. Get a relationship with the university ombuds (if you have one) which can help prevent getting you in a sticky situation. The ombuds at our uni honestly doesn't seem to do much, but knows more than I do on what's \"going on\" and can give very good advice.",

I think its perspective, a lot of academics have not really worked outside of academia so they don't quite understand how good they have it or they didn't think too much about their career trajectory and so didn't make a decision about the costs/benefits of academia vs other jobs (see a lot of red flags from prospective academics posting on here). Academia provides me with a hell of a lot of freedom compared to my other options and I value that more than the bits that suck. Plus to go back to the perspective bit I also know that those bits that suck are present in industry too... ok the pay might be better but that wasn't the key point for me.\n\nSome things, like workload, are at least partially self inflicted, I'm under quite a bit of deadline stress right now but its because I've agreed to do too much, do I feel pressured to say yes to stuff, sure but would there actually be negative consequences if I said no, I don't have time, probably not (I don't work weekends, not doing it, and if there's something like an open day where I have to work over a weekend then I take a day off in lieu, and I've not had any issues, I meet and exceed my targets).\n\nFinally, people may feel reluctant to shout about the good. There may be those who are afraid of going againt the 'groupthink' but for me its about two things, first I don't want to be rubbing other peoples faces in it, if most people do think academia is hell then I don't want to be the \"sucks to be you, I'm having a blast\" guy, second, there are genuine grievances, sure I personally may not have experience but academia does have a bullying/harrasment problem for example (of course that's not that different in industry) and I don't want to undermine those people\n\nThough in the end I'll say that the prime driver is probably the first thing, forums like this attract complaints, its human nature.\n\nPersoanlly I love academia, best job I've ever had, I think the uni I work for helps but this is a great gig",

You get paid fairly well to expand the body of knowledge, dedicate your energies to a field that you care about, and hopefully make some positive impact. Teaching allows you to pass down your love and the importance of the field to a new generation. There's a lot of flexibility in how you design your life, and tenure can be a lifechanger. \n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of hurdles, in the form of workplace politics, dealing with administration, and a labor glut in some areas of the humanities.",

We had a similar problem (though not to this degree) in the early 00s, so that new assistants were making more than continuing assistants with 3-4 years experience. That was only allowed to stand for a year and adjustments were made.\n\nFor us the net effect over time has been very tiny bumps for years of service (<$1K) that keep people separated, and a laughably small raise at promotion to associate (about $1,200). The raise for full is 10x that. So we're compressed but not inverted...the gap between a new assistant and a newly-tenured associate is about $7K now.\n\nI hope \"they\" will find a way to address this at your school. It's terrible to treat people that way but sometimes leaders fail to look at the big picture and see the impact poor morale has on faculty.",

          "text": "I think this hits the nail on its head. More money, sometimes a *whole lot more* money in industry. But you don't tend to have many options in what you do. In fact, rather than pure research, a lot of industry will have you do applied research, and they will tell you what it is supposed to be about. In the Ivory Tower you typically can pick your topic and do research on whatever interests you. The real limitation for academics is whether your work will be publishable in a top tier journal/press.  But for many of us, this is one of the big attractions: the ability to choose our research topics and work on things that we truly find interesting instead of things assigned by some boss. \n\nSecond point is the 8-5 job versus flexibility. Very true. By and large, jobs in industry will be 8-5, M-F. In academia you can choose your hours, and you can (somewhat) choose your days. Courses you teach and meetings of course are scheduled time and can screw up a lot of that supposed flexibility, but some flexibility still is there, and even with classes, meetings, and office hours there is a lot more flexibility for academics in the times at which they work.\n\n* At the same time, one problem with academia is the flexible, not on the clock nature. My marriage almost broke up because for many years (decades) after coming home from work I had to put in four or five hours each night writing, grading, prepping classes, answering emails from students and admin. etc. Not having scheduled work hours also means the department and U feel very free to keep dumping more and more work on faculty.",

But back then, I did whatever I was interested in and spent a lot of time on things that weren't directly related to my research. Nowadays I aim to be more focused on priorities and work as effectively as I can.",

                  "text": "To answer, I'd say that depends entirely upon the person. As someone whose worked in both I'd say that to be successful in academia I found you need to put in a whole lot more time and effort than in industry. At the same time, once tenured you can more or less stop doing anything productive but still keep your job as long as you teach your classes without too many student complaints. You'll probably never get another raise or a promotion, but the job still is there. (Losing tenure occurs if you never show up for classes, molest a student, tweet racist or sexist things, etc. A few, but not many departments also cut your salary if you stop producing articles and research or even stop doing a \"good job\" (whatever that means) teaching.) Industry would never tolerate this. \n\nSo, my answer is it depends. Productive academics do, I think, work harder partially because you have to keep producing and keep coming up with \"new\" ideas for research while industry mostly demands that you keep working on whatever project is assigned and even more because, unlike (most in) industry, you need to find outside funding to allow you to do research. Most industry jobs tell you what you will do for your research but also fund it. \n\nBut, at the low end of productivity, industry doesn't tolerate poor performance. Sometimes, even if the lack of findings or results is not your fault (as in biomedical research), but that is an exception as long as you do the job.\nFrankly, I've known a few tenured full professors who basically stopped doing anything except teaching, and in one case they did a very poor job at that, giving minimal assignments, re-using old lectures, etc. Granted, at least at the U's where I've worked (mostly Big-10), this is somewhat rare, but I would say every department has one.\n\nEdited to show paragraph breaks.",

      "text": "I've spent the last 20+ years at an SLAC and a decade before that as a grad student and/or adjunct. Why? Because I cannot imagine being happy doing anything else. I have no boss, am bound to no schedule other than my class meetings, I decide what to work on and when, I am surrounded by interesting, smart, often funny people, and the work I do as a teacher helps produce future generations of educated citizens.\n\nSure, we complain (rightly) about low pay and long hours. Who doesn't? Everyone I know who is in another field (government, private sector, self-employed, non-profit) complains too. Work-life balance in the US is a disaster.  Yes, academia has gotten worse over the last 20 years in many ways. But it's still better than being a lawyer, punching a clock, working as a contractor, or any number of other paths I might have taken.\n\nAnd there are days that are great, most often being the ones where I'm on a vacation or extended break. There is literally no other job where I could earn enough to live on yet only be bound to the office about six months a year.\n\nResearch? Sure. But as a mid-career full professor it just doesn't matter that much to me any more. After my last book I said to myself \"You know, there's not a lot of point in continuing the race to conferences, papers, chapters, and books. Why no work on something fun?\" So I did: put a sabbatical into a new project that is local, will interest the general public, and will take years to finish. No pressure. I'm a teacher first, perhaps a public intellectual second (I write a lot for general audiences, do media, etc.), a writer third, and a \"researcher\" perhaps a distant #5 or 6 behind some other things.",

People go in wanting to teach and research and then they stay in because they hope they will be lucky. It happened for me (tenured now) but I have much lower earnings than I would have if I had quit at pretty much any point in grad school and taken a different kind of job. I like the work and I accept the low pay in exchange for all the enjoyment I get from teaching and writing. I\u2019ve also made friends at work and am not badly treated. So this is best case scenario! I just have a small house and an old car\u2014the no kids helps with the finances. \nWell worth it for me.",

Kept working in higher ed after my masters. Went on to a doctorate because I like what I do and free tuition is hard to turn down. Now that I am post doc, I am committed to my career and it would be hard to switch at this point. I agree that the schedule and benefits are great motivators and I do like what I do. However, I do sometimes miss the days of not always having to be on and sacrificing my family and personal al interest to keep things running. So for me it is a mixed bag.",

While I know some Master's and PhD level folks who work a straight 40 in non-academic jobs, it seems like most of them have significant overtime expectations, too. Plus they lose flexibility in other aspects, too. Now that I'm more established as a teacher, prep takes up less time and I have more room to pursue my own interests. At this point, I'm only hitting overtime if I decided to take on something extra or messed up my own scheduling.",

I spent 18 yrs in academia (counting from the beginning of my grad school) and always loved the freedom that academic work gives you. At the same time, I always admired people who had their own businesses and daydreamed about having my business one day. My academic career was in the US and Switzerland. So, when I moved to a country where there weren't many good opportunities for research, I chose to become an entrepreneur. Since academia is my \"natural\" environment and  I love working with academics, my current work is related to helping grad students and PhDs.",

Yes, you do have more of a structured schedule, but there are other benefits (never having to pay for conferences because the company pays, better pay, usually better health benefits, dept heads with management training, etc).",

They mostly live or die on the generosity of the political rulers de jour, who have power and money, which were extracted from the people who make profit, often at spear, arrow or gunpoints, but were anxious about leaving behind a legacy. Or they do need someone who can make their armies a little bit better at killing people. So, they hire scholars and academics and put them to work.\n\nIt was true then and now. So, I ask myself, which side of the gun and tax extraction would I like to be on? Not the side the bullets come out of, obviously. Politics and politicians are really not my forte, I'm not a people's person (though I think I may fit a staffer position). I missed the chance for being police or military and I don't have the physique for it. Entering academia is much more within my reach.\n\nProximity to power, yeah, that's my reason.",
