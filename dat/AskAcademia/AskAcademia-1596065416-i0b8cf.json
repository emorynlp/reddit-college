  "text": "I often see on Reddit mentions of grad students living on food stamps - how common is this, and how come this is a thing?\n\nTo put my question in context, I\u2019m not from the US and I\u2019ve been led to think that US grad schools are well-funded unlike the UK. If there\u2019s funding, why do students have to rely on food stamps? I\u2019m confused!",

HOW it is taxable depends entirely on where your money is coming from (ie. do you get a W2? Do you have to pay estimated quarterly taxes? Are you also paying payroll taxes?). There are situations where you also get money to cover your tuition, and depending on where that money comes from, you might have to report it but it is not taxable. It can get annoyingly complicated!\n\nFor example, when I was in grad school, I got a W2 for my stipend- for that, I paid federal and state taxes but not medicare/social security during the school year (I did pay medicare/SS during the summer because I got paid from a different pot of money during those 3 months). I also had an external fellowship that covered my tuition and fees- I had to report this money on my tax forms but did not have to pay taxes on it.\n\nAs for tax advice, you're correct in that program administrators will not give you specific advice on filing your taxes, but they should tell you whether you will be receiving a W2 (and will have taxes withheld) or not (and therefore will have to pay estimated quarterly taxes). Mine did.",

If you're a graduate student without children, then you're going to have a more difficult time proving you're a SNAP eligible student.\n\nOne major requirement to be a SNAP eligible full time student is to work 20 hours per week. Yes. Work in addition to full time school. At which point, depending on your wages, you will qualify for less food assistance. So say you're a graduate student getting a stipend? Well plenty of them are monthly and do not reflect hours on the pay stubs, which is the main way to verify hours. So maybe you'll have to get a letter from your advisor saying how many hours you work...and hope they're not the kind of person who looks down on those on food assistance.",

Given, my assistantship was supposed to be part time (20 hours/week) and we were allowed to work outside school. I did have some tiny part time jobs for extra cash but with the nature of my work as a GA, and 9 credits a semester I would never have been able to get another job to supplement my stipend to fill the cost of living. \n\nMost masters students I know don\u2019t even find graduate assistantships to be worth it because of the low funding. It really only makes sense if you want to go on to a PhD and need a big resume builder OR if you\u2019re overly worried about having future debt. Most GAships come with at least partial tuition remission. I think long term it makes sense to have a GAship if you can find a way to supplement your living expenses for the time being. \n\n\nBut PhD students are usually much better funded because that is considered a full time job. Though I can see some PhD students needing some assistance in some parts of the country where cost of living is astronomical.

To work more than part time, you must complete a Master's through the university (so if you came into the program with a Master's from somewhere else, you're screwed) and receive special dispensation from your PI that requires loads of paperwork. If you manage to jump through all those hoops, congratulations! You can now work 75% time. And this isn't just 75% time on research, it's literally any on-campus job--if you teach, if you work at the library, if you are a university administrator's personal assistant--all of it can never total to more than 75% of a full salary.

My yearly stipends were under $15,000, and I had to pay significant taxes because the \"free\" tuition money counted as income. My husband and I took out loans for our living expenses.\n\nAt the time we were teaching 3 courses per academic year with possibly one in the summer, and we were barred from seeking other employment. I picked up some freelance work on the side but never made much from that. The loans + some parental support (bless them) got us through it but we are still paying it all off now. And this is best-case scenario: we both ended up with good jobs in the desired career.",

So you can buy lobster, you just cant buy already steamed lobster tail from the deli. \n\nOften it's just supplemental. I know people with families of four getting ~100$ a month in food stamps. So they're not using them for everything, just to cover some costs.",
