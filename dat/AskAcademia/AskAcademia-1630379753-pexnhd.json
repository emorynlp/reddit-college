  "title:": "PhD pathway from industry and startup",
  "text": "First, this is a question about what a career in academia could look like from a non-traditional background, not so much an admissions question.\n\nWhat would a potential pathway for a startup founder to move into academia look like? I\u2019m 32, ten years out of undergrad and 4 years out of masters.\n\nOnce I sell my company, I\u2019d like to embark on a career path in academia. I have a masters (thesis track) in applied statistics but it\u2019s in a different field than the one I\u2019d like to pursue - economics. My company has developed novel techniques and tools for pricing in highly competitive markets to great success. \n\nMy undergrad GPA is not great for various reasons, but a couple of letters of recommendation, work experience, and extremely high GRE scores got me into my masters and I graduated with a 3.8 while working full time.\n\nI have many professors from undergrad and grad schools who have highly encouraged me to get a PhD and would be happy to write glowing letters of recommendation. I\u2019d have spoken with them about this decision, and they aren\u2019t familiar with anyone who has navigated this kind of situation. They are still very encouraging, but they aren\u2019t faculty at what most people would deem \u201cTarget schools\u201d. Hence, asking strangers on the internet for additional perspective.\n\nFor most programsI have explored, it looks like I would really need to get another bachelors in Economics to be a competitive candidate at highly ranked programs. \n\nMy questions for the community:\n1) Is a meaningful academic career at this stage in my life a pipe dream?\n2) Do I need to go back to square one academically to \u201cprove my worth\u201d to top programs?\n3) Does my applied experience realistically count for much in the modern academic world?\n\nFWIW, I don\u2019t have any delusions of going to Harvard/MIT/UChicago (I\u2019d love to go to UChicago except it\u2019s in Chicago).\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "Some thoughts from a social science perspective. You can contact PIs as others suggested, but in the social sciences we don't really have a \"lab\" model, and so contacting PIs is not really the same. In fact, in the R1 school I am right now (social science PhD in an econ-adjacent field), it is not very well seen to cold e-mail professors just to say hi. If you have a specific admissions question and a connection to the professor (however tenuous) that is fine. It's not like STEM where, from what I understand, you need to make connections pre-application. The reason is, a random prof won't have any say on your admissions unless they are chairing the admissions committee, and because there is no lab model, there is no opportunity for a random prof to say \"admit this student I chatted with on Zoom\". Admissions depend highly on GRE (especially GRE quant), grades, research background, math classes taken, SOP.\n\nThe only person in my cohort who had connections before applying did an RA-ship with a prof because she did her undergrad at the same school. This is something you may want to explore.\n\nFor your case, I would recommend going on the Urch forum (you can find on google) which is for people applying to Econ PhDs, they are pretty specific and generic reddit advice is not suitable for those PhDs in general. You may also want to check out management and policy PhD, which are econ-focused but don't have the same requirements.",

      "text": "Unsolicited advice: You may want to look at PhDs in finance or entrepreneurship too. The job market is probably better and you wouldn't need a post-doc. I doubt you'd need a different bachelors. Pay would be higher. Econ also I think is quite a bit rougher in terms of the culture, but that is anecdotal. \n\nIn any case, I don't think your age matters in any field. I would imagine most programs will not care much about your undergrad, they would care more about research experience than anything. Your applied experience does matter if it gives you connections in industry that can help with research or provides good examples and legitimacy for teaching.",

      "text": "First, thank you for the reply!\n\n1) End game is being able to do a variety of research and getting to teach younger people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to get a research oriented job in industry without a PhD or I\u2019d be relegated to working under a PhD - crappy ceiling in corporate that would already be crushing my soul. Of course, some of the endgame is just the PhD itself. \n\n2) Most of my industry connections aren\u2019t exactly academia-oriented, it\u2019s one of the reasons they were so underserved in the work my company does. Most leaders are blue collar who worked their way up. Salt of the earth, but little overlap with academia.\n\nI\u2019ll poke around at government opportunities, but I think being a professor is something that would fulfill me more than being a mentor in industry (I\u2019ve done that for years). I enjoy research and I am able to produce quality work quickly. I know that academia is full of politics, but I\u2019ve dealt with corporate BS for over a decade. \n\nI appreciate the perspective - what was your \u201cend game\u201d going into your PhD program?",

You may be able to get lecturer role with a masters, although these roles are highly coveted due to their low workloads.\n\n1. I wouldn't do it. It's not obvious what the end game is. In practice you can find a job that is more research oriented which may also have room.for mentoring starting engineers.\n\n3. It can if you emphasize what you learned or use industry connections. But it won't let you skip the phd requirement.\n\nWeirder avenues include doing phd work as part of a company or the government. In particular US government organizations like the core of engineers often let their employees do projects in collaboration with a university which can yield a diploma. If you like stats maybe NSA can set you up with something?",

      "text": "This is not specific to Econ, but I know multiple people who\u2019ve gotten PhDs in a field that is not related to their BA/BS. They usually have a masters in the same field as their PhD, but applied statistics is pretty relevant depending on the sub field of econ you want to go into.  \n\nI think another BA would be overkill at this stage. If you try your hand at applications this year, do your best, and aren\u2019t satisfied with the programs you get into, you can then decide if an Econ BA makes sense. (If you go for that route, I encourage you to check out Columbia School of General Studies or its equivalents, which is designed for non-traditional students. Financial aid is pretty mediocre but that\u2019s probably less of a problem for someone in your position). You should aim high for your grad program. I don\u2019t want to be literally \u201cHarvard or bust,\u201d but if you want a PhD for a career in academia you need to go to the most highly ranked programs, period. \n\nYou asked whether your industry experience will count for anything in academia: officially, no, but the type of person who can start and run a successful company is the type of person who has a high chance of success, period. You just have to keep an open mind. You might find that you want to teach in a business school where your industry experience would not be the least unusual, or you might pull your cohort mates into another startup. I work at a company that hires lots of PhDs and our best / most successful employees are those who were fairly successful as academics as well. Academia can seem very mystical and elite even to people in it, but if there\u2019s one thing I learned from the former professors I\u2019ve worked with in my industry job, it\u2019s that work ethic, networking, planning ahead, time management, stress management etc are transferable skills for any industry.",
