  "text": "What are the behaviours that you would recommend while working as a team of seniors (7 to 40 years of experience more than you) who have inflated egos and has a complete lack of sensitivity and do not respect your personal deadlines in the interest of the projects (job applications, work permit deadlines)? You also don't have any other choice to select a different team.",

And yeah, if you\u2019re the kind of person who hates doing things last minute it\u2019ll drive you mad!",

      "text": "An easy one is to simply give them an earlier deadline than the actual deadline. I do this all the time with my peer reviewers.  \n\nAlso, a lot of senior researchers are legitimately busy, so anything you can do to simplify what they need to do to respond to you will help in actually getting a response.  Avoid asking for multiple things with different deadlines in the same email. Don't bury the request in a long email debriefing last week's lab meeting or include 7 attachments when only one is relevant. Keep requests simple and clear. \n\nFinally, a little deference and flattery here and there when necessary can be useful with folks with big egos. It's worth it as long as you get what you need in the end.",
