  "title:": "What are happy PhD students doing right?",
  "text": "I\u2019m sure this has been asked before but I always like to hear new thoughts :)\n\nI\u2019m about 6 months from graduating a STEM Master\u2019s program (in Europe) and thinking about applying for PhD programs. I have a topic I\u2019m actually really excited about in a not very crowded research field, I\u2019ve found labs that do it which I could apply to, and given my skill set I can\u2019t really engage with this topic in science without a PhD. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s big in industry right now and a recent conference for industry professionals I went to left me really unenthusiastic about working in that field, for now. All that would seem to point toward doing a PhD.\n\nProblem is, a lot of the PhD students I\u2019ve talked to seem absolutely miserable. Overworked, burnt out, disillusioned with a topic they (presumably) once really liked. I\u2019m a generally happy person with good organizational skills but I don\u2019t want to be naive and assume that will save me.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into what makes the difference between a happy grad student and a miserable one? If you\u2019ve been through it, what was your experience?\n\nEdit: Lots of people are mentioning work/life balance, which makes sense! But a lot of (STEM) labs I\u2019ve been in seem to de-incentivize it, as if you\u2019re lazy for working less than 60h a week. How did you find a boss who supported having balance, or if he/she didn\u2019t, how did you maintain one anyway?",

My undergraduate supervisor recommended that I apply to work with my graduate supervisor, and I accepted the position before I met my graduate supervisor. Essentially, I relied on recommendations and luck.\n\nOne big thing to do is to contact recent and current students of your prospective adviser. If multiple students agree that things are good or bad, you can generally trust their opinion. One bad review among many good ones might mean that there were specific issues with their relationship, and those might not be one-sided. On the other hand, one good review among many bad ones might mean that the adviser plays favourites.\n\nIn general, advisers are people; everyone will have strengths and weaknesses. My personal recommendations to focus on are matching expectations and management styles, as those often are the biggest day-to-day sources of friction.",

I found myself comparing my work or life with others a lot in my first few years of grad school (7 total, 2 for MS and 5 for PhD). Once I learned that everyone works differently and that there's nothing wrong with that, I was so much happier. I learned I worked best devoting a whole morning or afternoon to writing and then spending the other half of the day on other smaller tasks. I also worked better from a coffee shop off campus, and I had to stop caring if people thought I was unproductive because I wasn't on campus all day every day (I actually graduated before most of my cohort, they just never actually saw me doing the work).\n\nAdding to that idea: finding an advisor who understands that everyone can be productive in different ways is also a huge boon to your success, happiness, and mental health. My advisor didn't care if I was on campus when I didn't absolutely have to be, which allowed me to work in my own way. As long as I turned things in on time/early and gave her plenty of notice for when I'd need feedback, I was golden in her eyes. I knew other advisors who expected their students to be on campus/in the lab 9-5 every Monday-Friday, no exceptions. Additionally, they had to run all travel time by the advisor well in advance. This would have been stifling to me, as I work so much better if I work when I know I'll be productive and take off to a trail or for a run to reenergize if I'm feeling unproductive (i.e. cutting out of the office or coffee shop for a couple hours where I'd just have been twiddling my thumbs anyway). Same for travel: cutting out early or not showing up at all on Friday to go camping is what makes me so much more productive the rest of the month.",

I feel like the job search builds character and I'm sure I'll get one eventually - I've had interviews so I'm doing something right.\n2. Having your research go well, or at least having some successes . A good part of my depression was a result of being on a dead-end project that wasn't going anywhere. It can be really demotivating when you try and try and try and fail over the course of years and eventually I just stopped trying (depression). Once I switched to a better project, life got much better. I wish it wasn't so tied to the work, but that's the nature of graduate school.\n3.

      "text": "From my own experience, I feel there is a component to this circling around expectations.\n  \nResearch is typically characterized by failure. It is very rare to come into a project and have everything work 100% all the time. I think people recognize there is a challenge to graduate research, but they are not necessarily aware of the scale of failure. For me and a lot of my colleagues, we can easily spend a month just trying to figure out why an experiment is not working, only to find out we get a negative result. For a PhD, this can make 4 years really long.\n  \nMy advice would be to go into it knowing that it is hard and you are going to fail. You will fail more than you have ever failed in your life. The important thing to focus on though is being resilient, and finding solutions in those failures. Approach things as a basic problem solving exercise, and reflect on those failures: why didn't this work and what can I change for the next time I do it?\n  \nAfter a while, you'll start to see that within those failures you'll get a success every now and then, and before you know it you will be preparing to graduate.",

During my PhD I worked 9-5, and hardly ever worked in the evenings or over the weekends, but when I was at work, I worked my ass off, and I worked professionally. I also made sure my advisor knew when I was there so it was clear that I was consistent with my productivity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother huge aspect is diversification of your projects (or sub-projects). If you spend all of your time working towards one mega-paper, you might get there and be the first to publish about that subject, but the risk will force you to stress out beyond belief and failure in that situation can be crippling. If instead you carefully plan small projects along the way that can either be summarized into one major push or can be done in parallel with a higher impact project, then you don't have the sink or swim pressure of the one huge looming project. Just like the stock market, if you diversify your portfolio you will see more sustainable long term gains, but the magnitude of any individual gain might be diminished. Diversifying your project portfolio means you rely less on luck (being the first to publish, getting clean data/samples immediately, writing well early) and get to rely more on steady development. In my opinion, that leads to happiness during your PhD. If you are one of those high rollers who need the fame and notoriety, go try to get that famous advisor in the 30 person lab group who doesn't care about anything that's not published in Science or Nature.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne way to identify an advisor that is good at project diversification is to look for recent lower impact journal publications in addition to the heavy hitters, that's a good indication that they will be receptive to a sustainable research portfolio. In solid state physics and materials science that means publishing in journals like APL, Languimir, and some of the society specific journals like the IEEE journals in addition to the heavy hitters like NanoLetters or Nature Materials.

Qualifying exams were my own personal hell and I had a few other select moments of being overwhelmed but overall, it wasn't too bad. \n\n1. I don't watch TV. I know some people use TV as an outlet and that's probably healthy in moderation so I don't think that's bad but for me, it was a time killer. \n2. I chose an area of study I absolutely love. (Most of my research was about Reddit and anonymous digital media, coincidentally.) It felt overwhelming but I was naturally curious about what I was studying. \n3. I utilized time so much better than I ever have. \n   1. I used small blocks of time really well, something I would say I probably did not do at any other point in my academic career. Example: I would outline papers religiously and in detail and then use my kid's soccer practices or sitting in the school car line to write paragraph-by-paragraph so I only had to focus on that small chunk in the time I had. I never realized how much time I wasted by not doing this before. Sure it's a half hour here and a half hour there, but they definitely add up. \n   2. I would  divide out my tasks and plan in advance. For instance, I would save \"brainless\" tasks for office hours in case someone walked in with a question. I would save other tasks for larger blocks of time. But I always knew what I would do and when even with some built in time for \"crisis\" (for instance, the hour long meeting with the student that could easily be an email; however, instead, they think face-time with the professor will win them brownie points. But then they just won't leave because they feel like they need to make sure you know their opinion on everything that has ever been debated in the history of all mankind so you know how smart they are).\n   3. If I managed my time well, I allowed myself to take a few nights off per week to just be present with my people. It was good motivation to stick to the schedule. There were times that i needed to go into crazy researcher mode and lock myself away for a weekend or two so that I could focus but I usually only had one or two of these per semester and I have a good partner, family, and friends who were willing to help. I know that's not the case for everyone. \n4. I had a great relationship with classmates in my cohort. The academic insecurity is hard but it definitely helps when you figure out that no one else knows what they are doing either. Even though other people in my life were supportive, nobody really \"got\" what my life looked like except my classmates. They were great for vent sessions, those \"you can do it\" pep talks, and just overall putting things in perspective. \n\nThere were a few near-breakdowns but for the most part, I've enjoyed the experience. The job search afterwards... not so much. ",

Our relationship is pretty chummy, and being able to crack jokes is a big thing for me. I don't like people who are too formal/stuffy. Also, research can be lonely and I don't want to jump into monologues about a specific niche PhD thing that my friends have absolutely no idea about. I can make those jokes with my supervisor/research group.\n\n3. Freedom to change my schedule. I'll leave early if I have an appointment, and start late if I didn't get to sleep until 3am. I don't have classes, so there aren't too many things I really *have* to be on-campus for, and I can put in my hours whenever I want. For me, that means shifting my work hours later. Forcing myself to get up at 6am will only mean I get chronically sleep-deprived and ill, and will not make me productive. \n\nAnd what about the projects I hated earlier on?\n\n1. Projects that were assigned to me, and which I didn't really want to do. I accepted because I felt pressured. I *hated* them. I hate every single paper that came out of them even now.\n\n2. Supervisors who were too distant or cold. \"Distant\" both in terms of being ~15,000km away, and also just not great at conversation. \n\n3. Forced to be clocked in at a certain (early) time, and always having people keep tabs on when we were in the office. The fatigue makes it harder to focus and gives me headaches, or even a migraine, which really doesn't make the project more fun. ",

Doesn\u2019t necessarily make one happy.\n\nAnswering your edit:\n\nI think it comes down to what you prioritise in your life. Everyone has a place. Your advisor has a certain place in your life but they are not everything. I do what I feel like doing when I feel like doing and ask for advise if I want to regarding things that I have some doubt over. I have managed to maintain that as my relationship with my advisor and they are okay with it or maybe even glad. I don\u2019t work in a lab so I might have it easier. But I used to before I joined here and certain days can be tough if there\u2019s something important. If you set up a strict time limit and stick to it, I don\u2019t think you would have much problem being happy. As for your advisor, it\u2019s not my or your job to keep them happy. They have to do it themselves. So I would say finding the right advisor and having a right attitude towards life contributes the most towards a happy grad student.\n\nHope you find what you are looking for!

I don't regret doing it, but I am certainly glad it's almost over. Pick an advisor who you feel you can work with, and a lab that feels like a good fit. I came into my lab at the same time as a few other graduate students, their friendship absolutely made my experience SO MUCH better. ",

One of the hosts grew to hate his PhD whilst I think the other liked it through and through, so they manage to have both viewpoints covered. \n\nI am still a couple of years away from applications, but I feel I have a much better idea of how to go about it, how to choose labs/supervisors and the sorts of red flags to look out for before comitting to a programme. Hope the podcast can do the same for anyone else who sees this. ",

Your dissertation will end up nothing like you planned but if you can keep pushing through obstacles you will make it out on top.\nGood luck!",

You can set expectations for yourself and also with your advisor, and if they are not happy with that pick a different advisor. You will almost certainly not be working on the same things you do in your PhD lab after moving on. It's rare that one advisor honestly gives you an advantage over others in terms of future job prospects. I see this a lot, where new students think because Professor XYZ is in the field I like, I need to join that lab. You can get into whatever field you'd like in your postdoc, so don't let that weight hold you back from giving different labs and advisors a fair chance. ",
