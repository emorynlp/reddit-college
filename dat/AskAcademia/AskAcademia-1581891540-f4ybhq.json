  "text": "Completely random question, I know, but I was on [this page](https://gsl.altmetric.com/details/73220640) and randomly noticed that someone from DPRK apparently tweeted about this paper (either a VPN or the North Koreans have surprisingly good taste in science). Anyway, this made me wonder, are there actually any actively publishing universities or research institutes in North Korea (publishing in mainstream journals)? I can't remember ever having come across a DPRK affiliation before.",

He must have been from a politically privileged family to be in that position, too. He must know how lucky he is, and know that he would have so much to lose by defecting. \n\nThe flip side to the stories of heroic defection is that there is an element of selfishness: your entire family gets sent to the gulag. It is a horrific reality for any defector to have to live with. \n\nIt\u2019s very easy for those of us who live in democratic and free societies to cast aspersions on others who live in shitty places and have to make serious choices between the nebulous concept of freedom and the very concrete reality of their family\u2019s wellbeing.

Perhaps in the past decade or so this isn\u2019t the case as much due to the further isolation of NK and Russia\u2019s deviation from its Cold War ties (yes this isn\u2019t very nuanced, I know). I would probably think of NK\u2019s science like you might think of a company, they do research, but most of it is held close to their chest. If you look up famous North Korean scientists on Wikipedia you can find some guys who did some phys. Rev. A papers and stuff in the 70s and 80s, pre internet era. Granted more recent ones are featured in news articles about selling (or trying to) nuclear secrets to the Syrians. Anyways, that\u2019s my take after 20 minutes of research and could be complete bullshit and is surely all conjecture.",
