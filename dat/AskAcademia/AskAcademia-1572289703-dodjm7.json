  "title:": "UPDATE [Jealous postdoc coworker accusing me of faking data, not showing up to work; reputation and career at stake]",
  "text": "Link to original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/dcw0rn/jealous\\_postdoc\\_coworker\\_accusing\\_me\\_of\\_faking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/dcw0rn/jealous_postdoc_coworker_accusing_me_of_faking/) \n\nThought I'd slap on updates as this played out. The TL;DR is that things will likely not be the same for me in the lab, but I like what I do too much to let it bother me.\n\nSo luckily a witness got to my PI before me, and let her know there had been a public outburst between me and another postdoc that was definitely worth talking about. My direct PI is very much the 'mother' of the team, and wants to make everyone like each other. My other PI is also the school Dean, and he's a lot more cut-to-the-chase. Both of them were aware of the problem within about an hour of it happening.\n\nAs others suggested, I very quickly made sure all of my data, lab books, and files were up-to-date and solid, in case the accusation that my work was faked was taken seriously. I've seen other labs be audited before. I luckily keep great notes, and had dates and raw data neatly put together. And I have an (informal) assistant, who witnessed most of the tests I do and is a prominent name on the patent. Between a witness and dated notes, there is no way any of this postdoc's crazy ramblings could come back to haunt me. \n\nOf course, nothing happened but talk. It was obvious that this other postdoc was out-of-line and had no evidence to her claims. I took a recent look at some of Facebook posts, and she is really depressed. There is a lot of emotional stuff going on with this postdoc that likely has nothing to do with me, I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Being offered the patent opportunity within earshot of a competing postdoc was probably not a great idea, and my PI will likely learn from that, but as far as I know she got a 'stern talking to' by both the PI and the Dean and we have both happily carried on with the non-communicative relationship we already have. I don't think this postdoc will be around this time next year; she seems to hate academia anyway. \n\nI hoped things would go back to normal for me in the lab, but sadly it really doesn't feel that way. There has been a cold shoulder kind of attitude around me that I've really taken notice of. Rumors seem to have spread really fast, that either I'm a 'fake scientist', a 'cheater' (for having an assistant?) or a terrible person in general, and I certainly don't feel welcome anymore. The lab is very much a high school clique, and I'm the new person that dropped in and started causing trouble. It's like there's a force field around me that everyone's too afraid to cross. I don't know if the stigma will dissipate anytime soon, but I really enjoy the work I'm doing, and I'm keen still to get this patent out. The social isolation sucks, but there are still a handful of great people in our department who are really friendly. \n\nThis update was pretty mediocre, but it was therapeutic for me to get it out. Thanks for all the great advice.",

      "text": "Thanks for the update.  If the problem postdoc got a stern talking to from the bosses, that's probably as good a result as you can expect without escalating the situation to the next level.\n\nWith regard to the social isolation you're feeling in the lab, I'm sorry to hear that that is the case.  I was in a similar situation in graduate school.  My best bet is that this will slowly improve over the next year or so.  If the problem postdoc leaves like you think she will, that will be a big plus.  But, the best thing you can do to bring your colleagues around to your side is to be supremely competent and professional in your work.  Even if they don't like you now for \"rocking the boat,\" most people can't help but get along with others who they consider to be knowledgeable and useful as co-workers, and so I think they will come around eventually as long as you continue to behave as a professional, continue to develop your skills, and are willing to assist others when they need it despite how they treat you.  They may not like you now, but after you help them a couple of times to do something they might not be able to do on their own, they will re-evaluate what they think of you, even if they're not aware of doing so.  This will add up over time, and eventually things will be fine. \n\nKeep your chin up, and good luck.",

      "text": "These situations are complicated. I remember seeing your post and being worried for you. I have kind of been through the same situation. \n\nI was invited by our PI to help in a literature review that was waiting to get written for months. My part involved building one massive table. So I went and took that table to our review meeting. The postdoc asked me to help him finish his table minutes before the meeting, so in a hurry I copied and pasted part of his data in a wrong way. The PI and I didn't notice, so the meeting went smoothly, after which I left for lunch. Coming back I got told the postdoc accused me of complete unethical conduct, based on the mistakes I've made on his table. He basically said to other lab members, near our PI, that I only finished my part fast because I invented data throughout the table. I got so mad (fortunately he has a history with lying in the lab so no one believed him) but didn't have the guts to tell the PI. In the end, I don't really know if those mistakes were real or just something he wanted to accuse me of. It was my first real contribution to the group and I didn't want unecessary stress.\n\nJump to now, he made a sorts of emotional confession of developing depression recently, so I guess that didn't help him. From what I was told he's always been like that and our PI is aware of it but it's very lenient, including doing nothing after being told by a former undergrad she was leaving due to anxiety developed over said postdoc's abusive behaviour. I feel sorry for him but conflicted over the PI's lack of action. \n\nSorry I digressed, but it's a similar situation that left me really confused in my recent professional life. Excellent data record is the key!",
