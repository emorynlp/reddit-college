  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a 1st year PhD. student in Strategic Management and International Business. My program is fully funded. There is a summer research project but I am considering getting an internship at a think tank or government agency or central bank etc. \n\nMy advisor believes I do not need to do that, but I want to do it out of interest. Would this hurt or benefit my future prospect in 1) finding a job in academia 2) finding industry job.",
