  "title:": "Got offered a post-doc in another university. First words from my prof were to stay out of his way..",
  "text": "Anyone else have this happen? When I started, my lab was literally just starting - equipment arrived a few months after I started. Over the last 5 years, I set up the lab, brought in research, I expanded our departments network to such a huge level that there are now post docs in other departments which came from me. The contacts I've brought in resulted in 2 research projects, one scholarship for a new PhD (joint industrial research through industrial partners my prof didn't even know existed ). My research also ended up in two new grants. Suffice to say, I've done my part.\n\nWe got a new PI last year, so there are no open positions for me there. I got offered a post doc position in a competing university. When I told my prof the first words were, \" well, I advise you to stay out of my way '. I found that to be really hurtful, especially after I've help build his department up so much. A week later we spoke about it again and he said , well it actually makes sense that you go - because then I know who is doing what in the other university.\n\nI found it to be extremely toxic - I thought that your prof should be happy that you're advancing your career. Instead, it just made me hate my place of work so much.",
