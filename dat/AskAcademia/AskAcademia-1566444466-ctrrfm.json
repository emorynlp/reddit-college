  "title:": "How to be kind but clear when telling a hopeful grad student that their academic record does not meet expectations?",
  "text": "Pretty much the title, but for context:  \n  \n\nMore and more often I'm getting email requests from senior undergrads in my dept who are considering grad school and want to apply to my lab. These are students I have not taught myself, but this isn't unusual since I'm a new prof. When I check their academic records, I am sometimes surprised to find that they have Cs and Ds in relevant courses. I tend to offer to meet with them anyway, because I like to see how they speak about their research interests, career aspirations, and see if they offer any explanation for their course performance.  \n  \nIf the meeting does not improve the situation, I have a really hard time deciding how best to communicate to these students that it's a no. Should it be in person or by email? If it's by email, how do I close the meeting, since I definitely know by that point it's a no?  \n  \nAnd how do I tell them without kicking them while they're down? Should I simply thank them for their interest and say I can't offer them a position? It seems too harsh to say outright that their academic performance does not meet my expectations for a beginning graduate student. Should explanations like these be reserved for cases in which the student specifically asks for feedback? Help me, please.",

As much as it sucks to hear, it's going to suck more to waste 100s-1000s of dollars applying to schools if there is a high chance they they aren't going to get in because of their academics.\n\nThat being said, I had a friend who worked in the same lab that I did and he had an advisor tell him that he wouldn't be taken seriously by grad schools (very bluntly) for whatever reason (lack of research experience I think) and he was devastated. He completely stopped doing research, ended up not applying at all, and basically gave up all his plans of getting a PhD. So make sure whatever you say it's tactful and helpful not just negative.",

          "text": "I think there's a difference between telling a student \"you will never get into grad school with these grades\" (possibly true, but maybe wrong) and \"our program typically accept students with grades in the range of XX-YY and you would need a minimum of XX to be considered at all\". That leaves it to the student to explore other possibilities and means the supervisor isn't making a blanket statement that may or may not be true.\n\nThe other thing is this: assuming the student is unlikely to get into a certain kind of program, it would make a big difference if an advisor could help the student explore other ways in which they can pursue these interests, e.g., other kinds of postgrad programs, or even career choices that would fit their interests and training.",

      "text": "So I didn't have a very strong academic record, thanks to some undiagnosed mental problems, but I did have good test scores. What helped me the most was a professor, who was not looking to take me in as a grad student, sitting down with me and figuring out how to present myself best and which schools would be less likely to care about my undergrad grades, that still had good programs at least tangentially related to my interests. \n\nI had also had a professor sit down with me while I was in undergrad and suggest I take a few years away from school before deciding on higher education. I got a job in academic research, so I had some papers and experience to my name, and took some courses in my interests for free as an employee, getting much better grades since I only had one class at a time to focus on.\n\nI got rejected by 5/8 of the programs I applied for, accepted at 2 that that professor specifically recommended for me, and 1 a postdoc recommended for similar reasons. My applications focused on the research and coursework I'd done *after* undergrad, and the research I was interested in pursuing. I picked the one that suited me best and got my PhD there.\n\nIf you're genuinely interested in helping them, maybe it would be better to frame the meeting differently. If they went into the meeting knowing you 'weren't really looking for new grad students' but that you were willing to help them figure out some programs to apply for that they might not have thought of, they would not be expecting the meeting to result in an offer. That still gives you room to make an offer if the meeting goes unexpectedly well, though it does mean you'd have to look into a couple of schools with looser GPA requirements. Having a meeting with the purpose being 'to give advice on applying to grad school' would take that expectation off you, so when you don't offer a position it wouldn't be seen as a kick.\n\nI think it's probably best to be honest about their application weaknesses, as long as you can give some constructive advice along with that. You don't know that they aren't cut out for research, you do know that they wouldn't be suited to your lab in your school's grad program, so offer advice that gets them closer to doing research with the record they currently have. Being told 'your GPA is really weak, and there are a lot of schools that will reject you based entirely on that' stung, but the conversation that followed was supportive and helpful for furthering my research goals in a way no one else had ever been.\n\ntl;dr don't let them go into the meeting expecting an offer, and don't kick them unless you can also help and encourage them to get past it",

In any case, I'm sorry to give you a negative response and wish you the best in finding a good project.\n\n(I copied his email directly. imo you\u2019re already very nice to give them all a chance, this professor didn\u2019t even bother talking to me)",

      "text": "It sounds like checking the academic records in the first place is giving a bad impression before you meet with the students. Since you are willing to meet with them, though, and still consider giving them a spot with your group, it sounds like this doesn't turn out to be about the grades in the end. Have you considered not asking for their academic records prior to your meetings?\n\nAnecdotally, I ran an NSF REU program a few years ago and we accepted a few students with lower GPAs (but excellent applications otherwise) to see how they'd do and they did fantastic. In the end, one of these students won our internal travel award for the excellent summer research they conducted. Of course, this doesn't mean that all students with poor GPAs (in relevant courses) will do well, but it's something to keep in the back of your mind.\n\nTo answer your question of how to best let them down gently? That is a tough question. I'd recommend being honest and letting them know directly, but with compassion. This is most easily done in person (as text can leave a lot of ambiguity in tone). If you can, suggest other places they may be able to do research or give suggestions on how to improve their \"application packet.\"",

      "text": "> hopeful grad student that their academic record does not meet expectations?\n\n\nFirst, you're doing *yourself* a disservice if you actually care about their grades while looking for someone to conduct research for you. GPA does not correlate with research success at any level, all the way up through professorships. Go ahead and ask your own department for their data and see for yourself. Many graduate schools are ditching GRE scores as requirements because again, they offer zero predictive power for success in grad school. (Sidenote: some student fellowships require GPA cutoffs and therefore can skew the data depending on how you measure \"success\").\n\nMy favorite story is from Abigail Salyers, former president of the American Society for Microbiology. She was asked to review medical student applications for the UIC med school. When she met with the rest of the committee to share their picks she literally threw away the applications that had a GPA above 3.5. She told the search committee she polled the life science departments at U of I and found the average professor's undergrad GPA was 3.3. She found she ran a smoother lab when her students had more diverse, less academic heavy bsckgrounds. \n\nShe...wasn't asked back to review the following years applications. \n\nWe are raised to respect GPA, but when it comes to upper level research it is literally useless as a tool to distinguish between who will be successful and who will not. I'm not saying there's a particular reason for that, just that it's what we see. \n\n> If the meeting does not improve the situation, I have a really hard time deciding how best to communicate to these students that it's a no.\n\nIt is GREAT that you still meet with them!  If you've met with them and decided not to take them then it is no longer about their grades. You could just say you've met with a lot of other students and you've chosen someone else that is a better fit for the lab. If they ask for constructive critisism you can of course tell them that for you, grades are important (and that grad school committees still use them as a filter, mostly because of fellowship or training grant GPA requirements). \n\nFor your own sanity, remember in the real world rejections often come with complete silence so anything you give them is better than nothing. \n\n\nMoral of the story is chose who you think is the best for for your lab when you meet them, not necessarily who is the best on paper. Saying you found someone with better \"fit\" can sometimes be the simplest answer.\n\nEDIT: For those interested in the research looking into if GPA and test scores are relevant to finding successful researchers (spoilers, they're not, even subject specific tests) here are two quick write ups reviewing some literature: \n\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/06/gres-dont-predict-grad-school-success-what-does\n\nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/52691-gre-scores-are-a-bad-predictor-of-phd-success",

Of course you shouldn't use GPA alone/as a cutoff to make admissions decisions, there are issues like private schools having average GPAs about 0.3 points higher than public schools across the board so context matters, and it's better to consider the entire transcript rather than the single number, but I have never heard anyone say that GPA/course grades shouldn't be used at all in assessing applicants. In fact, I attended a holistic admissions workshop with Julie Posselt and Casey Miller, the researchers who did a lot of the work that is being summarized in your links, just three days ago and in an example admissions rubric they presented the first criteria was 'academic success' which was based on course grades in the discipline. I strongly doubt that they would endorse a practice of throwing out applications with GPAs over a certain threshold since that would go against the whole concept of holistic admissions.

I've included an anecdote below about a student who did get that kind of realistic feedback from schools, because even though I tried (and failed miserably) to tell them that I didn't think that they would be competitive as a Ph.D. candidate, I didn't want to make a life decision for him. \n\nI had a student ask me to look over their graduate school applications.  I knew that they were applying to two really high-level schools, two safety schools, and was looking into industry positions, so I didn't worry too much.  Well, his top choice, one of the top Ph.D. programs in computer science turned him down and offered the standard \"so many qualified applicants, couldn't take them all\" HR-approved note.  He reached out to the advisor he wanted to work for directly, who leveled with him and said \"you have far too many C's and D's in your major courses, while it's clear you like programing from talking to you, we don't think you would be successful with our rigorous curriculum based on your past performance.\" He received similar comments from two other schools, and was offered MS admissions, not Ph.D. for the fourth school. After that level of feedback, he decided that maybe industry experience would do him some good and he is now comfortably making more money than the rest of us, lol.",

I floundered in undergrad due to depression and an undiagnosed learning disability, but I spent several years in industry proving myself, and I entered graduate school several years later fairly decorated and enthusiastically recommended by senior scientists at my job. I ended up doing just fine my first year, and I was able to hit the ground running with my research because I have polished lab skills from my time in industry. If the student is determined to get in, addressing poor grades and showing improvement worked for me and may well work for them. (I also retook Orgo II lecture three times to pass and pointed that out as an example of my grit.)\n\nLooking back, having my undergrad advisor tell me point blank there was \u201cno hope\u201d for me based on my grades was devastating and demotivated me even more. If he had offered some more unusual routes to graduate school, I would have known there was a light at the end of the tunnel despite my poor academic performance. I ended up having to figure that out myself.",

I had a terrible experience this year where I got a lot of serious complaints because I told a very average student that it was unlikely they would win extremely competitive graduate funding. The whole thing dragged on for a year, emails were read, meetings were had - it was awful. \n\nI am not sure whether this is a structural problem but I think there is a trend of these kinds of students expecting certain professional trajectories and it might get ugly if these expectations aren\u2019t met.

In a sense he is putting the people he emails in an awkward position because his academic record is clearly not good enough and he should know better than to reach so far. I think you should tell them why you are rejecting them if it has to do with academic performance. If you don't they will probably assume the wrong thing and may get it into their head that problems they have aren't problems. Life isn't easy and as heartless as this sounds sometimes you just gotta tell someone they aren't good enough.",
