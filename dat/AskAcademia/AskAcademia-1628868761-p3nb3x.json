  "title:": "Me and my friend did a project as a team. He now wants to write my half of the project in his master's thesis as well. Should I allow him to?",
  "text": "Hello. I hope this is the right place to ask this question.\n\nSo I was a CS undergrad and my friend was doing his master's in CS last year when we started working on a project as a team under the supervision of a professor. The project turned out to be a success and we published a paper together, then I graduated from my undergrad studies while my friend continued doing his master's studies.\n\nNow, he came to me with a weird offer. He stated that since we did this project together, I owned half of it and he owned the other half. He said that he can freely write his half of the work in his thesis, but said that he also wants to write my half of the project in his thesis as well. He said he would dedicate the \"Acknowledgements\" section of his thesis all to me if I accept this offer.\n\nThis seemed bizarre and weird to me, and he said that he and I would both benefit from this, as he would need to do additional work for his thesis if I don't allow him to write about my half of the project in his thesis; and I would benefit because the readers would get to know about me when reading the \"Acknowledgements\" part of his thesis. He also said that I wasn't allowed to include my half of the project in my thesis if I pursue a master's degree since it is something that was done in the past, and therefore my half would be unusable if he didn't write about it in his thesis.\n\nWhat do you think about this offer? I wanted to ask here to get some opinions on the matter.",

      "text": "Speaking as a CS professor, the answer is \"Of course not.\" Even if you agreed to this, his Master's thesis must be his own work. Since you co-authored a paper, it has already been documented that your contributions were  enough to merit more than acknowledgement. He cannot include your work in his Master's thesis unless he very clearly documents that it was your work and not his, the same way he would with any other citations to work by others, which is apparently not what he wants to do. It seems pretty clear that he is trying to cheat, and you should not support that.\n\nHe is also being dishonest when he says that this would benefit you. Nobody cares about the acknowledgments in a Master's thesis. It is also untrue that you will be unable to write about your portion in your own hypothetical Master's thesis in the future, although it is perhaps unlikely that you will want to do so.",

Apparently our supervisors expected me to pursue a master's degree under their supervision (I said no but they were hopeful that they could convince me to do a master's). Had I pursued a master's degree, then we would have produced double the work, and he would have written the first half of that work in his thesis and I would have written the second half in mine.\n\nNow since I did not pursue a master's, there is only 1 half of the whole product, and without the whole 1 half, my friend has to do additional work to graduate. He doesn't want to do additional work for reasons (has a full-time job etc.) and for that reason he wants to write my half the project in his thesis as well. \n\nApparently our supervisors allow this thing if I'm fine with it.\n\nEven if I'm fine with it, this is still a no-no, right? Also, my friend said that no one would care about his thesis when we have published paper about it. Is this true? Would I be hurt if I gave him my consent about this issue? He also added that we could make our project open source and have my name on the foreground all the time and this would really benefit me. \n\nI'm sorry I'm asking a lot of questions.

I doubt your degree would be in danger but it's not impossible either.",

Mentioning you in the acknowledgements is not proper credit. And as you are co-authors on a paper, it will be very obvious to anyone else that half of the project is actually your work.\n\nAgreeing to his proposal is very unethical. It could hurt you in the future because you contributed to scientific misconduct. But if you are no longer working in research, I don't think that this will hurt your career because you didn't unfairly take credit for anything for your own gain. Nevertheless, I would not agree to this.\n\nI can't imagine that your supervisor's are actually okay with this. A master thesis is something that absolutely has to be 100% your own work. You can show additional results by other people that help put the project into perspective but you have to be very clear about which work is your own and which isn't. If your friend doesn't do that, this is scientific misconduct and can have severe consequences especially if he wants to continue working in research.",

              "text": "First, I'm really sorry you got put in this position. Shame on your supervisors for allowing it to happen. Social pressure from friends and role models/advisors/supervisors can be very hard to overcome and it is difficult to discern between what is right and wrong in such a situation. \n\nCandidly, the additional work your friend is avoiding is part of earning a masters degree. I would be furious if I hired a faculty member or accepted a PhD student who did this in their thesis or dissertation. The thesis is usually the single best example of what a graduate degree holder has accomplished with respect to research at the point of graduation. For him to attribute your work as his own in a thesis is unethical at best and I would argue fraudulent at worst. Under no conditions should your friend be allowed to publish your work as his own.\n\nIf your supervisor is not okay with your friend using their half of the work as a standalone thesis--especially the first half--I cannot comprehend why using your contributions suddenly speaks to the research prowess of your friend. If attributing the work to you is insufficient, he has not completed the requirements for a masters degree. Also, if your friend was fraudulently allowed to use the entire work as a masters thesis, it becomes their research. Period. They will be expected to talk about it in future interviews and careers as though it were entirely their own, regardless of whether you co-author something from it in a future journal article. Acknowledgements are not authorship. Your supervisors should know this. Why your supervisors appear to be allowing exceptions to this has me seriously concerned for what else goes on in your department. I know stuff happens but this seems particularly egregious to me.\n\nLastly, it sounds like you are not interested in pursuing a masters degree but I really hope that's not because of the difficult experiences you appear to be having at your current school. I would like to hope this type of discussion would never happen at most reputable institutions. At the very least, I cannot possibly imagine it occurring at any institution where I have worked or have colleagues. If you contributed good work to a project and enjoyed the process, I hope this experience is not what turns you off from a research career. It can be very rewarding and it sounds like you've put together publishable quality work as an undergraduate student. If so, congratulations on your achievements! That's not easy to do.",

From that viewpoint, there's nothing objectionable, but he also doesn't need your permission in any legal or moral sense. I'm not sure why this is presented as an \u201coffer\u201d.\n\nWhat is not OK is plagiarizing the existing project and presenting all of the past work as novel work done for the thesis. This is problematic for two reasons.\n\n1. He would be *cheating* on his master's thesis by presenting work he had done previously, or by presenting your work as his. Instead, he can *continue* work on the project for his thesis and write the thesis about that new work.\n\n2. He would be *plagiarizing* your previous joint work. You published a paper about the project, so he can do what any other researcher could also do: just cite the paper in the thesis. It's his duty to clearly separate the contributions of his thesis from prior work.\n\n> He also said that I wasn't allowed to include my half of the project in my thesis if I pursue a master's degree since it is something that was done in the past, and therefore my half would be unusable if he didn't write about it in his thesis.\n\nWTF. This makes no sense at all. You're *both* allowed to continue working on this topic, and you're both not allowed to recycle previous material in a thesis. Whether he continues work on the project in his thesis has absolutely no bearing on what you would be able to do.\n\nI too \u201crecycled\u201d a student project for my Bachelor's thesis, but made sure that my thesis involved distinct work. Whereas the project involved familiarizing myself with the field and implementing a proof of concept software, my thesis substantially improved the software, evaluated it, and compared it against other tools. \n\nDisclaimers: If in doubt, talk with your professor who supervised the project, or with any other professor you trust. I'm making the strong assumption that the thesis is not allowed to recycle prior work, but this might not hold everywhere.",

If there is any unpublished work, he could include a \"draft manuscript\" with you cited as a co-author and the same disclaimer about what he contributed.  Regardless, he can talk to his advisor on how to approach this and find a way that doesn't take credit for your work.",
