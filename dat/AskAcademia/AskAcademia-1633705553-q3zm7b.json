      "text": "What were your friend's complaints? I've published books with several academic presses and have never had any major problem-the only tussle I had was about a cover, which I won. I did have an experienced in-house editor at my university who helped with contracts and major decisions so that was fortunate. The days of heavy-handed editors seem to be over-people now have the reverse problems of not enough editing/attention to the ms., poor indexing (by software) and little promotion. One is lucky to get decent copy-editing these days, much less editorial input. I have a friend who is the lead copy editor for a major academic press and she has been shocked by declining attention to manuscripts and how they are managed. She points out larger issues with manuscripts to the administrators (i.e., problems with logic, writing, content) but they let most of that slide these days. Distribution and promotion can be an issue-promotion is mostly up to authors now. \nObviously, a lot depends on the project manager or editor you work with, and the team they assemble. Good luck, hope you have a positive experience!",

      "text": "Like the other poster, I've done a few books with different presses and haven't run into any serious problems.\n\nWhat I would stress is that you understand the terms of your contract and the process for publication. When will the manuscript go out for review (will it?)? When will the final decision on publication be made? How long will you have for revisions? Who will make the index (usually you)? How long will you have to make it? Etc.\n\nNone of these are insurmountable, but if the publisher starts being cagey about answering these questions, well, yeah, that's a red flag.",

      "text": "I feel like the university press I published with (a large public university) gave me much more guidance and a more helpful peer review process  than my colleagues have gotten at  the huge academic/trade publishers (Routledge, Sage, etc.). If that matters for your project, ask your acquisitions editor about the process and ask friends or colleagues who've published with the press. \n\nHow much of the copyediting, indexing, sending out permissions requests, etc., is your responsibility? (There's a fair chance the index and permissions are on you. Copyediting quality varies, judging from some of the recent books I've read.. Look at some of their books and ask yourself if you'd be happy if it were your book. You'll put so many hours of your life into this book. If it comes out with a hideous cover, quarter-inch margins, and tiny, weirdly formatted typeface, and a couple of embarrassing copyediting errors, how disappointed would you be? \n\nWhich is part of the more important question --\n\nHow much will they try to market your book? Are they at your major conferences? Are they sending out review copies to the journals you'll want reviews in and do those come out of your royalties? Do they submit to the prizes in your discipline you'll want to compete for?  \nDo they publish simultaneously as hardcover and e-book? Paperback? Will that e-book be bundled in with common library databases like ProQuest or EBSCO? University library budgets are shrinking, and I'm at a point where at least a third, probably half, of the books I have available at my (smallish) university library are e-books in one of those databases. Likewise, what are the press's list prices like? In my field (literary studies), we have a lot of books in the $30-50 range, which both libraries and individuals purchase, and then a lot in the $100-plus range (often from the academic/trade publishers), which only libraries purchase (and increasingly, not even libraries). You want readers to be able to get it.",
