  "title:": "\"Make all the figures before you start writing the paper\" is terrible advice",
  "text": "Biomedical sciences student here. I am curious what people think of this statement. Personally, I have heard it from many PIs, including my own, leading me to believe it is a common bit of philosophy throughout academia.\n\nBased on my experience, this has been garbage advice. Sure, you need to know your data, and you need to have it analyzed before you start writing. But I have found that the story only comes together when pen hits paper, and some parts of the story end up needing to be emphasized while others can be ignored. In the past, I tried to stick to pre-made figures and maintain the expectation that they weren't going to change. Ultimately I found that this unnecessarily constrained the story I ended up being able to tell and became a waste of time since I just remake the figures anyway.",

All of my advisors agree with that statement too.",

That's why professors ask students to develop the figures first. \n\nA majority of students have trouble developing transitions, and they tend to present their work as a temporal assessment of the order in which they accomplished the work. Sometimes the last experiment ends up becoming FIG1, and that's hard for many young scientists to see. Now, again, maybe you're a very talented writer, and that's great! Certainly each mentor needs to engage each mentee differently. But, in a generalizable way, it's not unreasonable for the PI to ask the trainee to develop the figures first.",

For me at least, the process of making figures happens in concert with the data analysis and exploration process, and so is essential for fleshing out what story the data is telling. That being said though, I always end up making lots of figures that are not used. Many times they were essential for crystallizing a thought process, but they end up being a means to an end, not an end product that is useful for the final paper. At best some of them might show up in a presentation, or maybe the supplement, but many just end up on the scrap heap and that's fine because something was learned from their creation. Similarly, virtually none of the figures stay unaltered during the writing process that follows and in many cases it will become necessary to make new figures during the writing process as you realize certain things need graphical explanation or support.\n\nSetting all the above aside, what I usually tell my students is that the above works for me, but the writing process is pretty personal and different strategies will work for different people. I want them to make figures as this is an easy way for us to have a conversation about their data and for us to work through the analysis process together, but if the \"make the figures for the paper first\" thing isn't working for them as a strategy or is hindering their progress, trying something else is fine. More important is having some sort of strategy in place, as without it, you're just waiting for the writing process to happen and that's never good.",

Figures can end up changing a lot for various reasons, and many get cut or sent to supplemental. So don't waste a bunch of time making things pretty until you're fairly certain they will make it into the paper (or paper presentation). Also, use reproducible techniques (e.g., ggplot package in R) to create your figures so it's easier to change things down the road. I started with the intro on one of my papers and I've ended up having to cut so much useless info because my figures/results didn't support the story my figures were telling.

Make up figures on a whiteboard of how the project could play out. Can you make sense of all the possible outcomes? Are there some answers that are better than others? If all the possible answers are interesting and interpretable then you have a good project design. If only some answers give you intelligible answers then you have a poor(er) design.   \n\n\nOnce you have data, drafting the figures gives you an outline of the paper. This is how people read papers. Often they just look at the figures to scrape the information they are interested in. It's the storyboard and the hard data that determines what you ultimately can say.",

I came from a niche of research where you were committed to a single experimental set-up for often 3-6 months. This necessitated our lab being sure we had a fairly optimal design before initiating the experiment, and a large part of that was done by asking the questions: \"what would be the primary figure you would include in a publication from this experiment?\", \"how would you interpret that data/figure?\", \"are there  interesting findings if your data does not look like that figure (or can there be while not leaving your experimental objective)?\", and then \"how do we make sure to test the right experimental variables/controls to properly get to that figure?\"\n\nI've found that projects that have shorter turn-arounds allow so many individual experiments to be run, that some researchers fail to really learn and internalize this type of thinking. For them, it can be easy to simply run another experiment, sometimes even at low cost. But when it comes to making sense of the data, it can end up being a little bit post hoc ergo propter hoc if they weren't specifically thinking of how their data would/could be interpreted at the end of the experimental series.",

What do you think the readers of your paper/thesis will look at? The (probably quite dull) technical word soup, or the pretty pictures?\n\nPeople give you the advice to make all the figures first for a simple reason - you need to tell your story with the figures alone. Someone needs to be able to understand your paper from just the figures, because they will read the abstract, read the conclusion, view the figures, then scan the body for details to answer the remaining questions they have about your work.\n\nWe aren't writing novels here. The body of the text won't be entertaining. It should contain the details needed to reproduce our experiments, and the argument we're trying to make, written using words. But if that argument isn't obvious from your figures, people won't be willing to agree with your conclusions! The argument you write must, therefore naturally flows from viewing the figures, so producing them first will make your job a whole lot easier.\n\n If you think you should focus on writing the body of text and enjoy writing prose, good for you. Come back to me when you're writing your thesis literature review and let me know how many papers you read linearly, in their entirety, from abstract to conclusion! (It won't be many.)",

Getting the figures right is therefore some of the most important work of writing the paper. BUT in the process of writing, sometimes you have insights that change the way you understand the data or how you want to present it, leading you to change the figures. \n\nI once wrote a paper and while putting together the talk about it I had a flash of insight about a new, better way to present the ideas. I ended up with a much better presentation based on completely different figures. The paper was mostly mathematical proofs and the talk ended up being mostly conceptual figures explaining the ideas in the proofs. Had I stuck with the original figures, it would have been a dud (honestly, I was even bored creating the original presentation). Instead, several people told me afterward it was their favorite conference talk.\n\nBottom line: it is helpful to think about the story you want to tell and how to tell it through the figures before you start writing in earnest, sort of like storyboarding your paper, but be open to changing them as you go along.",

Some people do better building an outline and writing to that, others do better sorta writing and letting the paper evolve on its own. For me, I feel the latter serves creative writing better than scientific writing, but at it's core it's mostly a matter of preference and how to get \\*you\\* to write more efficiently.",

      "text": "My understanding has always been that 'draft out your figures before you write the paper' is more of a guide to performing research, rather than documenting it. It certainly helps to storyboard with figures, but that's not its primary purpose - it's writing a roadmap of your work, in publishable figure form.\n\nWhen I 'draft all my figures' for a new piece of work, I'm trying to build a paper boat using the minimum quantity of data figures to establish a point. I tend to use the [MatPlotLib xkcd plugin](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.xkcd.html) to make absolutely clear what's a 'data goes here' figure, and sometimes we've even written decision trees about what to do with what data outcome. But if I can't make the boat float without a particular figure, then we have to include that experiment. If I can't work out where a particular figure would go in the paper, I have to ask myself why I'm doing the experiment as part of this piece of work.\n\nYour mileage may vary, and the degree to which your work is 'thought out' will be incredibly dependent on sub-discipline, country of employment and funder. That said, I've seen *lot* of research done, (in the UK, by friends and collaborators, mostly with gilt-edged charity funding) that would have benefited from a very early figure draft, because the combination of anxiety and completionism leads to unsustainable project drift.",

      "text": "The most effective strategy is going to vary based on the student, the advisor, the project, etc etc. But in almost all circumstances you are going to iterate on both the figures and the writing many times. I have often found that having a set of preliminary figures before I start writing is very useful, and it really helps me to facilitate that spark when \"pen hits paper\" that you described. But I also work in computational biology where iterating over figures is pretty fast, so I think that is probably a big part of why the \"make the figures before you start writing the paper\" works for me. Regardless, I wouldn't be so hasty to dismiss this as \"terrible advice\", it sounds like it just wasn't an effective strategy for you.",
