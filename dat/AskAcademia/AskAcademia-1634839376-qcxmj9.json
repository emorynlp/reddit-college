  "text": "I have a feeling I just have to submit stuff to journal articles but I'm writing a non-fiction book based on research I've done. A simple Google search didn't land me to any place where I can submit it for peer reviewers. Is there a place that I can submit my manuscript to? Is there a process for getting peer reviews I'm not aware of? I just want to make sure I'm not talking out of my ass or missing important pieces of already published literature.",

(The publisher will deal what that when it comes to it -- if they use peer review for whole books, not just book proposals.)\n\nYou want content editing by a subject expert. Are you associated with a university? Could you find a research seminar that deals with similar topics? One way could be to present different parts at different seminars.\n\nTo fact check a whole book is a huge undertaking and not something someone can be expected to do on their own time if it isn't done from inside the \"system\", where the reader gets paid as advisor, examiner, gets co-authorship, write and publish a review of the published book, or any of the other ways that make it at least somewhat worthwhile. \n\nTo get someone to do the work out the goodness of their heart is like asking a mechanic to fix your car for the same reason.",

      "text": "What's the point of publishing a book over a research article in your opinion? Peer reviews are not sourced from the author of the material to be reviewed, typically academic journals recruit reviewers for articles so they achieve the gold standard: double blind peer review (where the authors do not know the reviewers and the reviewers do not know the authors). Some journals also publish book reviews (of published works) but this is not technically peer review.\n\nI also am wondering since you labeled this as social science, did you conduct research on humans? If so, did your research receive some for of ethics approval (in the states, it's IRB) before working with participants and collecting data? If not, it is going to be impossible (and unethical) for this work to be peer reviewed and published.\n\nIn short, if your research was approved by an ethics board, I would just try to publish a journal article since the journal will handle the peer reviews and other researchers will find/use your work at a greater rate than a book.",

      "text": "If your goal is to receive peer review for publication, you'll need to identify journals that are relevant to your topic, review their submission requirements, and then submit. You'll likely have to break your work into chunks to meet those requirements, and then your book becomes more of a literature review with a heavy emphasis on things you've published.\n\nIn some fields it's not really \"published\" until it's in a journal, in others (CS is the one I know of) a conference may be acceptable. You'll then wait for the reviewed comments along with an accept/reject decision. The peer review and publishing are integrated into the same process, and it's handled by a journal/conference (you don't seek out peer review on your own and then publish elsewhere if you get the OK).\n\nTips for finding journals that may be relevant to you:\n\n* Find research in your area, use this to find labs/researchers, use that to find their webpage. They'll have listed their publications: where did they publish? What are they citing, and where is that published?\n* If you've found researchers, you may also have found their contact information. They'll be able to provide a list of journals they feel are worthwhile.\n* Groups like Springer, IEEE, ACM, ASME are all large groups with reputable journals. Those are largely tech-focused because they're the ones I know about, not sure if that's helpful.\n* Try searching for key phrases like \"transactions on xyz\", \"communications on xyz\", \"conference on xyz\", \"letters on xyz\". \"Call for papers\" is another one.",
