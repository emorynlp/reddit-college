  "title:": "Alternative career choice for a humanities MA having doubts?",
  "text": "I'm currently pursuing a masters in a humanities subject (literature). I quit my job to do it (I'm in my mid-20s), convinced that academic was for me, but cards on the table, I'm struggling to focus on my work, not performing as well as I'd like to be and am hence starting to have some doubts about whether this is my right career. But I've sunk quite a lot of money into a masters.... Which leaves me a little bit stranded. Does anyone have any advice for careers, other than academia, that I might try my hand to, and which ideally don't involve any further qualifications? It's crossed my mind that a university administrator could be a decent thing to do, although I'm not sure what demand's like, and that high school English teaching could work too. Finally, could there be merit in me using the next 9 months to learn to code, on the side of the masters? I have heard of people getting junior developer jobs within that time.",

      "text": "Look into online courses you can take in grant writing, medical writing, or technical writing. These seem technical but all require an understanding of how language works and how non-specialists understand writing. Research administration is another career that humanities scholars can excel at (it basically involves people skills and interpretation). If you can finish your MA and have one of these additional certifications, you could take the next step. In many of these careers it is hard to get your foot in the door, so you will need to network, but once you do, you'll have opportunities. You could look out for chances to help professors as a part-time research coordinator, grant writer, etc.--look on your campus jobs board. Just being involved with putting together a grant would give you a starting point for grant writing.",

      "text": "PoliSci PhD student here. Personally, I do much better when balancing out my academia with 15-25 hours of work. I do custom decorative concrete and fine carpentry as a private contractor, which I learned while working construction to pay my way through undergrad. At one time I had quit working to focus on school, and experienced academic burnout very similar to what you're describing. Lack of interest, trouble focusing, doubt, lowered performance, etc. Something about working with my hands part of the time really brings some symmetry to my life and reminds me why I'm pursuing my degree. Maybe pick up some hours at a job? Doesn't have to be construction, just something that allows you to switch gears a little.\n\nIf you're totally convinced you don't want to be in academia, I'd suggest what I suggest everyone who gets to that point: HVAC or smart tech electrician/solar installation. HVAC technicians in particular make bank and it'll only be in more demand as the world gets hotter. As for the electrical stuff, they're growing industries that will be really under served in the next few years and having experience in them will set you up for a very lucrative career, especially once you get into management or ownership. Just my $0.02, if you don't want to work with your body for a few years, disregard. You can go to school for both, but you'd be better off just finding a contractor in your area and starting as an apprentice.",
