  "text": "I'm in my final year of PhD and is looking into applying for open post doc positions. However, I do not know when my defence will be yet. Best case scenario it is going to be sometime in April/May, and in worst case it would be in August. \nSo I was browsing internet for potential future supervisors, and then I happened to find a position open for application, available immediately, and the deadline is sometime this month. Would it be way too early for me to apply for this? If yes, when would be the best time? \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "In my field, postdoc positions being advertised now will tend to start around June, however some will be willing to push the start date back for the ideal candidate. If you can determine who the PI is, it might be worth emailing them to ask for more information about the position, when they would want a postdoc to start working with them, etc. I'm about to post a position that will say available immediately, but I don't anticipate someone actually starting until next summer.",
