  "text": "Taken from a previous post of mine:\n\nI had a really wonderful professor a few semesters ago that really changed my perspective about life. In private she taught us so many life lessons and I\u2019m so grateful to have had her as my professor. I miss her. \n\nNow today:\n\nI was thinking maybe I should reach out, I\u2019m not really sure how. Some professors have stated professors like keeping in touch while others don\u2019t. \n\nAny tips for effective communication here would be helpful!  Or general tips !",

God knows a lot of profs fear being irrelevant, even if they know that's completely relative and non-determinative.  They, too, are human beings and appreciate the validation. Go for it!",
