  "text": "Struggling to find a job after a postdoc and will have to apply for a receptionist or data entry position. On my CV I'll fashion my TA and RA jobs as \"administrative assistant to the department\", since they involved a lot of admin and work with LMS, postdoc I'll just skip. But if you google me, the first hits are my academia. edu web page with my pubs and conference talks, dissertations page from my uni, and my postdoc page. So if a potential employer decides to google me, they'll immediately see that I'm way overqualified and too academic/ brainy. Shall I delete the academia webpage and ask my department and postdoc to delete my info? Or am I just overthinking it? Any advice and insight appreciated.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for the suggestions on how to spin my academic experience but unfortunately I'm not a US or EU citizen and in my home country all these options do not exist. I do appreciate the support and encouragement, though.",
