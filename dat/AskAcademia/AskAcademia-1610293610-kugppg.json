  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been volunteering with the national peak body for health psychology in my country for five years as the Chair of the Student Subcommittee. For the past year, along with another student, I been responsible for curating content for the newsletter.\n\nI am a PhD student, and my degree has taken longer than expected for health reasons. Nonetheless, I enjoy volunteering, because I am very passionate about health psychology. I have received little recognition for the work I have done, which has often been very extensive and involved hours of work, but again, I am passionate about health psychology, and I believe in loyalty to an organisation. I also attend monthly teleconferences, which are each two hours. I have rarely missed a meeting.\n\nIn a recent email listing all committee members, I was not listed. I replied and asked why my name was not included. I was told it was a record keeping error, which I accepted. I have now noticed that I have been removed from the website as 'chair of the student subcommittee', 'student representative', and 'newsletter editor'.\n\nI do wonder if they are suspicious that I am still a student, but I am, there have just been extensive delays because of my own health issues, and COVID. I actually mentioned to the Chair in a recent email that I have finished my coursework and placements, but I am still continuing my research, because I was wondering if I would be eligible to be considered an early career representative instead. She said I am still considered a student representative.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How should I address this? I'm a little annoyed...",

This is particularly true of voluntary organizations, where people are assigned tasks not by their ability, but by their willingness, and just because someone is willing doesn't mean that they have time or skills.\n\nSomeone makes a mistake and forgets to put you on a list. Someone else copy pastes that from someone else.\n\n\n(Source: I'm volunteer website person for a small non profit. List of members is a mess. Someone emailed me to tell me that the old president is still listed in one place - they died a couple of years ago. I'm crap at it, but the alternative is that it doesn't happen at all, and I'm slightly better than that).",

      "text": "Just to back up u/cactusmittens answer. This is a mistake that happens on a website I run every few months, and always at the start and end of a semester. In our case, it's because every individual has a start and end date in a central database. _Every_ individual. Tenured professors have an end date of December 31, 2999. And every person needing reappointment -- lecturers and postdocs for example -- have an end date of the last day of the semester, even if everyone knows they'll be there longer. Every admin staff meeting near the end of the semester features our administrative officer asking our HR person \"[Person] wanted to know when the reappointment letters are going out. Should I tell them it's the same date it's been every semester for all of history?\"\n\nSo, therefore, about the website. If it's a sizeable department, the person in charge of the site is probably getting an HR list of current people and using it to update the site. Often there's an appointment gap between semesters (winter break and summer), and sometimes the person managing the site doesn't yet know that gap is an unavoidable detail of HR databases. So they drop the person from the site.\n\nSo as others have said, a polite follow-up email probably clears this up in five minutes.",
