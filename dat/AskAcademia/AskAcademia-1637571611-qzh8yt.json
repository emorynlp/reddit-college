      "text": "TLDR: isn't there some kind of review or verification prior to a text being adopted by a school?\n\nI am in concurrent UG psych classes for different disciplines, that are teaching the same topics week to week. This has illuminated a very serious problem for one of them. Text one is a neuropsych text that was written by my professor with a ton of engaging content, in text citation, and very clear objectives. I've not encountered a single section that was not fortified with sound science or research. Cost was $34. \n\nText two is Abnormal Psych, not written by the ab psych professor and a lot of what they write is conflicting with text one. Additionally, I have found several errors or very dated notions with questionable citations. Some Examples:  \n\\- they say that the US Department of veterans affairs utilizes \"rap groups\" for combat vets. Rap groups have not existed for decades and there are no VHA wide combat vet therapy programs. In fact, most of their veteran PTSD stuff was extremely dated, one sided, and inaccurate.  \n\\- They cited non-peer reviewed papers that read like they were written by a freshman to hold up statements that I find implausible, like force feeding being an effective treatment for ED.  In fact, I've not gotten a clear response when asking how \"effective\" is measured.  \n\\- They are fixated on GABA and mention it every chapter, but fail to discuss the link to dopamine. I am getting test questions wrong when selecting dopamine on \"reward circuit\" questions... also, \"reward circuit\"?   \n\\- For the drugs section, Ab psych said crack cocaine was just purified and smoked coke, and \"it's basically free basing.\"  Thanks to text one, I know this is not accurate.  \n\\- The ab psych text gets the history or morphine and oxycontin wrong (literally has oxytocin twice), ignores big pharma's culpability, and attributes rising heroin use to race. Not socio economic factors, just race. No citations and major logic leaps on that one. \n\nAnyhow, Ab psych text was published this year and cost $340 to buy, $250 to rent, and $80 on kindle. The Kindle is abridged (without clearly saying so) and there were no rentals available. I had to get the kindle when the hard copy was back ordered for \"up to 12 weeks\". When I did a side by side from kindle to previous edition ($24 used on amazon), looking for changes, it was predominantly superficial changes to include mentions of covid and current events, and shifted focus towards more social issues than the last text. Shocker: psychology hasn't had a break through in the 2 years since the previous edition was published. However the professor has fished out page and chapter references that are unique to this book and made test questions for them, so that we have to have the new printed book.   \nEach week, we have to reflect on what we learned and each week, I spend the time illustrating how frustrating the text is. The only response I've gotten is that \"I can only teach what is in the book\". How is it one professor can use a text they wrote and the other professor is helpless? Also, isn't there some review or verification prior to a text being adopted by a school? Both are full fledged faculty, both are PhDs, both have been at the uni the same amount of time.",

          "text": ">isn't there some kind of review or verification prior to a text being adopted by a school?\n\nIn a word, no. I mean, there may be exceptions out there but at every institution I'm familiar with, professors are able to choose whatever materials they choose without having to run it by anyone. \n\nThe exception to this is if a department decides on a standard text. Even then, it's not really a verification process as much as it is a bunch of academics deciding which text to use. This typically happens in large departments where the same course might be taught by multiple people concurrently, and it's a way of standardising the content; you don't want there to be a huge difference in knowledge between two sections of the same course when it comes to subsequent courses. You need to ensure that everyone is learning the same thing. \n\nThis might be the case for you. Your first course is obviously that particular professor's course: they clearly teach it regularly and have created their own materials. They have the freedom to choose what they want to teach and how they want to handle it. \n\nWith your second course, if this is a large course with multiple sections, I'd say the fact the professor has expressed they cannot diverge from the book is likely the result of the department setting a standard and them not being able to go against it. There may be internal politics at play as well (sometimes we really really hate the textbook for big or pre-req courses and the department won't less us change them.) That might be why you received the response of \"I can only teach what's in the book\" as opposed to trying to defend the book itself.",

Instead of an academic master thesis I had the choice of doing an internship and write a short applied master thesis: general company description + (2-5k words) on a topic related to my internship. The company I'm working at does translations/data annotation/ natural language processing and plain data gathering + sales. What would be a not so convoluted research topic to write about in the thesis related to finance/economics? Something I would be able to use some form of regression in Stata for example. Thank you!",

      "text": "So long story short, I'm a current studying biomedical sciences at a Canadian university (University A), and I ended up posting some questions on Chegg last year. I can't get them removed, but haven't been caught yet. I was under a lot of stress mental health wise with online school, but what I did was still wrong and I really regret it. But I guess I got what I deserved and failed the course anyways.\r  \n\r  \nThe policy at my school is that if I get a transcript notation, it is erased 4 years after the offense or 1 year after graduation.\r  \n\r  \nI'm also thinking of switching out to a community college to do a technician's diploma and maybe coming back to finish my undergrad somewhere else (University B) in maybe 4 years because I'm interested in grad school, but I know the technician's diploma will help me with making some money NOW to pay off my loans.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I'm worried about now is this coming back to haunt me in 5-6 years if they go hunting for old assignment questions and I have finished undergrad at University B, leaving me with a black mark on my transcript for 4 years and unable to apply for grad school.\r  \n\r  \nI think it might just be the smart decision from a long-term perspective to finish up now so that even if I get hit with a transcript notation, it will only last for 1 year after I graduate. Also, after dropping out of University A, would they even bother to give me an academic offense? And even if they did, wouldn't it just be automatically erased according to the policy?\r  \n\r  \nAlternatively, I would like to just own up and confess to the prof about this even though it's been a while and while this may lead to the black mark, this would help me a lot with the guilt I'm experiencing and leave less uncertainty in the future for me long term and maybe this is the way to go.",

      "text": "Debating between two Master's degrees: foreign language teaching or literature?\n\n* **Personal information:** Literature undergrad, European, Spanish native, not living in Europe but in the country of my S.O.\n* **Want to work in the following fields:** Literature, linguistics.\n* **Want to work in (more specifically):** Literature teaching, language teaching AND translation. Maybe academia depending on what I stumble upon during my academic and professional life.\n* **Proficient in**: Spanish, English, French.\n* **Other future plans:** I want to study a second Master's degree in ''Asian literature'' (it's something quite specific and I would study it in the country's language).\n\nNow, for my first Master's, I'm contemplating these options:\n\n* **Spanish as a foreign language**\n\n1. Pros: I want to live in different countries for some time and this one could be more useful for this purpose. Slightly shorter that the second option.\n2. Cons: Not very useful if I live in a Spanish-speaking country.\n\n* **Literature** (I would probably choose comparative literature).\n\n1. Pros: More useful if I live in a Spanish-speaking country (which might be the case for the majority of my life, but that's uncertain).\n2. Cons: Teaching in different countries might be harder. Slightly longer than the former option.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n* **Literature + Spanish as a foreign language + ''Asian literature''** = My Master's degrees would not be very useful in South America, where almost all immigrants speak Spanish and the specific Asian literature I want to pursue is not taught anywhere. The second Master's degree is, nevertheless, related to the literature I want to translate and could be quite useful in Europe, where I could become a professor in Cultural Studies (I know that becoming a professor is not that easy).\n* **Literature + Comparative literature + ''Asian literature''** = Even though the three would be literature degrees, it makes sense because literature can be a wide subject and my degree is completely unrelated to the second Master's I want to pursue. More useful in SA but less useful if I want to teach in a non-Spanish speaking country.\n\nI'm also accepting different alternatives!",

          "text": "I think you need to clarify your goals a little bit, and that will help you decide what to do. Because, perhaps somewhat unfortunately, choosing a master's will be choosing one of these paths.\n\nIf you want to go into academia, your master's degree(s) will, ultimately, be somewhat irrelevant, as your PhD will be the only thing of relevance. Indeed, having multiple master's might even be a hindrance to that path, as it isn't uncommon for those who can't get into PhD programs to try and boost their CV with master's programs, as the admissions are generally easier. While obviously not everyone would read your CV this way, it should be something you consider - especially if you go the second, exclusively literature route.\n\nIf you want to work in linguistics you will need a linguistics degree of some kind. If you want to teach at the university level, if you want to work for corporations like Google or Facebook as a linguist, a base requirement is that you have some kind of linguistics degree. \n\nBut, when it comes to your other potential career interest, I think you do need to narrow things down a bit further. For example, if you want to teach Spanish at the university level, your PhD will be of more importance than the master's, and you could conceivably teach Spanish in a Spanish department without a language-teaching specific degree, depending on where in the world you are. But, if you want to teach at say, the secondary school level, or you want to work for private schools or language institutions, a language-teaching degree would be more useful than a literature degree, as those types of jobs are less likely to accept a literature degree.\n\nAnd sort of vice-versa applies for literature. If you're looking at academia, if you end up in a language department you'd likely be teaching a combination of language/literature regardless (with the caveat that I'm sure this can vary by institution, it's just how our language departments run.) However if you want to work in private schools, secondary schools, then you'd need the literature degree. A literature degree does also have a little bit more versatility on the job market, as there's some more \"soft skills\" associated with lit than with teaching. \n\nFor translation it again depends on what you want to do. Corporations might be fine with just a fluency in Spanish, but jobs like translating for governmental purposes, or live interpretation events etc. tend to require some kind of translation qualification. I'm not sure what exists for Spanish, I know other languages do have \"translation of [target language]\" specific master's, or subsequent examinations and certifications that can be obtained, so if that's a route you're interested in, those are likely things you should look more into. \n\nSo really I think some introspection and focus is needed. I know it's difficult, but it will help you make up your mind if you can figure out what it is the end-goal is, then you can start working out how to get there.",

      "text": "Tldr; Should I quit my current undergrad research lab and look for another lab to participate in?\n\nI\u2019m currently a junior majoring in biology. I have been doing research in a behavioral neuroscience lab since last summer. It is a small lab with a PI, one research coordinator, one research technician, one phD and a postdoc. While they are all nice people who are very passionate about the subject, I am wondering if I should quit for a couple reasons and wanted some outside opinion/advice. I am not sure if this is usual but the PI is never at the lab. I have only met him about four times during half a year although he attends all the lab meetings. The research coordinator is the main leader. He is very old and not surprisingly is retiring soon. I and all the other lab members just heard about this and this makes things unclear about how things will go moving forward and I just kinda wish the PI was more present  so I could\u2019ve learned the most I could from the lab. Anyhow, it is unsure when the exact date of his retirement would be and I\u2019m worried this might cause the lab slowing down or even shutting down if he retires before I graduate. Another issue is that I am not sure if I am that interested in the subject. It is more data analysis and mathematics heavy than I thought it\u2019d be(although I\u2019m not sure if most biological researches are this way-I have no basis of comparison to make). I am not sure if this is because I just don\u2019t know enough about the matter to be interested in it or if it is a genuine disinterest. I have made an effort to learn more about it but it is taking quite some time as the subject is very specific and the lab members have been very busy. \n\nI have found a couple other labs that seemed interesting but I\u2019m just not sure whether to quit my current lab or not yet. Sorry for all the messy rambling I hope someone can help.",
