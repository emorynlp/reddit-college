  "text": "I've been told that a lot of papers are being denied publishing because people are afraid of upsetting others. Is this true? If it is, are you concerned? Why or why do you not think this is a good thing ultimately?",

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary data and just saying no is not data.",

That said, controversial doesn't extend to the conspiracy theory type claims out there with no evidence whatsoever. The methods, logic, and analyses need to be defensible even if the result is controversial.",

In those instances it may be decided that the research shouldn't be published or not published in full. \n\nResearch doesn't not get published because it's controversial or might offend people, that's just what idiots on facebook claim to justify why there's no published evidence to support their conspiracy theory. Research is withheld from publication to prevent harm, not to prevent offence.",

In psychology new ideas that go against the grain by someone who isn't a field leader get rejected for controversy all the time",
