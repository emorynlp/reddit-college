  "text": "Hello people, \n\nBackground: I have been told by several people that I am fairly good at conveying my message in conversations; I had 4-5 scientific presentations with no hiccups and I have given countless oral exams during my undergraduate (almost all of my classes had an oral section). So to put it simply, I am good with talking. \n\nQuestion: I started searching for postdoc positions in another country. So far I had a couple of interviews that ask vague questions and expect concrete answers. For example, I get asked how do I plan to publish X papers in Y years in high impact factor journals. I give a general answer then I ask for details about ongoing projects or available instruments etc. so I can suggest something more concrete. Then the interviewer says something like \"we will talk about specific projects latter\". This is just an example, but there have been other questions which I find weird and I am thinking maybe I am not used to job interviews. My PhD interview was a formality because I was working as an undergraduate researcher for 4 years at the same lab, so the only real \"job interview\"  I ever had was  my university entrance exam when I was 17.5 years old. Is there any resource (book/video etc.) that can give me some suggestions on how to maneuver an interview in academia? \n\nP.S. I am applying for neuroscience in Germany/Switzerland if that helps!\n\nThanks!",
