Why on earth would you want to choose the second one?",

In many, you may not get a stipend but you are freely able to get paid for teaching classes at the university - which you'd be doing to justify your stipend in the US anyway - or do something else for money, if you prefer. This is typically how it goes in non-lab disciplines. It's in the US that we have this system where you have to be funded because otherwise it's a financially ruinous endeavor, and where the university basically uses that funding to rule your professional life as long as you are with them, leaving you with no flexibility. For many people past the age of 22, for that reason, it's more feasible to get a PhD in countries that don't fund PhDs, since then they don't also have to quit their job and teach snotty undegrads for poverty wages for the privilege.",
