My main identity and my academic background is in my country of citizenship, and some of my answers likely reflect that background. If I say I was in the military before starting my studies it is going to be understood very differently if I flag myself with USA compared to if I flag myself with Finland. I would have to switch flags for every other answer or question I type.\n\nThis doesn't even consider the case when someone moves to a different country, changes their flair, and then suddenly all of their old answers (which now have a mismatching flair) suddenly become very confusing.\n\nI'm all for country flag flairs but they should not be used as the sole means to specify the context for a question. This should be something explicitly stated in the question.",

I'm currently based in Ireland and many of our practices are similar to that of the UK. If someone asks a UK specific question, I can often answer. The same could also be said for the US and Canada, where there is a ton of overlap. A great answer about the US tenure process shouldn't be dismissed just because it was given by someone with a Canadian flair, as an example. \n\nI'm in full agreement that country should be stated in the question, but that flags might be less helpful.",

Yet we are all expected to know the US terms and be able to compare them with whatever we use. Heck, many of us even start our posts with \"Non-American here\" by way of apology.\n\nHowever, many situations encountered are similar, and many academics like or would like to work internationally, so a split probably wouldn't work. I'm all for specifying countries or adding flairs if that can help us straighten things out a little, and I'd certainly welcome a sidebar with definitions and translations of our local terminologies.",

There are a lot of questions like \"how do I write this\", \"how do not cite this\", \"how do I apply for this\" or \"how do we fix order of authors\". However all these questions can vary strongly on the field. And even in the general field there can be differences, a high energy physicist might just publish authors (all 200 of them) alphabetically, while a fluid physicist does that differently.\n\nField is already much better than country though, but flares can be very general, e.g. \"STEM\" is really broad.",
