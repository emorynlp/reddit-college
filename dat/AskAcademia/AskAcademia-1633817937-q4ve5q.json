  "text": "I was thinking back to a conversation I had a few years ago. I'd looked up a favorite undergrad professor and saw that, twenty years later, she was still AWT and hadn't published anything since the 1990s. I asked a colleague who knew her why that was, and he said \"All she ever wanted was to teach and advise. She did what she needed to get tenure and then, well, taught and advised. She teaches two or three subjects every semester and is totally happy with that.\"\n\nBut that's still the only time I've heard of someone doing that, and I'm curious if it's just because my knowledge is limited to the culture of one institution.",

I pointed out that he would be expected to do more as full than as associate. He asked what could anybody do about it since he's tenured. I reminded him that our system has merit raises only (when we manage to get raises!) and that a faculty member who operates at an associate level when full wouldn't get the same raise as s/he would have as an associate.

One is the prof who made a rationale choice and doesn't want to do the work, such as the research or committee service required.

Then there are those that want to be full but just can't or don't. Some of them got lazy and some of them really did work hard, but just tried and failed. They are not happy being AWT and are often resentful of those who are full. Some people in the second category try to convince themselves and others they are in the first, but their resentment and unhappiness shines through.\n\nWhat is interesting is that some full profs make the assumption that all people who have been AWT for some time are in the second category, whereas many are in the first and really are AWT by choice. There are many profs who decided to be AWT as it fits their goals better than the push to full and it really annoys me to see full profs be jerks to them. It also sucks when AWT profs who wish they had made it to full are jerks to full profs. Everybody be nice!",
