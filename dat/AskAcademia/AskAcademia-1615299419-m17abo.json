  "text": "I was recently accepted to a PhD program with funding. It's a 60% paycut from my current, secure job. I have come to hate this job, though, and would very much like the opportunity to grow in this PhD program. Post-PhD should lead to a modest pay increase with much more up upside. This job I have now is the only job I could possibly have in this part of the state, so if things went south, I would almost certainly have to move. Although, I have 3 years guaranteed funding with the PhD, and if I couldn't find a job somewhere after that, something is seriously wrong. Jumping off the deep end like this is terrifying. Has anyone done it? How'd it go? Any advice? I just turned 34, no kids.",

You\u2019re getting paid just less money so you will have to adjust your lifestyle if you dont want to use savings. If you do research well on what jobs to target post phd and then during your phd build your resume into the perfect candidate you should get a job. Ive yet to know someone who didnt get a job",

The admin there was awful and the environment was toxic, however, and she had come to loathe working there.\n\nShe basically came to me and said she had to quit or start to hate everything in her life. She shopped around for full-time teaching spots and ended up with a few good prospects; the one she took (where we now are) is at a tiny university in a tiny town, deep-rural in our Southern state. We moved three hours away for it, so I had to change jobs, too.\n\nHer spot is tenure-track; she has her M.A. and will enroll in and complete her PhD as a condition of her long-term employment here. (She\u2019ll be commuting long range/distance learning.)\n\nOur state median household income was about 59K at the time; she left a job making just above that to take a job making 40K: about a 33% cut in gross pay. (My job switch as a result of the move took a comparable cut in pay.)\n\nWe are definitely more stressed financially, less ahead on mortgage equity, debt payoffs, etc. Even after her PhD, my wife will make 10K less than she did at her old toxic job.\n\nI would not change her/our decision to move, for any amount of money. She\u2019s worlds happier and more fulfilled.",

I also made the contacts that helped me land my current job. \n\nIt was financially tough at points to fit an \"adult\" life with mortgage etc. into the stipend I was paid during my PhD.

I finished writing up my thesis while in the first year of my new job which was HARD but possible. \n\nI like to think that investing in yourself now in terms of that pay cut will make you more valuable in the long term to any employer, and will give you significantly more options for the future.",

                          "text": "I also agree with the previous posters that my experience is outside the norm in terms of my friends on the PhD program (most who are pursuing academic careers). I can only give you my experience, which was that it has been a positive move for me but that money was never my focus. You should look at the overarching trends as well in this area, as others here have said. \n\nI should probably have caveat my previous post with the fact that I went in to the PhD knowing that it was going to consolidate my previous work experience and allow me to be identified as the expert in a field that I was working in. \n\nI did it because I love research, learning and saw it as a development opportunity. I wasn't expecting to make  financial gains, it will take time for me to catch up on those lost earnings. However, it opened the doors to several alternative opportunities for employment that were not open to me before I did it and that has been the most valuable part for me. I had previously been stuck in a location and job that had no development prospects. I'd definitely rate the PhD as being brilliant for that ability to develop yourself and your skills quickly.\n\nThat said you do have to be strategic about what you do while you're doing the PhD.  I made sure I contributed to and attended industry conferences as well as academic ones as I knew that academic job opportunities in my field are like gold dust and competition is fierce. I knew I needed to maintain and industry presence where possible. I also had to give up some opportunities in favour of others e.g. I didn't undertake teaching during the program as it didn't offer me as much opportunity as my consulting work on the side etc. \n\nI'm also continuing to work alongside universities and to publish now I'm in industry, which should keep my options open if I want to return to academia in the future.\n\nSo ultimately if you are looking for development and access to opportunities I would recommend it. If you're focused on making more money when you finish then there are other things you can do that may cost less and benefit you more such as retraining and reskilling or pivoting your career. Think about what training/reskilling you could buy with the salary you'll be dropping on the PhD and evaluate which works out best for you.",

While I\u2019m still working about the same number of hours as I did before, I find that academia gives me a lot more flexibility about when I do my work. I love being able to wake up earlier to get things done and then have my afternoons free. Doing this has meant that I work more on weekends than I used to, but I usually have more time during the week to do things like grocery shop, cook, and work out so I think my general health and quality of life has improved. I also think I have a healthier work/life balance than my friends that went directly into a PhD program. This is in part due to having experience setting boundaries etc. at my old job, but I think it\u2019s also my attitude about salary- I figure I\u2019m not getting paid enough to work long hours 7 days a week! \n\nDisclaimer, though: My spouse makes a high salary and therefore we are able to have a very similar quality of life than we did when I was at my old job. We are certainly saving less and having to be more frugal about going out to dinner and buying things for our house but for the most part we haven\u2019t had to make major sacrifices due to finances. I would probably feel differently if I had to move to a smaller place or make other major life changes.",

I would not recommend dislike of one job as rationale for a phd.\n\n\n- Make sure you factor in what you would lose from annual raises, retirement benefits, healthcare, and such.  On the other hand, PhDs often forget about social programs they are eligible for. \n\n\n- There is never a guarantee that there will be an increase in income after the PhD, or that if there is, it will make up for the income lost.  I\u2019m not saying that to be negative, just be realistic.  Many people make exactly $0 more or make less.  PhDs are kind of common.  So don\u2019t even factor the potential increase in salary post-phd. The phd alone has to be worth the money lost and retirement benefits lost, even if you make less after.  \n\n\n\n- I don't suggest a phd to anyone who isn't quite sure.  If you know - great!  If this is your passion - if you just **need** to look into \u2018existential dread among mice-robot cyborgs with genetic knockout for autoimmune disorders using machine learning\u2019 - then do it.  If not - look into other solutions first.

      "text": "Yes. 29 years old, no SO/kids, but with a mortgage on my condo - left my clinical research job in December to start environmental health PhD studies full time which amounted to about a 70% paycut. Hard to evaluate it long term at the moment as I'm only in my first semester but I moved from a job/career track I was also coming to hate to a field I am interested and engaged in whole heartedly. Helps that my current field is very prominent right now as it's directly related to the origins of the pandemic, so I kind of feel special and relevant when doing it at the moment which helps to be such a stark contrast to languishing in my old position. So, whether that excitement factor would be the case with you, I couldn't say.\n\nMoney-wise, it hasn't been great to see my account drop as much as it has but its manageable and definitely worth it at this point. One thing I would say - if theres money you want to spend or credit you want to get on your current salary - do it now. I tried to refinance after I went back to school which would have saved me a couple hundred a month and they denied me based on my income being too low. Refi-ing 6 months ago when I was in my job wouldn't have been an issue. \n\nOverall I'd recommend it, get to build up some savings in the interim years and don't have to live purely on ramen during grad school, plus the maturity aspect is quite noticeable from people who went straight into PhDs and honestly gives you a leg up just in your general mindset and approach. It's been my experience that I (and other older students) approach professors/advisors/others with a \"we're colleagues\" kind of approach, vs. fresh out of undergrads who very much still have a hierarchical \"student-teacher\" kind of working relationship. \n\nHappy to answer other specific questions you might have.

Also, frankly, I got used to a middle class lifestyle in an expensive area, and it's pretty frustrating to live with roommates, constantly watch my expenses, forego vacations and house purchases while all my non-academic friends are doing those things. It's one thing when you're 25 and everyone is just getting started; it's a little tougher in your 30s. \n\nAs I said, though, I'm very glad I did it.

      "text": "Late to the party, but I want to add something that others may have missed: it is important to consider the location/cost of living around your sponsoring institution and whether or not you're excited to live there. (Obviously your passion/commitment for the subject matter is critical as well but others have mentioned this)\n\nI personally quit a well-paid entry level job in biotech to pursue a masters and PhD in Norway because I was really, really excited to live there. I lived off my savings for two years during the masters (lots ramen and root vegetables), but i couldn't have been happier. I learned to cook for myself every day, ate healthier, traveled and hiked constantly, pursued side hobbies and met many interesting people. Definitely worth the cut in \"expected lifetime earnings\"... I wouldn't care if i came back to the states and ended up with the same job that I left or worse (although now my PhD stipend pays more than my old job... And like, free healthcare) \n\nOn the flip side, a Norwegian colleague of mine took a post-doc position in San Francisco and has been strongly considering quitting and moving back to Norway because she can barely afford rent + basic social activities (although there hasn't been much of that at the moment). She is managing and learned to budget better, but it was a struggle for her to stay in a city that she genuinely loves because the compensation didn't match her expectations of cost-of-living. \n\nMoral of the story: do some homework on the city you'll be living in. What activities do people do there? Are there cool bars/nightlife around? Are there any nice destinations for weekend trips? These things will keep you sane no matter the stress levels you encounter from your work or budgetary limitations. What is rent like? Browse craiglist for apartments. If it's a good fit, you'll find that this \"homework\" is actually getting you excited about moving there, and that it may or may not be as economically challenging as you originally thought.\n\nAlso for those that may be reading this and considering applying for grad school, please consider the European route. Typically the masters programs are free (or almost free) tuition but you must pay for living expenses... Yet rent is cheaper than most cities in the US (+lots of student discounts) and if you cut luxuries like fancy soap/groceries and new outfits you can live comfortably on very little until you can land a paid researcher or PhD position. Definitely worth taking a detour from the typical \"start saving for retirement when you turn 18\" mindset in the US. My two cents.",

      "text": "Ten years ago I left my super cush job to pursue a PhD. My job was pretty boring once you learned it but they paid you a hefty salary (at least for 22yo me) to do it. Fast forward to now, I'm doing R&D for disruptive technologies in Silicon Valley and loving every minute of it. My honest advice: if it's a topic you truly are passionate about ***absolutely go for it***. Your future self will thank you.\n\nGoing from work back to academia does have it's own special challenges. I do have a few pieces of advice I wish someone had told me:\n\n1. *You will probably need to (at least initially) study harder than the straight-to-grad-school students.* For me, being removed from calculus for 3 years was enough for me to forget almost everything. So my first year I had to put in 2x the work of my classmates to catch up. But it paid off because the fundamentals were fresh in my mind when moving on to more advanced topics.\n2. *Don't discount your real world world experience.* You having worked a grown-up job you were exposed to many things that aren't commonplace in academia. Speak up (humbly) if you see your research group/classmates doing things that aren't in line with how the real world works. This applies to everything from presentations to running an experiment.\n3. *Squeeze every drop out of it.* This really is a chance for you to become an expert in a specific branch of study. If you take that to heart you\n4. *Take REALLY GOOD notes!* I find myself constantly going to my notes from grad school for refreshers on certain topics. I thank my past self for when I took good ones!\n\nHope this helps! Best wishes on your journey! :)",

      "text": "On the job satisfaction front, whether or not you are going to enjoy academia will depend upon your preference for teaching vs research and your capacity to endure whatever part of it you don\u2019t like (incompetent admin, peacocking faculty, frustrating student behavior, useless research, etc).  There are different mixes of teaching/research out there and while you may not be able to pick where you live you can probably (field dependent) find a job that suits your preference mix.\n\nOn the financial front, unless you are top tier and survive tenure track, you are unlikely to make more money in academia than industry.  But hey maybe you write a book that Oprah likes, right?\n\nOn the stress front, it will vary based upon what type of position you take.  Some may be lots and lots of research hours, some may be too high of a teaching load.  Me personally I have found a nice position that does not pay well but has a net teaching/service/research load that allows for a low stress lifestyle.  I do have busy weeks but nowadays a busy week is 50-60 hours not 80-100.  I do have frustrations with admin but I am figuring out how to minimize those effects simply by staying off their radar.  I have some small issues with some fellow faculty but again those are mostly dodgeable.\n\nBottom line I think choosing to pursue the phd and the \u201cacademy\u201d is like anything - you are unlikely to know for sure until you jump in, a lot of it is what you make of it, and it is unlikely that strangers on the internet will be able to give you advice that is good for your unique personality and preferences.\n\nPS.  I forgot to answer your question!  I left 6+ figure job and now make mid 5 figures.  Don\u2019t regret it one bit.",

      "text": "So glad someone asked this question, I am in a similar position. Dropped out of a PhD program with a MS degree about 4 years ago and have been working in industry and now government. This is a permanent state job with all the benefits. \nNow I plan to go get my PhD again. I\u2019ll be 31-32 when I start. I\u2019m doing this because I miss research very badly and I know that\u2019s what I want to do. I feel like I am not doing something that is important to me and am often bored out of my mind or stressed over things I feel are not worth it. Also, to get a more senior level position even in industry or government,  I would need a PhD. The pay in academia is not great, I know. But I think I would rather be doing something I am passionate about and I was okay with the graduate student life earlier and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that huge a deal, especially if I am living with a partner. \nIt may be true that even with a higher salary post PhD you may not make up for the loss in earnings, especially if you\u2019re in a field where you tend to spend several more years as a postdoc. That\u2019s something you should consider too. \nHowever, for me this experience in industry has been extremely valuable in terms of experience and contacts, which could help me in the long term if I do want to go back to industry, even though as of now I see myself going down the academia route.",
