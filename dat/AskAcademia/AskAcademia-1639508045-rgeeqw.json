  "title:": "Is It Okay to Email Researchers Using Similar Methods to Yours for Advice?",
  "text": "I'm in a STEM graduate program and I'm currently using a method my PI is not familiar at all, but he advised to reach out to other professors at my university to ask to set up a short meeting for further advice on using the method and to briefly discuss some of my data, to see if they could provide insight. I did find a few researchers at my university who might be good to contact, though I have never met them (though for one researcher, I did a summer undergraduate project with their colleague). Is this okay for a graduate student to cold email other researchers? Are most open to this?",

But what we'd usually do in situations like the one described by OP is organize a small workshop and invite 2-4 people doing the stuff we want to learn about. The guests arrive in the early afternoon, we give/hear some talks and have good discussions, continue more casually over dinner at a nice restaurant, and then they can return home the following day (or may decide to stay the weekend in town). We pay for travel, dinner, and the hotel, and try to communicate in our invitations that everything is quite low-stakes.",
