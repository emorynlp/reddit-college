  "title:": "Is It Okay to Email Researchers Using Similar Methods to Yours for Advice?",
  "text": "I'm in a STEM graduate program and I'm currently using a method my PI is not familiar at all, but he advised to reach out to other professors at my university to ask to set up a short meeting for further advice on using the method and to briefly discuss some of my data, to see if they could provide insight. I did find a few researchers at my university who might be good to contact, though I have never met them (though for one researcher, I did a summer undergraduate project with their colleague). Is this okay for a graduate student to cold email other researchers? Are most open to this?",
