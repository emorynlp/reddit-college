  "text": "**Edits since yesterday's posting:** Thanks all for weighing in on this. I am shocked by how much attention this got. I can't respond directly to each comment but have read through most of them - I'm going to write another post that addresses some of the discussion points brought up in the comments and will link that here when it's up.\n\nThank you all for your support, and insightful counterpoints. \n\n---\n\nThis is my second year on the job hunt. I\u2019m writing this because I wish I could go back in time and not do the PhD. It of course wasn\u2019t a complete waste of time - I learned a lot about my sub field, but I could be living a much better life right now in terms of income, autonomy, etc. if I had pursued virtually any other path. **I\u2019m writing this for those that are currently looking at offers for grad school, you need to take a long hard look at the facts before accepting an offer, even if its a good one. I\u2019m trying to write information I wish I had when I was considering PhD offers. This is more geared towards Humanities/Arts folks, I don\u2019t know much about the job situation in STEM fields.**\n\n## My Situation\n\nHere\u2019s a quick bio, all true, but anonymized somewhat for obvious reasons.\n\n* ABD since January 2018, diss finished Fall 2018, defense set for Spring 2019\n\n* Degree in a Humanities/Arts discipline (can\u2019t be more specific)\n\n* On the market since ABD\n\n* PhD at prestigious R1 university, a \u201cpublic ivy\u201d, not a CHYMPS school though.\n\n* Fully funded, tuition, stipend, insurance, etc. full package\n\n* Sexy, modern dissertation topic, in vogue right now\n\n* Attendance at all major conferences in field\n\n* Solo-author publications in my own field, as well as two huge organizations that are tangentially related.\n\n* Maxed out grant funding from all available in-house sources every year of degree work\n\n* Teaching experience with every year of degree, including a course I developed.\n\n* Read \u201cThe Professor is In\u201d early on and developed the pedigree and application packet Karen suggests in the book.\n\n## Application Season 1\nThe day after I passed my comps, I started applying to positions. This was in January 2018, so it was late for a lot of deadlines. As a result I only completed about 30 applications, split fairly equally between R1, community college, and other institutions. I got one Skype interview and was not summoned for the on-campus interview. Not a big deal I thought, I was just ABD, no defense scheduled, and late to the application season. Better luck next year.\n\n## Application Season 2\nWith the dissertation finished, and a defense scheduled, I hit the job market again around August 2018. To date since then I have banged out 113 applications (kept track in a spreadsheet this time), split between R1, CC, other universities, and industry jobs, this time with a heavy weighting towards R1 and CC jobs. \n\nIt\u2019s nearing March now and the results have been dismal. Here are the outcomes:\n\n* 3 rejections from college jobs\n\n* 29 rejections from industry jobs\n\n* 1 \u201cpostponed search\u201d (I have a friend that is a Master\u2019s student in that department, apparently this is an inside hire, but their internal candidate needed another year to finish the PhD)\n\n* Radio silence on the rest of them\n\nThe outcome is dismal. Short of going to an Ivy League school, I\u2019m reasonably certain that there is very little I could have done to improve my chances on the market compared to what I actually did. I networked well, I worked my ass off, and despite personal connections, and a great pedigree, I can\u2019t land a gig in academia. \n\nIt\u2019s also proving difficult to get a gig outside of academia. I\u2019m extremely overqualified for a lot of the positions I\u2019m applying for but the PhD is this sort of \u201cblack mark\u201d to those outside of academia.\n\n## Rebuttals\nAt this point a number of loud voices in this sub will probably stop reading and comment about how \u201ca PhD has no guarantee of a job\u201d which is utter nonsense I see parroted over and over again here and other places. It\u2019s a well known fact that academics tend to over-rationalize things. \u201cA PhD has no guarantee of a job\u201d is something that is oft-repeated to make those who have struck out on the job market feel less disappointed - i.e. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t undertake the most stressful 5/6/7 years of my life to get a job! I just love knowledge, you know, because it keeps a roof over my head and feeds my family.\u201d Please reconsider your actual motivations for the PhD. For me, I love the research, I had a lot of fun doing it, but I also had the **reasonable expectation** that I would land some kind of teaching job (even non-prestigious, outside of R1 or important SLAC) after completing this credential that less than 1% of the population holds. *Call me crazy...*\n\n## Conclusions/Advice for Those Considering a PhD\nIf you are considering doing a PhD in an Arts/Humanities discipline with the hopes of getting a job - don\u2019t. You\u2019d be much better off working for a company, doing a startup, or even working a menial job to pay bills while working on your craft outside of your day job. \n\nThe only reason anyone should pursue a PhD is for fun. That\u2019s it. If you have a trust fund to support yourself, or a job at daddy\u2019s company to fall back on after completing the degree, go for it. This is a game for the rich, outside of that it\u2019s a giant pyramid scheme. \n\n**TLDR:** Unless you\u2019re at the top of your class, with good connections at an Ivy League school, you are no different than a young boy born in the projects hoping to join the NBA. Academia is a pyramid scheme. The citizenry is waking up to the fact that all of the information taught at college is available free on the web. College employment is not in a recession, it is decreasing as the paradigm falls out of favor.\n\n",

      "text": "\u201cWe enrolled in PhD programs, law school, med school, architecture school, education master\u2019s programs, MBAs. It wasn\u2019t because we were hungry for more knowledge. It was because we were hungry for secure, middle-class jobs \u2014 and had been told, correctly or not, that those jobs were available only through grad school ... \n\nIn the past, pursuing a PhD was a generally debt-free endeavor: Academics worked their way toward their degree while working as teaching assistants, which paid them cost of living and remitted the cost of tuition.\n\nThat model began to shift in 1980s, particularly at public universities forced to compensate for state budget cuts. Teaching assistant labor was far cheaper than paying for a tenured professor, so the universities didn\u2019t just keep PhD programs, but expanded them, even with dwindling funds to adequately pay those students. Still, thousands of PhD students clung to the idea of a tenure-track professorship. And the tighter the academic market became, the harder we worked. We didn\u2019t try to break the system, since that\u2019s not how we\u2019d been raised. We tried to win it.\n\nI never thought the system was equitable. I knew it was winnable for only a small few. I just believed I could continue to optimize myself to become one of them.\u201d\n\nThis is from an opinion piece from Buzzfeed News called [\u201cHow Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,\u201d](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjd__uoqtrgAhUM9YMKHbukBlgQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeednews.com%2Farticle%2Fannehelenpetersen%2Fmillennials-burnout-generation-debt-work&psig=AOvVaw0wdEpS14fwfyd9YUOLfg-A&ust=1551302508577550) and I now find myself talking about it to everyone. \n\nThe PhD market is oversaturated because it\u2019s the only way big universities can afford to teach everyone, while knowing full well most students won\u2019t get a tenure-track job because too many people graduate from PhD programs (while the colleges continue to use grad student labor instead of hiring more faculty). Meanwhile, we were brought up with this idea that if you just work harder, you\u2019ll succeed, which has created a bunch of graduate students and post-docs who have convinced themselves that their lack of career prospects is their own moral failing and not the failing of a system that churns out more graduates than the market could ever handle.",

People are \"optimised from birth\". if anything the complete opposite is true; people are geared towards efficiency and will reduce their effort if they dont have to compromise too much on the outcome. We were sold fantasies and we willingly accepted the seduction because it was convenient for us and told us what we wanted to hear. It would have been more effort to actually assess the situation and decide whether it was realistic or not. Now people are outraged because they got burned and want someone else to fix the problem. If the system is broken then you cant break it any more. why not start setting up online universities that undercut existing models? setup local study groups at public libraries. establish your own scholarly societies, journals and seminars. you may not get paid for it as much as you hope but youre broke anyways. you may not get recognition for the courses you run but it wouldnt be any less rewarding, and who knows what might emerge from that action?",

It looks like the post-recession trend in History is reflected in other Humanities disciplines [source](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/08/28/more-humanities-phds-are-awarded-job-openings-are-disappearing). That sucks, but not too surprising. \n\nNot that the ratio of open positions to PhDs granted was healthy before the recession. At any rate, the academic job market hasn't been a sure thing for decades, if it ever was. One of the problems is nobody wants to hear that (and others try to shut down those that are simple telling the truth about the market).\n\nAny person that entered grad school *after* 2008 must either have been in a state of denial about the market - or nobody was allowed to tell them the truth about it. And at this point, many of those graduating *did* enter after 2008. Sure, their departments should have told them what the market was like, but if they don't find out until the first time they decide take a run at it, that's really their own mistake.\n\nIn the early 2000s, one couldn't perform the simplest of searches about graduate school and academic jobs without finding doom and gloom stories - they are even easier to find now. The problem is, people aged 22-25 aren't that great at risk assessment.",

My particular field has some resiliency. I'm also not as concerned about the prospect of finding a job outside academia - my language and research skills are applicable in a variety of non-academic industries.\n\nMy disappointment stems from the fact that very few of my mentors within academia ever talked about it. I was surrounded by R1 graduates and Ivy Leaguers. My undergraduate advisor thought I was one of his best students and pushed me towards a Ph.D. program, and my mentors/parents assumed (like I did!) a Ph.D. was a good investment. The department in my R1 grad school failed to really address the problem, or even talk about it to any extent, until the last few years of my doctorate. I learned far, far more about the problem through conference travel and via other grad students. Even in the last year of my doctorate, when I wanted to talk with my committee about moving into teaching-focused jobs, community colleges, or non-academic work, I still received the same advice: your work is innovative and important for our field, you should keep working on it, and you should endeavor to find a tenure-track job. After I defended my dissertation, my advisor laid out a timeline for what I should do over the next few years to further my career, assuming I would get a very competitive postdoc and a tenure-track job. If I wanted advice for pursuing anything outside the narrow range of research-focused tenure-track job prospects, I could not turn to my committee.\n\nMy experience illuminates one of the facets of frustration many Ph.Ds experience. Was it my fault for failing to understand the raw numbers and potential? Absolutely. But now, as a visiting professor (contemplating leaving academia), I think it is my duty to inform my undergraduates and colleagues about the realities. People in academia need to be mentors not simply within our own fields, but for general job prospects after graduation. I definitely agree that academia is something of a \"pyramid scheme.\"",

When I was finishing college in the late 1980s there was reasonable evidence that the market was posed to tick up; it did not, but the evidence was there. By the time I was in grad school (early 1990s) everyone I knew was telling students *not* to pursue a Ph.D.. Certainly throughout my own career teaching undergrads (the last 25 years or so) I have never encouraged anyone to pursue a Ph.D. with the goal of a traditional academic career, nor has any of my colleagues. You were poorly advised, apparently by people with no sense of the market-- which is odd because it didn't take much even in the mid-1990s to see what was happening all around us. Even the AHA and OAH were holding sessions about the terrible market and what we now call \"alt ac\" careers when I was going to the meetings in the first Clinton administration.",

My situation in the late 1990s was similar, except that the faculty understood the market had changed and were supportive of those of us who wanted careers in teaching-oriented institutions. They couldn't offer a lot of help, but were willing to mobilize their networks, write better LORs, observe teaching, etc. which apparently hadn't been their practice before then.

I asked if any other professors in the department had told them about the difficulty of finding a job, especially in American history (again, all but one of whom haven't been on the market for at least 10 years).

Looks like History didn't, though.\n\nWhat it doesn't show either is that *undergraduate enrollments* in History also plummeted after the recession and have not recovered. The entire field is in crisis as a result. At my school History majors are down about 65% from their peak c. 2010 and we have attrited away half our tenure-track historians in response. The same is true across our athletic conference (true peers) and in our national peer market as well, the only exceptions being at schools that require history as part of gen ed. It's the STEM rah-rah from the media that drives this; after the recession people sought majors with obvious/known career prospects, and the media never report the fact that History majors actually do quite well in terms of securing full-time employment after college (better than Biology at my school, by several points). They likely aren't working as *historians* but that's the point of a liberal arts education in the first place: it prepares you for a range of careers, not a specific career track.",

If the comparison was engineering instead of history, you'd have a $20k difference in median wages for first job after college. That's a life-changing difference for some folks. As a minor point, I know many that would argue that history is a social science rather than a humanities discipline; I'm sure it varies by training. Biology has some focus areas with rather poor employment prospects (conservation biology; ecology - especially without a PhD). Chemistry or chemical engineering has pretty great employment prospects (and compensation); as does computer science, math, etc.\n\nOnce again, given that decline in humanities enrollment, anyone that started a humanities PhD after 2008 ought to have known what they were getting themselves into. A late 20-something or early 30-something who kept their head in the sand about the job market the entire time they were in grad school owns some share of the responsibility for their situation. They should have been told, early and often, what it was like - but if they spent 5-10 years in grad school fully ignorant of the job market - part of that is on them.\n\nAnyway, more generally about the humanities - \nIn the US, the NEH has a yearly budget of $42 million this year. The NSF, $8.1 billion. The NIH, $25.6 billion (which is down from a few years ago).\n\nThe low valuation of the humanities goes well beyond the academy. As educational institutions shift towards the grant model across all fields, without some protection grant-light fields will wither. I don't think many administrations see this as a serious problem.",

The government is run by anti-intellectual fools now (at least half of congress and many entire state legislatures) so it won't come from there. The only thing admins respond to is enrollment numbers, so fields that hope to survive will need to find ways to attract bodies.\n\n&#x200B;",

The youngest member of my committee did her undergrad at Harvard and her grad at Yale and was, looking back on it, totally oblivious to the advantages conferred to her by her Ivy pedigree. \n\nNo one on my committee ever brought up the tight job market. When I brought it up to my advisor - who I only met with once a semester, btw, since she was always busy with her own research or her 29 other advisees (yes, 29), she told me not to worry, I had so many publications, and so much teaching experience, and so many grants, I'd be fine. Other people should worry, yes. But not me. \n\nWhen it came time to do the job search itself, I was on my own. And I soon discovered via TheProfessorIsIn and this subreddit that there was a complex web of unspoken, unwritten rules to the application process that no one had told me. I also discovered that I had unwittingly broken these rules by publishing so much so fast, and on so many topics. I also found out that many of the application materials I had already sent out had broken these rules. \n\nLuckily, I got a job offer in the private sector so I only banged my head against the wall for six months or so. But it was a horrible, stressful, depressing, shitty six months, and my committee was not helpful during this time. I don't think my experience is unique. ",

My graduate department didn't have the slighted idea where its students ended up in the 1990s when I was there, nor did that change in the 2000s. It wasn't until c. 2015 that they actually began systematically tracking all of their students in fact. Back when I was there we had almost 300 graduate students on the books (MA/Ph.D./ABD) and nobody could tell you where half of them were...they weren't taking classes, some were paying tutition, but there was zero effort to track what happened to them when they left. The \\*only\\* data was self-reported job placement that went into a newsletter: \"Debbie Smith is a new assistant professor at South Dakota State Poultry Institute.\" Those who didn't report, didn't take academic jobs, went into other fields, etc. simply fell off the face of the earth as far as the department was concerned, so 100% of the availble data was positive.",

You cannot tout your skills of research and analysis in your chosen field if you can't employ them to make informed decisions about your own life.\n\nI work for an large professional academic association--you know, the ones that put on the those can't-be-missed annual conferences. We're also the keepers of data on academic employment trends. I can tell you without any equivocation that brilliant and incredibly hardworking people are not landing tenure-track jobs. A lot of them pursue non-tenure-track full-time positions (which is where the entirety of higher ed is going), and you need to, *at the very least*, prepare yourself for that route. Realize that these positions do not provide job security and as a result, cannot afford you academic freedom. Be hopeful that you're hired by an institution with a union, and be prepared to use a lot of your free time to fight for access to faculty governance structures, adequate pay, reasonable course loads, and basic benefits. Do not expect much by way of professional development, including conference or research funds. Your #1 job will be to teach and to \"earn\" good student evaluations. Your institution won't care about your research. You have around 3-4 years to be on the tenure-track job market before search committees start to dismiss you out of hand.\n\nThat's, honestly, one of the ideal situations. Many others end up in several part-time positions (aka, adjuncting) while simultaneously trying to pay off student debt, buy a home, start a family, etc. Without financial security, none of that is possible. Adjuncts are, for the most part, treated like garbage by their institutions and the contingent labor situation is, in my opinion, the top and self-perpetuating cause of discredit and disrespect of higher ed among the general public (and among state budget appropriators).  \n\nThen you've got PhDs who end up in secondary teaching or other work. The vast majority of those jobs do not require a PhD, or if they do, it's not in an arts and humanities field. So then the question becomes one of opportunity costs--by the time those PhDs enter the professional workforce, they're competing for jobs against people who have already been working 5-6 years.\n\nI highly suggest you take a gander at the website of the your field's primary academic association (eg, American Historical Association, College Art Association, Association Philosophical Association, etc.)--most produce an annual jobs report, and if they're worth a damn, are directing staff, budget, and resources to contingent faculty representation/advocacy as well as opportunities for PhDs outside academia.",

Seems to me you may not have been fully qualified for R1, and yet so overqualified for CC jobs that they never bothered to consider you since you likely would not take the job.  You should have weighted the middle instead, rather than the Hardest to get and CC, which are not easy- just different expectations.  Second- I'm at a masters university (well, we just moved up to Doctorate, but we're still the same school), and when I get apps from people we think clearly have R1 intentions, I worry that we are wasting our time with them.  When you apply to so many, did you really take the time to customize to the unique aspects of the expectations at all the different levels of academia?  We had an candidate who interviewed for a job we had last semester who mentioned needing a piece of equipment in her start up that was so expensive, we could never provide that. It did not matter how qualified she was after that- we're not going call her back because she did not do her due diligence on the position OR would never accept the job anyway.  She may very well have been under qualified for R1s, yet so tone def that she can't be hired at lower levels either.   You have to make us believe you actually WANT to work with us- not that you'll take if you don't get what you think you deserve.",

For what it's worth, it seems like all the work you've done should be enough for any reasonable person to get a job doing what they love. All of these comments to the tune of \"well you didn't do this\" and \"did you try this?\" remind me of the comments my friend got when she was trying (and failing) to conceive.\n\n\"Oh, you're only having sex when you ovulate? You need to have sex every day. On your head.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're doing IVF *without* taking XYZ fertility-boosting drug? You need to take Procreatron 9000 and imbibe this nanobot solution that will serenade your uterine lining with Marvin Gaye.\"\n\nSo she had sex 37 times a day and became a GnRh android and still couldn't conceive. Because it just wasn't going to happen. So she adopted, and now she's happy--a lot happier than when she was convinced it was her fault, and that she was a broken, insufficient human.\n\nI think you're doing fine, fellow Humanities friend. You're doing enough. \n",

Like, the consequence of being in school k-PhD is that you don't know how anything outside of academia works. It's not just resumes - you don't know what skills employers are looking for, how they prefer for you to demonstrate them, why they are important... The value structure of academia (what makes a good worker, why the business exists, what constitutes success) is very different to almost everything in non-academia. And restructuring your value system and identity in such a fundamental way, at ~30, with little to no guidance is probably very hard. ",

I know folks who left academia at various stages (during program, after program, after postdoc, after TT job) and work happily in industry.\n\nThe job search is less effortful than an academic one, but it still takes some work. Most important is the prep work before you even launch the formal search: the informational interviews, the networking, the learning about different job roles, narrowing down what you want, etc. Then there's tailoring your materials (cover letter and resume).\n\nIf you're partway through your PhD, one thing to consider doing is an internship over the summer (I did one in graduate school - it's doable, but you have to commit!). There are also some summer bridge programs at consulting firms specially designed for PhD students - like Bridge to BCG, which is a 3-day program that rolls into an interview at that firm, for example. Visit your university's career center - more than likely, they actually do serve PhD students who are interested in industry. (Mine was fantastic.) Check out VersatilePhD, which is a resource for PhDs searching out non-academic careers. Join some professional organizations in your local area, if they have local chapters, or join listservs online. When you go to academic conferences, seek out the non-academic panels and find those people to chat with them. (I did this in grad school; 9 times out of 10 they are happy to chat. I also get found at conferences now, which is a nice feeling lol.)",

It sounds like maybe you are not.\n\nFor instance, go to specialised job fairs to network and introduce yourself, make yourself known to industry headhunters, make friends with privious grads who are now in industry, look up people on linkedin in the companies/positions you want to work in and ask them out for an informational coffee. Just as you are probably ready to relocate for an academic job, you should also expect to move for a good industry-based job. \n\nI think some PhD grads have the notion that they are either too good for industry or will be rejected if they tried (even before trying) - I can assure you that is not the case. I worked in management consulting (in a top international firm) before academia and it was full of PhD grads (including many humanities PhD grads especially in law and philosophy/ethics). Many top companies and businesses love to hire PhD grads for their research and writing skills. \n\n",

          "text": ">how could this number be limited, without depriving people of their right to pursue education to their full potential?\n\nThis is superficially an excellent point, but it starts to unravel when you look into it a bit more.\n\nFirst, what right? People have a right to K-12 education, that\u2019s it. They will let you keep at it in high school until you pass, you never fail out definitely.\n\nThat is certainly not true in higher ed. People fail out all the time. Where is their rights?\n\nBut perhaps you\u2019ll point out that you specified \u201cto their full potential\u201d, but even here, people have never had that right. PhD programs reject qualified applicants all the time due to the limited number of spots. Doctorate programs are not fulfilling a mission to educate, they are highly selective training programs meant to form independent researchers.\n\nThey incidentally form people that can work in industry, of course, but this isn\u2019t their function, and they are not particularly well-adapted to the task. If the industry was to have its way in forming its future employees (like it does in a few vocational disciplines), the programs would undoubtedly be wildly different. That PhDs are working in industry is simply a byproduct of their oversupply in the first place. \n\nSo what is to do? Well, the programs are already selective. They could simply become more so. That\u2019s really the only way. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying to restrict it until a spot in a PhD program is a guarantee of a tenure-track position, but there\u2019s a middle ground.\n\nFor vocational schools, such as law schools and medical schools with a single outlet, it\u2019s very easy. You pull the funding from schools that fail to turn out a majority of students who pass the bar/board exams, or fail to get the single job they were formed towards. It\u2019s trickier for PhDs, but something similar could be done, with state schools that reduce funding in departments that churn out a majority of underachievers.\n\nUndoubtedly some departments would have to close, or be relegated to only teaching undergraduate students. And that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, ",

And most of all, you discuss equal rights for outcomes, I discuss equal rights for opportunities. \n\nWhere I live, no, they will not \"keep you in high school until you pass\". You  can be left behind your class three times, and that's it. After that, you're out. Your rights have been given all the chances. I doubt there's an indefinite time one can spend in high school anywhere.\n\nMoving up to higher ed, which is where specialized education starts, you can also be left behind or expelled, if you don't meet your credit requirements, or if you're caught cheating. Of course, this is not a perfect system, and exceptions are made, and some people cheat, and some people fail. Their right was to be there in the first place. To try and make the best of their abilities. PhD programs are, indeed, highly competitive training programs, and the fact that they accept and reject applicants judging their abilities is in no way a contradiction of said applicants' rights. It's their confirmation. The same thing happens everywhere else in the job market, and nowhere else is specialized higher training a guarantee of a job. \n\nPhDs in the Humanities have more chances of working in the industry - as I said previously, depending on the field (I can only speak for my own), there are always private research institutions and grants, and institutions other than research institutes and universities that can absorb PhDs and put their expertise to use. \n\nThis being said, I also advocate for a middle ground between impossible selectivity and an inflation of PhDs that don't contribute to the field. I agree that, all avenues considered, there are not enough jobs to absorb all the specialists that are being trained. And I agree that we could do without many PhD programs (Masters' programs are too many, as well). \n\nI just don't agree that any highly trained, highly specialized individual, PhD, MD or astronaut, can expect to have their choice of dream jobs available just because they jumped through all the hoops. No one else in the job market does. Medical doctors aren't guaranteed a spot in their hospital of choice, no matter how good they are. They still have to compete, and the spots are still too few. You can only have so many chief surgeons. And those who don't get the spot will always be disappointed, and disappointment trickles down the line, as people are forced to accept positions less than their dream job. It happens. You get better. You keep competing, you keep trying to find your place. There are plenty of valuable contributions to the field, especially in Humanities, coming from unaffiliated researchers. If you have something to say, you try and find some ground to say it. \n\nOr maybe it's just me who has a problem with the \"life's not fair\" frame of mind. ",

      "text": "I won't \"call you crazy\" (we've all felt this, and we know the numbers are bad), but I will say: the average for most fields these days is 4-5 years of postdocs before a TT job. Which is to say, if your _expectation_ is that 2 years out of your PhD you will have a TT job, then the expectation is wildly outside of the norm. (I did 4 years of lecturing/postdocs and did get very lucky in getting a TT job, but I recognize that luck was a big part of it. I spent the postdoc time also building up my non-academic/alt-ac networks so that if I decided to give up on academia, I had some likely options.)\n\nThe one thing I recommend to anyone starting a new PhD program is also to make sure you develop transferable skills on top of your field of expertise. That both helps you with your academic search (because being an expert in your field _and_ knowing something else is often a boon), but also gives you more non-academic possibilities. My go-to is to recommend that humanistic/arts people learn to code a bit; not with the idea that you'll be a full-time coder (you're not a CS major for a reason), but because a little bit of coding is presently still a differentiator in the humanities/arts academic work, and can be useful for other fields. \n\nBut you should know first off that a PhD in arts/humanities probably _hurts_ your ability to get a non-academic job by itself. You're overqualified but underexperienced, from the perspective an employer. I think this is very much unappreciated by people (including myself) when they start such programs. An MA or MFA can make you look interesting and educated, a PhD makes you look like some kind of weird monk. It takes a LOT of work to convince a potential employer that you are willing to not be a total pain in the ass, or won't be constantly looking for the way out if you are starting in a role \"below your level of education.\"\n\nI don't ever tell people NOT to get a PhD, but I do tell them to look VERY HARD at the data, the possibilities, the opportunity costs, and so on, and I also tell them to plan VERY REALISTICALLY for the possibility of a non-TT position, because that's what they're likely to end up with. There are many great careers that are not TT academic positions, but if your entire training/etc. is betting on this one very unlikely, very fluky outcome, then you're setting yourself up for a rough possibility.",

It served as a very useful bridge between \"the kind of scholar I was trained to be\" and \"the kind of scholar I wanted to be.\" I came out of it feeling very confidant about the kind of job I'd be happy with, and the kind of scholarly identity I wanted to pursue. And I was able to use the time to explore some other non-academic possibilities too, that could have been good fall-back positions had the job market not worked out.

No one is going to  look at you as lazy for doing a PhD.\n\nIt is simply *not that simple*. I work in industry right now, at a large technology company. I have a PhD. PhDs can absolutely get jobs in industry, but not by treating it this flippantly. Having an employment gap of 5-8 years is absolutely a big deal, and doctoral students or recent PhDs will be asked at the very least to explain the gap - if they even make it to the interview to explain. You simply can't leave it off your resume, because then it becomes a 5-8 year hole. You'd need to explain in your cover letter. This is a skill to be honed that, frankly, most advisers won't be able to teach because they've never worked outside of the academy themselves.\n\nNo one will look at you as *lazy* for having a PhD, but there are all kinds of other assumptions they attach to having a PhD. And point blank, being a doctoral student is not treated the same as having work experience, so a doctoral student needs to be savvy in explaining how their background and skills are transferable. It's very very doable!

I think a common misconception that academics have is that they can step out of academia and into a management position - and to be honest, that assumption is annoying and irritating to hiring managers in the industry. A PhD does confer information and knowledge and skills that are valuable and useful...but management is not one of them. A lab manager position will *not* read as appropriate management experience for a management position in state or federal government, finance, or consulting. A PhD can get a job but for the most part, they should expect to start in a junior position unless it's something that's explicitly directly related to their PhD work (and even then...they *still* sometimes start there).",

              "text": "This is...not true! At all! An *un*qualified person is a *money suck.* Best case scenario, they won't be able to do the job at all, we figure it out relatively quickly (<3 mos) and we'll end up letting them go and re-launching a search. And hiring is really, really expensive. Worst case scenario, we *don't* figure it out quickly enough and they mess up something really expensive, or manage to hide the fact that they are doing no work for months. Then we still end up letting them go eventually and re-launching an expensive search.\n\nEven if you mean a junior vs. senior person, from a training perspective (excluding salary) it's actually cheaper to bring in someone who already knows what they're doing and only needs to adapt to a new company culture than it is to train a junior person from scratch. The junior person isn't very productive at the outset, which means they are getting paid to do far less. Theoretically, the senior person can get in there and start doing work much more quickly. An *un*qualified person is a complete money suck; \n\nAlso, senior =/= closed-minded; that has a lot more to do with the person and their experiences. Senior/\"overqualified\" people don't necessarily struggle with their 'chain of command' or with learning new things.\n\nThere are a couple things:\n\n1) PhDs are not necessarily overqualified. In fact, I think that's probably the biggest problem that newly minted PhDs have, is that they *believe* they are overqualified for jobs when they are...not. Simply holding a doctoral degree doesn't make one qualified, much less *overqualified*, to do anything besides direct work in the field in which one is trained. If you have a PhD in history, for example, you're not \"overqualified\" to be a program manager at a technology company or a development associate at a nonprofit. It certainly doesn't make one automatically qualified for management or senior-level positions, unless they're in research or scholarship.\n\n(And then, maybe not even then. I have a PhD in a social science field, and I started as a junior researcher on my team. My training mentor was a guy with a bachelor's in my field who's been at the company for 15+ years. And *I* *learned a tremendous amount from him* (and still do). Not about research, necessarily, but about working and conducting research in our specific company).\n\n2) For better or worse, PhD holders have acquired a reputation that they are eggheaded people who cannot work quickly, don't understand business, and cannot work well with others. I'll say the stereotype is unfair while also admitting that there are facets of the academic experience that mean PhD students *don't* get as much exposure to collaboration, working on a team, working quickly, adhering to a budget, etc. There are ways to mitigate that, but it does exist.\n\n3) Sometimes, people with advanced degrees expect higher salaries just because they have an advanced degree, not because the degree is relevant to what they do. From a business perspective, a hiring manager might ask \"Why should I pay someone with an MFA in theater more money for this role as a project manager on my team, that has nothing to do with theater?\" And it's a valid question...the MFA (or whoever) will need to make a good case for their transferable skills.",

I don't think it's a stretch to say that most people who get humanities PhDs will not remain in academia and to recommend that new students consider that. At best she is generalizing her feelings, but that embittered humanities grads are a staple on all the academic forums is a directional indicator. I don't think her conclusion is that she's a perfect candidate - I think it's that her qualifications should theoretically position her well to get a job. Like, that there are many fields where one can be employed and be less than perfect is kinda her point.\n\nI also just think what you said was cruel. \n\n> Your misinterpretation of what I wrote is at worst malicious and at best the result of poor reading comprehension.\n\nholy shit calm your tits. I wasn't attacking you and there is no reason why you should attack me.

People would jump all over me if I took my personal experiences and then generalized to this subreddit about how grad school is easy or how it isn't that hard to get tenure if you just work hard and make good choices. Isn't it reasonable to be consistent the other way around?\n\nAs far as the quote you took of mine, I assure you, my tits are calm. You said that I called OP a narcissist. I did not. Your assertion was wrong. I posited two explanations for why your assertion was wrong (purposeful misinterpretation or poor comprehension). I never called you stupid, nor do I believe you to be stupid based on our interchange here. \n\nTo be fair, my original comment about some glaring fault was probably over the top, and I apologize for it. This scenario just reminded me of a similar one a colleague went through a few years ago. By all accounts, he was a PERFECT candidate, but he was AWFUL in interviews. The problem was that he didn't realize it. If he were to write a post like this, he would assert that he was excellent in interviews, thereby obscuring the true reason that he didn't get a job. \n\nFinally, I don't really understand your assertion re: \"calling people stupid\". I honestly don't think I've called anyone stupid on here ever. If you can find one instance in which I've called someone stupid here, I'd happily acquiesce. ",

Isn't it reasonable to be consistent the other way around?\n\nBecause people's judgments are predicated on known or assumed probabilities. If OP here were tossing a fair coin and was complaining she was only getting heads, I'd jump equally over her as I would over you if you complained you were only getting tails. As is, when comparing accounts of an unsuccessful and successful outcome in a game with bad odds, I will think the former is more generalizable. I think that's reasonable.\n\n> I assure you, my tits are calm\n\nby precedent, I don't know about that\n\n> I posited two explanations for why your assertion was wrong (purposeful misinterpretation or poor comprehension). I never called you stupid\n\nAgain, by precedent, when encountering those two accusations in a message board exchange, the usual implication is that the person they refer to is stupid. If you don't want me to think you're talking about oranges, don't use the word oranges.\n\n> This scenario just reminded me of a similar one a colleague went through a few years ago.\n\nSo you shit on her for generalizing from an edge case because... you want to generalize from an edge case of your own?\n\nObviously we cannot decouple the impact of OP's personal performance from market fluctuations, and this is true in any employment account. I don't know what actual data you want to see in a reddit rant, frankly. Obviously people shouldn't treat this OP as data or objectivity - presumably we've all done college here. But what is the point of calling her narcissistic and fundamentally flawed? Just to upset her further? We can't conclude from this that academia is a pyramid scheme, but we can conclude that a lot of people in academia end up very unhappy on the job market despite doing what they always wanted to do and performing highly for a number of years, and I think that's a *flawed, anecdotal* narrative that undergrads should take into account.\n\n> If you can find one instance in which I've called someone stupid here, I'd happily acquiesce.\n\nDid you know that I don't actually keep a spreadsheet on your comings on goings?",

It worked out.  I then decided to switch to teaching. While my colleagues at 4 year state schools all held PhDs, there was no-long term or full-time available work, and I ended up teaching at a community college (currently 2/3rds time). I like the work, and having a PhD helped me get my job.  No complaints.",
