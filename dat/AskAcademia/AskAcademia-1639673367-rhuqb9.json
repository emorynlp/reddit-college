  "title:": "I think my NIH NRSA will be funded but everyone keeps hedging their language -- please weigh in?",
  "text": "Hey everyone, I recently submitted an NRSA application to an agency whose payline ended up being an impact score of 30. My impact score was 25, which I was very happy about. I received an email two days ago from an NIH rep saying that \"\\[my\\] application has been moved to an approved funding list.\" The email also said, \"Please note  that until a notice of award is received there is no guarantee of  funding.\" \n\nIs there any reason to think that my fellowship application won't be funded at this point? Everyone keeps reminding me that there is no guarantee that I will be funded until I actually receive notice that I was \\*officially\\* funded, but to me, the distinction between \"your application will definitely be funded\" and \"your application has been moved to an approved funding list\" is a purely semantic one. Am I missing something?",

      "text": "Honestly, that's just classic government agency risk-averse legalese. It's another form of \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". It's them saying yes we've awarded it to you but until you've signed the contract we're not liable and if we back out because shit goes down you can go swivel, friend. \n\nCongratulations on your award.\n\nETA you'll probably find the grant agreement has similarly weasely terms. Once signed your funding is as guaranteed as it gets but there's always a get out clause. Recently, in the UK the government pulled overseas aid funding that included a lot of research. Grants got killed over night. This isn't to scare you but just to say there's a reason the language is there.\n\nCongratulations again!",

It's not totally a bad thing when you think this is tax payer money but it is extreme!\n\nI'd befriend your grants team or legal team, whoever handles third party funding where you are. They should be happy to explain it to you - not least because they really want to comply with all the funding T&C's, but also because it's good practice to educate early career researchers on these things. \n\nYou do tend to become immune to the language after a while but it's daunting when you first start out!",

In the case of contracts, they can be held personally financially responsible for cost overruns that occur from them overstepping their authority. I'm honestly not sure if that's also the case with grants, but I'm not stupid/wealthy enough to test it.\n\nEDIT: I will say that projects on the funding list will occasionally not get funded for a variety of reasons. It's rare, but it's not as astronomically unlikely as some of the replies are suggesting.",
