  "title:": "Interruption in lab work due to sexual assault: how to address on NSF GRFP?",
  "text": "I graduated in 2017 in four years, but had a really rough time due to a sexual assault in 2014. \n\nI had to fund my own tuition, after family disowning me, and switched over to industry work from labs (for better pay). \n\nI have decent research experience in industry, but I don't know how to address why I went to a top-research university for undergrad, and then suddenly switched to industry work after my first year of undergrad without at-least mentioning the sexual assault. \n\nMy current NSF GRFP app mentions this in four words, and then jumps to how it made me prioritize and positive things, but I feel so embarrassed about it. I don't want to fish for sympathy, and I'm worried that my review panel (I bet primarily older men) won't look on it kindly/or atleast it'll take on too much weight and take away from my work. I don't want to seem like I might cause trouble. I just don't know how to explain why I suddenly stopped lab work, despite being at a major research university.",

      "text": "I've reviewed GRFP's a couple times and wouldn't consider your switching to an industry position to be a red flag at all. Please don't feel like you need to reveal more about your situation than you feel comfortable doing. Reviewers are explicitly directed to evaluate applicants for their potential to *become* future research leaders, not for their previous track record. You could certainly mention that you switched positions as a result of personal/financial turbulence at the time if it fits into your overall narrative, but a specific explanation isn't necessary. Spin it as a great experience to learn about science from a non-academic perspective, expand your network/skillset, and mention how it motivated you to pursue the career trajectory you're now proposing.  The review panelists are absolutely not trolling through applications looking for reasons to penalize applicants. Applications near the funding threshold are discussed live between reviewers, and the ones in your corner will be using anything that makes your case unique to argue in your favor. Good luck!",

Plenty of easy reasons for dabbling in industry work at an early point in your career. \n\nSorry to hear about your past, but focus on your future.",

          "text": "This! Lots of people would make that switch for all kinds of reasons, like money or becoming burnt out and disillusioned with academia after studying at a top level research school. The experience gained from industry can definitely be spun as a plus too in my opinion - everybody in academia has academic experience but not all have industry, and there are unique skills to be gained there. I would not go into detail or mention the sexual assault specifically. I am a victim as well and it really sucks but I have gotten universally poor responses by sharing that info with literally anyone for any reason. People who have not experienced it often have incredibly strong opinions about it for some reason and seem unable to even attempt empathy as for what it may feel like to be in that situation. And some of those people are going to see it as an \"excuse\" or \"weakness\" in this context, which is absolutely disgusting and horrible but I've had it happen so many times I don't mention it to anyone ever for any reason anymore. \n\nSeems like so many people, especially in the age of #metoo, see sympathy as a limited commodity that someone must earn and convince them to spare a crumb of, and want to pick apart our traumas and find ANY reason to blame us and excuse the perpetrator. I don't know why. If I say I was mugged or hit by a car or some other trauma, people accept it and say how horrible and sorry they are, but say it's sexual assault and suddenly they're arguing my experience and no matter how many assumptions I debunk there's always another reason they claim they can't sympathize, or a reason it's \"not that bad/serious\" to them. This is just my experience of course but it's a volatile topic in the US right now and sadly considered \"too personal/familiar\" in many professional settings, I'd avoid it. It implies your industry experience was a mistake or second option as well, which it was not and never let anyone make you think that, even if it was not originally what you wanted before trauma messed everything up. It is every bit as valuable!",

Weren't you worried that jobs might wonder why you were leaving college to go to work?\n\n> I just don't know how to explain why I suddenly stopped lab work, despite being at a major research university. \n\nyou left after your first year. students leave schools for a million different reasons. this isn't suspicious or worrisome at all. no explanation is required. If you just absolutely can't let it go and must say something, just put a generic \"financial reasons\" or \"family health\" or something.",

I was harassed one time by an authority figure (I know it\u2019s not as severe as your situation) and it really fucked me up for a while.

I have hope that in the future we can establish an environment in academia where victims can feel truly supported and not further marginalized.

You won't know until you realise something's wrong.\n\nWhat happened to me changed my life. I became more withdrawn, more \"online\", and more timid. I stopped taking risks. My entire personality is different as a result. You bet that if someone asked me, I wouldn't tell.\n\nWith all due respect, you don't know what you're talking about.",
