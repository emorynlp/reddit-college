This is the approach I tend to take \n\n\nGo to google scholar \nResearchgate \nOrcid \nGoogle \nUni website but the ones I am interested in have next to no data in their sites. \n\nIs this the most comprehensive/ exhaustive  list ? If I search at all these , can I say with confidence I have seen all there is to see? If after all this I don\u2019t find a topic of my research, is it safe to conclude the particular profesor has not worked on this topic at all ?",

So even if they did publish something, no one knows about it and that publication is having no impact. I'd say this is a big red flag. Publications are one of the most important things for a PI, so it doesn't make sense that they would be hiding them.",

      "text": "I echo the sentiment from the many great comments here: difficulty finding any publications is a red flag. I will add, however, that early career researchers may have fewer publications (but they should still have SOME publications).\n\nIn the case that you are finding publications but they are just not relevant to your research interests, this may suggest you and the potential PhD supervisor are not a good match. It is reasonable to worry about finding a good PhD supervisor(s), but it could be WAY worse to end up in a lab you are not passionate about for 4+ years.\n\nGood luck!",

On a related note, if I only find Spanish language led literature on their pages, does that mean they do very little work in English language led research? I am applying in Spanish Unis. I know you must think this is soooooo obvious. I guess my point is, if they have done the work, it must be all out there. If its not out there, perhaps they don't do that kind of work. really appreciate your time!!",
