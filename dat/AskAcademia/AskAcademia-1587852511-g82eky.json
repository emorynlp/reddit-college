  "text": "I find my supervisor (who doesn't have any industrial experience) a bit insecure when facing some of the industrial folks. He often asks, \"is that how it works over there? I got more insecure for him being my supervisor by asking that for some reason.\n\nMy sister who has been working in the industry for her whole life didn't quite like working with people who have been \"stuck\" in school -  she finds them as people that couldn't really solve real problems - no offence but she said that \"these people\" are more complaining and using \"methods\" people don't understand. She says she doesn't care for \"the references\", \"the literature review\" or SCOPUS Indexed if it can't solve the business problem - I literally laughed hearing that. \n\nAcademics - do you get insecure not having industrial experience?",

So no, I'm not concerned -- especially now that hopefully COVID-19 has made the world a lot more aware of why you need those esoteric experts doing weird stuff. Without people mucking around with molecular sequence evolution to answer obscure academic questions, there would be no tools to trace virus strains and identify important mutations and all this other incredible work they've done in such a short time! Without some taxpayer-money-sucking microbiologists studying weird hot water bacteria in the 1970s, there would be no PCR tests, etc. 30 years ago, people were studying Coronaviruses because they have super cool, relatively complex genomes for RNA viruses, no one suspected they'd be of any human relevance before SARS-1. Some of those people were mocked for studying non-human industry-irrelevant bat viruses...\n\n\nIf the world doesn't figure this out and I'm left without my academic job somehow, guess I'll have the rest of my life to spend on being a militant activist for basic science and make a career out of that. Because I know that despite all the anti-intellectual overly-pro-business propaganda, we basic scientists are not only useful, but actually absolutely essential to modern society and a decent quality of life in it =)",

Practitioners typically prize breadth and efficiency, whereas academics typically prize depth and rigor. As such, academic mentality and approaches tend to clash with practitioner environments - but that doesn't mean it's inferior, just different.\n\nTheir suitabilities are likewise different. A practitioner's approach isn't very suitable for an in-depth rigorous, research driven study, whereas an academic approach isn't very suitable in a fast-paced generalized, heuristic/gut driven environment. And it's not trivial for someone steeped in practice or academia to one day put on the cap of the other.\n\nThat's why in many fields there is a lot of demand for academics to advise and consult for government and the private sector, and to do studies.",

I am not like insecure... but sometime I feel like I am kinda \"degenerating\" in academic field... for instance lot of my colleagues can't say difference between working and doing nothing, maybe its just profesional deformation of creative job, hard to say. Also work habits are way too different in academia (humanities) and 8/5 jobs. From time to time I work (part time) as a plumber and really the way how the concept of working is understood in \"normal\" jobs and in academia is uncomperable... So in general I guess your insecurity is something like \"being lost in the translation\"",

Maybe your sister is lucky and works for a company that does actually make a positive impact the world, but my experience of industry isn't that. Industry people are wasting their talent and ability 'solving' short term profit driven, often non issues. I get to focus on things I care about, things that actually make the world better rather than enrich a bunch of other people.",
