Pretend you have a \u2018writing muscle\u2019 in your brain and exercise that muscle every day. \n\nOne of the most prolific scholars in my field said during a conference talk that she treats writing 250 words like brushing her teeth. She wouldn\u2019t leave the house without brushing her teeth, same with the writing habit. And even while you\u2019re waiting for a decision on your first submitted manuscript (congratulations) start the second project. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re going to get stuff rejected, it will hurt. Put the rejection email away for a time and then come back to it as a chance to improve.",

      "text": "1- Don't read academic quit-lit, and don't read all the negative stuff you see on these subreddits. There is so much negative energy when it comes to applying to faculty positions. Trust me, I understand where it comes from, but if you are serious about being a professor you have to block all that negative shit out. \n\n2- Develop an original research vision and believe in it deeply. The only way I became a professor is by feeling like my field would genuinely suffer if I didn't lead a research group. I know that sounds a bit crazy, but that is the deep wellspring of motivation that I needed to get through my postdoc. \n\n3- Being a professor is about being a professor, which is more than just about being a great researcher. You need to work on your teaching, communication, presentation skills, mentorship, guidance, diversity/equality/inclusion, self-promotion, service, charisma, networking, conversation skills, and leadership. A candidate who has a strong research CV but does not have these soft skills is not a strong faculty candidate. \n\n4- Don't treat the faculty search as a raffle or a crapshoot. Yes, of course, you can maybe look in your field and say, \"How did *that* person get the job and I didn't?? They lucked out.\" Sure, maybe they did. But luck is not a reliable strategy. The only thing you can control in this world is yourself. Focus on yourself, make yourself the best candidate by a mile -- that is the only reliable strategy to landing a top-tier position. \n\n5- Be zen about it. If you are a faculty candidate, you are probably ~28-35 years old, making a garbage postdoc salary while your friends from high school/college are all married with houses and stable careers. It is a very difficult time for mental health. My advice is to direct all your anxiety and frustration into self-improvement. Direct it into your research, and all the soft skills from #3. Become better. This is the only productive way to use your energy. \n\nI don't know how else to say this, but you need to want an R1 TTAP position with *every fiber of your being*. You cannot say, \"I am going to try for a faculty position.\" You have to go for it, hard. You need to have probably the same mentality as if you were trying to become an Olympian, or get drafted into the NBA, or do anything else at a world-class level. I know this sounds maybe a bit too hardcore, but remember that you're basically competing against 200-300 *excellent* people--the strongest in your field--for maybe 2-5 positions each year. You have to want it more than every other person, and be able to turn that ambition into productive energy and work, if you want to be successful.\n\nEdit: Haha, this post has kind of a desperate energy to it. I guess that is an honest reflection of how I felt when I was applying for TT jobs. I applied multiple years and had 4 onsites before I got the offer. Each interview was better than the last, I used each experience to focus and develop myself; but each rejection was a deeply painful and frustrating experience. \n\nThe last thing I guess I have to say is: You have to love it -- all of it. The research, the science, the collaboration, the students, the teaching, the conference presentations, the paper acceptances, the paper rejections, the failed hypotheses, the laboratory grind, the Ah-ha moments (especially the Ah Ha moments) -- all of it. This job is tough but the only way you can get through it is to enjoy every last bit of it. \n\nFinal edit: It's very important to have a supporting family and partner. My girlfriend (now wife) always believed in my vision and helped me through the hard times. I don't think I could have made it without that kind of support.",

Feel free to contact me; people are doing it. If I don't know your answer, I know someone who does; if I don't think you suck, I will totally forward your portfolio on to an artist. But check this out: Do you live in Nebraska? There are no studios there; I will tell you to move. Do you dislike the idea of arriving at 6:30am and leaving at 10:30pm? Find another passion. You will be hardcore or you will not succeed, unless you get lucky. It shouldn't be that way, but it probably will be at your studio.\n\nI wouldn't do it again for $1,000,000/yr. But I was good when I was doing it (I left on good terms when my wife got pregnant unexpectedly-- I'm now a stay-at-home Dad). And I have to say... I've never \"drank just to calm down\" before going home to my wife before, until I was a professional game dev. Working with other girls and guys who worked on / went on to work on games like The Incredible Machine, or Mechwarrior 4, Peggle, Population: One, etc.\n\nAnd if you're still with me, and you're wondering if you can skip #3? You fail. All you parents who ask me, \"My kid has interviewed for years and never been accepted at a studio. Why are they not hiring him/her?\" --- Well, your kid is dropping the ball on #3 and the interview team is picking it up.\n\nOne last thing: Did you try to go to a for-profit school, like University of Advancing Technology? Here's the standard: Be asked by the Dean to become an adjunct professor, as a student.\n\nIt's hardcore, folks. Absolutely no shame in saying \"No.\"\n\nGodspeed to all of you.

      "text": "I think if I were talking to myself on the _first_ year of TT job applications, it would be something like:\n\n* Not every TT job is a great job. I know you want _a_ job but you need to figure out whether you want _this_ job.\n\n* You need to convey that fact in your letter, interviews, etc. Not just _a_ job \u2014 but _that_ job.\n\n* And you really need to know what it is you do. You cannot go into an interview with still only a vague sense of that. If you don't know what it is you \"do,\" and who \"you\" are versus everyone else who graduated from your program, spend some time figuring that out.\n\nIt wasn't until I really grokked the above that I was successful on the job market, and having been on many search committees now I see that this is often what separates the great candidates from the ones who merely have good credentials. \n\nAs for first year as an assistant professor... I guess it would be, try to have realistic expectations about what you can and can't do. And try not to stress out too much. There are just so many new things that first \u2014 the university, the city, the job, the colleagues \u2014 and there's so much pressure to just hit the ground running. There's only so much you can do, though.\n\nI guess in general I would encourage myself to take stress more seriously. I always ran a pretty high-stress lifestyle, and thought that was just the way to get by in this field of work, but it really backed up on me a few years into the TT job. Learning to manage that earlier on would have been an improvement. I don't think I'm alone in this; a LOT of my colleagues who started around the same time as I did, by year 4 or so were drinking too much, etc., and having to deal with that. That wasn't my vice, but I get it.",

      "text": "1. This sounds harsh, but: If you apply for more than one year and you do not have campus visits, you need to make serious backup plans. Virtually everyone I know who got TT jobs had some serious interest early on (even if it took them a couple years to actually \\*land\\* something). If you didn't get interviews or visits this year, ask yourself: will something extremely large change about my profile in the next cycle? If the answer is \"no,\"  you need to make backup plans. I have seen people delude themselves for years because they weren't willing to face this. \n2. Someone else on here said this, and it is very true: a huge part of the job is soft skills and public speaking (\\*especially\\* public speaking). \\*Most of the job\\* is communicating to students who do not give two craps about your particular specialty or even your whole discipline, and your job is to find ways to show them it's exciting and fascinating and important. If you can't get a room full of \\*faculty in your field\\* feeling energized and excited and full of love for the field (in an interview or a job talk), they are going to (correctly) think you will be a boring and bad teacher who will at best be endured by students and at worst will lose them majors. Show interview committees how much you love your subject! And if you don't light up when you talk about your subject, maybe look for a different line of work.\n3. If you haven't published, don't waste your time applying. The market is tight. The job has three parts: teaching, admin, and publishing peer-reviewed research. If you have no evidence you can do #3 (and believe me, a bunch of people in the pile with you \\*will\\* have evidence they can do #3), why on earth would any university hire you?\n4. A humanities-specific note. \\*Nice\\* VAPs can be very good onramps into faculty positions. The (unhealthily competitive, extremely well-funded) doctoral program I graduated from recently did a survey of its graduates with TT jobs in the past 5 years. Virtually everyone  who ended up in TT positions jumped to them from ABD; a small slice took non-TT positions after defending and then got TT jobs. Every \\*single person\\* who took a non-TT position after defending and subsequently got a job went through well-funded VAPs (mostly at nice SLACs). People who took teaching-heavy humanities \"postdocs\" did not convert to TT. I'm sure things are different in the sciences, but there was a very clear pattern in the set of recent graduates.  \n5. This is a piece of advice for new faculty. Many universities with large, successful doctoral programs are located in wealthy cultural hubs and you will emerge from your PhD program with a social circle made almost entirely of other people with PhDs.  Most of the universities and colleges you will be applying to, however, are not in wealthy cultural hubs. They will have some but not many white collar professionals around in the town, and there will be a wildly varying number of junior faculty, many of whom will be weirdos or have kids or live two states away and will thus not have time to be friends. I have seen so many of my colleagues from grad school (and in my current job) struggle because they can't figure out how to live happily where their college is located. They make themselves unhappy with insane commutes; they are condescending and ignorant about the town around the college (doubly so if it's in a red state); they are disappointed all the time that it's not New York or Austin or Madison or whatever; they can't imagine being friends with someone who works at the gas station down the road. My grandma used to have a cross-stitch on her wall that said \"bloom where you're planted.\" You have stuff to offer your local community, no matter where you are, and it has stuff to offer you. You just need to be creative and open-minded and break the chains of the weird all-academic social landscape that most people get trapped in as graduate students.",

First and foremost I would be more honest with what I want. Not what I was supposed to want but what I wanted out of a position in terms of teaching and scholarship. Instead of thinking about the ranking, prestige or how much they seemed to want me, carefully consider the student demographic and recent scholarship from newly tenured members of the department. That tells you more about the teaching atmosphere and research expectations then any sales pitch. The second, and more important thing is to gird myself for the intense racism and sexism that permeates academia. It shapes everything. I love my gig, but it was my third TT job and last try before I left academia to do something else. I feel blessed to have it, but the process of landing someplace good raised issues I never dreamed of.",

The job search lasted years and nearly destroyed my life, and I constantly wonder if the payoff is worth it.\n\nBut if I couldn't be dissuaded, I'd only apply places where I knew people, or where my advisor/mentor knew people. Networking is FAR more important than I understood starting out. \n\nIn the second case, I'd tell myself to quit trying to actually teach in a different way. Quit trying new stuff, like active learning, etc. Students hate it, and administration only pays it lip service. Traditional lecture is the way to go, because as far as teaching goes, your main concern is those student reviews. And getting neutral or good student reviews is a function of being pleasant and approachable, making the class as easy to pass as possible, and granting every request you can while keeping your lunch in your stomach. When you're dumbing it down, go dumber. Be shameless in your fawning compliments. And make sure that most of the class has an A or a B locked in by the day that you give the review.

      "text": "My first time on the job market they were interviewing me.\n\nMy second time (and any time I've had an interview after) I was trying to find out if I was going to be happy working in that place. The more you know about how a university works and how those inner workings can affect you, the more you can make an informed decision about working there or not. \n\nAt my current job, the previous dean and President did a pretty good job of supporting faculty. The current ones are completely the opposite, and it's awful. The people who are supposed to be supporting me in doing my job actively stand in opposition to it, and it freaking sucks. Ask questions at \"campus visits\" about what these people are like and what they do to support the department you are applying to--it will tell you a lot. Be sure to look at the faces of the people not answering the question too, they might tell you more than the person who gives the \"official\" answer.\n\nAll the research productivity in the world doesn't mean shit if you get a job where you will be teaching a 4/4, always overloaded to a 5-6+ and the dean and president laugh at the idea of merit pay increases, sabbaticals, or course releases.",

      "text": "I really like this thread. There is some pretty solid advice. If I could go back in time to when I was applying, I would tell myself not to waste time on applications to institutions where I would never get hired. I went to a pretty niche program that wasn't a top-10 or even top-20. I probably wasted days on applications that would never been looked at because I didn't have the pedigree to be there or 1-2 years experience as a TT Asst. Prof already. I really like research and focused my attention on R1s or research-intensive liberal art schools (similar to where I did my undergrad). Looking back it was a total waste of time. \n\nIf I could go back to my first year on the job, I would just tell myself that your departmental colleagues matter quite a bit for helping keep your sanity and make sure that you always have a good relationships with your chair. I've lucked out in working in two departments (I've since left my first TT job for a different institution) where everyone was collegial and any toxicity didn't detrimentally interfere with work. I really like both of my chairs and find their support has been the one thing that has helped my career and sanity. They were able to read when I was overdoing it and told me to slow down and go home to relax. They can also be really supportive if I wanted to dedicate more time to research and even helped to find financial support from the institution to pursue it. For reference, I went back out on the job market my second and third year and have nightmares about the sort of places I could have ended up (i.e. toxic departments and colleagues). It was a real eye opener about what sort of place I wanted to work and how I wanted to balance work/life responsibilities.",

      "text": "Just scored a great TT job this April. There are lots of blogs and online resources for how to interview for your discipline or field, so use those as priority. \n\nGenerally, my advice is to identify and commit to your values, and use that to guide your strategy. There are many things to value in this process, not just overall prestige of institution or R1 status. This includes geographic location, proximity to family, ease of immigration, partner or children preferences, work-life balance, etc.  \n\nI would then use these preferences to guide your decision making. Are you going to selectively apply for 10-20 jobs and accept you may not get them, or are you going to blast applications until you're sick of institutional HR systems? Are you applying for teaching or non-TT positions or not? If staying in a geographic area is important to you, you may need to flex on being in an R1/R2 or be patient.\n\nI prefer this approach to picking the procedural details first, because the procedural details (like the # of apps you'll submit, how much you'll tailor, etc) depend on the why to make it meaningful and prevent some burn out.",
