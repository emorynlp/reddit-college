  "text": "So, in March 2020, this big conference in my field got cancelled. I had the paper ready and everything. My question is: can I/should I put it in my CV? \n\nJust for context: I'm a Phd candidate and I'm sprucing my CV for postdoc applications, so conferences like this one do look good on a CV, or so I've been told. But I'm not sure what other peeps are doing across the field?\n\nThanks a lot!",
