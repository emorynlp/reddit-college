  "text": "I'm looking at a simple platform to have a personal site. Something that I can use mainly to take notes actually. I find that I gather so much notes, tutorials, websites for references, etc. and haven't found a good way to do that in a way that works well. I find that a hierarchical tool like a web site makes more sense than a word document. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it would be public facing, have my publications and work, and link to researchgate / Orcid / twitter etc. in one place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what are your simple to use tool to achieve that ? (I can do programming but prefer not to take my time to do too much of that myself).\n\nThanks !",
