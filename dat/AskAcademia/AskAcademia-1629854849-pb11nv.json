  "text": "Is there any chance to comeback in academic life to me..\nI have MSc in biological sciences and unfortunately due to family issues.. I couldn't continue through my career.. \nI'm 27 year's old and It's been three years.. my brother had accident and diffusional axonal head injury.. still we don't know whether he will improve back to normal behaviour.. I have very deep love for being biology student.. it's been two years I haven't touched books.. but I keep looking at research papers while at phone.. \nDoes the academic world accept me if I have 3 years of wastage of time.. \nBut my family wants me to take a job that to lead decent life.. but my heart is not yet ready for that.. I am average at performances.. not that good.. \nWhat should I do..\nShould I listen my parents advice and take job..\nTry for academic life.. it takes time.. it's very hard to find job in academia.. \nI don't know what to do.. \nI'm in dilemma.. please help..",

See if anyone has open PhD positions, who might be looking for a PhD student. Get in touch with people and ask around.",

Keep it brief, say it's been a difficult period but you're now ready to return to your career and looking forward to starting a PhD. People ask because they want to know your background and that kind of gap can represent some issue with a candidate, like they went to jail or spent 3 years playing video games refusing to work. You just need to make them feel confident there's no nasty surprises coming their way. Just be upfront about it. \n\nOne note of caution, you say you loved being a biology student. Being a graduate student is nothing like being an UG, especially after the first couple of years when you stop taking any classes.",
