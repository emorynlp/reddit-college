  "text": "22f, currently holds a BA in Political Science! I was planning to go to law school, but the idea of working insane hours and dealing with angry people every day for the next 40 years makes me nauseous :) Whoops. \n\nDebt:\n\nCurrently 7.5k in student loans. Semester tuition here (Oklahoma) is roughly 4500$. \n\n I figure I'll end up with 20-30k in debt total. \n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n* I don't care about money as long as I can afford a decent apartment, my loan payment, and cat food. \n* I value long-term stability. \n* I value the ability to grow in my position. I want to be able to move up! \n* I don't want to take work home with me. I want to go in, do the job, and leave. \n* I want to be able to have a job almost immediately out of graduation. \n* Minimal risk!!!!!!\n* Having camaraderie with fellow employees! Working together. \n* I would want to graduate in 2-3 years (going spring, summer, and fall). \n\nThings to keep in mind: \n\n* Great socially \n* Bad at math, but a firm believer that you can do anything you set your mind to. People called me stupid and I graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a 3.9 GPA! \n* Creative \n* Dislikes monotony \n* Love love love learning. Philosophy, History, the Arts! \n* I currently work full-time. I would prefer to continue to do so. Accounting is the only degree I can imagine I could feasibly do that. It's almost all online and my institution is an hour's drive away. \n\nCurrently:\n\n43% of a Civil Engineering degree done \n\n55% of a Computer Science degree done \n\n40% of an Accounting degree done \n\n35% of an Education degree done \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you! & Apologies for the flair. Not sure which to pick!",

      "text": "This sounds familiar. I got a BA in Social and Political Sciences in 1987, then went to grad school for Computer Science. Learning to program was the best decision I ever made. I got my first job straight out of college, money problems essentially solved, with skills that weren't specific to any particular country so I ended up working in England, Australia, Japan and the US over the years. Working for big companies also gave me stability and a defined career path.\n\nHaving said that, I would vote for an Accounting degree. All the people I know who went into accounting seem really happy with their jobs, good money, and regular hours. The hours for software engineering can be brutal, evenings and weekends, lots of pressure. From my understanding, the hours for accounting are much more regular, usually 9 to 5 but maybe heavier during tax season. Interestingly, all the accountants I know are women who, according to the stats I've seen, are much more heavily represented in accounting than in computer science.\n\nSo, my advice: do the accounting degree and get a job with a accounting firm. You'll have a stable job, less risk, a career path, plenty of social contact, and lots more to learn if you want to specialize or become a CPA.\n\nGood luck!",
