  "text": "Hello, I hope this is okay to ask here as I don't know anyone I could ask in person. I mean this question in the most respectful way possible.\n\nI am looking into labs looking for potential PIs for a PhD in US schools. I notice in some cases, the lab is comprised virtually 100% of members of the PI's same national? background (telling from their names), in an otherwise multicultural department. Current student, past students, even undergraduate students - all of the same national group. Also the research is often theoretical STEM or mathematical and completely unrelated to any kind of cultural element.\n\nI will not say which national group (and I've seen this happen with more than one group), but it's common enough that it's a trend. The faculty and students of the department as a whole are very multicultural so I don't see how this happens naturally, unless the PI intentionally only picks members from the same group as them. Also looking at the past publications of the group, the trend holds too (so it is not just a random fluke at one point in time).\n\nIt would be analogous to if for example, in my home country of Argentina, there would be labs at the university comprised only of ppl with French names, or only Polish ppl, or only Greek ppl.\n\nI mean no disrespect but, as someone obviously not from that ethnic group (as an Argentine), should I even bother applying to mono-cultural labs? I'm interested in the research but get a sense I won't be welcome. \n\nAlso, is there any legitimate reason why this could turn out so? And Is this okay in terms of university policy and diversity/inclusion?\n\n(Sorry if this is insensitive in some way, I don't really know how things work in the US, but I genuinely just thought US universities are very emphasizing not having bias in nationality or ethnicity in hiring).",

      "text": "Certainly, there's the worry about PI bias and others have discussed this quite well already. However, in my estimation the *student* are usually a bigger factor in these situations.\n\nMinority students, especially international students, are reasonably worried about PI bias and therefore have a slight tendency to gravitate toward groups that have a track record of being hospitable to students like them. The sets up a self-perpetuating likelihood that students of a certain background, such as a specific nationality, will enter certain labs. (Other issue: money. In programs where domestic students can be centrally funded, in addition to having more fellowship opportunities, while international students *must* be funded by their supervisor, the international students necessarily have both fewer options of labs and are more vulnerable to exploitation.)\n\nOn the other hand, prospective students who don't belong to that same identity group may worry about missing out on things if they join a lab where they would be a clear minority in the group. Language is poses one of the clearest potential inequalities here---it's harder to participate in a lab environment when your labmates are communicating in a language you can't understand. Social exclusion is another worry, because a lot of collaborations and experiments are born in casual conversation rather than lab meeting.\n\nBasically, lab composition is complicated. It's hard to call relatively homogeneous labs a red flag.",

I think women may be more concerned about biases in labs so when they see a lab with a balance or majority of women, that might be a selling factor, adding to women.
