  "text": "Most theses are about 100,00 words, which is never enough but there\u2019s still a bit of room for creativity. Just wondering what Easter Eggs you or someone you know snuck in to liven up a sentence or make a point? Song lyrics, pop culture references, names, etc?\n\nEdit: These are all fantastic, you guys rock. And thanks, kind stranger, for the award!",

      "text": "There is a rather infamous paper from the 1990s regarding something called \"Tai's method\". In this paper Tai presented a method of estimating (I think) glucose response in something something blah blah blah.... I don't know the details because I'm a mathematician and the paper is about medicine or something related. \n\nAnyway, the main problem with the paper is that the problem they are solving amounts to computing a definite integral and \"Tai's method\" is nothing more than the trapezoid rule everyone learns in their first calculus course. This was pointed out by a letter to the editor here: \n\nhttps://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/10/1224\n\nProbably it would not have been so egregious if not for the fact that Tai decided to double down on this oversight and insist that their entire methodology was novel. Tai herself is actually the one who started calling it \"Tai's method\" and much (not really that much) drama ensued. This has become a classical cautionary tale about why people in STEM fields should actually pay attention and learn mathematics instead of just getting a C and dumping it all. \n\nSo anyway I snuck a citation for this paper into my thesis, despite it having absolutely nothing to do with anything even remotely related.",
