  "title:": "Passion is teaching, not scientific research. Should I stay in my Applied Math PhD?",
  "text": "I'm a second year applied math PhD student. I had originally wanted to teach high school but was convinced to do a PhD program to be able to teach university. I love TA'ing for the undergraduate courses and would love to teach them. I'm just really not enjoying doing research. I actually enjoy programming and implementing for my research but not really the science itself. I feel very unmotivated and aimless in my work right now. I feel like quitting and doing a math education PhD instead. I really don't know what to do and I'm afraid to bring this up to my advisor because he believes in my potential for science. Anyone have any similar experience and / or advice? Thanks.",

      "text": "I pushed through finishing my degree despite knowing that I would not want to pursue research and wanting to teach instead. But it was a complete statistical anomaly that I was able to land a teaching job when I finished: they are quite competitive depending on field and are similar to research jobs in that you have to take them wherever you can find them. Looking at my grad school cohort (graduated 2017): out of the ~25 students in my cohort and the cohorts above and below mine all five of the teaching-focused grad students have landed teaching-focused positions, though I believe I am the only one who has a job that does not require research for tenure (and the pay is so low and commute so long for my job that I'm actively looking for a new one). The other four took VAP positions after graduating and landed higher-paying asst professor or instructor positions and seem happy.\n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable guiding you in either direction, as I'm an example of survivor-bias. So, my advise would be to talk to young professors at small teaching-focused schools: How difficult is the job market for those jobs in math? How difficult was it for them to finish out their degrees doing research while wanting to teach after finishing? Are they hiring people with masters degrees to teach 1-200 level courses or only PhDs for all courses?\n\nOther things to consider: how much do you not like research (I at least was very interested in my research topic, but just hated the last year of solely data analysis and writing after doing the fun bits of research: planning and collection)? Are there opportunities to teach while earning your degree that you'll enjoy to get you through the process? Would your supervisor support you in doing so? \n\nDon't make yourself miserable unless you see a path to your goal would be my end all advise. It was worth sticking it out for me personally, as I am looking at leaving academia altogether so that I can stay in my region (my turn to make career choices based on my spouse as he made multiple for me) and having a PhD has opened a number of doors that wouldn't be open otherwise. But all things are relative to field, time, and experience.",

      "text": "I'm a firm believer that if you don't need a PhD you shouldn't do a PhD. Even a math education PhD is research into how to teach maths, not actually teaching it. Would that fulfill you?\n\nSo, do you need a PhD to teach? If you're happy teaching high school the answer is No. If you want to teach undergrads then the answer might be Yes!\n\nAlso look at the options you have - for example can you Master out? That might be a good compromise?\n\nYou can do a PhD and then stay in academia teaching only, that's perfectly normal if teaching is what you enjoy.",

      "text": "Why do a PhD at all if you\u2019re not interested in research. By definition, a PhD is a research degree. If your goal is to focus on teaching and avoid research, then I\u2019m not sure a PhD in mathematics education instead of applied mathematics really changes anything, unless you\u2019re interested in research in mathematics education.",
