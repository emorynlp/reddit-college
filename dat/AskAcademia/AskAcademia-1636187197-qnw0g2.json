  "text": "Hi, guys i\u2019m interested in the MS/ Phd in Civil engineering most preferably a specialization in Construction Management. \nStructural engineering could also be one i\u2019m willing to look at.\nI\u2019d want to know if anyone here is within this field. \nAlso, any suggestions on a grad school - lost my funding this fall due to covid induced visa delay. I will be glad if anyone can help with any suggestions .\nThanks",
