  "title:": "Academics say my PhD is 'really interesting' but they can't supervise?",
  "text": "I'm a prospective humanities PhD student (in English Literature) and have been talking to several professors (in the UK) about possibly doing a PhD at their institutions. Part of the process for UK applications, is that you have to submit a polished research proposal - similar to what I believe you do in year 2 in the USA - and I've been attaching a draft of it to these professors to check that what I want to focus on is something they'd be interested in and feel they could supervise.\n\nUnfortunately, almost every professor I've contacted has said they do NOT feel they could supervise it. The reason they give is that it is a very niche project which requires specific expertise (which is true, but I thought they had this), although they all assure me that it is 'really interesting' research, implying that they think the project is worthwhile.\n\nShould I be reading between the lines here that my project isn't viable? I'm finding it difficult to know how seriously to take the 'really interesting' bit since it sounds to me like exactly the sort of thing someone would just put in an email just to be nice, rather than a sincere reflection of the projects caliber. Do any English Literature professors have advice for how to interpret this, and perhaps what to do next in terms of finding someone who's enthusiastic about the project?",

      "text": "*The reason they give is that it is a very niche project which requires specific expertise.*\n\nI feel like this can be a doubled-edge knife, particularly in the humanities. On one side, from my experience, research that gets grants and recognition are often niche and bring something new to the broader related subject. On the other side, this type of exploratory research, if you will, makes it hard to find evaluators/thesis supervisors.\n\nFor a thesis, sometimes the best option is to chose a subject that is safe and relatively known. That being said, this should be the opposite mindset for something that you will dedicate multiple years towards. Essentially, the phd would give you acess to a position in which you can do very niche projects.",

Who specializes in that methodology? You could try writing to them to say \"I love the method you applied in your work on X and I think it would well on my work on Y.\" \n\nAlso, of your direct advisor has little/no expertise in your topic, discuss how you will leverage other resources (faculty, even adjuncts, consortium agreements, related departments or disciplines, library resources) available through their institution to fill in the gaps. That way they don't feel like it's all on them. They can see you've done your homework and are proactive and therefore more likely to be able to manage with somewhat less input from them. \n\nI too had a very niche topic (didn't exist really) but I made it through with this approach. Good luck!",

      "text": "You may have personal reasons to ignore this advice, but have you thought about applying to US institutions? It was commonly agreed among both my fellow students and the supervising professors at my doctoral institution that the advisor does *not* need to be a subject matter expert in the topic of the dissertation. They are more a coach who guides the student as she becomes one. There are two reasons why this can work in the US doctoral system, but maybe can't in the UK one.\n\n1) Coursework. Your advisor learns to trust you as a scholar through your coursework. Good humanities doctoral seminars scaffold the process of writing a dissertation, by giving you the opportunity to develop a seminar paper in a semi-independent, semi-guided way. This experience is actually formative for doing the same thing with a dissertation.\n\n2) Committees. My (second-hand) experience of UK doctorates is that it's very focused on the advisor-advisee relationship, whereas in the US you have a committee of faculty members guiding you, who can all bring different things to the table. My dissertation essentially asked, \"what if we read text *X* being more attentive to aspect *Y* of its cultural context?\" One member of my committee had done a lot of work on *X*; another had done much more with *Y*. Neither were my advisor, who was someone whose methodology drove a lot of the way I asked the question. The *X*\\-expert wasn't even at my school.",

Most programmes I've seen seem to offer between $15,000-$18,000 which I think I'd struggle to make work especially living in a city. I'm also a little concerned about the fact that it takes double the time to get a PhD in the US compared to the UK, and, of course, that's to say nothing of the academic job market, which is poor in both countries, but the shorter time span of the UK PhD means it's easier to duck out and do something else - you're not committed for as long a time.",

I received multiple fellowships, imcluding the presidential one, which together with my TAship ended up being upwards of 40k a year in a cheap town. Seriously consider the US. Academia here is generally more supportive of grad students, providing MANY more opportunities for professional development. Also, US academia is more toxic, more obsessed and more difficult to treat as \"just work.\" I'm now an assistant professor in an R1, and I received an email from somebody in leadership at a top institition in the UK suggesting I apply to an Associate Professor post there. Think about the US--it's a great place to give your career a solid boost. You can always go back to the UK later. Also, niche is good. Don't let that put you off.",

I can't see why you wouldn't have my \"luck.\" Preparation in the US is generally bettrr than in the UK. You'll teach from the beginning, present a lot, connect with lots of grad students, attend conferences. A top 100 university in the US will provide you with better support and opportunities than the UCL, Kings College, Cambridge, Oxford, edinburgh, or Birmingham. Your US professors are used to supporting you, working close to you and mentoring in ways that UK academics are not even aware of. That often translates into a closer relationship with your director, more collaboration, and maybe more stress (?). \n\nIn terms of toxicity: there is a lot of competition here. PhD students have a professional obsession with academia and they picture themselves as academics. Many of them are very aggressive (since this is the only way to succeed in this environment). The inseparability between personal and professional stuff coupled with competition and stress makes US academia kind of toxic (not that UK academia is a bed of roses).

Not everyone had that last extra 5, but there was extra relevant work (extra TA sections; indexing books; etc.) available for those who wanted / needed it. It might be worth reaching out to some current students to see if most people end up getting more money than the basic package. I'd agree that a school where the support package is too small to live on isn't a school worth going to.\n\nIt does take longer, but I think the extra things you do are all good things to prepare one as a future scholar.

In my field, which is very similar to English Lit in many ways, this can range even at elite institutions offering funding from heavy teaching requirements due to need (big public schools like the UCs) to essentially no teaching requirements (NYU's Institute of Fine Arts, which also doesn't offer full funding to all its students, or at least didn't used to). At my school--a wealthy private school--we were required to TA more because the department considered it good training (and because professors had come to rely on having a TA even for small courses) rather than out of any sort of need. This led to circumstances where one would be a TA for a class of, say, 15-20 students. This freed professors--who often would be teaching only one course a term--from even that minor amount of grading. Cushy gig for them.",

I think that most people wouldn't add the 'really' unless they meant it, at least to some extent.\n\nCalling it 'niche' though could very well be a legitimate practical criticism. Is the proposal broad enough that you can get several papers (or in your field maybe a book) out of it? Are enough people interested in that topic for it to get funded? Is there enough leeway in what you want to do that the professor thinks they can still have an impact on your development as a researcher? (Perhaps this is less of a thing in the humanities, but that could be an issue in my field. It might be a sign of naivety, in the sense of not acknowledging what you don't yet know.)",
