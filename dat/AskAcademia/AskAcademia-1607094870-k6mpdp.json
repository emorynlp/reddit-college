  "text": "So I am looking for a position in this one profs lab and on their website they have announced that this one paper of theirs has been accepted for publication. The title of the paper seems interesting so I would like to read it. Is it okay to ask him? If yes, how exactly do I go about it. Also, I don't know the prof personally and I am not a student of his uni.\n\nEdit: Thank you all kind strangers for replying! :)",

We profs aren't \"on break\" like students, but many (like myself) will plan to work from home with limited on campus hours, or conversely they may be extensively working in their research spaces/labs which may/may not be in or near their offices because they have more uninterrupted time.

However I find that a) when I'm on the receiving end of it, though it makes me roll my eyes a bit, _it still works pretty well_, and b) that when I've had the need to dole it out to others, the more flattery tends to equal the more results. Which is to say, I've been surprised at how well it works, even when in the abstract I would think that everyone is too responsible and too intelligent to be affected by it.\n\nThat, of course, has made me inherently suspicious of flattery directed towards _me_... but even then, I still like it. I think flattery is an under-estimated \"hack\" of the human psychological system. Obviously one doesn't want to be creepy about it. But when trying to dragoon people into things they, in their right mind, might not want to be part of, slipping in a few lines of, \"well, the reason we'd like you to do this is because _everyone knows_ that you are _amazing_\" works disturbingly, disproportionately well. My sense is that people who think they are immune to it, or that they'd be offended by it, are often just as susceptible as anyone else. Just my experience.",

Journals don't like it if you're posting your article to, say, ResearchGate where anyone could find and download it, but they're almost always okay with some limited sharing directly from the author.",

          "text": "Did you read the one who told you to buy it? That's so strange that I want to read it. Do you mind PMing the title?\n\nAcademic articles are different than books. This makes no sense to me. Subscriptions and article purchases don't keep academic journals alive, at least not the ones I know well. They're funded by universities (usually), which are in turn funded by tax payers.  If there was anything in it worth publishing they should want people to read it.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why people aren't angry that they have to *pay* to read publicly funded research. Most research universities have digital repositories for that very reason. They are supposed to be producing research for that the public *needs*, even if it's written for experts. It used to be expensive to physically print journals. If they have a free way of disseminating that research to people who need or want it, honestly, it shouldn't be up for debate. It's their duty and responsibility. \n\n\"Open source\" shouldn't even be a widely used term in reference to academia. If you want a well educated populace, you don't withhold education and knowledge that costs you nothing to disseminate.",

I was surprised to get that response bc I\u2019ve always been told authors would be happy to send a copy of their work. I remember one of the authors was a big shot in this field so I was disappointed to see that response. I agree, it\u2019s ridiculous that you not only have to pay for it, but your access depends on what your institution chooses to pay for. Mine was very stingy.",
