  "title:": "Academics taking the piss out of your accent at a conference",
  "text": "The title says it really, I recently went to a conference where some of the other PhD students (and their supervisors) thought it was funny to take the piss out of my accent (east london/ essex- I know, I know). I played it off at the time, but it's been bothering me more and more. How are you meant to deal with these kinds of situations (unprofessionalism in a professional setting)? \n\nTheres not much I can do about my accent, and to be honest I really think it's irrelevant so long as what your saying makes sense. I think this is more of a rant than anything, so sorry. Any advice for when this happens again would be great.",

Nevertheless, the first question, asked by an older, Cambridge-educated academic whom previously I had a lot of respect for, was \"can you repeat that entire thing but in proper English this time please?\"\n\nI was stunned, but in retrospect I think I handled it quite well. I let it hang for a moment or two, then just said \"...can you ask a question that's more appropriate to a professional setting?\" and did a little scoffing laugh before moving on to the next question.\n\nAfterwards, I was afraid that my snarky response would have doomed my career before it started, but the moderator actually approached me to apologise for his behaviour. Apparently he's known for harassing younger academics.\n\nAnyway, my advice is this: don't go nuclear when this sort of thing happens, but definitely do stand up for yourself - you won't get any backlash for it. I'm so sorry you had to go through this sort of thing as well.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm not full of myself and even in retrospect, I do totally see the flaws of my study, but I also see that it was, for the undergraduate level, an extraordinarily good presentation. It was a long, hard fieldwork with a really rich and well analysed data, and some presentations on that conference were like weak analyses of a really small set of data, so I am sure I wouldn't have been LAST if they were realistic. The written papers had already been evaluated, the committee was supposed to judge the oral presentation exclusively, but the head decided to shit on the last sentence(!) of my written paper for long minutes and asking me, an undergrad, really cynical questions. I love getting feedback, even if it is telling negative things, but that asshole made me cry because I couldn't handle his manners and I wasn't in a position where I can tell him off.\n\nSorry, this had to come out.\n\n&#x200B;",

In the US there are some accents (heavy Southern ones, for example) that would elicit a prejudicial response in some quarters, but I can't imagine anyone actually saying something about it in an academic setting. Americans are so mobile that it's tough to actually place someone based on an accent anyway...in my academic workplace very few people were raised anyhwere nearby so we have many different accents (not just regional US ones, but UK, India, various Asian, Middle Eastern, Northern and Central European, Spanish, Portugese, Caribbean, South American, etc.) within the faculty. Nobody would ever criticize someone for their accent, though students do sometimes complain when a new professor is hard to understand (typically that's with Asian faculty). But there's no social status associated with various accents, and I can't imagine anyone advising a professional to adopt a fake accent in order to be perceived differently.",

I'm from Arkansas, so I get made fun of for my accent all the time, and I asked him what was wrong. He explained that he'd grown up in a poor household in a working-class city and that he was mocked in a pretty mean-spirited way for his accent at his university. He then went on to say that he thought my friend and I came from a \"posh\" place and that's why we were making fun of him. I explained that no, I was from the Ozarks and she grew up on a cotton field, and he was surprised because we didn't \"sound\" working-class. It led to a really interesting discussion about perceptions of class in the UK vs US and it was one of the more enlightening conversations I've had in a while. ",

When Australians are using terms like \"Shazza\" or \"struth\" or any other stereotypical Aussie slang, we're usually doing it as a kind of derision of bogans and of people who live in the middle of an arid desert. We're imitating our version of rednecks, the poorly educated, and usually the poor. They're the \"rough around the edges\" folk who wear flannelette and overalls everywhere. (And we also don't call them \"shrimp\" in Australia, so that saying doesn't even make sense here.)\n\nWhen Aussies are doing that accent with other Aussies, we all know the context and the general feeling behind it. Americans tend to just assume they're \"in\" on the joke and jump in with it, which leads to greatly inappropriate interactions >90% of the time. That's why you'll get a grimace and some stunned silence in return, or someone will give a tiny laugh and say it's \"such a bad joke\". We're typically pretty friendly, so that's about the worst response you can possibly get. \n\nIt's like that friend who bags you out, and you return in kind, but you both know that it's all a joke and it's built on some kind of shared history. It's very much not okay for the new guy in the lab to jump in one day and insult you just because he saw your friend do it. Especially because he'll just go with any old insult, not realising that there's quite a nuanced \"theme\" with unspoken rules to it. ",

And the school secretary says, in this kind of over the top way \"OH, you're the LADY with the ACCENT\". Like, I dunno, apparently I'm incomprehensible. Then I asked if they talked like that to parents who have accents because they are non-native speakers.\n\nAnother example: a student who was part of a minority group once said to me \"you are harder to understand than a FRENCH person\" with an emphasis on \"French\" like it was \"cockroach\".\n\nMost of the time it's just \"OH YOUR ACCENT IS SO CUTE, SAY SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR ACCENT\" which is embarrassing the first time, and then becomes just more and more tedious.

                  "text": "> Was it hard to feign a Dutch accent?  Did you live there?\n\nI never actually lived there, but, the process by which I chose Dutch was largely process of elimination [and now that I think about it, pretty interesting].  I'm white, which limited my options (nobody was going to believe that I spoke Zulu or Japanese as my native language).  I deliberately wanted to do a non-English language, so as to convey as many false ideas as possible without saying anything (In this case, \"English is not my first language\" in addition to \"I am from a foreign country\") which eliminated North America, Oceania, and the British Isles.\n\nThat left me with continental Europe (and possibly Israel, but I actually think Israeli accents are incredibly difficult to imitate).  I started narrowing things down by what language's vowels I could imitate convincingly (vowels are typically the key to a successful foreign accent).\n\nI tried to find online recordings of people who spoke the languages that I might be able to imitate speaking English, so that I got a sense of the pronunciation idiosyncrasies they have.  Politicians are actually great resources for this (unlike celebrities), because they occasionally have to speak English, but they aren't comfortable in it.\n\nI listened to a lot of Dutch people (that was another thing: I can't find a lot of Spaniards who speak English on camera), and I thought that politicians were a better resource than celebrities.  I think this is because politicians *have* to speak English sometimes, but unlike celebrities, don't do it a regular basis. Balkenende was a great resource, and so was Geert Wilders (to clarify: as a linguistic reference, not as a politician, and there's a famous video of Balkenende speaking to George Bush that was pretty helpful).  They both have quite heavy accents, and Wilders has a cadence when he speaks English that I found useful to imitate (although that might sound as weird in Dutch as it does in English for all I know).\n\nI thought Dutch vowels were quite easy to get (compared to say, German or Danish [which I couldn't even begin to try to imitate]), and I was able to get a better sense of how Dutch people used them when they pronounce English words.  For example, the \"a\" in \"vader\" or \"appel\" is not a sound that English has.  But Dutch people often substitute it in for the \"o\" in words \"lot\" or \"fought,\" [I assume because that sound doesn't exist in Dutch].   \n\nThere are also a lot of Dutch sounds that sound very similar, but not quite the same, that are easy to substitute in for English ones (e.g. the \"ou\" in \"vrouw\" is *almost* like the English \"ou\" in \"loud,\" so I substituted the \"ou\" in \"loud\" for the \"ou\" in \"vrouw.\")  \n\nMy surname is vaguely Germanic sounding, so a language like Dutch was preferable to something like Spanish or Italian.  I ran it past a Dutch colleague who was in my cohort in graduate school to make sure it was convincing enough (apparently, she said she would believe I was Dutch as long as I spoke English [i.e. if I spoke Dutch, no one would believe I was a native speaker], which was good enough for me).\n\nSorry if that was much longer than you wanted, but it was an interesting learning experience.\n\nEDIT: Also, I tried (and failed) to learn how to pronounce the word \"Scheveningen.\" ",

Their accents did not hamper them, so maybe try to locate some of them and ask for advice. (Sorry, it was a brief visit so I've lost their names.)\n\nI'm Norwegian myself, but I've never had anyone question my accent. I was picked on for my Norwegian dialect by other Norwegians growing up, but in retrospect I realise I was my own worst enemy when I let the teasing get to me. \n\nAs adults you'd never expect to hear this in a professional setting. \n\nThere are a few ways to deal with it, but they all depend on the group you're in and the person making fun of you. \n\n1) Call them out. \n\nRedirect the attention to their behaviour instead of your accent:\n\nDon't say anything. Give them your full attention as if you're waiting for the punchline to their remark. It'll get awkward for them fast. \n\nThis gives them the opportunity to revert their former statement. They could say something like; 'I'm just messing with you. Your accent is great. Please, carry on, I'd like to hear more.\"  \n\nIf they don't take the hint, put words to how you feel. Say something like \"I'm sorry, I'm just reliving my childhood trauma of being teased for my accent\" Say it with a smile; if you can evoke laughter and sympathy you can win anyone over. \n\nAlways give people a way out when they behave badly. It might be they didn't mean to at all.\n\n\n2) Take them aside later and express how you feel. \n\n\n3) Own it. (I recommend this one.) \n\nIn the words of Tyrion Lannister; \n*Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.*\n\nMake your accent a part of your brand and be proud of it. If it's a class thing, make a quip about how you're trying to defy stereotypes within academia. \n\n\nHonestly; watching Jim from The Office made me realise that it's not my accent that was the problem; I was simply surrounded by really mean, insecure people from time to time.\n\nEither way; good luck! :-) ",

Those of academics or the visiting public. I\u2019ve been to 3 conferences in SA and 2 in the UK but have never encountered this. Maybe I\u2019m just bad at spotting that but it seems beyond rude and I can\u2019t think of any academics I know who would do it (out-loud at least). I definitely wouldn\u2019t stand for it and I think you\u2019re well within your rights to call someone out on it.
