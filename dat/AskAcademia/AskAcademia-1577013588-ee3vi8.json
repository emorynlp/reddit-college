  "title:": "Can I just vent about the whole recommendation letter system based on invitation?",
  "text": "This is not about the US, as I'm based in Europe. I'm trying to re-enter the academic world after about six years, I would really like to do a master's degree in a certain field and I need recommendation letters. I get that. I've contacted my thesis supervisor from my old university, who luckily remembers me or at least can get a pretty good idea of what kind of student I was from my grades. I've had some relevant professional experience in these years, so I've contacted one of the places where I've worked to get an updated recommendation letter - I already had one, but God forbid it's older than one year, so I had to contact them to get another letter with exactly the same content but a more recent date. Which is silly. They are busy people, and it took me about a month to get this letter.\n\nNow I would like to send more than one application in case I don't make it into the one I'm interested in, but as it turns out some universities have a recommendation letter system where you have to *invite* your recommenders to a platform and they have to submit the recommendation themselves. Yeah, sure. Like, who has the time to do that? Certainly not the organisation that sent me this updated recommendation letter after a month. I don't feel comfortable asking for this, and I honestly think it's ridiculous. Does this whole system work this way because I'm not supposed to know what they say about me? I know they are going to be positive recommendations, otherwise I wouldn't submit them. And it's already not that easy to get a recommendation letter in countries where it's not a thing - like I had to explain to them what it was and I almost had to write it myself, so anything that needed more effort would definitely be a no.\n\nI feel like I'm cut out from applying to certain universities because of this. Already asking a professor I haven't had contacts with in six years feels weird, since I do have her letter and I could just submit it anytime. But no, *she* has to do it or it's not valid. If I wanted to send three applications, just to make sure I make it into one, should I ask her to do this three times? It honestly feels like bullshit.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I needed to get it out.",

      "text": "It does really suck for returning students. I can understand needing a lot of letters for PhD admission, but if you\u2019re applying to something like a taught Masters, you\u2019ve come out of the workforce, and you intend to go back into the workforce afterwards, maybe a bit more flexibility and adherence to industry standards is needed. \n\nIt makes sense that the letter writers should be sending the letters - if they know the student will read their letter they may be pressured to lie in it, or to be more positive than normal. People shouldn\u2019t agree to write if they can\u2019t write a positive letter (and usually won\u2019t agree), but there\u2019s a big difference between \u201cgenerically positive\u201d and \u201cglowing\u201d. Also prevents tampering or falsification by the student - it\u2019s easy to get a university\u2019s letterhead and no one actually checks signatures. \n\nA better system would be a centralised platform where writers can upload just one letter and it can be sent off to all the institutions you apply to. In many cases the only difference between letters is the name of the uni anyway, so they may as well be generic. But obviously programs don\u2019t want to do this because they want control over what they ask recommenders.",

              "text": "Unfortunately this seems to be geared towards employers/jobs, not graduate programs. There really aren't that many portals for any subject, and none seem to have a wide enough adoption to be too useful (or well-known). I believe there was a common system at one point that was trialled in the US for certain institutions and certain subjects, but these centralised systems really only benefit the *applicant*, not the program. \n\nEvery program wants to ask its own questions in its own ways. Some really care about grit and emotional maturity, others really care about placing applicants into achievement bands. A centralised system means they can no longer ask their own questions or change their questions so easily between years, and unless there's widespread adoption, it's simply in their best interest to opt-out. So it's really an all-or-nothing situation for any platform - either every (or nearly every) program signs up, or none do. Universities also aren't going to pay for it (mathjobs takes a fee from employers) when they already have the infrastructure.",

They will not hold it against you. If they agreed to write you a letter then they likely think you will succeed and want to help. Just let them know one time that they will be receiving these email invitations and thank them again for their help. \n\nThen let the onslaught begin.",
