                  "text": "Usually, in the support communities I spend time in, we prefer \"Low-support needs\" and \"High-support needs\".\n\nEssentially - do you need assistance to shower, make food, and otherwise take care of yourself? That's usually what differentiates the levels of autism.\n\nAnd also, ability to verbalize.\n\n\nUnfortunately, executive function and ability to cope with change are rarely considered for official labeling.\n\nA sudden, overwhelming change can make a seemingly neurotypical autistic person who was rocking it all completely change, and be, forgive the word used, \"useless\". This relationship is rarely encoded in labels.\n\nFurthermore, sensory sensitivity and masking is also rarely encoded. Here, I refer to the effort needed to \"pass\" as a non-autistic person socially, and the effort needed to process aural, tactile and visual sensory input or perhaps more appropriately: filter these sensory inputs.\n\nA non-autistic person working in an office with just the right kind of lighting won't really have any issues, maybe a mild headache. An autistic person may manage for a while, but their producitivity will suffer and almost inevitably, they'll end up shutting down (\"Autistic Shutdown.\")\n\nReplace light with certain sounds, wearing certain pieces of clothing and you get it.\n\n/u/julovi If I may suggest: \n\nAsk your student about their sensory sensitivities, and if any of those sensitivities may be triggered by your lab. \n\nFurthermore, always communicate the topic of meetings ahead of time, with clearly outlined expectations.\n\nAlso, offer them a chance to communicate non-verbally (even a verbal autistic person may go non-verbal due to sudden change, stress, sensory triggers). For instance, letting them discuss with you over some IRC channel or I guess, Microsoft Teams rather than meeting face to face would be a godsend.\n\nBut as I said in the beginning: Ask. \n\nFor better or worse, a lot of neurodevelopmental disorders were wrapped under the same label, as such the claim, \"Autism is a spectrum\" is even more important than it was. \n\nHowever, remember - \"autism is a spectrum\" should be viewed like how light is a spectrum. Autism is \"white light\", meaning it is a combination of discrete qualities of varying intensities rather than just a single wavelength.",

And it makes sense that it\u2019d be a shit classifier because \u201chigh functioning\u201d was a shit classifier and \u201clow support needs\u201d is the exact same thing just worded in the opposite direction.

Another thing I've seen it called is a superpower because their abilities allow them to do specialized work. :) \n\nAble-bodied is a word with such negative connotations, and it just needs to go! It does dismiss what you ARE able to do since ability relates to what society EXPECTS without accomodations and/or accessibility. We just need to stop grouping people into boxes that we didn't get the chance the label. It's our issues after all, right?? I think we're more than capable of doing that.",

Maybe ask on autistic pride sub and then maybe present options. Like - I appreciate this is new for you, do you think it would be helpful if I...? Or would you rather x? \nAnd it would be really nice if you were willing to trial methods of working together because sometimes you think something will be good and then it's not.\nPersonally I would love to meet my supervisors more regularly than is standard. But I don't know if that's adhd, autism, or just me being in love with my supervisors.\nI was very surprised by my autism diagnosis. I don't feel I am anywhere near the neurotypical stereotype of an autistic person. And those stereotypes were entrenched in me because I thought I was NT (and maybe somewhat eccentric LOL). So I think asking the autistic community is helpful because although responses may be varied they come from a perspective that understands all the diverse ways autism can be.\nI remember thinking I can't be autistic, I love hugs.

Any adjustment away from your usual risks accidentally being condescending. It's hostile, unfriendly, uncaring environments that cause issues at that age. Just keep an eye out, if he's showing signs of stress, maybe just extend a friendly hand a bit sooner then you normally would.

ASD tends to be less expressed with age, especially when it's High Functioning, so it gets less attention.  \n\n\nI'm sorry I can't provide more specific advice for supervising at a PhD level. I imagine the main trouble that might come up is around deadlines. I would try and establish deadlines as soon as possible to give them as much time as possible, and provide reminders earlier then you might normally for students, make sure he's aware. Problems arising from ASD are usually avoided by avoiding surprises. I definitely would try my best to avoid springing any last minute changes on him! And during more high stress times you might find he becomes very blunt, if that happens, just remember he's almost certainly not trying to be rude.  \n\n\nI hope any of that can be useful, but I'm sure you'll do fine without much extra help!",

There are things you usually hint at, like looking at your watch when a meeting needs to end, and some people with autism will get that right away, but some won't, and you'll find yourself getting mad at them for not doing what you want, which is ultimately unfair because they don't know what you want. Feel free to start with indirect and then step it up, but don't avoid direct statements completely because they're awkward. So, even though it might sound a little harsh to be direct (\"I am not going to review your chapter because I asked you to do A, B, and C first, and you only did B.\"), it's a lot nicer than being indirect and letting the autistic person flounder.",

You\u2019re better off giving suggestions with a few options to guide the conversation. For example, \u201cwould you prefer I correspond with you this way, or some other way?\u201d\n\nYou can also ask them a few questions to get an idea for how they typically approach things. People with autism can be very methodical or systematic in their behaviour. So ask, \u201cif I was to suggest you do this task, how would you approach it?\u201d I realise this is open-ended but you\u2019ll get a better idea of communication style and personal quirks by probing this way.\n\n2. Since this is a PhD I would keep an eye open for any difficulties with executive function and address them early. I\u2019d even go so far as to suggest you warn them about the challenges people can face completing a PhD (organisation, time management, planning, file management, decision-making, etc). If they seem open to discussing it, encourage them to spend a few days researching executive function and email you to let you know what their strengths and weaknesses might be. That will likely make your job a lot easier. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses in this area anyway, but you can tell them you know this can be different for neurodivergent people.",

Typically the student will work with the office to create a list of reasonable accommodations, and you would agree to these and make use of them in your supervision. They may include things like deferred deadlines, alternate formats for evaluation, or specific ways of communicating with each other.  \n\nI am autistic and was only diagnosed after having nearly completed my PhD. I wish I'd known earlier, and if I had I would have been able to do things differently with the support of my supervisor. However, I can't tell you what specifically your relationship with your student should look like because autism is a huge spectrum and my experience with it may be totally different from your student's. If they're walking in knowing this about themselves, they should be at a point where they can tell you what things might not work - opening up this dialogue (with the help of the accessibility office) is key to understanding your student and creating a supportive environment.\n\nETA: involving the accessibility office is important because it creates documentation about the situation. \"Ask them!\" is great advice, but if what they say is not written down somehow, that can lead to situations in which either or both of you end up frustrated. In the extreme case, it could become a legal situation (trust me, I've seen it happen!). It's better to make everything official now, rather than wish you'd done so after you find yourself in a discrimination case, for example. A third party protects you both from this scenario.",

I've worked with middle school students with autism and there's a fine line that you shouldn't cross. While the age is different, in general it's important to be aware when the students gets overwhelmed. With that in mind:\n\n1. Break up tasks into smaller tasks throughout meetings. I would do this by discussing the timeline and then preparing reminder emails to sent (or showing your student). It's not that they don't remember, but getting off task is common (though I wouldn't know if it's the same in adulthood vs adolescence). You could also use sticky notes where the next task to tackle is revealed after the first is done. \n\n2. During meetings, make sure you cover what needs to be discussed and only allow unrelated matters to pop up *after*. Those with autism thrive with order and structure. \n\n3. Provide rewards. This can be as simple as allowing the student to discuss other great things in regards to the subject matter. It gives your student something to look forward to at the end of their work and meetings. \n\n4. Patience is a real virtue. While all students will have their different setbacks, patiently working with this student will make it easier for the previous three suggestions to work. \n\n\nAlso remember at the end of the day that there will be off days. The student could be getting all kinds of support but one thing can throw a whole day or week off.. regardless of how major or minor it is. If you eventually have your student wanting to talk with you about everything, then you've built that trust that is often difficult to learn (at least in adolescents.. for adults this could vary a lot). \n\n\nYou are already showing you care by taking the time to ask for advice here. I think you will do fantastic and thank you for asking such an important question.",
