  "text": "Note: have searched older/similar posts on here but am aware at the effect that brexit/covid has unfortunately had on many funding bodies recently. Have also posted in r/AskAcademiaUK \n\nHello all,\n\nI'm currently an MPhil student in the UK, and am hoping to upgrade for the PhD next year if I can secure funding. I've looked at the usual US to UK sources (Fulbright, Marshall, etc.) and have already ruled out those where I'm not eligible/deadline passed/etc, and I'm planning on applying for AHRC funding. I was moreso looking to see if anyone in this group had any suggestions for other external grants/scholarships I could apply for that I'd be eligible for as a US citizen studying in the UK (or even just to hear others' experiences on how they funded their PhDs)\n\nFor some specifics/bonus details since I know some scholarships can have other odd stipulations, I'm a medievalist (technically musicology but involves enough interdisciplinary work to be somewhat flexible on subject) graduated from a historically women's college for undergrad, and identify as LGBTQ+. (Also if this is the wrong group to post in please let me know if you have any suggestions on some other places to look)\n\nThanks  in advance!",
