  "text": "\\[USA\\] Hey everyone! Hope the semester is treating you all well! I have a question that I'll post here and on r/psychologystudents. So, I have my undergrad in psych and am getting my master's in sociology. I am planning my masters thesis and, in addition to other types of programs (social psych, social work, sociology), I'm considering pursuing a PhD in clinical or counseling psych once I'm done. However, I am not sure if I would be competitive to get into this type of program. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I would have to start from scratch in terms of coursework because of the different theoretical background and I would not be jazzed to do a non-terminal masters right after this one. Can anyone speak to their experiences or know anything about shifting degree type after a masters? Thank you!",

Your Bachelors is Psychology means you likely have most or all of the courses programs look for in applicants.\n\n2. Your Masters in Sociology is, I would guess, a slight positive toward your applications. The coursework will not transfer over. However, your thesis means more research experience (even if it's not psych research), and you can get a letter of rec about your independent research skills. If the research area is related to the research you're hoping to work on as a Ph.D. student, even if the methodologies are different, that can help. And if your grades are good, your Masters degree can convey that you can handle graduate-level coursework.\n\n3. There are a bunch of other considerations in what makes someone competitive, including personal statement, research experiences, letters of rec, GPA, GRE scores, etc. You might consider talking with a psych professor from undergrad who can provide you with more personal guidance.",
