  "title:": "My advisor told me that my work is of insufficient quality two weeks before I need to defend.",
  "text": "Background: I'm a master's student, my thesis topic is in the intersection of social science and engineering.\n\nFeedback with my advisor has been a running issue, mostly due to differences in communication styles and what I perceive to be their inflexibility on their specific feedback style. Generally their feedback is vague, unstructured, and unactionable. Think: highlighting a term and commenting \"what does this mean?\" and then pontificating about it for three paragraphs in a comment, rather than highlighting and commenting \"clarify.\" They're also a big fan of highlighting an entire section or chapter and saying \"dig deeper-- really think about this\" without providing any functional direction to dig in. Kinda the 'if everything is highlighted/nothing is highlighted' dilemma. This irks me, since I have specifically requested clear, actionable feedback on a number of occasions and been flatly ignored. Also, a lot of my UG training was about successful team/leadership communication *specifically including* altering feedback so it is understood and accepted by its audience, and discussing feedback at length to ensure that it is clear and actionable. But they're the advisor, they make the rules. It sucks, but it is how it is. I can deal.  \n\n\nUntil yesterday, when they told me that they aren't ok with my scheduling a thesis defense because they don't consider my work of sufficient quality to defend. Two weeks before the deadline to defend in order to graduate.\n\n\nNow, that sucks. And it would suck at any time. But I need to defend in two weeks unless I want to take a summer term. So it extra sucks. And we've had functionally the same draft for over three months. And I've been pestering for feedback or clarification of feedback *constantly*. So it extra extra sucks. \n\nI'm pretty sure that given these circumstances, my advisor's opinion on the overall quality of my work should have been made clearer *much sooner* than it was. Now my graduation timeline is in jeopardy, and my advisor does not seem to have a problem with this. (Side note, they've had next to no funding for me during my entire degree period, so 85% of my degree has been self funded. They magically have money now, and have said that graduating late is not a problem because they can pay for my summer semester. An extra semester I said I can't afford to take because jobs and job market, but that info kinda... bounced off their eyes like they were made of bullet proof glass.) \n\n\nSo naturally I pulled an all nighter, added 3000 words to my thesis after pestering my advisor for clarification on what specific parts needed improving until they got mad and accused me of not wanting their help (this was probably due to the fact that I was pointing out every time they were asking me to add something that they had asked me to remove in one of our prior... 12 ish editing cycles for this same document. Mostly in order ask what they wanted different because they didn't like this same thing last time. A little because I was mad.) And sent the edited doc back to them, asking if, with minor additional editing, it would be of sufficient quality now? \n\nThis was yesterday at 6 am. They ... Haven't gotten back to me yet. \n\nSo after that rant, I guess my questions, my fellow cogs in the academic machine, are as follows: \n\nWhat can I do? Can anything even be done? Is this normal? Am I justified in my extreme annoyance?  \n\nAny feedback accepted, assuming there isn't a life-altering 2 week deadline attached.\n\nEdit: worth noting that I (as I perceive it) can generally take feedback that amounts to \"you suck\" because \"suck less\" is actionable. I'll probably get huffy for a sec, since hearing that I suck kinda sucks, but I'll pull on my big girl pants and work to suck less. I'm mostly angered by the timing of the \"you suck\" feedback in this instance.\n\nEdit 2 (big): Additional Context: I'm seeing a lot of comments that I am being too reliant on my advisor for myriad reasons, that it's not my advisor's job to hold my hand and feed me answers, that clear and actionable feedback takes too much time and is not their responsibility, etc. I agree to a certain extent with all of those points. I have probably become too reliant on my advisor, and have let them functionally isolate me from the rest of my committee. It isn't my advisors job to handhold me through my own analysis, and while I have a differing opinion on the responsibility of mentors to their mentees where feedback is concerned, feedback does take a lot of time to do and communication styles will always be different. As the advisee it's my responsibility to adjust to my advisor, not vice versa.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that my advisor has demanded my draft for their review on an almost weekly basis. I didn't initiate that. Additionally, I have sought feedback from outside the institution, and while this feedback has been less useful than feedback from experts in the field would be, no one has hinted anything about my writing being unclear, unoriginal, or boring. Additionally, I have never requested that my advisor give me line by line editing feedback on an entire draft until the last few weeks, when I still thought we were on schedule to wrap up and wanted a final lookover. Full draft edits would be a bit of a waste of time in the early stages of a draft before the entire thing was put together. Initially, I only sent them sections of the draft that I had worked on that week, like \"methods\" or \"results.\" They responded by specifically requesting the entire draft and then sent me line by line edits which alternated between three paragraphs of thinking about one word or highlighting multiple pages or the entire document and requesting I \"dig deeper\". Overtime, they also repeatedly asked me to remove things, or move them around, only to ask the next week to add them back in or move it back. \n\nThis is when I started asking for clarification-- many of the comments made no sense in the context of the document. I could tell they wanted me to do/change/think about *something* but functionally not what that something was. And I couldn't tell if they wanted content in, out, or edited, or how. And puzzling this out has been very frustrating. I believe I commented somewhere below that asking for clarification on what direction to \"dig deeper\" in when \"dig deeper\" refers to 25 contiguous pages of draft is not asking for handholding in my book. \n\nFinally, as a result of not getting clarification on \"dig deeper\" I've done a ton additional analysis that has turned out to be a waste of time. Time analysis, individual item analysis, ranking analysis, high-score testing, analysis by industry designation grouping, analysis by literature-based coding, analysis of the entire set, of individual organizations, by market category, on and on and on. Every time my advisor told me to \"dig deeper\" I thought \"I've missed something important in the analysis, how can I reexamine my existing stuff and do new stuff for a different perspective?\" And ended up wasting time on lots of different things to look at, none of which ended up in the paper because there was nothing there. \n\n(Side note: advisor demanded that I write this new analyses into the paper every time and send it back to them, arguing that I needed to show them that this wasn't useful in the paper and not just tell them there's nothing there. I fail to see why we couldn't have just gone over it in one of our regular weekly meetings in five minutes instead of me wasting time writing something that will definitely be deleted and them wasting time reading it in order to delete it.) \n\nIt turns out my advisor meant \"connect your analysis to the literature in your writing more explicitly.\" Which, yes, that's extremely valuable. And something that I'm totally capable of doing, without being fed answers on how these things connect. I did the lit review, I'm familiar with the content, and drawing those lines is easy. It would have been equally as easy earlier, assuming I understood that *that* was the key missing element in the first place. I see no reason why \"you're missing explicit connections between the literature and your analysis\" is an unrealistic bit of clarification to have liked to have months ago.",

      "text": "Yes, your frustration is justified, but it doesn't seem like your advisor is overall malicious or toxic (unless this goes deeper than thesis revisions). As you pointed out it seems like this is mostly down to a clash of personal styles. Some advisors intentionally refrain from giving specific, actionable feedback to grad-level students because they want them to take ownership of the problem and figure out a solution rather than just check off tasks. (I knew a faculty member who liked to say that a grad student's main goal was to learn how to think.) In a generous scenario, perhaps your advisor takes this approach. In a less generous scenario, perhaps they are just lousy at communication and feedback. At this point I think all you can do is try to push through, get done, and get out, even if it winds up being a semester later than you wanted. Hopefully the reason they haven't replied to your revisions yet is because they are actually reading what you wrote and giving it a fair evaluation towards allowing you to defend on schedule.",

I advise senior theses every spring and so much of my editing has to boil down to this for a couple of reasons:\n\n-I simply am not going to spend the time to line by line edit tens of pages per student when advising multiple students with multiple drafts per semester\n\n-Moreso, though: if I were to do line by line edits, it isn't allowing the student to synthesize why I've asked them to do certain edits. If I say \"change this sentence to read more like xyz\", then I'll just get them swapping out their sentence for \"xyz\". If instead, I say \"this sentence is lacking specificity and comes off like you could be describing a number of different issues. Could you instead use specific phrases like xyz or abc here?\", they can make a decision and also then apply that logic to the rest of their paper after they see a few pages of line edits. The true line edits (comma placement and specific word or phrasing choice) should be done be peer proofreaders and not the advisor in my opinion/experience. In grad school, we sometimes spent lab journal club days helping out with specifically this task which was extremely helpful for me as a future teacher and for the others in their personal research and writing.",

They don\u2019t seem to want to learn or think, they just want specific direction down to details of what they should do at any given moment. So when I am mentoring them on writing manuscripts, sometimes we go through rounds and rounds of feedback and the manuscript is still bad- because short of writing something yourself, it is very hard to explicitly direct someone how to write an entire manuscript sentence by sentence. Like, if I suggest they add something to the Results section, they will add that one specific piece to the results section and consider it done because they \u201cdid what I asked\u201d. But they won\u2019t add the now relevant pieces to the methods section, discussion section, abstract, or reread everything to make sure they don\u2019t have to make any conceptual changes- because I \u201cdidn\u2019t ask.\u201d So then I have to edit their results section and then go through and basically rewrite pieces throughout with the updated information. There is just no ownership- it becomes about me giving them a to do list instead of them writing a manuscript, and that isn\u2019t academic growth to me.\n\nThe thesis document is something that the grad student needs to take control on and own. If I sent someone feedback that was like \u201cdig deeper in this chapter\u201d, I\u2019d at least want them to try to address it- not to constantly schedule follow-up zoom calls to discuss the specific details of what it means to dig deeper in relation to these specific pages. It sounds like the advisor is doing a lot of hand-holding.",

It's kinda hard when I'm already very frustrated. \n\nThat being said, I personally don't think that asking for clarification on \"dig deeper,\" when \"dig deeper\" refers to 25 contiguous pages, is necessarily asking for handouts. More of a \"can you point to the place that needs deeper digging?\" kind of a thing. It isn't as though I'm asking them to hold my hand while I read bar charts and tell me what the biggest bar means. Then again, I'm all about optimizing my time management by directing my efforts in a specific direction rather than flinging myself in 20 directions at once.\n\nAlso, point on communication: when I hear \"dig deeper\" I think \"I need to reexamine my data analysis for new directions or something I missed.\" It has since come to light that my advisor meant \"connect your analysis to your literature explicitly in your writing.\" -- valuable, and definitely necessary in a paper, but not at all what comes to mind when I think of digging deeper. Also definitely something that I'm capable of doing without assistance once it becomes clear to me that that is what I need.",

Being helped to understand what needs changing is not the same as actually changing it. Just making requested edits is a LOT of work. Grad students are in school to LEARN, and the best way to learn is to actually get concrete feedback on what's wrong.

      "text": "I don't think it's fair about the 2-week notice. But you are missing something fundamental in the way you are approaching this feedback and your expectations for \"good communication.\"\n\nIt sounds like the problem is your writing. And writing is hard to learn, to be sure, but you are failing to communicate properly in your writing. So this whole \"I am an excellent communicator from undergrad\" is a bit silly since your writing is leaving people confused. You should change your mindset a bit and think more about how you communicate to an unknown reader. Because that's what writing is \u2014 not a report of the work you did (which seems like what you think you are writing) but a story you tell someone about your topic. If any reader says \"what does this mean?\" it means exactly the same as \"clarify this for the reader.\" It means that term or idea is coming out of nowhere and is not introduced properly for any reader and is confusing. It means \"this area is not up to snuff.\" A comment of \"dig deeper\" means that the reader is left desiring more nuance and you are painting in too broad strokes with generalizations, and that makes the reader distrust you. A common strain of advice in professional writing circles is that readers (even professional authors and editors) know when something is off but they don't know how to fix it. And it's not their job to fix it because that's the work of the author \u2014 how to figure out how to write their own ideas clearly.\n\nFurther, when something is confusing, there are many possible solutions. You seem to be approaching this like a checklist of \"things to do\"  \u2014 define this term, cite this author \u2014 when writing isn't really like that. \n\nThere are ways to teach writing, and it seems like your advisor doesn't really know how to. It's not a perfect science because writing is so variable, but a good prof should be able to notice patterns and help you break bad habits. But here's the secret: a lot of profs just \"write by ear\" and don't know how to teach it. They think it's \"just a thing you know\" because they grew up in an environment like that. That's a bigger problem that I have sympathy for, to be sure, but it's really common. It is my opinion that this needs to be worked out on an international scale, but change is slow.\n\nSo you'll have to teach yourself. I recommend you pore over The Craft of Research (which discusses how to introduce and format information palatably) and maybe The Art of Styling Sentences and The Sense of Style by Pinker.

      "text": "It's normal enough that I've heard about it multiple times in the past. The best thing at this point is just to push though because you're so close to finishing. The general rule of thumb for edits is to allow your advisor/committee at least two weeks. So I can tell you right now that the turn-around you're expecting is unrealisic if you sent updates yesterday. Also, I get that you're venting here, but if you've shown any of this upset with your advisor then it's no wonder they aren't all that receptive. If you feel like they give you conflicting feedback then send them an email following each draft summarizing the feedback you recieved and ask whether they agree that thats what you should have gotten out of their comments. If they agree then you have a paper trail. If they don't then that gives them the opportunity to clarify. It also sounds like sit-down/zoom meetings would have been beneficial for feedback in your case.\n\nUltimately, it's the student's job to manage time and finish the thesis. It's always stressful. It's always hard. I don't know how the thesis writing process has gone for you as a whole or what your working relationship with your advisor was like before this, but I'd urge you to take all this with a grain of salt because at this point there really isnt anything else you can do.",

Hence the sudden offer of funding coupled with the extension. Ultimately, you are not getting feedback that amounts to \"you suck\", but you *are* getting feedback that amounts to: \"this masters thesis needs to suck less.\"\n\nMy guess is that you are going to get nowhere with questions about \"actionable\" feedback. That's not really the way a lot of social sciences (and particularly humanistic social sciences) work. Lots of academics are simply trained like artificial neural networks -- someone forces you to read 500 articles and tells you which ones are good and which ones are bad, until you have internalized whatever implicit criteria are at play and can more or less accurately apply them, but struggle to specify them. \n\nBut it's also not clear that knowing these criteria would help in a given situation. Often it's a case of: if you can't already see what's wrong, you won't be able to fix it. Perhaps the most common (and most damning) feedback about a lot of work is simply: it's predictable, it's obvious, it's superficial. From the perspective of an advisor, it's hard to know how to express those criticisms without being very, very blunt, and even harder to know how to provide actionable feedback.\n\nObviously none of us can know if that's the case in your situation -- your advisor could simply be a bad advisor and neither interested in nor capable of helping you. There are lots of those out there as well. You also left your field pretty vague, so I have no idea if any of what I'm saying applies.\n\nBut two actionable steps, instead of continually asking your advisor \"is it OK now?\", might be:  \n\n1) ask: \"What are 3 things someone who is smart and doesn't like me would criticize about this essay?\"\n\n2) ask: \"Can you think of any articles on this topic that I could use as models for how to approach this issue?\"",

Generally I ask very specific questions unless the question is \"what have I missed here.\" I've also regularly sought feedback on this paper outside the institution, and frequently read it over myself. \n\nI agree that I can probably be more prepared and that no one is going to give me handouts.

In a way, both of these people are your advisor. \n\nLike I mentioned before, many people in your advisor's position only do this part of their job because they absolutely have to. They also spend a lot of time hearing about how great they are. They have tons of people telling them how intelligent and important they are, how important their work is. \n\nSo we have a very educated middle aged person with a stunted emotional intelligence and an over inflated sense of importance. Your advisors version of his steak being over cooked, is you telling him his feedback and communication style is insufficient. But instead of yelling at you like a waiter, he throws a tantrum by giving you even LESS attention. \n\nWhat you can do to prepare in this instance is basically, \"How do I outsmart/trick this person into giving me what I need?\", \"What things do I need to take into account when receiving communication from this person?\", \"What can I do to make our interaction seem of benefit to them?\". It sounds evil, but people with low EI almost never notice when you find a way to use their bullshit against them. A lot of being a successful adult is being a successful detective and using all the facts to see the whole picture rather than just one section.\n\nIn terms of setting and reminding them of deadlines, that's kind of expected and all your responsibility. Also \"I think I missed the deadline for this advisor twice for this semester... once on account of another project having a sooner deadline and getting higher priority\", This is likely how your advisor feels about your work as well. If you've missed two deadlines in one semester, you're not going to be viewed as someone they deem worthy of their time. Obviously surgery can't be helped! But the second reason is a big yikes. \n\nTo summarize, you told a person with an inflated sense of self importance and low emotional intelligence that the way they communicate isn't good enough for you, broke two deadlines you set with them, and are wondering why they won't be more helpful. I guess be mentally prepared to play along with other people's bullshit (to accomplish your goals, not without reason)",

      "text": "I had a similar experience for my master's thesis as well. Except here, my advisor wouldn't even say that I had to \"look into it\" or \"clarify\", they would simply shake their head and go like, \"this isn't done\". When I would probe further and ask why? What's wrong? What can I do? They wouldn't reply, just shake their head a bit more. \nSince I had a brick wall for an advisor, I took note of what my batchmates' advisors would tell them. I asked some of them (only those whom I trusted of course) regarding a few points here and there and wrote my thesis.\nIn the end the committee ended up liking my thesis enough to give me an overall A. (Despite the grading breakup being 50-50 between the advisor and committee, and I know how \"well\" I was graded by my own advisor)\n\nOf course, I don't know how the system works in your university, but in mine we would ask other university faculty or PIs of private labs to be a part of the thesis defence committee. So thanks to this, the advisors don't exactly get to pressure the committee or influence them into grading you poorly.\nOr, in hindsight, someone could get influenced, maybe I got a bit lucky that my advisor did not/could not do that.\n\nSo, my suggestion would be, if it is possible, ask your batchmates for some help. If even 1 can spare sometime to read through, it helps.\nHowever make sure it's someone you can trust completely.",

However, one of the most valuable experiences in graduate school is learning how to deal with people who think completely different about intellectual approaches to a particular problem. The one thing I think is inexcusable is telling you 2 weeks before the fact the work is not up to snuff. Full disclosure, I did that to a student 3 weeks before defending  after they ignored my feedback and skipped a meeting. That was 15 years ago - it was a mistake - and it wasn\u2019t the resulting department brouhaha that made an impression on me (the student took it all the way to the provost) but how my late evaluation did not serve the student or the project. So now, all my feedback is put in the context of whether this work is acceptable or not. It was a hard lesson and I make sure students who are not cutting it know after the first \u201cturn-in\u201d early in the semester. It helps light a fire, and I find myself having a lot less problems in later drafts when a student knows where they stand. It might be necessary for you to take him up on the summer offer - you definitely should have been treated more professionally but now you just have to get through it. I wish you good luck.",

This happens in all walks of life and professions, from MDs who feel the \"how dare s/he?!\" offense when a patient suggests an alternative to their proffered ddx/rx/tx to the convenience store cashier who decides the store is completely out of a product because they simply don't feel like going to the back room to replenish the stock of Snicker's bars because the customer is behaving like a d*ck.\n\n\nOne professor I had felt the need to name-drop in just about every class, e.g., \"When I was at lunch with Nancy Pelosi last week ...\"\n\nA mentee of mine showed me a critical letter from a pastor - from a chuch she no longer attended - which forbade her from discussing his criticism of her with anyone else. To just about anyone, this is an unreasonable and \"weird\" position to take.\n\nPeople are weird and people have issues; this includes academics.\n\nI'm inclined to believe this is a case of missed communication, the prof thinking \"Well, I told OP X, I don't know why s/he doesn't attend to X!\" while the student may hear \"Prof told me about (generality X), but I have no idea what that means!\" E.g., \"Dig deeper.\"\n\nWhile you may be completely correct, I'm not as inclined to dismiss this student's drafts as \"crappy\" and the student's behavior as \"annoying\" and \"difficult\" as quickly as you seem to be - I simply don't have the data to do so. \n\nI'm also not reading that the student is demanding to defend (I could have missed this), but mostly dismay, frustration, and helplessness, with a good measure of \"it's not fair, I'm trying my best!\" thrown in.\n\nYou may be right.

These are  possiblities, and it's rare that situations are black and white. \n\nTo imply as strongly as you seem to be that it must be one or the is a false dichotomy, at least, and a straw man, at most.\n\nMy last reply simply allowed for the possiblity that something else may be going on. You questioned that, I provided examples of that happening both in academia, and in everyday life. \"Weird\"-ness happens.\n\nI believe you may be assuming I'm holding thoughts and perceptions  that I do not and assuming other \"facts not in evidence,\" e.g., \"difficult,\" \"annoying,\" \"student who\u2019s (sic)\" written \"crappy drafts.\"\n\nI have no evidence that some here are \"obvious\" \"experience (sic)\" mentors, either. \n\nI completely agree with you about discovering \"what would work moving forward.\" \n\nThis may not be an issue completely of OP providing a product that meets the standards of one advisor and OP crying \"foul!!!\" when OP seems unable to deliver, but might be OP needing to understand that while some in academia view themselves as educators who seek to grow others both generally, and in their discipline, others in academia view themselves as evaluators who demand and judge performance. \n\n\nI completely agree: this is about finding out what would work moving forward, not just with this thesis/academic pursuit, but in other situations OP may find OPself (to form an awkward neologism).\n\nI hope you noted the qualifiers, this time.\n\nLet me state broadly and conclusively, just to make sure: I know neither of the participants nor their personalities/bents (whether someone is unreasonable or \"annoying,\" I have read none of OP's thesis or seen the quality of any of the work be able to discern whether it's of sufficient quality or not - and if it's in a field unknown to me, I certainly wouldn't be able to weigh in many ways other than in measures of format, grammar, and style.\n\nTherefore, I'm attempting to not state anything conclusively (though I may have failed in some measure, at least from what I'm reading in your replies).\n\n(Apologies for the probably disjointed writing; I've been interrupted by others while typing.)",

      "text": "Some of these comments are bizarrely sympathetic to your advisor, which was not my takeaway from reading this. One giant red flag here is not letting you make use of your other committee members. (Unless some of them are supposed to be \"opponents\" at the defense, as some schools do.)\n\nDoes your advisor have PhD students also? If so, they've probably prioritized them. I had the same advisor for my MA thesis and PhD dissertation, and it was abundantly clear in retrospect that nobody cared about the MA students or their projects. Advisement was mostly a \"yeah, that's nice\", but what you're experiencing is on that same spectrum.\n\nIs there a lab involved? That's usually behind the stories in this sub of students being kept around longer than they want to be. \n\nI'm not sure if there's any way to prevent the summer semester. But if I were in your shoes, I would figure out which of the committee members is the most helpful to their own students, and run your work past them. The students in my department who had a better time with advisement (including me) saw the committee as tools in a toolbox who all were good at different things, rather than advisement being a general skill available from all. And perhaps another committee member may know what your primary advisor means by some of the vaguer comments. They have probably worked together on projects before. In my department, we all knew that when Prof. A was being unreasonable, we could get Prof. B to talk to them for us.",

Anyone who is at that point in the process who has not heard what is being said for the rest of the years, rarely listens to this sage advice at that point either.  And the reasons we draw straws is becasue we are going to get a litany of why the mentor was remiss, and why it is unfair, and why this is all someone elses fault , and the rest of the students also think this is unfair.  And you can be very , very no nonsense about it and say, we also think this is not up to snuff at all, and then it is the mentor AND the committee that are all in it together trying to make OP not graduate.\n\n\nWe have metrics.

Idk about you but I couldn\u2019t justify having someone tell me multiple times that my feedback is unclear or I actionable to the point where we\u2019re going around and around in circles with revisions and not actively make a change. Sounds like a bad adviser to me. But then on top of that to tell someone two week before defending that you don\u2019t think their work is up to it? Idk the timeline in their program but to me that\u2019s shocking. And it goes back to feedback because I think the adviser should have been able to convey to them long before that the quality of work in its present state was not acceptable and needed dramatic improvement in order to defend and then actually sit down and make actionable steps to reach that goal. Seems like every step of the way ops adviser has failed to help, to push, to support, and is now blindsiding then in the 11th hour which has cause op to panic write without any real idea of whether or not the new writing is even helpful enough to raise the original status.  And if it was, why wasn\u2019t the feedback that they needed to write more? It just seems like everything has been vague and op has been left chasing down their adviser and guessing and pushing for what to do next. \n\nIdk their exact situation but I sympathize because I\u2019m in a very similar situation and it\u2019s kind of ridiculous how schools/advisers/professors at a grad level can offer so little In the way of feedback/effort/support and no letter how productive or responsive you\u2019ve been, it\u2019s still on you.

And it\u2019s wild that they can get paid and still not do that\n\nEdit: penalty helps to mention that my program isn\u2019t research based but taught. Architecture. And there is scary little teaching going on. So little that there\u2019s been a large wave of withdrawals from the program. So in may be biased from my experience",
