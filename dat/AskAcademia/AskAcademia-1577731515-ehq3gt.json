  "title:": "Advice for a young professor dealing with academic burnout and needing to revive a flagging career?",
  "text": "I started this job four years ago and they have been really hard ones for me. Between the demands of my academic job, a difficult department/institution, and some really tough family stuff, I am just wrung out. \n\nI am the only child of elderly parents who have had a continuous set of alternating health emergencies over the last four years. Two or even three times a year a parent required a long hospitalization and a complicated recovery that I had to take care of. A year ago my father passed away leaving the control of everything in the family to me (my mother has dementia among other chronic issues). Settling his estate and making sure my mother is cared for has been a very big job (not to mention dealing with the grief when I have a bit of time to do so, we were very close).\n\nSuperficially, my department was understanding, saying to take the time I needed and family comes first, etc. In reality (and perhaps understandably), though, they saw my reduced productivity and attendance in the department and were not pleased. I just can't be the high-performing academic they want. I kept thinking that after each crisis, things would smooth out and I really get things done, but then another would come up. I've had a few painful and frank conversations with my chair and the provost. I think they could have been more supportive, but they weren't, and it's better not to think of what could have been and concentrate on the regular situation.\n\nI've managed to do all the service and teaching required, but that is not valued much. I tried to revive my research many times with collaborations and taking on new students. None of the students have worked out, they learned a lot but I ended up needing to redo all their work. (This could be my fault as well, not supervising them enough.)  I have a lot of great collaborations, but that work has also been massively disrupted by my family issues, and they have lost patience with me (also understandably). Just down to it, much of the issue is that I do not have the energy and focus research requires.\n\nI need a new job, I just cannot perform at the level needed here, but I find myself feeling too burned out to go through the faculty job search process again. Also, I have not published in *years* and my last grant ran out in 2017, I have not had a new one (applied for a couple but no luck). My CV looks pretty sad right now. I should be manuscript-writing my ass off, job-applying my ass off, grant-writing my ass off, but I find I can barely get four hours of work done in a day.\n\n(As an aside, I'm not alone in all this. I have a husband, but he actually has had almost identical issues with his family and is also exhausted and grief-stricken. Additionally, he hates his job, whereas for me it feels more like my job hates me. I have seen a therapist and a psychiatrist. I am on anti-depressants and though I am not really depressed I think it maybe helps somewhat. They have both been sympathetic and helpful in some ways, but the consensus among them is that things are just really hard and my issues are a normal response to continuous stress.)\n\nAny advice on how to recover and revive?",

          "text": "Yes, definitely. I did take the FMLA leave in blocks (as it's allowed) when things were at their worst and I was taking care of a parent 24/7. Stopping the tenure clock works when there is one big thing you need to deal with, so we never had an official set-up like that. I probably should have brought it up to the chair or the provost, but at many points in this process I was not functioning optimally and just focusing on functioning adequately. While the chair assured me several times that she felt I was doing very well considering everything I was dealing with, she still feels that my research output just isn't good enough after all this time. \n\nI could definitely change my position to teaching faculty with a research associate status that allows me to stay a PI but has no research expectations. The issue is, if I take that (and I will) I'm still so burned out I feel like i can barely work.",

      "text": "My own problems haven't been to the same intensity, but I can relate to the feeling of constant stress and the feeling that your job hates you. Similarly my partner hated his job. I had very different circumstances and was at a very different stage of my career, but having gone through that and working outside of academia for some years have taught me that change isn't something to avoid. What stopped our torture what a career change and moving away.\n\nEverything you described about your work situation tells me that unless you really, really, REALLY want to continue at this institution, you need to find some remaining scraps of joy, motivation, inspiration for what you loved about this job and apply elsewhere. \n\nYour first time going through an academic job hunt was likely quite involved. Remember that you are now networked and established. Draw on your network and experience. And even honestly consider leaving academia. In the end it's just a job. I know being an academic tends to be more of a way of life / a lifestyle career, but you need a job that can flex with your life needs. With the relationships at your current institution having been damaged, you will have a mountain of expectations and prejudices to overcome. You will likely find relief in starting anew elsewhere.\n\nBest of luck. Don't be afraid to be \"selfish\".",

Moving to a CC with a 4/4 load (or worse) might get you free from research entirely, but at what cost? In most cases as the teaching expectations go up so do the demands from students and expectations for mentoring/advising, which are also quite time consuming.  Almost any way you approach it a pre-tenure faculty job is going to require 60+ hours/week if you're going to achieve tenure in most places.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear about your situation. I'm in the last month of dealing with something similar - mom with dementia in hospice, dad with dementia died 18 months ago, fewer medical emergencies but I have kids. I had tenure, so lower stakes. \n\nI did a specific caregiver's stress therapy that I found helpful. It was based on ACT, acceptance and commitment therapy (I think). The idea was to improve skills to deal with stress rather than open-ended talking. \n\nPart of what they worked on was building resilience through exercise and social support. You're probably saying you don't have time for exercise and hanging out with friends; that was my initial reaction too. But I started going for walks and trying to find time for coffee with people I liked that I had lost contact with. (Careful with this - some people I thought were friends didn't expect a real answer in response to 'how is it going?' and others just wanted to tell me how bad my life was.)\n\nPart of the therapy was also about clarifying priorities and what you can really get done in a day. There was some care taking that was probably excessive (\"you're trying to be a good son, but your parents wouldn't want taking care of them to destroy you, your career and your relationship with your children\"). \n\nA few questions that grow out of this - \n\nAre there activities you are doing for dept and/or institution that suck time and don't really matter much to them or you? Are there ways to pull back on teaching and service - even for a semester or two - that give you some space? Not necessarily space to write - just personal space. \n\nIs there personal money or an inheritance that would allow you to hire in some additional help? This could be to help with parents, cook meals for you, clean, or start some low level lit reviews/pulling articles, etc? \n\nGood luck. Feel free to PM - happy to talk more.",

          "text": "Thanks for this! I think I may be on the other end of a lot this now. The therapy has been helpful and I did hire a full-time aid to take care of my mother. I worked something out with my university that I will be sort of downgraded to teaching faculty but with research associate status so I can keep my lab and have PI status for grants. And the teaching load is relatively light, just one course that will be about 50% material I have taught before. \n\nSo, no tenure, and this isn't really a career position anymore, but I potentially have the room to get things back on track if I could get the snap back in my garters. I am just left with the fallout of dealing with all that stress over so many years. I find therapy isn't really the place to help with professional burnout, particularly the academic type.",

The stress from academia will always be there no matter the institution and you\u2019ll still have your family to tend to.\n\nYes, the academic job is a way of life but it shouldn\u2019t consume you, nor all your time\u2014I don\u2019t think anything should. Remember to take care of your body and mind. Do you have interests or hobbies? Consider participating in stress-reducing activities offered at your institution (yoga, tai chi, meditation\u2026 these things can be done for only 15-20 minutes before sleep!). Aimlessly walking for a bit of time always helped me when my mind needed a refresh, too!\n\nDon\u2019t focus on the hours you\u2019ve \u201conly\u201d worked but on the things you\u2019ve completed in that time. Make a list and write down anything you\u2019ve done in that time of work, no matter how small the task (this can also be a list of anything you\u2019ve completed throughout the day). You need to get in the right mindset to combat the burnout. \n\nYou got this! You\u2019ve already made it this far. I\u2019m hoping for your wellbeing. Please keep us updated.",
