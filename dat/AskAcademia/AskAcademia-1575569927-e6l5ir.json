  "title:": "My referee just sent me,\"Do not apply to any more universities. I have already wasted enough time on this\"",
  "text": "I am an undergrad student applying for PhD positions. This is the **timeline** till now:\n\n**Jan 2019:** This referee offers a project that seems interesting but out of the comfort zone for most students. I am the only one who applies for it, but he tells me we need a group of at least 4.\n\n**March 2019:** I gather the group of 4 myself, and we start the project. One of us drops out, we still power through.\n\n**April-July 2019:** I work under his direct supervision, and spend a lot of one on one time with him, going the extra mile.\n\n**July 2019:** He is impressed with our end result, I ask him for a recommendation letter, he agrees and offers to tell the other professor involved in the project about my need for recommendation.\n\n**September 2019:** I email him that I will start applying for positions, and that I expect applying to about 10 universities.\n\n**October- November 2019:** I apply to 11 universities, with a space of 3-6 days in between, so that the emails won't spam them.\n\n**December 2019:** I remind him about deadlines, since he hadn't submitted any of the letters.\n\n**Yesterday**: he submits the first letter, after missing its deadline with 3 days.\n\n**Today:** He submits in total 8 letters and leaves out 3 universities, tells me he will not do more because this has wasted his time enough.\n\nI am really hurt by his email, because I have been preparing for this for more than a year, building a strong profile, and only asked people who saw my motivation and hard work to write the recommendation letters. It feels bad, that for him all of this is just a waste of time. I do not know if I did something wrong, or if I am applying to too many universities.  How should I reply to him? Should I seek another referee on a 2-weeks-notice for the remaining universities?\n\n**Tl;dr:** Referee tells me he does not want to submit any more recommendation letters after submitting 8 on the same day (even though they were sent in a span of two months). How should I deal with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important Edit:**\n\n\\- I sent an email to my referee apologizing for the inconvenience, and explaining my situation. He claims that he did not receive anymore requests, even though I provided his information in the same way for the other 8 letters, and my other recommenders have already submitted their recommendations. This means that if I resend the requests this would count as \"applying for more universities\" according to him. \n\n\\- I will try to ask another referee on a really short notice, which puts me in a shitty situation, but I guess at this point any letter is better than no letter, since many universities will not even consider my application without 3 letters. \n\n\\- 11 is not a lot in my field. They are not spam applications, I spent months planning them and choosing schools. My field is very active and a lot of people are working in it right now, so there are a lot of opportunities that suit me. Admission stats for these schools are between 5%-20%, so no matter how good I am, I still need luck and numbers. \n\n\\- My applications are not pointless. I have a very decent profile as an undergrad, and all of these programs are direct-entry PhDs. I will not be compared with people with a master's.",

      "text": "At this point you have two options: find another referee for these last few schools, or try and help this referee submit the letters if they are having difficulty. \n\nTo those applicants in the future thinking of applying to nearly a dozen schools: Be very clear about the number of schools you are applying to, push the letter submission emails all at once so none get lost, and offer to help the letter writer with the submission process.  Most letter writers are going to submit the same letter for every school with names changed, they might even have  a template they use for all their undergrad students, it's the submission process that can be wonky and difficult between schools.",

      "text": "I'm not taking the professor's side, but in the future I would recommend first sending your letter writers an organized list of everything you're applying for, with deadlines, and then submit all the applications on your end at around the same time, as much as possible. That way they can do it all on their own schedule. Spacing the applications out by 3-6 days actually makes it much more annoying, because (a) they never know when it's going to stop, (b) you're giving them much less time to do the later ones on the list, and (c) the emails won't be grouped together by date, so it may be easier to forget one or two.",

              "text": "In many cases, a single letter can be tweaked slightly to fit all of the different programs. So if you'd sent all the requests in one go, they could have made those minor adjustments to the one letter all in one go and submitted them all at once. But because it's spaced out they have to find the letter, familiarise themselves with its contents, and then make the small changes every single time a request comes through. It's a lot more \"overhead\". \n\nInstead of a couple of hours of their time one night, it becomes 30-60 minutes of their time every night for a week.",

I state in the letter that I write a lot of recommendations and I am keeping it brief but honest for the sake of my own time. If I only wrote for one or two students a year, I'd be long winded. But, I write for many because my field's entry level degree is at the graduate level.

I think that he was extremely out of line to say something so rude to you, and to put you in a difficult position with your last 3 applications. Sometimes we can't really help how others treat us - it is more a reflection of him than you. I suspect that he is moody and taking things out on you. I actually was in a very similar situation when I was applying for positions as an assistant professor. I only applied to a few positions, but my letter writer and former advisor got really upset at me when I emailed her to remind her of an upcoming deadline. I thought she hadn't submitted a letter because the online portal indicated that, but it turned out that she sent in a hard copy since she was struggling with using the portal. She actually got so mad that she told me that she wouldn't be writing me a letter again. Obviously, this response is overblown because I couldn't have known what happened, but sometimes people misplace their frustrations.\n\n2. Regarding the issue of organization, yes, a list with all the deadlines and submission methods is helpful and should be provided. That said, as a professor, I would not expect an undergraduate to know all the best practices. I think that professors who agree to write letters should make clear their expectations to students. One could simply ask the student for such a list. \n\n3. I think 11 universities is a great number for an undergraduate applying to PhD programs because of how selective PhD programs are. I was advised to apply to around 10 myself, and I did. Additionally, while others are mentioning \"match\", it's not guaranteed that the faculty you are applying to work with are available/taking students that year, making it very risky to apply to just a few programs. \n\n4. In terms of what you could do, you could apologize profusely for the inconvenience (even though it's not your fault) and thank him for the time he spent. You could also ask him if there is anything you could have done to make the submission process easier for him. You could consider explaining to him the situation that you're in now and see if he might understand and write you the last 3 letters after all. If you think that he is not the understanding type, perhaps you can ask the other professor for a letter or for advice (in a tactful way).",

Only our top 1% students have an ever so slight chance of getting one of those. Heck, none of us PIs would put a non-stellar UG student forward for a competitive PhD position.

It is super annoying to spend 10x30minutes of my already super short time on stuff that I know for sure is for the bin. It's not like there was a slight chance - there was absolutely no chance. \n\nAsk why the prof doesn't want to do it. They might have a reason.",

          "text": "I have seen someone with a poor undergrad transcript from a not-really-reputable college and limited research experience get into MIT in my field. They spent one of their summers in a lab at MIT with a professor from their home country. Apparently this professor saw the motivation in this student and wanted to accept into their lab as a PhD student. Plus the program was actively trying to recruit more Hispanic/Latina students to address representation issue in the field (they accept one or two student every year, which is commendable). They got rejected by every. single. school they applied to other than MIT (even the \"safety\" ones). \n\nYou can guess they won't get accepted (I mean most PhD programs have <10% acceptance rate anyway so yeah they likely wont get accepted) but you cannot *know* they won't get accepted. And this is a good thing: if everyone hired PhD students based on some formula, we would be missing some serious talent/potential and likely exacerbating the representation and bias issues and ignoring people that followed more convoluted paths in their education/ career due to different circumstances. If the student wanted to take their chances, they should be allowed to. \n\nIt is your right not to want to keep writing letters. They do take a lot of time and professors are busy with other administrative tasks as well. But in this case you should be communicating your expectations and limits to the student so they can find another person in time to support their other applications. And if they didnt let you know of their plans early on, if you communicate that \"give me a list of 10 schools you want to apply to and I will write for those only\", they will know they are responsible for the rest of the applications to find suppirt for, because you clearly communicated your expectations early on.",

Applications for PhDs should be tailored. A student who applies to 15 programs is not going to tailor their application, and will have weak reasons for attending each one.\n\nAbsolutely this. I applied to 6 (4 DTPs and 2 funded projects) and that was on the high end of my friends applying at the same time - many people applied to only 2 or 3. Finding a good fitting project/program and tailoring the applications is hard going - mass applications are never going to be as well tailored.",

These website applications are somewhat obnoxious for us- in the past, we could write a letter once, maybe customize it slightly for your top 2-3 preferences, and just submit it. Some of these can take around 20 minutes each. I definitely would not have over 200 minutes to spend on one student, unfortunately, especially at this time of year.\n\nI would reach out and apologize if you have overstepped and ask what the referee advises that you do moving forward. It is possible that he is also questioning your choices of programs- hard to tell. If there are one or a few of these remaining ones that are really important to you, if it seems like this was just a frustration answer, I would consider asking the individual to complete those 1-2 applications. But, if you have a good alternative, that would work, too.\n\nEdited to add- this is definitely a rude response from the referee. Email can be too blunt, and a lot of academics are not good at communication. But, this is definitely not an appropriate tone for an email from a professor to a student, unless previous warnings had been given about how many recommendations would be provided.",

If your student does good work, then you are ethically obligated, in my opinion, to give them a reference. They are certainly entitled to one, assuming they performed competently. Any of my students I take on get references according to their skill level and performance, and I budget time for this.\n\nFor a converse perspective, in Canada a student has to consent to their advisor for their advisor to claim they supervised them. The advisor cannot put on their CV or website that they advised so-and-so without an email or a signed consent form. Imagine a student telling their advisor that \"they aren't entitled to have credit for advising them, since it's not in the research job description\". That would be ludicrous! It absolutely would screw the advisor over.\n\nThere are many unwritten rules in academia that have to be followed for the system to work, and this talk of \"entitlement\" is just asinine. If you aren't willing to recommend students that work well for you, then you are in the wrong line of work.",

When a student who has expressed no interest in graduate school decides they're applying to 15 programs with a deadline this weekend, that's going to be hard to meet. \n\nSome comments even imply that a student asking at the last minute shouldn't be a problem, because since it's part of the job we should all know it's coming and be prepared. \n\nPersonally, I've never turned down a student for a letter, even when they're disorganized and ask last minute. But I also think it's perfectly fine for my colleagues to set limits on things like the number of letters they will write, or what students need to meet in terms of requirements (a full organized list a month in advance, drafts of letters, etc.) for them to be willing to write on their behalf. \n\nI dislike when people minimize a task because \"it's part of the job\", or increasingly \"it's what you get paid to do\".",

Top programs are highly competitive and it is a total crapshoot whether or not you will be accepted. I applied to 14 programs at 13 schools. In the end, I was accepted at only 3 programs, only one of which had been on my initial short list, as a back-up plan. I didn't get into my favorite program, whose application I tailored all my writing to the most, which wasn't a \"reach\" school for me and should have been a slam dunk. I ended up at a top program at a top institution in the country, but it was one that I had tacked on at the end of the application process because I was scared about my chances of getting in anywhere. Granted, it really was a good fit, and that is why I had added it. But if someone had told me 10 was too many and if I had listened to them I would have gotten into a single, lower-tier school, in a program that was less of a fit for me.",

With PhD applications, you typically reach out to prospective advisors to gauge their interest and see if you can fit in their lab. It is a bit more direct and personal than simply going through the formal application process without contact. Did you do this and talk to any prospective advisors at these 11 programs? 11 is kind of a lot, but I don't think it would be unheard of. However, if you are just applying cold to 11 programs without making contact beforehand, I can understand your referee's reservations.\n\nStill doesn't make it OK for them to respond like that to you (instead of offering advice or simply being more polite about it all), but it would help explain how they are feeling.",

I ended up contacting grad students and visiting some of the labs ahead of time to make connections too and ask about their research and was often introduced to some of the faculty. (Key here being I didn't contact the professor, grad student introduced me). It was a lot of fun talking to them about their research and it also helped me understand what the stress level and mental health of the average grad student was at the University.\n\nIn the end, I got into 2/4, but the choice was easy because I found the lab and the advisor I wanted to work for and a school culture and lab culture that would be healthy for me to be successful.\n\nIf you still want to do all the applications more power to you and there is some great advice in this thread. My advice is to get a bit creative and try things that other applicants won't, like going and connecting with the people, showing genuine interest in their research, asking for informational interviews with grad students and during them see if they can show you around the lab or department or whatever your situation is. \n\nIf you end up only applying to 8, or even the full 11, make sure you put your full heart into each application. \n\nI only applied to 4 because I wanted to do the best I could on each application and my GRE.

All adjunct had the title \"adjunct professor\", all pre tenure professors \"Assistant Professor\", etc. Granted this was a school that prided itself on not having any non tenure track instructors (which was kind of a lie, most of my courses were taught by tenure track people, but I did definitely have an ABD adjunct for public speaking and an adjunct whose primary job was school accompanist for a music gen ed)\n\nNor is it common for upper level courses to be adjunct taught, and even if they DID ask an adjunct, the adjunct is being ridiculously irresponsible/stupid if they didn't immediately say no and explain why they're not an appropriate letter writer.",

Many professors are overworked, particularly this time of year.  And it's not the AMOUNT of time that's important, but the constant interruptions that take away from the meager amount of time we have to work on our own research programs.\n\nFor the past few years, this has been my solution:  I type up a single un-customized recommendation letter on department letterhead, e.g. \"I highly recommend Jane Doe for your graduate program, because of a, b, and c.\"  I save it as a PDF and share it with the department administrative assistant.  When the student submits the application, s/he gives the department email address for my recommendation letter.  When the admin receives the request, she uploads the file (and ignores any requests for bubble ratings).  It's a little burdensome for the admin, but I figure it's similar to the old \"mail merge\" where I would write one letter and they would print out 20 copies with different addresses at the top.\n\nFWIW, I have never had any complaints about using this system.  Your mileage may vary.",

      "text": " I think academia should get rid of recommendation letters, and asap. These letters just feed  a vicious circle where only students who got to have a closer relationship with a professor get to have the letter; in the same way, if in a lot of places it is illegal to suggest a professor to hire your student, why does it become legal when it's a recommendation letter? Plus, not all recommendation letters from all professors work. Of course the ones written by known and respected professors will work better. But this has nothing to say about the worth of the student - rather it speaks volumes about how you choose to pick a student because you respect their professor. What then about very good students who do not have a 'respectable' professor to ask a letter to? I have seen that in Europe a lot of schools are getting rid of the recommendation letter requirement in Ph.D. applications. And if you ask me further, my opinion is that applications should be anonymous.",

      "text": "I came here to say that something similar happened to me. I appplied to 10-11 schols as well (it isn't too many, you will likely only get into only a few and can choose among those. I have seen many people apply to 8-12 schools)  2 of my letter writers were great and submitted everything on time. One wasnt responsive to my emails at all (despite saying he would be delighted to write a letter for me early on). He ended up never submitting his letters to 2 universities (and missed deadlines on many others). One of those schools refused to take my application into account with a missing letter, the other one extended an offer of admissions anyway. \nYou may or may not need to worry about this depending on the policy of the schools you are applying to. Some will be OK with a missing letter, some will allow you additional time to get in the last one (and perhaps you can ask someone else to write a letter for you?)\n\nEarly on, I was wondering if I should \"guarantee\" my applications will be considered and ask an additional person. If needed (in case someone doesnt submit their letters), I could use their letter. I was told that this would be wasting that 4th person's time for no reason and I didnt do it. Looking back, I should have. Grad school applications are important and more critical than wasting several hours of someone's work time. I write letters for my professors' promotion cases even when it is probably not needed. But in case it makes a change in someone's life, it is worth it. I never view that as a \"waste of my time\". \n\nHaving said that, there are many students who ask for letters and universities habe different formats (some as for filling out forms etc). BUT that's why you notify them a few months ahead of the deadline. If they accept it, they should be able to manage their time well (afterall we are asked to complete all of our assigbments and research projects on time) . But a unified application system would really help professors save time.",

      "text": "I'm sorry you received such a curt response. But I would not agree to write 11 letters for a student, and if a student asked me for letters numbering beyond 7, I would want to speak to them about their graduate school applications and research  project.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. First, most students aspiring to do graduate work apply for between 4 and 7 schools. The number depends on how difficult it is to achieve admissions to those institutions, how specific/narrow their research goals are, and how well they are acquainted with potential supervisors. \n\nIn my view, applying to more than 7 schools indicates a few potential problems with your applications. I'm not saying these are necessarily true of you, but they are true of many students applying for a great number. They are:\n\n1.) An under-developed research project; realistically, there shouldn't be 10+ schools that are all a good fit for your proposed project. If there are, your project may be under-developed.\n\n2.) You might not be writing fresh materials for each university. Applications take a long time and your materials should be custom-tailored for each school. (This takes a while and tacking on one paragraph to the end of the research statement isn't sufficient.) \n\n3.) You haven't made connections with potential advisers at each school you are applying to. I understand that in some cases, certain prospective advisers or programs will recommend applying directly without consultation, but I think it's never a good idea to apply to a school if you don't know who you are working with. \n\nIn my experience, reaching out anyway -- or even better, having a trusted professor reach out on your behalf to make the connection -- is the better plan. If the potential adviser is averse to any kind of communication before hand, they might be a person that is better to not work with.",

Writing the first letter is always what takes most time so many profs are actually happy if they can reuse their template a few times and didn't just craft it for a one-off.\n\nMore so, the professor should just have said that he doesn't want to do that many letters here:  \n>September 2019: I email him that I will start applying for positions, and that I expect applying to about 10 universities.\n\nSomething like \"Hey, I won't have the time to do 10, please choose your preferred 5 and I'll write the letters for those\" would have been a good response that would have allowed OP to plan better. It also would have spared himself some time because he would have gotten less emails about the different applications.\n\nBut most importantly, he could have said it more polite. The professor isn't necessarily wrong in declining to write more letters as he already did but communication is key and there is literally no reason to send such a rude response when something simpler would have done the job.  \n\"Hey OP, I've written as many letters as I could but I won't have time for any other of your applications, please try to find another referree for the rest of your applications and good luck\".  \nOverall, same message, nicer approach.",
