  "title:": "What is the common practice of reviewing in your fields?",
  "text": "(I work in mathematics,  and its applications - in particular  in Deep Learning.)\n\nThis is the first post of a series I have in mind about the review process.\n\nI advocate for open review: authors know who the reviewers of their papers are, and they are automatically given the whole reports, and also automatically the right to reply to the objections by the reviewers. -> Why? If a reviewer reveals their name, then they will be hesitant to say wrong things or things they are unsure. The objections by the reviewers can be right or wrong, don't treat them as they are gold standards.\n\nHowever, that is far from standard in the fields I have written papers on. There could be review reports like \"We don't think that this method has any advantage\", without any reason, and the authors are not allowed to reply. Also, we don't know who the reviewers are, and whether they are fair or competent. And often, there are many cries of unfairness. However, there have been not much improvements.\n\nI know websites like openreview\n\n[https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference)\n\nwhich is a better model: the whole public knows about the content of the review. They also allow authors to reply to objections. The public could more easily decide who is right and who is wrong, if there is dispute. So this is almost what I want, except we don't know who the reviewers are (but one committee which has the authority could easily find out who are behind).\n\nSo I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. What is the common practice of reviewing in your field? -> I wrote.\n2. What would you like it to be? -> At least as the openreview. However, I like something more than that. See point 3 below.\n3. How do you think it could become what you would like it could be? In my case, an initial thought  I have is that a concerted effort from all institutes in the whole world can resolve the problem in the field. In particular, there should be an independent committee having the right to audit journals and conferences and so on, should there be evidences of irregularities.\n\nEditors/reviewers who show a tendency of doing bad jobs, should get consequences. Same for journals which have the tendency of doing bad jobs. Papers which were unfairly treated should be reconsidered. Authors, with solid evidences of unfairness from the journals/editors/reviewers should have the right to appeal to the independent committee.\n\nAddendum 1 (28 November):\n\nFrom the responses, many agree that reviewers should be anonymous to authors. I have no  objections with that, except how to keep reviewers to be fair and hold them in account if they too often do bad jobs (for or not for their own benefits).\n\nThe field climate/environmental science seems to have a very nice reviewing environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it is suggested a website where people review the review process:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://scirev.org](https://scirev.org)\n\nLooking into some of the journals there, I think that the website is very informative and useful. (On the other hand, for each journal just about a few reviews submitted, and usually not as detailed as on openreview website.) However, how can we use the information to ACTUALLY improve the reviewing process?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddendum 2 (28 November 2021): Is there any way to design a relatively fair system of reviewing?\n\nSome ideas I have:\n\n\\- Have a standard process that decisions must follow by specific reasons.\n\n\\- Give authors the right to respond to the criticism by editors/reviewers.\n\n\\- Don't use the reasons \"too technical\", \"not up to the level\". Instead comparing with recent papers published there (probably within 5-10 years, depending on how many papers that journal publishes a year).\n\n\\- The important issue: how to have the ideas we have actually implemented? -> this will be the topic of another post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "> \"We don't think that this method has any advantage\", without any reason, and the authors are not allowed to reply.\n\nIn what context does this happen? In my field (quite related to deep learning), the authors always get to have a rebuttal unless the paper is outright rejected, or it's for a conference (however, our conferences are not as highly regarded as in ML). If I got this comment in a paper, I would write a paragraph or two pointing out the vagueness of the statement and then maybe throw in a numerical comparison with other standard methods. This is almost always enough to get past the reviewer, and the editor usually steps in if the reviewer claims are unjustified.\n\nPersonally, I don't like the idea of reviewers being known. No one in my field would ever reject papers that need to be rejected if their name was attached to the rejection. Most of the papers I reject are conference papers that have been thrown together at the last minute, probably by a graduate student at the behest of their advisor. It would be super awkward for a new student to get such a rejection with a name attached to it, especially if that student then meets that reviewer in person at a conference. The anxiety this would induce, imo, would be more detrimental to new people, especially ones who don't get the guidance they need early career when they start submitting papers for the first time. Imagine getting a scathing (or even just a politely negative) review from, I don't know, Yann LeCunn or one of the other big names on your first paper. It would be terrible!",

I've recently collaborated with a FAANG company on a machine learning paper and we submitted to a machine learning conference. That process, although peer-reviewed, was VERY different. The quality of the peer review was poor (comments like \"This isn't useful\" with no elaboration or suggestion for improvement). It also turns out there's no iteration with the editor/reviewers. We got comments which in my field I'd consider fell into the \"publish with minor corrections\" category which would mean convincing the editor that we'd satisfied the reviewers, but with this paper it's basically up to us to change the paper how we want and it'll get published either way with no further checks. We have fixed a few of the identified issues and the paper is now better thanks to the peer review but we could have ignored all the comments and been fine.",

Get rid of middle-man journals, eradicate publication fees and paywalls, and make publication an extension of standard reporting. Eliminate authorship as a measure of academic success. Get rid of the perverse incentives driven by the false economy of academic publishing and put the focus back on the science and scholarship where it belongs.",

How do you then encourage people to do research, or decide who to give funds to do research? At the least, need fund to hire some people to help carry out the ideas, one person does not have time to do all the good ideas they could have. In fields requiring machines,... to do research, a researcher literally cannot do anything if there is no fund.",

There shouldn\u2019t be research that disappears because results were negative or some Reviewer 2 decided it wasn\u2019t novel enough - make publication a requirement of doing the job and put it all out there without journals acting as gatekeepers. If we can\u2019t find a suitable replacement for authorship as a measure of success, it\u2019s time to pack it up and turn the lights off on the entirety of academia.  \n  \nWhat even is the point of publishing in its current form? If it\u2019s for reporting research results, it sucks at that, it does a better job of burying research so nobody ever finds it. Is it for deciding where funding goes? Then why write a proposal - isn\u2019t that what the proposal is for? Is it an incentive for researchers to do the work? God, I hope not - it\u2019s slow, frustrating, expensive, and a tremendous time-sink. What\u2019s left?  \n  \nMaybe we approach from the other direction - what is publishing *good* at? It\u2019s tremendously good at being weaponized by people who want to review-tank other people\u2019s papers to protect their turf. It\u2019s great at distorting scientific reporting through positive outcome bias and non-replicability. It\u2019s fertile ground for fraud. It is a useful tool for amplifying institutional bias.  \n  \nI\u2019m sure the best minds of the modern world can come up with a way to properly communicate scientific research and accolades for good work without relying on this outdated system of publication. I can\u2019t see any reason to retain it, other than for the sake of people who can currently abuse it to their advantage.",
