  "title:": "What is the common practice of reviewing in your fields?",
  "text": "(I work in mathematics,  and its applications - in particular  in Deep Learning.)\n\nThis is the first post of a series I have in mind about the review process.\n\nI advocate for open review: authors know who the reviewers of their papers are, and they are automatically given the whole reports, and also automatically the right to reply to the objections by the reviewers. -> Why? If a reviewer reveals their name, then they will be hesitant to say wrong things or things they are unsure. The objections by the reviewers can be right or wrong, don't treat them as they are gold standards.\n\nHowever, that is far from standard in the fields I have written papers on. There could be review reports like \"We don't think that this method has any advantage\", without any reason, and the authors are not allowed to reply. Also, we don't know who the reviewers are, and whether they are fair or competent. And often, there are many cries of unfairness. However, there have been not much improvements.\n\nI know websites like openreview\n\n[https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference)\n\nwhich is a better model: the whole public knows about the content of the review. They also allow authors to reply to objections. The public could more easily decide who is right and who is wrong, if there is dispute. So this is almost what I want, except we don't know who the reviewers are (but one committee which has the authority could easily find out who are behind).\n\nSo I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. What is the common practice of reviewing in your field? -> I wrote.\n2. What would you like it to be? -> At least as the openreview. However, I like something more than that. See point 3 below.\n3. How do you think it could become what you would like it could be? In my case, an initial thought  I have is that a concerted effort from all institutes in the whole world can resolve the problem in the field. In particular, there should be an independent committee having the right to audit journals and conferences and so on, should there be evidences of irregularities.\n\nEditors/reviewers who show a tendency of doing bad jobs, should get consequences. Same for journals which have the tendency of doing bad jobs. Papers which were unfairly treated should be reconsidered. Authors, with solid evidences of unfairness from the journals/editors/reviewers should have the right to appeal to the independent committee.\n\nAddendum 1 (28 November):\n\nFrom the responses, many agree that reviewers should be anonymous to authors. I have no  objections with that, except how to keep reviewers to be fair and hold them in account if they too often do bad jobs (for or not for their own benefits).\n\nThe field climate/environmental science seems to have a very nice reviewing environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it is suggested a website where people review the review process:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://scirev.org](https://scirev.org)\n\nLooking into some of the journals there, I think that the website is very informative and useful. (On the other hand, for each journal just about a few reviews submitted, and usually not as detailed as on openreview website.) However, how can we use the information to ACTUALLY improve the reviewing process?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddendum 2 (28 November 2021): Is there any way to design a relatively fair system of reviewing?\n\nSome ideas I have:\n\n\\- Have a standard process that decisions must follow by specific reasons.\n\n\\- Give authors the right to respond to the criticism by editors/reviewers.\n\n\\- Don't use the reasons \"too technical\", \"not up to the level\". Instead comparing with recent papers published there (probably within 5-10 years, depending on how many papers that journal publishes a year).\n\n\\- The important issue: how to have the ideas we have actually implemented? -> this will be the topic of another post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "> \"We don't think that this method has any advantage\", without any reason, and the authors are not allowed to reply.\n\nIn what context does this happen? In my field (quite related to deep learning), the authors always get to have a rebuttal unless the paper is outright rejected, or it's for a conference (however, our conferences are not as highly regarded as in ML). If I got this comment in a paper, I would write a paragraph or two pointing out the vagueness of the statement and then maybe throw in a numerical comparison with other standard methods. This is almost always enough to get past the reviewer, and the editor usually steps in if the reviewer claims are unjustified.\n\nPersonally, I don't like the idea of reviewers being known. No one in my field would ever reject papers that need to be rejected if their name was attached to the rejection. Most of the papers I reject are conference papers that have been thrown together at the last minute, probably by a graduate student at the behest of their advisor. It would be super awkward for a new student to get such a rejection with a name attached to it, especially if that student then meets that reviewer in person at a conference. The anxiety this would induce, imo, would be more detrimental to new people, especially ones who don't get the guidance they need early career when they start submitting papers for the first time. Imagine getting a scathing (or even just a politely negative) review from, I don't know, Yann LeCunn or one of the other big names on your first paper. It would be terrible!",

For example, a journal claiming to be \"general\" uses the excuse of a paper to be \"technical\", \"specialised\" or \"not of interest to intended readership\". Another example is a journal which claims that it cannot consider a paper because it does not fall into the expertise/interest of the journal's editors, even though the paper falls into the claimed scope of the journal. One can go on with such examples, it is a never-ending list.",

I've recently collaborated with a FAANG company on a machine learning paper and we submitted to a machine learning conference. That process, although peer-reviewed, was VERY different. The quality of the peer review was poor (comments like \"This isn't useful\" with no elaboration or suggestion for improvement). It also turns out there's no iteration with the editor/reviewers. We got comments which in my field I'd consider fell into the \"publish with minor corrections\" category which would mean convincing the editor that we'd satisfied the reviewers, but with this paper it's basically up to us to change the paper how we want and it'll get published either way with no further checks. We have fixed a few of the identified issues and the paper is now better thanks to the peer review but we could have ignored all the comments and been fine.",

However, bad reviewers can exploit the system to silence alternative approaches and promote their own approach or their own people. So while reviewing is not paid, it is not without beneficial. How can we deal with that? \n\nI have no objection with reviewing to be paid. However, with that, more obligations are expected from the reviewers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Scirev.org](https://Scirev.org) is interesting. Thanks.

How do you then encourage people to do research, or decide who to give funds to do research?

What if a result will not have practical implications, how can one check?\n\nDo you see any mechanics which can replace journals in checking the correctness of results, in general, and for now?\n\nMaybe from sometime in the 1950s, I suppose, there is also an additional feature attached to publishing in journals: it is supposed to say something about \"importance of the work\".

I would suspect that the problems for review in my field are along the same themes that affect all fields, though we don't have double-blind review the way that some other fields do, which compounds the bias problem.  \n  \n>However, there is the question of how to check whether something is correct.  \n  \nWhat we're doing right now doesn't achieve that, for all of the effort being put into it. We know that's the case, because the replication crisis continues despite how selective or strenuous peer review is. I would argue that the current peer review process makes the problem worse, not better, since it rewards positive outcome and incentivizes replication-destroying behavior like hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing) and p-hacking. If we're honest with ourselves, we're not currently checking whether anything is correct before it enters the literature. So I don't know if eliminating peer-review would contribute much to the existing replication crisis, particularly if we also remove publication as a reward-system and measurement of success.  \n  \n>What if a result will not have practical implications, how can one check? Do you see any mechanics which can replace journals in checking the correctness of results, in general, and for now?  \n  \nI think if the purpose of peer review is to check the correctness of results, it has utterly failed. This is just another function that we assume peer review is providing because of how selective and meticulous peer review can be, but when you look at the finished product you can't confidently say anything has been achieved. \n \nWhat else can we do? Presumably someone can make an argument to a funding agency for why an existing result is possibly in need of revisiting, and report their own results on whether it survives replication. This is really the only way we can check the results of other people's research - do more research - but we don't currently prioritize this kind of work and instead favor work that can boast novelty. From the first dollar allocated to research to the last dollar spent on publication, the system is entirely orthogonal to the purpose of checking research results for correctness. Peer review is a grinding process of submitting your work to a tribunal of experts, but they only have the ability to criticize the work at the shallow level of someone who literally just read your work for the first time - these are not people who are well equipped to assess whether the work is correct or not. So peer review instead focuses on the reviewer's personal opinions - whether you did what *they* would have done, or did it the way *they* would have done it, or presented the way *they* would present it, and so on. Very little peer review is actually about checking the accuracy of the work.  \n  \n>Then, with the scarcity of resources, this supposed importance attached to journal publishing comes to be very important in deciding who gets jobs and fundings and prizes and so on.

It doesn't matter what your research was, it should be reported and communicated and accessible to the public, and we can call that process 'publication' and get rid of publication in its present form. The need for restructuring goes very deep, and we need reprioritization of research resources from the very first dollar. The problem is very large, much larger than peer review.",

The obsession with publications, and big-impact publications, and whether the work being proposed is led by someone with those publications and the project is capable of producing those publications, is an entirely manufactured distraction that academia has been captured by.

First, the committees of such grants ar composed of people from many backgrounds, most of them at best can know just a bit (very shallow) about what you write. Except, if you can show for example that your method gives some quantitative amount (5%, 10%) better than the current best known method, then it will be clear to them that your method is better. Second, each of them must take care of hundred of proposals, from probably hundred different fields, in say 3-4 months. Then asking that they would give a good evaluation for all proposals is impossible, given that reviewers at specialised journals can spend more than 1 year(s) and still have mistakes.
