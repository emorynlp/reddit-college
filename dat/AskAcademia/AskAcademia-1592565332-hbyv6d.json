  "text": "Hey all. I've always had a problem with reading papers, and I was wondering if anyone here could relate/give advice. \n\nIt's not that I struggle to understand research papers, I just seem to get a bit freaked out when I'm faced with a big paper.. I feel anxious to start reading it because it's just so MUCH information. Then I just open a new tab and distract myself to reduce my anxiety. Either that, or I'll start reading it and the author will cite a load of other papers that sound interesting... leading me to open those up too. I then have like 6 papers open at once and it feels like it's just too much. \n\nSo far this hasn't affected my performance or anything, and I've always scored well when I was a student. However, I feel as though I could be doing better if I could overcome this issue. How can I stop doing this or manage it better?",

Sit down and go through it with a pen marking the important/relevant bits, making notes in the margins and if there's something you don't understand skim those references to see if they are worth going through in detail.  It's totally fine and probably normal to be reading a couple papers at the same time ie. Be 20% through paper A, 50% of paper B and just starting paper C.  A good paper takes multiple reads to get everything in it so dont worry about having to read some parts several times.  \n\n\nIf your finding several papers in the references that sound interesting, good! You're really interested in the subject. Check if they are decent papers with a quick skim, and you can put them aside for when you have time. Of course you'll need to act on your own ideas at some point rather than just read an infinite number of papers, but you'll know when this comes.",

This is what I've always been doing. My problem lies elsewhere: tidying up those notes to a coherent, comprehensible interesting stuff to work on or to be cited later.\n\nI'm currently using Zotero. I've been copy-pasting my notes to each items I added in Zotero. I've used tags, but I still feel like my notes are scattered. Any tips for better organization?",

      "text": "This is a natural reaction - the ever-expanding body of information most of us access daily in our fields is simply more than we can process. You might find the following helpful, however:\n\n1. Read the abstract, then read the conclusions, then stop. Make **written** (not typed) notes on the main research question(s), methodology, and basic findings. Leave the article and go do something else for 30 minutes (eat a cupcake, drink wine, do some yoga). Associate the reading with something positive to quell your anxiety.\n2. Turn off your wi-fi, close any unneeded tabs on your desktop. **Without accessing your notes**, see if you can articulate one or two of the main points/questions you read earlier. If you can't, read the abstract/conclusion again. This time you don't get a cupcake.\n3. Dive into the first 2-4 pages. Access your original notes and create an outline. As you read, you want to see if you can fashion the same information structure as the author, noting key arguments and findings along the way. Make the reading as interactive as possible.\n4. Do **not** (and I really mean it) go chasing down the author's source material while you're slogging through the article, even if something strikes you as the most interesting thing you've ever seen or most pressing question that's ever occurred to you. Following those rabbit holes feeds your avoidance. Make a note of the source/your question. You can return to these later, but only after you've completed the task at hand.\n5. Follow the above strategy as your work your way through the article or chapter. When your focus wanders, try to bring it back. If after 15 minutes it's not working, do something else for a while. Put a time limit on your breaks and don't use them to web surf. Get back to the reading as soon as you are able.\n6. At the end of the week, quiz yourself. If you've read an article a day (or a book chapter a day), see how much you've retained by writing brief synopses of each work.  In many fields, you will not have the same kind of testing that regularly requires demonstration of knowledge that you had as an undergraduate. You must monitor this on your own.\n7. Shake hands with the reality that reading shallowly contributes to your anxiety. The above process takes time, but it is infinitely more valuable to you than \"reading\" 200 pages and retaining nothing.\n\nI've taught graduate students in the U.S. and in Germany and have noticed significant cultural differences in the two academic arenas.  In the U.S., we often under-educate our undergraduates and then stuff our Master's and Ph.D. students to the gills with information, encouraging them to incorporate as much data as possible within a few scant years, asserting at the end that the process is more important than the actual retained knowledge. The process I've experienced in Germany is slower and more focused on deep learning. It is also less tolerant of \"intellectual off-roading,\" which can have both positive and negative effects.\n\nWhile I do not know where you are studying or the field in which you work, I would advise you to protect your own cognitive space - and peace. You cannot learn every bit of information you encounter, so relieve yourself of that burden. Instead,  develop strategies to learn deeply, to assess what information is really needed to reach your goals, and to alleviate the anxiety that transforms a subject you love into something you cannot bear. When you make these your priorities and carry them forward into your career, you'll make important cultural and institutional changes of your own.\n\n**\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! Made my day.**",

              "text": "Late response to this, but you bring up a good point. I tend to think of handwritten notes and typed notes as different animals. To put it inelegantly,  I use the former to \"inscribe\" information on my brain, while I use the latter for indexing and later reference. I also differentiate between handwriting and typing in order to weed out important information. If something makes it into my typed synopses, it means I've decided it really is worth noting and referencing later.\n\nWhen completing my graduate work, I typed the majority of my notes and tended to make notes on *everything* (and follow every cool rabbit hole, similar to the original poster). This was because I wasn't yet certain what was truly important and what wasn't, but it also meant I wasn't actively training myself to discern the important info. Others may be more readily adept at this, but it took me some time to develop a system.\n\nSo - I definitely agree with you that typed notes are superior as long-term reference *documents*. I also think that handwriting plays an important part in the actual learning/incorporation process needed for forming memories (a useful study comparing the two strategies can be found [here](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39044710/JoWR_2015_vol7_nr2_Mangen_et_al.pdf?1444246013=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DMangen_A._Anda_L.G._Oxborough_G._and_Bro.pdf&Expires=1592922694&Signature=SM6p12VXWZkHnJjtmb8FrVImnqq58bgVw1RVTWegXkHt7aDlGLVBmUchW0VZcMxCmexRwM8XZ7LYXcM~UXQff2hwVMgq9cvcEqM1qGpgH17WS8N05hRAG3U-1527zQft8lP-pBO5knAxgdJbHgkPZRL0t-ghiYoJqNdhrYslyaKlBJGILXkAFf~0Y1qHEojKH~uCgQ4oVbBbreQBFH1JU70DvHg0fBG0u4-QWTE3GjaOj78Y4wmY3I2FMbasxl9TsYJM3fTAs548PBQonW3wZuCSn94mW~Y2lVhElkQcGQscGNooifXpHFdzL0goXnGOD3pl9R2GK9Fbx3VCKcH1XQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)).
