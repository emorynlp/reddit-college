  "text": "Hello everyone, I am a recent grad who, admittedly, has not put in the work to get a good GPA. I graduated this year (Computer Science) with a 2.53 GPA. I just started work as a cloud engineer at a pretty good company and I am learning a lot of skills. Despite this, I really want to pursue a Masters and eventually a PHD relating to IT (Either systems architecture, or a more general Compsci degree) for personal reasons and to eventually do some research in the field.\n\nI am currently studying for the GRE and am also following a Micromasters (edx- MIT data science and stats) and will look into the EDX Harvard Cloud Architecture Micromasters. Whilst studying these courses, I am also working towards Azure certifications (Already have 1/3 prospective ones). I have this newfound desire to learn that I did not have in my undergrad years.\n\nHowever, I am worried that I won't be accepted to a program since my GPA is so low and I did not have an advisor in my undergrad years that was of real help to me (They always tried to hurry the meetings we had - so nothing was learned). I do not have research experience either.\n\nAre there any tips that you can share that will allow me to make up for my low GPA and get to a good Masters/PHD program? Are there ways I can show that I do enjoy learning? Will I have to do another undergrad degree just to make up for my low GPA?\n\nI would appreciate any help!\n\nTLDR: Low GPA recent grad working as a cloud engineer wants to get into a masters/PHD program and doesn't know how/if they will get there.",

      "text": "GPA definitely isn\u2019t everything and doesn\u2019t really matter later on (except for funding). But in general most schools have a GPA requirement that is typically above 3.0. Not sure about CS programs but in my experience there is usually a pretty hard cutoff, but if you\u2019re past the cutoff then you can make up for it in other ways. I would start by checking what they cutoffs are in programs, but I imagine they may be higher than 2.5.",

      "text": "So yes, you can totally get past this! I did this and am currently in a masters program and soon to be PhD. I had a 2.15 GPA in a chemical engineering program. Now going for Biomedical Engineering. GPA isn't everything and you can get around it. \n\nAlso btw, tons of MS programs don't require much in terms of GPA as they are usually geared towards industry. You could probably get one of those and use that GPA to move into a PhD once completed or even during if your professor thinks it's a good plan. \n\nOn to the more serious planning for getting into a PhD. So you will have to show that you can get good grades and for a PhD that you are a good researcher as that is really what a PhD program is for. \n\nNow for how to do this. \n1. Get familiar with the facility and program your interested in. \n\n2. Network with both the graduate advisors (administrators not professors) as well as any professors your interested in working with. Like actually just cold email them and try to get meetings scheduled to discuss stuff and your interests. \n\nYou will be told that you don't have good enough grades (you don't for the PhD or a research masters) but you do have great relevant work experience and certifications. But you are building a a working relation with the professors, showing you are obviously interested and driven to do this. \n\n4. Most of it not all universities allow you to take courses without being part of a program. Sometimes their called post bacheloriate or something similar. Discuss what classes you need to take in the masters program and what your professor and the advisors think would be best for you to take in anticipation of starting a masters. Make sure you know how many credits you can take outside of a program (masters or PhD) that can be transferred into the program once you start as typically you can really only take 3 or so classes outside that will transfer in, extras on top either don't apply or you'll have to take again. Make sure you get good grades like B's and A's. Make sure you still check in with the advisors and professors through your process. \n\n5. If you get good grades you can likely get into a masters, though it may be a regular masters and not research based but that's ok. Now your in the door and it's easier to move around from here. If decide on just a masters your now set. If you decide on a PhD continue on top the next steps. \n\n6. Speak with your professors that your interested in their research and seem like a good fit personality wise and discus potentially doing some volunteer research for them to get involved. This is super important if you want to go into a PhD program. They require you to be good at researcher and as well you will really only want to do this if you like research. Basically your doing a trial run as well as building skills.\n\n7. You'll basically have two choices either way here. If you want to just get a masters your good to go. The second choice is if you want to get a PhD. You can either get a masters and then do a formal application to the university for a PhD or alternatively you just request to be moved into the PhD program which is a little easier (i.e. less red tape and continuity). Once you have a PhD in the same program and especially the same institution as your masters, the masters is irrelevant. But if you decide to get the actual masters degree you can also switch institutions if you like. For PhD programs all your masters credits will automatically transfer towards a phd without any issues. \n\nLastly, for tips and what not. \n\nIt's always a good idea to stay in good contact throughout your program like once each semester or year with the graduate school advisor, and usually quite often with your direct advisor (you'll likely have recurring meetings with them if you do research). \n\nGraduate school teachers are more flexible than undergrad for the most part. At this point they know your likely an adult, you've had real adult jobs and work experience in the field and they know you are here because you want to. So let them know if something comes up, they will often be more flexible especially if you let them know at the beginning of the year of your situation. \n\nGood luck, you can do this!!",

Thanks for the amazing response and boost to morale! These are some vey good tips and I definitely will be trying to get in contact with some advisors first. I'm planning for my masters to be in a year or so. This leaves me time to get good prep done in order to have good contacts and grades.",
