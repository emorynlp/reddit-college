  "title:": "PhD study system affecting my whole career?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI've been quite anxious regarding a problem and since im in a new country doing my PhD, atm I dont have many people who I can share my fears.\n\nIm doing my first year of PhD, and its a topic that I'm really interested. Its a project where I focus on population dynamics, more precisely, species distributions and biotic interations (negative and positive). However, even though I love this topic, Im working with plants (not that is a problem), but I've always had the dream of asking the same questions with herpetofauna. Ive only applied to this PhD because these are the questions I want to study in my career, but the study system is not top choice.\nI've already asked this to my supervisor, and he says its normal for people to change study systems and he also gave me some real examples of persons who went through the same. I know there are successfull stories regarding this, but that does not ease my mind, those persons can be handpicked in millions for all I know. Do you think my current study system will prevent me from studying the same topic in another study system in the future?\n\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I don't think you have a problem. I went from pure biochemistry - all molecules and buffers, to a postdoc using cells, to a second postdoc working in drosophila, all answering similar questions. It's pretty standard to move between systems and actually it's a strength to be able to work in multiple systems.",

      "text": "It's very common, if not expected, for research interests to change over the course of a PhD. Personally I was accepted to my program to work in one subfield of computer science, and within the same year I switched to an advisor from totally different subfield. The point of a PhD is to teach you basic research skills that should easily transfer to different topics. Don't worry too much about being locked in.",
