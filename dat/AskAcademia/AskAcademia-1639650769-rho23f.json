  "text": "Hello! I finished my MSc in social sciences in 2016 and have since been working in the private sector, but I am thinking about trying to publish an article based on my master's dissertation for two reasons:\n\n1. My dissertation topic has come up in conversation a few times recently and I think it's an interesting topic and the findings were insightful\n2. I'm trying to transition into a research career (eg a research center), and I think having something published would help my chances\n\nI've identified a few specialised journals where my topic would fit very well. I know I can't submit it as the dissertation, it would have to be rewritten, but I would like to use it as a basis. I have two concerns:\n\n1. Can you actually submit independently, without being associated with an institution? The research was done while I was at university but I am no longer associated with it\n2. Is five years too long for the paper to be relevant? The topic itself spans decades so I feel like the interviews would still hold and five years is nothing comparatively, but I can see that gap as being detrimental.\n\nI would reach out to my supervisor but I want to know if it's unlikely/unusual before I do. Also, if it is feasible and you have any advice or starting points, that would also be very helpful",

      "text": "1. Usually it's fine, but look at the journals themselves just in case. Obviously you'll be covering any open access or extra page fees yourself if necessary, but that probably goes without saying.\n\n2. If the results are still novel, it's not too late. If similar results are published, you'll want to emphasize what makes yours different, and may want to aim for a lower-impact journal to be safe.\n\nDefinitely ask your supervisor for advice, but I don't necessarily see any reason why you couldn't give it a try. Good luck!",
