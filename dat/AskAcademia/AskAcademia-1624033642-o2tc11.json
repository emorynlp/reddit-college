  "title:": "PIs, what do you find most impressive about exceptional grad students?",
  "text": "I know it's not about knowing the answers to everything (as I was once led to believe), but a part of grad school and growing is asking dumb questions, lots of them. This is especially so if one worked in an interdisciplinary field.\n\nWhat then, separates mediocre, good, and exceptional students? When is the last time a student genuinely impressed you? What did he/she do? I'm less curious about the specific outcomes (publications, high grades, engagement, etc.), but more about the characteristics and habits great students have. Could it be creativity? Productivity? The ability to ask relevant research questions and design experiments? The ability to conduct experiments independently and discuss the results meaningfully?\n\nPut another way, aside from tangible results, what (soft) skills should I aim to gain in grad school to become a better academic? What makes you say, *wow, I am really impressed by this student*?\n\nHope the question is clear. Thanks for your input!",

In addition to their time doing experiments, READING READING READING dozens and dozens and DOZENS of papers to a level of understanding to actually develop an *intellectual* vision and an understanding of where the field - and related fields is at - then in following years, identify problems or niches and start to attack them - or at least make plans.\n\nThis requires a lot of time and commitment.",

Proper understanding of each sentence is needed as well. Not sure how they do that but I honestly have difficulties believing that the rest of my lab were capable of that.",

Some had to make it 9 to 5, if thats not possible it never really extends much beyond that because 1) they couldn't and 2) I really think its counterproductive. They were people who could stay focused and organized to produce a steady stream of small steps forward and deliverables day in and day out with an eye on a goal (usually a big paper or a fellowship etc).

If you think deadlines are toxic you're going to have a bad time\n\nSome are, some aren't.  I think what you've described mostly falls under productivity rather than meeting deadlines.\n\nPaper submission doesn't typically have a deadline.  If I'm ready to submit something but then I wait a week, it isn't going to harm anything.  Revisions may have deadlines.  Grant proposals have deadlines, but grad students don't usually write grant proposals (in most STEM fields).  And yeah it makes it harder for you to submit a grant proposal if your grad students aren't producing anything, but that's not an issue with meeting deadlines it's an issue with productivity.  The strictest deadlines most students come up against are talks and conferences.\n\nI also know professors who will freely admit that they give arbitrary deadlines or yell at their students or punish them in some way because they think it will motivate them.  I think that's terrible management.",

This made us feel extremely stressed out about getting work done since we started to feel like we weren't meeting these arbitrary deadlines, although in reality, we couldn't have met them even if we worked round the clock (which we were) because of the nature of the experiments that we were running. \n\nThe PI always thought that we weren't doing a good job, we were being slow, yelled at us a lot and made us feel like garbage, when in reality we were all showing a lot of initiative and hard work to learn how to do some really complex experiments in a fairly short amount of time. I once spent an 80 hour work week editing a presentation to their \"liking\" when a ten minute chat at the start of the week would have clarified their expectation on how they wanted the presentation to be done. That is when I knew that I had to change groups, for the sake of my sanity and my scientific career. I find it baffling to see how such terribly incompetent people find their way into such crucial roles in higher education.",

A dumb question is one that annoys the person you ask because they shouldn\u2019t have to answer it for you.\n\nAnd this is where \u201cit doesn\u2019t hurt to ask\u201d is dead wrong.

They would make little effort to figure anything out themselves; if I'm just telling you every single step of what to do, I might as well do the work myself. On the other hand, I've helped other students that, while also new to the field, would really take a stab at solving a problem and if they asked a question it was well thought out. They would also tell me what else they tried. They needed occasional guidance rather than hand-holding.\n\nYes if it's a high school student then there aren't any \"dumb questions\" but if someone is a PhD student, it's expected that they can solve most problems on their own. The bad PhD students are the ones that ask me questions that take 5 mins on Wikipedia. The good ones are the ones that ask for guidance on their own thought process rather than being asked how they should think.\n\nGood litmus test for me is \"Do I enjoy sharing an office with them?

The short answer is no I have no teaching cert, but those will help you. \nThe long version - here we go:\nI got my PhD in marine ecology and I hadn\u2019t gotten the opportunity to TA (both ms and PhD advisors preferred I focused on my work). When I was about to finish I was honestly open for anything, but I found the program through a friend (networking ftw). It\u2019s basically an extracurricular program hosted at the university and hs kids from the city apply to get in. The class is taught by the director and two postdocs (I\u2019m one of em, but I\u2019m leaving for a permanent job, more on that in a minute). We teach everything we can, and supplement with professors at the university for the first year. They get ecology from me, psych from my colleague, micro from the director, so we get engineering profs, chemists, astrophysicists etc to chat or show us around their labs. More than that though, the students learn how to do research projects. These are legit projects where they learn how to read actual scientific literature, design experiments, conduct analyses, write up their results, and present them. By junior year they\u2019re doing full-fledged internships, researching cancer biology, medical engineering, PCOS, nanomaterials, you name it, they do it. Many of them publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. To be honest, it\u2019s a friggin incredible job and I would stay if I could, but that\u2019s another story for another time. In addition to my program, there are sister programs that send postdocs out to schools across the city, but these instructors are more restricted to the guidelines of their schools, and they often end up getting certifications. Ask me anything about it here or through dm and I\u2019ll be happy to give more detail. \n\nFor the job I\u2019m taking: I\u2019m moving to an independent school where I\u2019ll be doing largely the same thing but for a whole school, not just the 104 I have at my current position (26 per each grade level). Independent schools don\u2019t follow state curriculum guidelines and this don\u2019t always require teaching certs. Many will help you get them while you\u2019re teaching, so definitely check out NAIS.org. I should note that I am bummed about leaving \u201cacademia\u201d but I\u2019ll still be advising students through research projects and I\u2019ll have the ability to conduct small projects on my own, all without soft money (but also without the\u2026clout(?) of being a professor). Im excited about this line of work though, so again, any questions you have, fire away.",
