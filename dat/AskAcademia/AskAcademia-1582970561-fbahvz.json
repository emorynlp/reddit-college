I definitely didn't work more than 40h a week on average (except when writing up at the very end I guess) and I finished in 3 years (I'm in the UK where 3-4 years is normal).\nMake sure you pick a supervisor who values work-life balance. Make sure you have other interests/hobbies and don't tie your whole existence and identity up in your phd. You need other things in your life so that when you hit the lows in your phd it doesn't consume your whole existence. I didn't enjoy every day of my PhD, there were weeks at a time I didn't. But there were also lots of good bits and overall, I enjoyed it.\n\nAlso, think carefully about whether you will be happy to have done a PhD if you don't land an academic job at the end of it. Most of my friends who did PhDs are not working in academia (mostly through choice) and they are all happy. But a common thing I see on Reddit is people thinking their PhD was a waste if they don't become a prof... That way madness and unhappiness lies.",

Sure, it's challenging and can be disheartening in the way any sort of extended \"apprenticeship\" might be.\n\nBut most of us end up working far, far harder as pre-tenure faculty. I remember grad school quite fondly actually, and while it was hard work there was a certain esprit de corps among the cohort and a sense of potential/excitement at least sometimes. But once you're on the TT you're more isolated, the stakes are higher, and the workweeks double.\n\nI say this as a humanities professor with three graduate degrees, understanding that the average time to Ph.D. in my field is now ten years. The experiences of humanists are far different from those in STEM, not only in duration and funding, but in that we almost always work alone and not on projects related to our advisor's research.

      "text": "As a disclaimer, I\u2019m not a PhD student until September, but I\u2019m currently a research assistant in a lab, and interact with several PhD students per week. Also based in UK:\n\nPlain and simple, a PhD is hard work, since most people do it shortly after undergrad, it\u2019s also their first real \u2018independent work\u2019 in the real world, so there\u2019s a substantial amount of maturation and growth as a person involved with it (particularly in managing ones mood when failure inevitably occurs)\n\nI think the real stress with PhDs and about your mention of 40 hour work weeks is time. As an RA, I can work 9-5, and still get paid, beyond my work hours there\u2019s not really crazy expectations of me. As a PhD though, it is YOUR project, if you take days off, that\u2019s time away from your project- you can go take a holiday for a month, but know your work isn\u2019t being done.\n\nIn the UK, PhD students have 3-4 years, if you don\u2019t produce substantial work in that time you don\u2019t pass. So realistically, it\u2019s not actually the time you\u2019re working, it\u2019s what you get done. You could work 100 hour weeks and get nothing accomplished and you\u2019ll fail, you could work 40 hour weeks and get great data and you\u2019ll pass, it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nBut I say this because the nature of a PhD is entirely self driven, if you don\u2019t do the work, it doesn\u2019t get done. Plain and simple. This means making clear defined work/life boundaries is difficult, and I\u2019m sure many people who have terrible times with PhDs do so because they don\u2019t make such boundaries\n\nIt\u2019s 5pm on a Friday, you feel you\u2019ve done good work today. But, there\u2019s always another paper you can read right? Always another experiment you can prepare? What about that data analysis you\u2019ve put off the last 2 weeks? Or how about making figures for that paper your PI keeps saying you should think about writing? \n\nEffectively, I think time and work/life balance is the main stressor on PhDs, it\u2019s not a job where you punch out at 5 and completely forget about it- there\u2019s always more you can do.\n\nNow I\u2019ve framed it a bit negatively, but that\u2019s really the key with doing a PhD- after years of studying this, you will be living and breathing it- are you prepared for that? If the idea repulses you, don\u2019t do it. If you\u2019re open to it and even crave for it, great! Go and chase it!\n\nAnother obvious stressor is the failure- it is the nature of science and experimentation that you will fail. Fail badly! Embrace the failure. My professor tells me the best scientists are frankly masochists, science can be like punching a wall apart with your bare hands. You need to get through the failure and ride the successes for as long as you can.\n\nAnd linking with all of these is your lab and your PI- find out how you work best. Want a PI in the lab with you hands on? Great. Want a PI who micromanages you every day? You do you. Want a PI who you see 3 times a year to check up on you? God speed. Ask yourself what work environment you want and tolerate, and find labs/PIs like that. Ask the students- they\u2019ll be more honest about the PI than the PI will.\n\nAnd as far as the negativity you\u2019ve read around it- people are more likely to turn to internet posting to say they\u2019re miserable, not to announce their happiness; it\u2019s a biased sample. Ultimately the people who will love it won\u2019t see it as a job, they see it as huge research freedom and opportunity, they will place appropriate boundaries to help them de-stress, seek help when they need it, and will be with a PI who works best for them.\n\nHope this helps!",

I worked for a long time before I went back to school & only went back because I had been adjuncting & decided I wanted to teach full time, so I looked at it as a professional degree (want to be a lawyer, get a law degree. Want to be a professor, get a doctorate). \n\nIt was hard & there were setbacks. I had an advisor who dumped me & a department chair who threatened to fire me. But I also developed a network of mentors and peers that I still rely on. And I learned a LOT. I really recommend setting boundaries. I tried to not do any work on one weekend day a week to give myself a break. And of course, access to a good therapist! But for me, I would do it again.",

If your supervisor keeps track of the literature and writes the paper for you, meaning you just have to do what you're told - sure, you could maybe do 40 hours as a robot. If your supervisor just provides funding and rough guidelines, it's up to you to make sure the actual research checks out in the end.",

I can see my progress and am starting to see my project's impact on the field/society. This is incredibly rewarding. There are definitely rough times in research (failed experiments, paper rejections, etc) but there are bad parts of anything worth doing .\n\nIn my opinion, there are 3 things that are equally important 1) advisor 2) research and 3) support.\n\n1. Pick an advisor whose mentoring style meshes well with yours. Think about how often would you want to meet with your PI? how much freedom do you want to have to come up with your own solutions/experiments/thesis aims? \n2. Pick a project that you think is impactful *and* that requires day-to-day tasks that you find interesting and engaging. Be passionate about the big question and know you like doing the nitty-gritty aspects like coding/cell culture/archive dives/working with people. \n3. Pick a lab environment that you like  - my labmates are my best friends and have literally picked me up off the floor on tough days (sometimes I lay on the floor when things are going poorly...). Make sure you have people in your lab (or department/city) that can support you and tell you you're doing a good job when your idea failed and you feel like you haven't accomplished anything in years.\n\nIn terms of workload, don't compare yourself to others. I know that's easier said than done, but I just try to do my work and *try* most days. I don't keep track of my hours, some days I work a lot, some days I don't get any work done at all. I aim for approximately 40 hours a week but some weeks are less and some are more - I think it evens out in the end.\n\nAnd remember that old adage: the squeaky wheel gets the memes. Complainers are often more vocal than people having a medium/good time.",

But I don't think this is anything too unusual. \n\n2. Occasionally you get some people who have an absolute nightmare. Often they pick an advisor who is narcissistic or abusive or worse. Your advisor plays a very large role in your work and so this relationship is important. If you get one of the few bad apples, it will poison the entire experience and these are often the stories you hear where you might get the impression that its \"the worst thing you can do to yourself\". \n\nOn the other hand, most advisors are at least mediocre.
