  "title:": "Which country do you recommend to look for a faculty position after postdocing for 5-year in US?",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\nPlease let me tell about myself a bit, which may help you to understand my situaton, and why I am asking this. I have a family of 4, and we are living under quite poor conditions in an old 1 bed 1 bath apartment by paying half of my salary. My daughter goes to 3rd grade, while I can\u2019t afford for a pre-K program for my other kid. Also, my wife is not allowed to work due to her visa type (H4), and she takes care of our little kid. I also pay a lot for medical insurances in montly basis as they are not fully funded (just to note that these are broadly common situations for nonimmigrant postdocs and their families who are living in expensive cities)\n\nAnyway, currently I have been doing my second postdoc at Harvard, and I am pretty willing to stay in academia. But considering the life expenses, ecopolitic issues, gun violence, lack of green card or citizenship and many other things, me and my wife thought that it would be better to go somewhere else to settle down in a safer, cheaper, less stressful and family friendly country. I actually plan \nno later than the early next year to apply for an assistant prof position in the field of neurobiology outside US. I would like to hear your opinions about where I should consider to go. I am originally from Turkey where no any research fields are well supported todays due to its economic instability. I was looking at Canada, EU countries and Australia/NZ, but I couldn\u2019t find certain details with regards to their research funds, how often positions are available, life expenses and salary rates, how long I need to stay or serve to get permanent residency or even citizenship etc. I would be glad if you can share your experiences.\nThank you.",

You can find the average salary in each country easily (there's probably a wikipedia page) and compare the offered salary to the average salary there to get a feeling for how generous it is compared to most people.  \n\nFor legal questions about residency/citizenship you're best off relying on the official government sources for each country, since that's not a topic where you can risk using amalgamated information from a non-official source.\n\nThere are many sites with statistics on the research funding in each country, so you can easily look that up separately from the other questions.\n\nI think that faculty positions, especially for a single topic, are infrequent and competitive enough everywhere that you should just look in every country you're willing to move to and apply to any well-fitting job you find.  From personal experience I can say that the Netherlands has a high quality of life and pays researchers well, although you'll need to be willing/able to learn Dutch once you move there if you ever want to feel settled.  \n\n\n> I actually plan no later than the early next year to apply for an assistant prof position in the field of neurobiology outside US.\n\nYou should start now; it could easily take months or years of applying before you find a position.",

I did my graduate studies in France, a 1st postdoc in the US, and I\u2019m now in Asia.\nIn my experience, no country will offer you as much recognition and such high salary as the US. European countries might have good social welfare, free healthcare and schools, but very few academic positions, with huge competition, and very little recognition in the end. You will also need to have an existing network in the country, which are hard to build from scratch, especially without knowing the language, the culture and the local system.\n\nIf you are struggling with your salary to sustain your family, try to move outside of Boston and go towards smaller college towns. Especially in public unis, employees have good benefits and life conditions for them and their families. In my case I was in Michigan and it was very nice, and not crazy expensive. \nGood luck with everything!",

Every detail of how academia works, what immigrant life is like, what the path to permanent residency is like, what benefits you get, what salary you can expect etc etc etc is going to vary from country to country. I will say generally that, in the EU, the path to citizenship once you are a permanent resident is usually longer and thornier than in the US, but on the other hand it is much easier than in the US to get the permanent residency as long as you migrate legally. So as long as you can live in a way that doesn't violate your residency and don't plan on voting, it may be a better option.",
