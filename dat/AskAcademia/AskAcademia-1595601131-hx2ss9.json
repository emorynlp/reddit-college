  "text": "Hey there! I\u2019m an undergrad and was wondering what qualities or characteristics you look for when it comes to someone working on research with you. What kind of qualities would a student have that you would gush over in a letter of recommendation for instance? Trying to improve myself as an aspiring researcher :) thanks~",

      "text": "I'm still a postdoc, but I directly supervise a lot of master's theses as the primary advisor. I'm also in a theoretical field, which may influence the following.\n\n* My best students are very independent and use me as a bouncing board for ideas. They come to each meeting prepared with a progress report, results, issues/shortcomings and a plan to tackle them. This makes it very easy to help them, and we both feel productive as a result.\n* My best students are also very organized with their derivations and notes. They directly type everything up into LaTeX or powerpoint slides, making it super clear. I have one student that grumbled for months about learning LaTeX and instead opted to send me photos of barely-legible scribbles, and giving timely advice to that student was impossible as a result.\n* Be honest about what works and doesn't work -- don't necessarily blame yourself or your skillset in case things don't work. Sometimes the problem is just really hard, and it's not obvious from the start why it would be hard. Even if the problem is easy/doable, a good advisor would rather you just be honest about not knowing what to do so we can guide you in the right direction. Beating around the bush or procrastinating on a nasty calculation isn't productive (tbh, I used to do this a lot, but I eventually realized its just not a good thing to do).\n* Please don't show up late - I have a student that chronically shows up 5-10 minutes late *every* meeting and it's quite irritating, especially if they want me to go over time to compensate, which I just refuse to do.\n* Don't feel that a research area or skill is \"beneath you\". I see this a lot with math students -- a lot of them feel that coding is too \"applied\" or \"engineer-like\", and it really hinders their progress. A surprising amount of very abstract pure math lends itself well to numerical experiments. That kind of attitude makes for excellent dank memes, but not so much in research practice. Same thing with learning research skills, like presenting well, writing well, using LaTeX, etc.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the co-signers! Let's ~~get a loan~~ write a paper together.",

But if you are creating value that was not present prior to your involvement on the project, e.g. adding original content to the manuscript, contributing to research design, etc... Then the value of your ideas should outshine being late at a meeting.   \nThere is some nuance here though. I think the same logic does not apply to deadlines, because not submitting by a deadline sets back the bigger picture, while not showing up to a meeting really is only detrimental to you because you lost the possible time you could have spent working with the professor.",

While some may be general enough that can apply to most fields, some of the ones may be too specific. I\u2019m in Computer Science working on a field HCI (well, a sub field of HCI is what I do but no need to get too specific). \n\nFirst my lab is about respect and understanding that people are different, come from different background and culture, and we have a culture that is safe for everyone to talk to discuss their issues. This means that the first most important aspect is; \n\n1. Be respectful and open minded of people \u2014 This includes not getting mad if someone is late 5 minutes (Like our other poster here). Diversity means we are different. If you have an attitude, this is a problem in my lab. \n\n2. You have to be able read a lot and write. This is even more important than coding.\n\n3. You have to be in the path of becoming independent and be ok to disagree with me and push ideas that you have. \n\n4. Be a team player while remembering that your project is yours and yours alone. Even if is part of a larger project. \n\n5. Able to solve problems and understand how research works. \n\nThis is my job how I prepare my students. Therefore, the most important to be a researcher in my lab, I have found that is: \n\nA. Be nice and respectful \n\nB. Read and understand the problem you are working on and write. \n\nC. Have or developed the skills needed for your project. \n\nD. Work hard against all odds. This is the most important part. You will get papers rejected, have difficult problems but continue (and shift strategies when needed) \n\nE. Be passionate about the problem if you can and I really hope you can. It may not be the exact problem you want but if the area is what you are passionate about, you will be fine. \n\nF. Be smart about picking the advisor for you and work on a project that your advisor is interested and ideally has experience.",
