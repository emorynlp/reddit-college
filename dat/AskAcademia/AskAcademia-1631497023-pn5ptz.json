  "title:": "Earning an Undergraduate Degree and Masters Degree Simultaneously?",
  "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nIn the past, I've read about people who have impressively completed undergraduate and masters degrees simultaneously. I'm curious to know how this can be done and what type of credentials are needed to accomplish this? Are there specific joint programs or can a person just enroll in both undergraduate and graduate courses at the institution of interest?\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "Some schools have accelerated programs so you work towards finishing your undergrad degree while starting your masters degree. At my college it was called the 3+2 program and you had to apply during your junior year to be accepted for it. Typically, you would do 3 years of undergrad classes and two years of graduate level courses. The graduate courses would fulfill the rest of the undergraduate requirements. In year 4 you\u2019d graduate with an undergrad degree and in year 5 graduate with a masters. \n\nIn order to do this you\u2019d need permission from the school but I feel like there are plenty of places that offer this kind of track for those who are motivated enough to try it. The program I was describing was for a chemistry degree.",

The Honours is only offered to those getting great marks in their UG units, and getting an Honours would be equivalent to having a Masters for the purpose of entryway into PhD.",

Having honours is like a stamp that you have a brain and know how to use it but doesn't carry the premium salary demands of someone with a masters, so they can float to the top of the pile of job applicants. That being said,  most graduates with high GPA usually don't have trouble landing jobs in the first place, so Honours are generally taken by those who are flirting with maybe joining Academia",
