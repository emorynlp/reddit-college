  "title:": "I hear professors complain a lot about the peer review process \u2014 what's wrong with it, and what was your last experience like trying to get peer-reviewed and published?",
  "text": "Not sure if this is the right flair \u2014\u00a0let me know if it's wrong and I can edit that!\n\nThis is something I've been wondering about a lot recently. I think I might not fully understand the process. Some smaller/follow-up questions if you feel passionate:\n\n1. Is it true that when you submit to a journal, you have to **pay** to submit? Does your university typically cover that cost for you?\n2. Do you \\*actually\\* reach out to peers, or is that more an artifact of an older time? I've heard that professors often pay a journal peer-review board to look over their study.\n3. How long does the process take? Do you track your paper the whole way, or just wait in limbo for months on-end while the process drags on?\n\nI'm really just interested in understanding what the process looks like in 2021, why it sucks, and how your personal experience has been (I always love anecdotes to understand things more concretely!) with the system.\n\n**And lastly** \\- if you were in charge, what would you do to change the way we do peer-review?",

      "text": "1. In the humanities you do not pay to submit. Some publishers will charge you a fee to make your accepted paper open-access once published. A publishing company for a journal I looked into asks for around $1500 to make a paper open-access.\n2. The journal will choose peer-reviewers for your paper from their database.\n3. In the humanities the process can be very very slow. I've waited over a year for peer-reviews (never submitting there again), and I'm at the 8 month mark on one paper now. But I've also had great reviews in four months. You can email about progress, and they may not even respond. Maybe this is different for well-established scholars. \n\nWhat would I change? The speed of the process. There should be an updated and acceptable standard protocol for how long a peer-review should take. There really are almost no excuses for not being able to review an article within 2-4 months. \n\nAlso, mean and unprofessional reviews should be handled by the editor before sending the reviews to the writer. It's not difficult to have an acceptable standard protocol around the tone of the review either. \n\nPeer-review, for me, has been really helpful in many more ways than it has been unhelpful, but it's a very slow process.",

      "text": "1 - Yes, you pay to submit. It's usually more for colour figures, too. And it doesn't matter if it's an online-only journal, you still pay several thousand dollars. And if you want your paper to be open access (which some funding agencies make compulsory to grant holders), you start to enter crazy prices. Nature Publishing and Cell Press are about 10k per paper for full open access, which is beyond what some labs can afford. Universities might help pay for it, but usually this is up to the lab to cover it from grants.  \n2 - The journal editor will chose which peers will review your work. This may or may not be anonymous.  \n3 - Anywhere from a couple of months to several years, depending on the reviewer comments. If it's smooth, they might just ask for a couple of minor things. In other cases, there will be multiple rounds of revisions before the reviewers are happy. Note that you can go through multiple round of revisions, do all the experiences requested by the reviewers, and **they can still reject your manuscript**.  \nTo build on what is wrong with the current publishing industry: the published research is funded by tax payers. Then tax payers also foot the bill for actually publishing the work, since publication fees are also covered by grants. Then, if the work isn't open access, the public will have to pay once more to access and read the work. Does this sound fair?\n\nAnother thing: journals take money from researcher to publish work... which the researchers did. They then ask other researchers to review that work... for free. They then charge individuals and institutions to access and read that work. They also get extra cash from advertisers. And with most journals being online these days, where are their expenses except for a few salaries? Well, it would explain why their profit margins are [insane](https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1272142843235250181?s=20), at \\~37%. That's higher than banks. If I try to explain this to anyone outside academia, they will wonder wtf is wrong with us. It's blatantly a type of racket which we put up with.\n\nNow consider that it might take you several years to publish the work, as some manuscripts do. By then, your work might be a little out of date. Or someone else may have scooped you, by publishing the same results are yours. Which again means that tax payer money was put to very poor use. This is being somewhat addressed by means of preprint repositories, where academics can put manuscripts which will be accessible to anyone within 48 hours. It isn't peer reviewed, but at least your results are out there for your colleagues to see which accelerates the pace of science, and the upload date means it will be clear if you were the first to show these results.\n\nAnd the cherry on the cake: academics are judged by their publications. That is the primary way in which we are evaluated for jobs, for grants, for promotions, for everything. And it is based on a broken system. Publications can take years to go through peer review, so they clearly are not correlated with how much work you put in. There is a large amount of luck involved, and not all labs will be able to afford to publish in the same fancy journals. Yet this is what governs our career prospects. \n\nI'm sure I might have forgotten a few other aspects of peer review and the publishing system... but yeah, it isn't really a good thing for anyone. Except the publishing corporations, which are raking in money.",

Paying to publish after acceptance (\"page charge\") is only common in certain fields, primarily where the standard is open-access. I have never paid a cent to publish any of my work as I publish mostly in society journals (i.e., the journal is owned and operated not-for-profit by a professional society).\n2. The journal reaches out to the reviewers. The authors may suggest reviewers but the editors don't have to follow those suggestions. Before submitting a paper, I often get a \"friendly\" review from my colleagues or peers that I trust, but I don't pay them. \n3. It takes forever.  Since peer review is volunteer service to the academic community, it's hard as an editor to get good reviewers. So when someone good agrees to review you don't usually push them much on timeliness (otherwise they would just turn you down saying they're too busy, which is usually true).\n\nI would disagree that the process as a whole sucks. In fact, I have had some papers where the paper got *a lot* better because of excellent suggestions from peer reviewers. The fact that it takes forever does suck. Since the problems are mainly caused by the fact that we rely on the generosity of our peers, I would actually like to see a small stipend for (on-time) peer reviews. I think it would help make it less of a burden.",
