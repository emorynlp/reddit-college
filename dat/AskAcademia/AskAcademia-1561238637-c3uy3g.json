  "text": "Serious question, btw. I\u2019m relatively new to academia, and my area of study is in the humanities, specifically critical theory and literature. I teach humanities as well. \n\nI find when I talk to people about what I do, they often seem to feel like just about anyone who has a heartbeat is an \u201cexpert\u201d in the humanities. \n\nI don\u2019t mind it really, because I love talking about my work and a subject that I personally care a lot about. But why is it that this same thing doesn\u2019t happen to people with degrees in, say, physics or mathematics? Or does it?",

They\u2019re also far less culturally literate than they realize. There is a lot of resistance to the idea that they might be wrong or might not grasp some basic concepts. It\u2019s not unusual for someone to come out of my class still thinking the Renaissance and Ancient Greece occurred simultaneously. In this universe.

I\u2019ve been willing to try different methods and approaches, and I\u2019m happy to teach recent works, particularly those by women, POC, queer artists/writers, etc., but ultimately I don\u2019t see a lot of students really understanding abstract concepts in the humanities any better than they\u2019re doing in math or science.

      "text": "My PhD is in entomology and for a couple years I worked for a state agency. While I was there I did a lot of diagnosing injury to plants and received a ton of calls from the public. One time a guy called me up and explained a problem he was having with some young white pines he had planted several years ago and was very concerned because he loved them. Based on his description I knew 100% that it was just sapsuckers - woodpeckers that (as the name suggests) eat sap and bugs but usually don't kill trees. He was unconvinced so I made a visit to be totally sure. Once I got there, what little doubt I had was totally gone. It could not have been anything else than sapsuckers. There is literally not a single thing that could ever be mistaken for their damage (if you are in my field, at least). Dude tells me he googled it (of course he did) and they were bark beetles. I tell him no - this and this and this and this would be present if it were bark beetles. These 10 other reasons are why I know it's not bark beetles - it's a sapsucker. He continues to argue with me to the point where his wife taps him on the shoulder and reminds him that I went to school for this exact thing. He says nope. He knows they're bark beetles so he's going to CUT HIS TREES DOWN. I take my hatchet, scrape back a little bit of bark to show there are no beetles underneath the bark and then he proceeds to yell at me for scraping the bark and hurting his tree......that 30 seconds prior he told me he was going to cut down.....because of the bark beetles that weren't there. At that point I gave up and left. You want to cut your trees down for no reason, be my guest. But why the fuck even call me? Why ask me to come out if you are already so sure you're right? Why do people go to the hospital and then bitch about getting medication? I don't understand people and probably never will. Doesn't answer your question. Just commiserating I guess.",

      "text": "Because they are ignorant--  think of how badly the humanities are taught in American high schools: \"history\" is largely memorizing names/dates, and \"literature\" is dedicated largely to forcing disinterested non-readers to slowly plod through some random classic over the course of 8-10 weeks. None ever likely get a hint of real philosophy, theology, or much else. All of this taught, typically, by people who do not even have BAs in true humanities disciplines, but rather hold education degrees with broad certifications (\"English\" or \"reading\"). So the masses have zero exposure or idea of what humanities scholarship actually involves.\n\nSecond, they are all experts. Because who hasn't watched a Ken Burns documentary, which makes them an historian, or read *Catcher in the Rye*, which makes them an expert on literature? If your idea of historical scholarship is simply \"knowing stuff\" and of literature is just \"I read a book once,\" the only difference between a 15-year-old high school student and a Ph.D. is the amount of time invested, and of course most think that a waste anyway.\n\nBecause they hold such cartoonish ideas of what humanities scholarship involves it's both easy to discount and hard to understand when someone suggests there's more to it. Nor does it help that our broader culture now considers the humanities a \"luxury\" at best or a distraction unworthy of societal investment at worst. When people *do* encounter real humanities scholarship that challenges their pre-conceived notions of history, identity, culture, etc. they often react poorly-- seeing it as an attack on their culture by \"elites\" who don't do anything constructive.\n\nThis is very much a post-modern phenomenon in America; only 1-2 generations ago literary figures were cultural heroes and historians were consulted by presidents. Both fields-- and indeed the humanities writ more broadly --lost their popular audiences *because* they took to challenging the status quo while simultaneously falling into the sort of internal monologues that characterized the worst of the theory debates of the 80s/90s, preferring to either throw bombs or to hide their thoughts behind such tortured language that it took a graduate degree to get past the first paragraph.\n\nThis has all been politicized of course, which doesn't help either-- the anti-intellectual strain in American culture was flamed by the right in the 1950s for political reasons and they've been fanning the fire ever since.",

      "text": "Well you could argue that Humanities Scholars have worked very hard over the last 50 years or so to dethrone expertise in the humanities. When you start saying that picking a great book is just like picking your favorite pizza. Or that Star Wars is just as important a literary genre for us to study as Dostoevsky. That the lions are just as discerning as the lion tamer. Or that reading the romance is just as important to the study of literature as reading Shakespeare. Or that fans and the audience are just as important as the work and the author. Or that there is no canon of great books written by great authors, but that anything can be a great book or that there are no great books at all nor any special authors.\n\nI mean logically: if you believe that there is no elite canon produced by great authors how can you say that there are elite experts about books and authors?\n\nI\u2019m not opposed to any of these trends \u2014 A lot of my own research on the famous imagery focuses on audience reactions \u2014 but they all are in fact trends that ended up dethroning expertise and making the old definition of the humanities as the \u201cbest and most beautiful\u201d elite body of literature studied by elites to be unpassable today.\n\nFor want of a better term expert is elite In the very old-fashioned sense of the word. And we have dethroned elitism. We have said that everybody\u2019s opinion is equal. We have said that every work of literature is equal.\n\nSo saying that it\u2019s the American public at fault, that somehow they are being anti-intellectual, when most of the trends among scholars have been in fact anti-elite is to me a misplacement of blame or credit however you view the outcomes.\n\nBasic point: If you say that there are no elite books, no elite authors, then it\u2019s hard to sustain the idea that there are elite critics.",

      "text": "It's really a matter of two factors. The first one is largely self-imposed.\n\nContemporary humanities scholarship -- especially with regard to literature -- is built in large part around postmodernism and reader-response criticism. It's easy for people to see themselves as experts when it comes to the humanities when every perspective or point of view toward a text is weighed and considered.\n\nI don't personally mind it. In fact, I think reader-response criticism generates much more valuable discussion toward a particular text than taking a more formalist or New Critical lens -- for example, eking out all the literary devices of a poem and signifying their literary \"worth.\" It might be an interesting exercise to understand why Shakespeare is appreciated by literary scholars, but it's a much more interesting exercise to give a poem or short story to a group of students of varied backgrounds and experiences and seeing what _they_ attach to -- often with wildly different takeaways and interpretations.\n\nEach of their reactions toward that text can further influence the interpretations other students make, which reshapes the text and recreates it anew. But the side-effect is that some people don't think that exercise has much value when anyone can participate in it -- especially when it seems a little circlejerky (many smaller lit classes are actually shaped into a Socratic circle) with no real intellectual value.\n\nThe other factor is that everyone believes themselves to be good critical thinkers and, therefore, sees themselves above criticism, which is the irony inherent to critical thinking. Good critical thinkers are always skeptical of themselves and are perfectly comfortable with being wrong.\n\nI'd also argue that to a lesser extent the humanities have failed to properly modernize themselves. I talk about reading Shakespeare for example, but many of my students don't read outside of class, and even fewer of them are willing to read something more than a few months or even a few years old. This is why I've restructured a lot of my courses around contemporary texts. In my rhetoric classes we talk about social media. In my literature classes we talk about Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. I think if the average student felt the material they read connected more so with the types of written, audio, and visual texts they interacted with outside of class, they'd put a little more value in the discussions they attended and the lessons that they learned.",

When I go on JStor to look up articles on idk Ulysses, I'm not looking for a description of what 10 20 year olds thought about it (although that's certainly interesting); I'm looking for some comprehensive review that helps me understand where the novel comes from historically or literarily, what effect it has on texts that came after it or on how, as a result of its existence, we have come to view the texts that came before it, or something else that lends me a perspective on the text that I don't have time to build up on my own. I think in many ways humanities scholarship has moved away from being scholarship that other people can consume, and while your teaching strategy is great, I wish there were more opportunities to engage with humanities scholarship for those of us who are no longer able to devote 2 hours a day to talking about Shakespeare in a kumbaya circle with other undergrads.",

              "text": "> More traditionally, formalism is about figuring out why and how a text works. \n\nFormalism is the study of, well, form. It's a study of structure and classification. It's the omission of cultural, social, historical, and even biographical (concerning the author) analysis. And what's left after all that is removed? Literary devices and tropes.\n\nIt's a vacuum-sealed \"close reading\" approach that later developed into New Criticism -- a school of thought that, while valuable in some aspects, inevitably came off as a bunch of old white men deciding how everything should be interpreted, read, and valued. One might argue it's very obvious why New Criticism took root and then subsequently failed around the same time colleges became less white and less male.\n\nBut I'm not here to vilify formalism. I don't think it's a bad technique. I just think it's boring. It still has its value in genre study, at the very least. If I were to teach a class about comic books or detective novels, I would rely primarily on a formalist approach.\n\nBy understanding what formalism is, you can also better understand the pursuits of postmodernism and its desire to avoid classification.\n\n> I'm looking for some comprehensive review that helps me understand where the novel comes from historically or literarily, what effect it has on texts that came after it or on how, as a result of its existence, we have come to view the texts that came before it, or something else that lends me a perspective on the text that I don't have time to build up on my own.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that reader-response criticism hasn't eliminated cultural studies, literary historicism, or gender studies. If anything, it has only amplified them. I am teaching a survey of American literature course starting in July that starts from the Civil War to the present. We'll still go over each of the major literary movements and all that -- I feel like it's impossible not to -- but the emphasis of discussion is still going to be on my students and their reactions.",

Smart people have been die-hard racists, white supremacists, anti-Western postcolonialists, etc.\n\nThe idea that there is a reason that left-wing ideology permeates academia at that moment, and that the reason for it is that the ideology is correct because of this, is fallacious and shows a profoundly short-term view of the historical politics of academia.",

You argue that academics tend to fall left of center (which is correct probably), but you also seem to argue that being this far left is objectively wrong. I don't think that leaning to some side of what is effectively an ordinal scale can be argued to be objectively wrong, given the scale is ordinal. \n\n2. Speaking of objectivity, there are some common results in social science that lend themselves more easily to a leftist political viewpoint than a right one. For example, we have little evidence that, say, black people are stupider than white people, and lots of evidence to the contrary. If I were to vote my conscience (as one should), knowing that would pull me towards voting for the left. \n\n3. Intellectual elites are certainly more homogeneous than we like to admit, which imo does lend itself to the argument that non-academics don't like academics because they are not like us, but it doesn't really speak to your notion that one side is wrong here and the other is right. \n\n3. A small technical criticism: even if on average academics fall left of center, an average is a poor measure of central tendency here because academics cluster politically by department.",

I'm in the sciences, and I get so frustrated watching my colleagues treat very real realms of study as wispy, intangible, who-can-know rhetoric that they have a strong opinion about; the worst are the boomers who seem to have an almost pathologic preoccupation with schooltime rivalries. Like, hey, you have a problem with gender or ethnicity in the workplace, you wouldn't believe it but there's a huge literature and people at this very university who spend their entire lives studying exactly that! You can even consult these sociology stats...hello? Wait, come back...\n\nI recently suggested to a climate scientist, who claims to be interested in communication, that he should consult people in psych and anthro, when he said he was having trouble getting people to understand something worded weirdly in the science. He took it as a personal affront. You would think I'd insulted his family.\n\nThe real problem is that these research topics are so undervalued that they're not represented anywhere. Somehow people in business can justify an infinite number of useless administrators, but no one thinks to have an anthropologist on every staff (and there definitely should be). There are no government agencies nor public resources available that make this data widely accessible (in some cases at least) and that itself has lead to huge problems across the board. Anyway, I share your frustration.",

You mention this is because its undervalued; I think the reason it is under valued is because it has relatively little economic output compared to the physical sciences. \n\nThe other contributing factor is that the humanities are definitely lacking in intellectual ~~substance~~ content compared to the physical sciences. I don't mean to bash here, let me explain. This is because of two reasons. 1. the topics are far more difficult to give a framework to compared to the physical sciences (the framework in physical science being mathematical theory), and so people in humanities spend a lot of effort teaching and arguing about methodology as opposed to teaching and arguing over the actual useful output of well entrenched methodology (arguing over and teaching methodology is basically unheard of in the physical sciences). 2. the humanities generate little economic output; and so receive little economic input. This has lead to the systematic effect that the humanities simply have had less of humanity's combined intellectual output dedicated to them relative to the physical sciences; which is kinda ironic.\n\nEdit: I understand why some people may find this difficult to appreciate; but I'd encourage you to create discussion rather than downvote and move on. I'd also like to add that I personally don't think the humanities are less valuable than the physical sciences; in fact I personally value certain fields in humanities higher than any physical sciences. I'm just trying to point out structural reasons why they tend to be undervalued in the moment.\n\nNoam Chomsky on the issue: from a lecture he gave and a short essay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6PgaOOZB6M \n\n> You learn by doing, and you figure out how to do things by watching other people do them. Thats the way you learn to be a good carpenter, for example, and the way you learn to be a good physicist. Nobody can train you on how to do physics. You don\u2019t teach methodology courses in the natural sciences. You may in the social sciences. In any field that has significant intellectual content, you dont teach methodology. You just watch people doing it and participate with them in doing it. \n\nhttps://chomsky.info/20001210/",

An unsureness around nouns that mirrors your awkwardness with punctuation?), and that assumed goodwill even when you are not the best representative of your field is probably the difference between physics and the humanities that people here are trying to explain.",

      "text": "It absolutely happens in hard sciences as well. When I've mentioned what I'm currently working on, people have suddenly become experts in the formulation of paints (including its economics), forest ecology and forest residue harvesting, the pharmacology of Alzheimer's medications, the environmental effects of the oil industry and so on. I guess it's that what precious little they know about the topic, they'll try to bring up to connect with you. It's interesting to talk to people who are actual and not pretend experts.\n\nTo answer your original question, I think this applies to all sciences, but more so to the humanities: it's the sheer depth of knowledge you're expected to master. What I mean by this is that if you're an expert in X, you don't just have a couple of random opinions about X, or work on just the latest topic about X that was in the news or which you just heard about from someone. Instead, you've studied five different theories about X, and to it's hard to summarize all that in a soundbite - you'd have to lecture for hours to give a complete picture, and your listener soon wouldn't be one. The \"instant expert effect\" is a result of not understanding this.",

      "text": "To play devils advocate a little:\n\nFirstly I think the humanities can come across as a bit of a social signalling game. A group of people write papers in journals which are reviewed and read by that same group, it can come across as all just buzzwords which you use to signal you are part of the group. See the [Sokal Hoax.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair)\n\nSecondly lack of utility. Going to the moon is way more impressive to the lay person than publishing a comprehensive study of the esoteric literature of 15th century Spain, even though that sounds super interesting. Somehow a lot of the humanities can come across as just reading books and talking about them for no particular reason. \n\nThirdly I think it's really hard to be aware of how natural \"cognitive technology\" feels. For example you're reading this sentence right now completely effortlessly but the amount of hard work done by you and others to get language to the point where you can do that is vast. Same thing with ideas: you can look at things through an economic lens or a feminist lens etc and it seems very natural to see that way, even though it took a huge amount of work to build up those lenses in the first place.",

Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose) to create bogus academic papers and submit them to academic journals in the areas of cultural, queer, race, gender, fat, and sexuality studies.  The authors' intent was to expose problems in \"grievance studies\", a term they apply to a subcategory of these academic areas, in which \"poor science is undermining the real and important work being done elsewhere.\"The hoax began in 2017 and continued into 2018, when it was halted after one of the papers caught the attention of journalists, who quickly found its purported author, Helen Wilson, to be non-existent. This led to more media attention as the hoax was more broadly exposed by news outlets.By the time of the reveal, four of their 20 papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, six had been rejected, and seven were still under review. One of the published papers had won special recognition.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

The views of those who are in position to know the most (climate scientists) are discounted in favor of those who lick their fingers and hold them up to the wind.\n\nIn general, Americans feel that knowledge limits you and weakens you. Think of it this way: if you hold to knowledge and evidence, then 2+2 can only equal 4. But if you discard evidence, and if make lies the truth, then 2+2 can equal anything you want--the possibilities are endless.",
