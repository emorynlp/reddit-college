      "text": "It varies a lot but academia is not renowned for it's handling of bullying and harrassment. \n\nYour question actually points to a significant part of the issue - that is professors handling complaints of bullying.  In no other sector or industry would a random section of staff be handling disciplinary matters, that's why you have HR and what they're trained to do. Obviously, HRs have their own reputation but that's a different issue. \n\nProfessors often don't have basic management skills - they aren't taught and they aren't valued by anyone who is assessing a professors work. They certainly don't know employment law and often are conflicted when handling these issues. \n\nWhere I work is different, in as much as HR does deal with allegations of bullying but it's not the sector norm. That said we've recently discovered that PIs often aren't reporting concerns or issues in their teams, not it seems for nefarious purposes but because they don't think of it and don't understand what HR really do, despite the fact that all PIs regularly meet with HR partners. \n\nBasically, academia broadly is a hot mess when it comes to handling bullying. You may get someone who handles it really well or you might not. Things are improving and some places are much more openly discussing it and they hopefully would be better.\n\nETA I'm a senior manager and I was bullied by a very very senior member of staff (non-academic). It was not handled well, in part because this person was so senior HR was freaking out. However, it has actually resolved itself and after nearly 2 years of stressful nonsense we've reached a place where we can get on and do our jobs. It helps if your manager/PI backs you up and if you keep the emotional heat down (very difficult when you're being bullied) and just keep raising issues as they happen without getting upset (whoever's handling it will be less defensive if they feel they are able to talk to you about stuff and you're not going to fly off the handle. It's not great but there it is).",

Sure, you can send an email complaint to *someone*, but there\u2019s actually no clear way to trigger the mediation process and there\u2019s no obvious candidate for who would be the mediator. If the students are from different colleges then there\u2019s really nothing done because the colleges don\u2019t talk.\n\nThe university recently tried to launch a new web portal for reporting instances of bullying after a study found 1/3rd of all students suffered bullying (and the same for staff). It was taken down within the first day. Someone didn\u2019t agree with one of the examples of bullying and threatened to sue. It hasn\u2019t gone back up afaik",

      "text": "We have a Crisis Intervention Team and online reporting system for student problems. In my experience when something is reported those folks respond very quickly and involve everybody associated with the issue. Most of the time it's about standard mental health issues but in the single instance that I know of involving bullying they got both students there and talked with them individually and then together about potential consequences of bullying (as well as false reports of bullying) and then got both into the counseling center (separately). It's helpful that counselors are part of the Crisis Intervention Team so they already know of the background. I've not ever seen anything negative about students who are referred; I imagine that faculty see enough disordered behavior that a referral is viewed in more of a positive than negative light because it makes it more likely that the student will get needed help.",
