  "text": "Hi All. Sorry for the long text in advance, but I reaaaaally need help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need help understanding what's happening because I am completely lost. Here is what has happened. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started my PhD in another country about a month and a half ago. My two supervisors got a grant and I was able to get the position after the interviews. An important thing to know is that they work in different universities and is a multidisciplinary project, so the science they do is completely different and I was told I would have to go from one place to the other regularly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first month was completely in my first supervisor university and everything went super well. We really got along, I was getting super positive feedback, I really connected with my coworkers, ... This supervisor measures our performance with a KPI thing on an excel and he told me he was super happy and that he was really surprised with how well I was doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that meeting, I was told I had to go 5 days to the lab of my other supervisor. This is when things started to get weird. \n\nI arrived there and I was getting a weird vibe from my supervisor but it was the first time we met in real life so I didn't think too much about it. She starts to show me the place and tells me that she wants to show me some IT stuff. I told her that I didn't bring my work laptop from the other place but that I had brought my personal laptop (I know this is my bad, I just assume she was going to give me one, but again completely my bad). She told me something like \"don't worry, I will send you the manuals and you can let me know if you have an issue when you go back\". After that, we started doing some work that day and everything was ok. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day, we had to prepare to do some experiments with animals to extract their organs while there were still alive. Just to be clear during the interviews I was only told \"you will have to work with organs and biological samples\". So during that experiment, I felt pretty bad, told her that I was going out for a while and then came back and told her that I was sorry that I felt very uncomfortable with that. She told me to go home and to contact my other supervisor because she thought that he should know. I did that and went to sleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I was able to that experiments but I was starting to receive a lot of random negative comments from this woman like \"I feel you are absolutely not interested in this project\" out of nowhere. She also told me things like \"you are not taking notes\" that at the time she told me that I was not taking notes but at other moments I was taking notes, she also said things like \"you can use your time to read papers\" that is something that I was also doing but not exactly at the moment she told me that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDays went by and, honestly, our relationship kind of went to this place of not really talking that much. Now I know it was a super stupid move from me. I did everything that she told me to do but I recognise that I didn't do more than what she told me to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last day I was there she told me to meet her at her office. There she started saying things to me like \"I don't think you are a good student\", \"I don't think you will be able to find collaborators\", \"This PhD is going to get harder and harder\", ... To those things, I didn't really answer a lot of things other than \"sorry, the next time I come here I will try to improve\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day I had a holiday but the \"nice supervisor\" called me to go to his office. So I went and he was there waiting for me with the other supervisor on zoom. I go in and he tells me \"For legal reasons we have to record this\" (I knew things were not going well at that point). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey started to accuse me of multiple things. Some things were true, for example, the fact that I left that day at the experiment. Other things were half-trues, for example, that I didn't take my work laptop (which is true but she didn't tell me it was a problem). Some things were lies, for example, the \"nice supervisor\" told me that he received very negative feedback from my coworkers. I later checked with them and they promised me that they gave very positive feedback in fact. And some things were absolute bullsh\\*t, for instance, they were questioning why I was living in a town and not in the city. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, they told me that I was fired. They told me that if I resigned they would write me a \"somewhat good\" recommendation letter for another place but that if they had to fire me they would not do that. After a couple of minutes of discussion, I told them to give me a couple of weeks to prove to them that I can work better. They talked about it and that I had a week and a half to do it. They told me that they were going to write a list of things they want me to do, but that they were not going to give that list, I had to figure it out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I talked with my coworkers and they presented a letter to the \"nice\" supervisor telling them that they don't agree with that decision and that they never gave negative feedback and that this letter is there to prove that they want to give positive feedback about me. \n\nSomething else that I discovered while talking with my colleagues is that this supervisor started to ask them HR questions (like \"do you think he is reliable?) the day after I left the experiment with the animals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day (today), my supervisor told me to go to his office. We sat down and gave a list of very general and broad stuff like \"don\u00b4t assume, ask first\", \"think before you act\", \"recognise your mistakes\", ... He also told me that I should try to focus on impressing the other supervisor not him. I thanked him for that list (even though it was not the list they wrote the day before and it was more like \"tips\"). I also told him that I don't know what I am going to be able to do in just one week and a half, he agreed to that. He also told me that he thinks that their decision to fire me was not the best way to handle it, but that if they don't fire me now they cannot fire me for the next 9 months. He told me that he thought I had a chance of doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis supervisor has money for hiring more students without the other supervisor. I asked him if he saw changing me to another project as an option (so basically me not working with the other supervisor). He told me that he does not see it as an option because \"that is too easy and you have to learn to work with different kind of people\", which is kind of true (i guess).\n\nI have been doing my work, reading papers and sending very nice emails to show that I care. I am going to go next week to the other university to show that I care (I cannot go more because of COVID). I have apologized to both of them for not being able to prove how much I like this position. But, honestly, there are not that many things one can achieve (at least in my field) in a week and a half. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am very worried. I came from another country, I have contracts here now for two years (apartment, phone, health insurance, ...), I really like the project that I am doing, the coworkers are really nice, ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to know your opinion. Do you think I have options of keeping the position? Do you think they just gave me this week and a half to \"show that they tried to let me improve but I didn't\"? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading my story. Please don't hesitate to comment!! I really can use all the help and tips I can get!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I know I have not given a lot of specific details, but I would also like to stay as anonymous as possible just to avoid potential problems. But if you think that there is something important that could be missing please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again",

I wonder whether there might not be more wriggle room here if it really comes to it, but you might need to bring in someone else with more authority. Possibly the university has some kind of ombudsman or grad student director to talk to and get involved before actually mentioning a lawyer (which is the nuclear and high-risk option of course - but you can talk to one without telling them).\n\n\\> Just to be clear during the interviews I was only told \"you will have to work with organs and biological samples\". \n\nThis also seems like quite a serious issue, if you took the job and made all the associated arrangements based on a misleading job description.\n\nWish the best in any case - something will work out and things might be a blessing in disguise, you never know. But I'd really mainly get that advice and support if at all possible so they can't bully you in the shadows so easily at least. And keep your own notes in any case, and maybe recordings (you might have to tell them you're making your own if they are, depending on local laws).",

I've never quite been pushed far enough to involve a lawyer, but I'd just want to know what the rights/responsibilities are - they quite possibly have some clause that lets them fire you easily, but have someone check it, especially given they've done some stuff that they might have been wiser not to.

If your project involves working with biological samples then of course you will have to collect them, there's not some servant there to do it for you. It's also a little hypocritical to be happy to work with biological samples, but not to collect them. Either OP doesn't mind working with animal samples in which case they should learn to collect them, or they do mind, in which case they shouldn't do this project.",

      "text": "Just saw in this thread somewhere that this is in France. I'm from France and in academia so here are some tips. I won't speak about who's right or wrong here, but only the exact next legal steps you could take.\n\nNo need to waste time on a lawyer in France. They have the full right to fire you for any reason (which could also be that they're just generally not satisfied) as long as you're still in probation period. If you can still survive in the lab beyond the probation period, then you're set and stable for this year at least.\n\nNow let's speak of the case where you either resign or they fire you. You must have come through 'Visa Talent Chercheur'. If it is already validated, you can stay from 3 months to 1 year in france without issues even if you're fired. Beyond that, if you do not have another position, you gotta go back (or become irregular, and I don't advice that). \n\nNow in that time, you could first do student jobs (you're considered a student while in phd in france). Be sure to have on you certificates that you're a student before you get fired, so that you can still get those jobs even if fired. Those jobs will keep you fed at least. At the same time, look for a new phds. \n\nI would advice in this part to resign and get the recommendation from them, as its extremely important in France to have a french recommendation for a phd, and expect that if you don't have it, your new phd PIs would definitively ask your old PIs about why you didn't continue with them, so expect trouble there. That's why again, OP, you should definitively get a letter of recommendation before leaving.\n\nAnother option is getting a job in industry. Kind of tough as  the company recruiting you would need to get a work permit for you, but still an avenue of possibility.\n\nEDIT : added my country",

There's definitely a lot of people who flame out for some reason in the first year and start somewhere new and just never mention it.",

So there would definitively be questions about that. He also can't hide the visa, as usually they have services that would help him get his paperwork. \n\nIt's just kinda tricky to hide it in those situations, as coming out clean would be better in the case they were gonna know anyway. It instills trust. But if OP gonna hide completely that he got a Visa and tell them that he would try to get a new one and that he is still in his home country, it could work.\n\nBut again, risk to be caught lying, which would make him lose his phd, and its just not worth it.\n\nOne tip I would heavily recommend in academia, is to just be stupidly responsibly honest. For my case, it made a lot of things easier and less complicated, even tho incurred some losses because of it. But you get so much respect from PI when you're just honest and upfront. And they act the same with you",

It\u2019s common sense people.\n\nBut you would have already known that pediatric oncology involved working with kids. OP didn't know that their research would involve witnessing extraction of organs from *live* animals.\n\nAnd if you didn't know that working with X group would be terrible, surely you should be offered the chance to switch topics/groups? There are other projects OP can be moved to. I don't see how it is right to expel the student for something they really have no control over - they don't choose to be sensitive to this issue and they didn't take on the position with any expectation that this would be the nature of the work. They were not informed in any way that they could be put in an ethically ambiguous/challenging situation.\n\nExtraction of organs from live animals is going to be traumatising to most people and it's absolutely the PI's responsibility to make sure potential students know it's a part of the job. Otherwise why the fuck are they bothering to interview people if it's not to check compatibility? That's very different to your pediatric example.",

Things are only going to get harder. I'm sorry you're going through this, and I know how hard of a decision this is going to be for you. I went through something similar, and to have your advisor threaten to fire you without the ability to explain yourself feels so shitty. I wish you the best of luck!",

They join a lab and are expected to know everything and start producing results the same week. They were then fired during the probationary period for not producing enough. You have come from another country with another language, it should be expected that it takes you time to adjust and understand the project. One should not have to know everything about the project when joining a new lab! It is for them to provide some guidance and training. Then after you can continue reading! Please do not feel guilty regarding this. This is the supervisors fault. \n\nI would advise you to leave this position. This is a huge red flag and shows how they will resort to firing you as the first option instead of talking to you and communicating what you want. I know it\u2019s risky to leave now but honestly even if you stay there could be so many issues down the line. What if they refuse to publish your results because they are unreliable? They could make your time hell there.\n\nIn terms of animal experiments, what they did was hugely unethical. It should have been made clear that you would do surgery. Also in the lab I am in many people have not managed to work with the mice. It has been very hard for people and that should be expected. There is an adjustment period for new members. Any good and kind supervisor will know that.\n\nAnyone telling you to accept this has been sucked into the academia mindset where we are supposed to know everything and produce results instantly. We are not robots, we make mistakes and it is normal even as a postdoc to need time to adjust. Your supervisors sound cruel and completely unempathetic. They are concerned only for their project. They do not care to try to mentor you. Even the nice supervisor still agree to try to fire you. \n\nI just wanted you to know that the \u2018mistakes\u2019 they talked about were completely normal things to do when starting out. Don\u2019t feel like a bad scientist because of what they said. I know how horrible it can be when supervisors talk to you like that. You deserve better.",

I think this omission is important - because actually you didn't agree to working this way. \nI can sense some unease about this, and it made me uncomfortable reading it.  I think you didn't get a chance to consider how this type of work truly fits in with your ethics, and I think each person should be in a position to do things with integrity. \nI think their position is incredibly shady - they didn't give you a full opportunity to consent to this work with ethical integrity, and they are shifting the responsibility for this dubious behaviour onto you, by making you feel like a bad worker. \n\nPersonally I'd cut my losses and take the option of resigning, and take my time to  consider what exactly are your motivations for doing science, and exactly where you stand ethically on these types of experiments. Find out exactly what is considered good practice, and if you are comfortable with pursuing it with good practice, and how you can safeguard yourself when there isn't good practice in place. \n\n\nIf you are doing such tricky work, you need to be 100% sure that it agrees with your ethics, and that the procedures followed are correct... and that you are able to clench your teeth and do it, when you need to. \n\nIf you don't feel confident in your boundaries, and that this is absolutely the right thing to do OR you feel that you simply lack the stomach for it - figure out another path. It's not fair to anyone to do something without full conviction in an area that is so tricky.",

The issue is about ethics and consent. But the sounds of it OP did not get a chance to give informed consent to participating in these experiments, because the were not told that live experiments will be the case. \n\nThey did not get a chance to see if their personal ethics align with these tasks. \n\nAnd it doesn't matter if they were performing any of the important surgery task, or just taking notes in a corner- it's exactly the same when it comes to ethics and consent. \"Does this align with what I believe in?\" It is not about being squamish or weak. It's about doing something you feel is right or wrong. \n\n\nGoing by the OP did not get a chance to fully consider the implications of this, because they were not fully informed about it at the time of the interview. \nIf they were informed about this, at the point of interview, you'd be somehow correct in your point that they should have decided to not take part then and there... but they were not.\nThey thought they have signed up for something different. \n\nAnd... I can sense that you absolutely believe that this is only an issue of squeamishness, or incompetence...but that is still the responsibility of the institution. Because if this person is incompetent, they shouldn't be in there in the first place.  \n\nAnd secondly... as others were saying this requires training. It also requires knowledge that what you are doing is necessary and good, and not harming animals unnecessarily. \n\nBut the sounds of it - OP was just rushed doing something they didn't agree  fully internally, and hence did not want to take part in it. They were also rushed into without proper training. That's not something to be mean to OP about. \n\nThis absolutely isn't a situation like medicine, where you know that what you do is ethically fully sound, because your job is to simplify help people, and where you could judge people for being \"squeamish\". \n\nIt's a different setting and situation - because there are different shades of ethics possible (some experiments are necessary, whilst some might be more difficult to justify), and people relate differently to animals.  \n\nWhilst during a human surgery you know exactly and intuitively that what you are doing is right, you need to have a slightly longer chain of mental justification in place for doing experiments on animals. Some have very straight forward belief system, where they think all experiments are fine.. and some have more complex positions. Some will see them as lower in the chain of evolution and there to use \"in the service of science and humanity\" and others will relate to their sentience and be distressed by experiments. It's very nuanced, very personal and individual.\n\nAnd by the sounds of it OP didn't fully establish that chain of justification for that particular instance... they weren't sure exactly what is their position on the ethics of it, because they weren't given the opportunity to fully consent  to it, hence it didn't feel automatically right to them, and hence they left.

They are consistently like this towards students, to the point where every single post from a student must be twisted such that the student is 100% at fault and the faculty are 100% spotless in their actions. They're not raising reasonable doubts at all. They're living in a constructed world where they (and all others in the profession) are righteously infallible. Even if a student says they were sexually assaulted and abused, this person would find a way to defend the perpetrators, so long as they were faculty members.\n\n>I think it's a reasonable question to ask why the OP was so surprised about the details of the research being done. Why didn't the OP look up papers from the lab and the other PI?\n\nThey *have* been reading papers. I think we all know very well how much journal papers conveniently leave out as assumed knowledge. If every academic knows the organs came from an animal, and if it doesn't really matter if the organs were extracted immediately or if the authors themselves did that task, then it often doesn't get included in the paper. At least in my field, more than *half* of an experimental setup will not be described in the paper. When you have experience with that setup yourself then you can fill in the blanks, but a student with no direct experimental experience has no way of knowing. This knowledge is informally passed down from supervisor to student, *not* through papers.\n\n>And I was also a little taken aback that the OP kind of conveniently let everyone have the impression that he was asked to surgically remove organs and then sheepishly walked that back afterwards.\n\nI didn't see that at all. All they said is that they and the supervisor had to prepare to do an experiment that involved removing organs. *You* (general \"you\") assume that meant they were taking the organs out, but they never said that or said anything directly misleading. And they're not a native English speaker either, so I'd say they've done a very good job actually. You try explaining your work setup in Farsi and see how many things end up ambiguous. \n\n>I mean, you have to admit it's a pretty extraordinary step for them to be ready to let him go a few days in. It's a whole procedure to recruit and hire someone, and all sorts of administrative procedure to terminate. So there has to be something to the other side of the story.\n\nThe \"other side of the story\" is the fact that this takes place in France, where there is a short probationary period where a student can be dismissed easily and after that it becomes practically impossible and probably involves paying money to OP. If this were in the US then it'd just be your run-of-the-mill abuse case with a student who hangs around for 7-10+ years, perpetually denied graduation so they can push out \"just one more paper\" on the PIs name. \n\nAnd in any case, the PIs are clearly trying to hide something. Why be nice and supportive for 2 months just to turn around in 2-5 days? Why tell the student that they need to get on the *other* PI's good side? Why refuse to let them switch projects and then claim it's because they need to learn to do hard things? There is definitely some information missing: the cause of the PI's *corruption*. It's obvious that whatever is motivating them to fire OP, it is primarily *not* OP's conduct. If someone is a bad student/worker to the point of wanting to fire them, you give them official verbal and written warnings. None of that has happened here.",

But if this is the general flavor of how these conversations go, with 99% of the commenters sort of jumping over each other to just automatically accept at face value that the student's story is an accurate picture, then I think it's useful to have someone be the skeptical scientist about it.

Try and find out what the University's obligations to you are as a student, not just as a graduate worker. If your University has some sort of Ombudsperson or Student Affairs official, reach out to them. You are almost certainly entitled to use their services while looking up legal aid. Note that this will be different from University HR. These are individuals specifically mandated to consider and watch out for student interest in the University.\n\nGo over your PhD offer letter. What did it say? Typically a PhD offer constitutes a firm offer letter. While the University is naturally entitled to dismiss you for things such as violations of academic integrity or failing to meet pre-set academic benchmarks, these are outlined in the University website if not your offer letter. I find it hard to imagine you failed to meet academic benchmarks within a month. That's just now how evaluations go. As your supervisor's and PIs your faculty are under an obligation to train you.\n\nYour problem will be that you're technically operating out of two universities. But which one are you affiliated to? Who was going to be granting your degree? They're the ones who owe you obligations and protections as a student. Reach out to them. The other university will likely have no real obligation to you since you won't be \"their student.\"",

If so, I can see why she dramatized everything to such a high level (probably because she isn\u2019t a good person).\n\nI don\u2019t understand how your primary supervisor doesn\u2019t have the leverage to fund you outside of her project though.
