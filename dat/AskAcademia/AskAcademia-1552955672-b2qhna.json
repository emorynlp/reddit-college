  "text": "so, this may be a stupid question but i would definitely appreciate some input...my masters thesis defense is at the end of april. the room i'm holding it in is a conference room, there are probably about twenty chairs down a long table. this information feels necessary for me to report for some reason. for some reason, this set up seems less comfortable for me to have my parents present than if it were in a more lecture style room. is it normal for parents to come to a thesis defense? would i be a super weirdo if they did? \n\ni'm a first gen american and college student, so i'm the first in my family to do something like this and my parents are very proud. my dad would really like to attend, but i don't want him to if it will be odd.

Whether master thesis defenses are public or not depend on the school. I wouldn't think inviting your parents is weird. Maybe just check in with your supervisor about your intentions, but really there shouldn't be an issue. Goodluck!!",

      "text": "I am a first gen student as well, and my parents came to my defense. I really wanted them there and they wanted to be there. My defense was public and in a lecture room with more seating, but I think if your defense is public and you want them there then it should be no problem. Are you able to defend in a larger room, it might make you more comfortable?\n\n&#x200B;",

I personally am planning on not having my parents there and telling them not to come if they ask, but we have a not-great relationship and them being there would add waaaay more stress to an already-stressful event.

In principle it\u2019s not weird (if it\u2019s a public defense) but in my program it\u2019s more of a professional thing with committee members and lab members in attendance, maybe a significant other at most. It would be pretty weird and unusual to have your parents there and personally that would not remotely interest me. It\u2019s up to you! ",
