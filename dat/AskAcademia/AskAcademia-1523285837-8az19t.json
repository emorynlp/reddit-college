  "text": "The title says it all. I'm grading assignments and I might lose my mind. \n\nWhen I first got into academia I scoffed at the old curmudgeons that talked down on students. Now I'm starting to feel the same way, but that path obviously doesn't lead anywhere good for me or the students.\n\nStudents are busy, I get it. There's a cost-benefit analysis they go through when writing papers and trying to decide how much time to spend on them. But come on. I'm sick and tired of reading low-effort, first draft, submitted 10 minutes before the deadline assignments that are two pages shorter than the minimum requirement.\n\nIt's probably my fault. I just don't understand why. We covered the content in class. It's also in the book. The assignment instructions are detailed. There's a rubric. I made it very clear on more than one occasion this is NOT an assignment to do the night before it's due. From my perspective, they have everything they need to succeed.\n\nI'm guilty of lecturing far too much, maybe they just aren't motivated or see the value of spending time on the assignments?\n",

      "text": "Most PhD students were passionate and accomplished undergrads who didn't need much handholding or help meeting deadlines, so when they become teachers, I think they're sometimes a little thrown by the fact that the average performance is well below their level. Which is fine. A lot of people will be prioritizing other things over your class, either because they're going through a tough time and have to or because they'd rather fuck around than study (which is a part of growing up too), a lot of people just won't be very good at the skills you're teaching, and for many, your class will be a bullshit elective or a prereq they have to get through to learn the stuff they actually want to learn. And that's fine, we've all been where these students are, and just because you don't have share a pure and all-consuming fire for your discipline doesn't mean that you can't enjoy these students as people, learn something from the interaction, or at least set them free with the gentleman's C. Making the best of whatever situation you're in a super satisfying feeling.\n\nI think, along with understanding that not all students are able to perform at the high level you're expecting, it's good to understand that few want to. Few people seriously aim to graduate college with a 3.7 and get a PhD; not all of your students will subscribe to your value system, and that's okay. Yours is not the only one out there. You're not failing these students by giving them an opportunity that they choose not to take advantage of.",

This story about how students *decline* learning opportunities seems to flow directly out of the view of the passionate and accomplished undergrad which *sees* opportunities, understands them as such, and, importantly, understands them as being navigable, live options.\n\nSometimes when I encounter these teachers and I look at their teaching materials I'm confused about what they think they're students are declining to do beyond declining to solve the desperate riddle of what this teacher is offering them or expects from them.  In such a case it's no wonder that students accept the teacher for what they seem to be - an opportunity to get a passing grade.",

              "text": "Thanks for the compliment and the insight. At the same time, if I wanted to make a general comment about teaching, I'd write a blog post. This is a comment in response to this specific OP. OP already mentions all over the place that they feel like their students' underachievement is their fault, so I doubt they're the kind of person who waltzes in, lectures for an hour, and declares that anyone who didn't get it is a rotten egg. In this particular case, OP strikes me as anxious and self-critical, and whilst your comment about teaching materials and course structure is important, I think for them in particular it's also important to hear the message that they're also still learning, they're not perfect, they'll never be perfect, and that's okay. For the students' sake as well. Overenthusiastic young profs who become frantic and micromanaging are just as bad as the uncaring ones. OP needs a plan and a calm head.",

      "text": "First, just try hard to remember that students are human beings, with lives and back stories that affect their motivation and performance in class. Many of them are fighting battles in their lives that we'll never know about. The worst of the curmudgeons gave up on understanding this point years ago. Don't be like them. This doesn't mean cut students excessive slack or dumb down your course; just, here in the home stretch of the semester, remember there's more than meets the eye and it's quite likely your students want to do better than they did, too.  \n\nDehumanizing students just to make it easier to absolve oneself of blame, is the worst mistake a professor can make, and after this becomes habit there's really no going back. So don't start down that road. \n\nSecond, the thing about higher ed is that you get to reboot your teaching every 14 weeks. Gather as much intel about your teaching as you can for right now and try to understand what you might do differently next time to increase student motivation and get better results. Part of this is on the students, but part of it is on you, and that's OK; just do what you can now, to make next semester better. Enlist the help of your college's teaching and learning center; ask a trusted colleague; ask here on the subreddit; even ask your students what changes you could make to improve what's going on in the course. This way you can bring this semester in for a safe landing and start making plans for next time. \n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for the gold, stranger. What do I do with it? ",

Dedicated, motivated people who loved their new profession. So you'd expect these teachers to do brilliant in this course right?\n\nWrong! Within two weeks we were guilty of all the usual 'student issues'. Glassy stares, digging our heels in because 'what use is this activity supposed to be?'. One of the memorable moments for me was when we were asked if we had done our reading. An uncomfortable silence fell until one man, in his fourties, replied \"I got really mad at my students yesterday for not doing their reading but...no I haven't\"\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Mostly to show you this isn't a student thing.  It's a human thing.  Nearly all of us are prone to procrastinating given the chance. Self discipline is probably the single hardest thing any student learns at uni. Add to that that they are often young, their brains several years away from being fully grown and told that uni is also supposed to be the time of their life, and hopefully some understanding can start to form.  And of course that's not even looking at any potential personal circumstances.  \n\nHope this helps a bit. ",

I say this because I've felt my cynicism growing in recent years (I have about 9-10 years of teaching experience, if I count my time as a TA). There is a part of me that sincerely believes teachers should step away from teaching after a certain period (and maybe return later). I'm half-joking, but I think there's a bell curve of cynicism for many of us: the years when it peaks\u2014when we have time invested in the profession but aren't yet old enough to let things roll of our backs--are the worst. \n\nSomething that might be more helpful (which I've done in recent years, after encountering similar issues): lots and LOTS of scaffolding and intermediate assignments. I used to assign paper due dates, sometimes with rough draft deadlines. Now I assign deadlines for individual paper *components*\u2014e.g., intro, review of the literature, central argument, bibliography, etc. This doesn't guarantee good work (if only!), but it at least spaces out the writing (even if it just means the students have spread out last-minute work across several assignments). \n\nThis semester I tried breaking things down even further (at the suggestion of a colleague): instead of an annotated bibliography, students first had to submit *one* bibliographic annotation. We then went over these in class to look at the formatting and quality of the summaries. Again, still no guarantee of good work, but it has pulled things up slightly across the board. ",

Yes, *some* professors are astonishingly bad at commanding student attention, but honestly that's rare. I've sat in on courses where the professors are amazing\u2014top notch lectures, fun activities, engaging questions\u2014and still students can be bored. If you're bringing enthusiasm to the course, odds are the fault is not with you. \n\nHave you thought about doing mid-semester evals? I do this every semester now: a short, anonymous survey that asks things like \"What are the best things about the course\" and \"What are some not-so-great things\" and \"What would you like to see/do for the second half of the semester.\" Sometimes I find that my perception of student engagement is different from their perception (i.e., a class seems bored but many of them are actually really engaged, just in their own way). \n\nWhat kind of institution are you at? That can make a difference. I've seen student motivation tank in some classes at the SLAC where I work in recent years. ",

By \"policy\"- I don't mean anything official, but that I have cultivated certain reactions that I have with students that protect them from my moments of cynicism. For example, when someone tells me they missed an exam because of a death in the family or some other hardships- I just believe them (or act as if I do, even if I am skeptical) When a student fails a class because they missed some easy assignments, skipped a ton of class or something like that- I assume they are going through something difficult in their life (not that they just don't care). The fact is- life is hard, especially when you are 18-23 years old. Often students are overwhelmed by the things happening in their own lives, dealing with depression or other mental health issues. Many are still learning basic life skills like time management, balancing their financial expenses, friendship and boyfriend/girlfriend dynamics. You can only do so much, and your students are where they are. \n\nIf you have specific issues with written work students are doing- then change the nature of the assignment. Require additional drafts, or build writing into your class time or something like that. Of course they will do the bare minimum of what you require- because they are juggling a bunch of other things and making their own cost benefit analyses in terms of their time and energy. But you have the ability to adjust according to what you can reasonably expect from people- which differs school to school- just depends on the local population. It might be too late this semester, but perhaps when planning for the next time you teach this class you could experiment and structure things differently (including your own attitude) and see if you get a different outcome.",

You spent time going over what to do and what not to do, covered the content and it was reinforced by text. Assignment instructions are detailed.  Grading is fair.   \n\nSo now, you hold to those.  If a paper comes in two pages less than the minimum requirement, you look at your rubric and grade it accordingly, no slack for nobody for no reason, no excuses (except if there is an official accommodation or sickness-- you know what I mean here).  Then you grade the others that meet the minimum with the same rubric. If your best students crash and burn, so be it.\n\nLearning is a shared responsibility maybe something like you 20% the students 80% and it appears from what you wrote that you did your part. They are clearly not upholding their part.  Learning to be a good student goes farther than the course it's a life lesson.  You can reinforce that by your fairness and consistency, i.e. doing what you're doing, using the rubric to grade fairly.  \n\nWhat you also can do, which I think is part of our responsibilities as a facilitator of learning, is to make a note on the crappy assignments about exactly they did or didn't fulfill and how they can fix it next time. (You'd think they would know this, and they probably do, but it gets drilled in when they see the awful grade and your support for them overcoming it in the next assignment.)\n\nAs a final note, we're always learning and improving and changing things up. That's great.  So far I like what I hear from you about offering a lot of assists to students.  The crapped out, it seems not because you taught badly or failed to do something, but because they did what students often do, which they need get a handle on.",

The truth is, unless they're really engaged in the class and the lectures, they will probably blow off 90% or more of the preparatory work. Especially if that preparatory work is ungraded, and I'll tell you why. Because when you have six classes, and to complete the readings for the week requires about 4 or 5 hours of work per class, the prep work by itself can seem like a literal mountain of work. And when they're done with that prep work, they will then still have the usual mountain of homework (which can sometimes seem like busywork) to do afterwards. This isn't to say that the sum of all the parts is not important, but sometimes I'd choose to study to take the tests rather than study to understand especially if I didn't particularly like the class. Studying to take the tests was much more focused, felt like I was actually learning things, and rewarded pretty directly with an improved grade.\n\nIf you want students to be more engaged in this process, you need to ensure that the prep work has an obvious benefit towards their grade beyond a mountain of \"learn this material\". Actually grade and give feedback on assignments. Give smaller quizzes. Rewards for asking questions or being engaged in class.\n\nAnother extremely useful way to do this is to offer the potential for rewrites. Allow them to submit their assignment, and then grade and offer feedback, and allow them to resubmit to say earn, 50% of their lost points back (make them highlight changes so the process doesn't take forever). Then it gives students a very clear a/b of what an excellent paper looks like versus their cruddily rushed paper/assignment.\n\nHope that helps you in some way.",
