  "text": "Hello to everyone,\nI would like to have a broad opinion about a situation that happened. \nApologies for my grammar, English is not my first language.\n\nI had trouble with an experiment and my supervisor suggested to collaborate with this very experienced postdoc who belongs to another research group. While I was chit-chatting with my colleagues ( who have been working in collaboration with this postdoc) they suggested me to be careful because this person has a bad reputation. I \" investigated\" more and other people told me that they tried to replicate the published experiments of this postdoc, but it was impossible. So the majority of people just quit the experiments instead of complaining because this postdoc has been working the uni for more than 10yrs.\nIn the same week another postdoc with the reputation to be lazy and a troublemaker ( e.g. a lot of experiments fucked up, no one wants to work with him/her because unreliable ) received another 3 yrs contract extension with a very good salary.\nI am wondering how supervisors could trust these people for theirs research works and especially I feel I lost faith in my uni which is one of the best in EU. I never had a strong \" research vocation\" I treat my job in the way I don't fuck my social and private life, but this does not mean I don't pay attention to my working reputation.",

      "text": "Perhaps the supervisors know something that your student colleagues don't know. And the 2 post-docs that you've heard about are perfectly competent and capable.\n\nOne of the things I always told my students is to not take academic advice from other students but rather talk with their professors. I'd suggest that you either, 1. do what your supervisor suggested and talk with the post-doc about collaborating or 2. tell your supervisor that you have concerns about the post-doc because of what other students told you about him/her. If you do the second and your supervisor hasn't heard about the student concerns about the post-doc, perhaps s/he will talk with that post-doc's supervisor and see if something negative is going on from that supervisor's perspective.",

Once happened that the postdoc 2 (the lazy one) and I made an experiment in parallel with the same brand kits but on different samples. My experiment worked technically well, hers/ his experiment did not and the reason was that s/he skipped a step in the protocol. When our supervisor asked why about this difference in the experiment s/he blamed the kit, while I firmly said that the kit worked well for me. My supervisor didn't say anything to her/him but the day after I was asked to do her/his experiment with the same kit and magically it went well. I received a \" good girl\" hand on my shoulder and the fact that I made the postdoc experiment did not annoy her/him because this is a classic behaviour already happened with others for getting rid of the \" wet work\".",

If you are nervous about potentially data being fabricated from the postdoc whose results can\u2019t be replicated, if it\u2019s possible go over there and have them teach you the protocol. Then you can do it and you know that nothing has been compromised because you did it with your own hands.\n\nSome people just don\u2019t have the \u201chands\u201d to do wet lab experiments. You seem to be able to get things to work , as evidenced by the experiment using a kit. It could be that this other postdoc in another group has different equipment, or unwritten tricks that aren\u2019t part of the protocol. \n\nI would go collaborate, have them teach you, and do it yourself. Stop the office gossip, it will get you nowhere",

      "text": "1. If you are funded then you work under the direction of your supervisor.  You may be entitled to pursue projects / research independently, but if your supervisor 'suggests' that you to do something, my advice would be to consider it less of a \"suggestion\" and more your boss telling you to work with this individual.  Maybe it's because your supervisor knows more than you do or maybe it's purely political; it doesn't matter here.   Follow your supervisor's \"suggestion\" or risk being branded with your own poor reputation as \"difficult\" or \"not a team player.\"   \n2. As for the integrity of the work -- you can't control your fellow postdocs, but you can take responsibility for your research.  That may may mean carrying a lazy co-author or ensuring that experiments meet your standards prior to publishing.  Whatever it means in your specific case, these are all considerations that go into interactions between colleagues in any collaborative setting and best that you get used to them now.  Unless you are extremely gifted and even more lucky, academia is a team sport -- play alone at your risk.\n3. Last but not least -- as others have noted -- although reputation is important it is often uncorrelated with the caliber of a person's work.  My advice here would be to follow JK Rowling's sage advice and do what Harry Potter would do (DWHPWD) -- eschew Malfoy's offer and figure out \"who the wrong sort are\" for yourself.",

First question maybe: is academics the way? if not enthusiastic about, maybe industry is also to consider; also, there, one can have time for oneself's life :-) \n\nBut more: maybe it's a little bit about boundaries. There is the OP, doing some work. There are others, who are maybe not that motivated, or they are, or they get promoted, or not .. in any case: that is \\_not\\_ OP's business :-) .. that is theirs.\n\nThey decided to work for this university, they seem to get along there quite well .. and that's their life, their business.\n\nThe OP seeing this, it's an interesting insight how other people manage their life - but it's theirs. it shall \\_NOT\\_ impact the own life.\n\nMaybe the question is: is academics the way to go? Does the OP enjoy the work by itself? .. and it does not matter much how other people manage to stay there .. it's \\_theirs\\_. But if the answer for the OP, only is, maybe: 'not so' .. maybe it's a very good point in life to think what sorts of work, and what sorts of working environment might be super-motivational - and to think how to get there.\n\n(as a side note: i have some friends, who are doing like you. they have their job, the job does not interfere too much with their life, it's kind of secure and fine. but it's not super motivational, it's a little .. 'flat'. - if right now there's something that put a red light on ('makes you sad', like you say) - that's maybe a hint that things could be changed. for the OP - not for the others, they seem to be ok)",

      "text": "This is a classic problem that happens in every work environment, not just academia. Senior staff have a different perspective on things from those on the ground. This isn't to say either side is right or wrong but that these things are often more complicated than first appearance and that both sides often only have a partial view of what's happening. \n\nThat said you can talk to your supervisor about it if you feel comfortable, but very carefully. It's fine to talk about your work and if you have concerns (with some substance, not just gossip) you can raise them. It's fine to say \"postdoc X suggested doing something this way but I wasn't sure, how would you do it?\" Or \"I'm having trouble replicating postdoc X's experiment, they haven't provided the full protocol, how would you like me to proceed?\" It's not ok to say \"I heard postdoc X's experiements can't be replicated\". \n\nLastly, just because you see a problem, it doesn't always mean you need to solve it. Sometimes you just have to play the longer game and wait for the right opportunity to raise concerns or find strategies for working around it.",
