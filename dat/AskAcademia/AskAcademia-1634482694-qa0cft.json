Do the websites not specify what level they are for?\n\nPhD \"summer schools\" are quite common in Europe, presumably also in other places.  They're specialist workshops, either high-level training from experts in the field in a particular subject, or an intensive course on PhD-level academic skills like writing papers.  They're also often a great chance to network and meet future colleagues.",
