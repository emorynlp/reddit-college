  "title:": "Accused of plagiarism after \"friend\" copied my assignment",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I'm freaking out and I'm hoping you might be able to help.\n\nI study a masters in the Netherlands. Since 2020, all teaching has been online. I just completed my second semester. For one of my classes, our instructor made us create a WhatsApp group with two friends in our class to share feedback and support each other. Flash forward to the last week of the course, I share my final assignment in the group for feedback, then I turn it in. Two weeks later, I get an email from my professor saying my assignment is suspected of plagiarism and they've escalated the case to the Board of Examiners (as they're required to do).\n\nIt turns out, one of my \"friends\" basically copied my assignment word by word and turned it in. It came back with a 60% level of similarity. She has told me she's deeply regretful and emailed the BoE owning up to her actions. I also emailed them myself explaining that I'd been the original writer of the paper and how my \"friend\" had come to have a copy of it. However, they want to hold a meeting with us next week.\n\nMy university's policies when it comes to this aren't very clear, but I would be considered to be aiding in plagiarism/collusion/co-perpetrating. The penalties could go from a warning to expulsion. There's no student union I can reach out to for help. I don't have a tutor. I feel utterly helpless and with no options to get advice anywhere on how to approach this meeting.\n\nI was hoping maybe you would be able to advise me on how to proceed, what to expect at the meeting, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I heard back from the Examinations Board. They decided not to have a hearing with me, as my statement and proof showed that I acted honestly and with good intentions. It was a very scary situation but very glad it worked out! No consequences at all for me :) ",

                  "text": "You are only in the clear if your teacher told you it was okay to share your actual written assignments. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but the same happened in my masters. My teacher had us work in small groups for the semester on a couple of group projects, but then our final project was individual. A person in one group shared her paper with her group members, either wanting feedback or intending to help, and at least one of her group members copied parts of it word for word. The writer of the paper and the guy who copied it got in trouble, and so did everyone it was shared with because they didn\u2019t report that it was shared. So many people don\u2019t even think twice about it - they\u2019re just trying to help their classmates learn or get some advice. In my classmates\u2019 cases, I think the punishment was way too harsh for the sharers and the recipients who didn\u2019t plagiarize. Hopefully most other board are more forgiving in that situation.\n\nHowever, if your teacher told you that they were fine with you sharing your work, you shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about. Just make sure you bring copies of the messages and any other evidence you have. \n\nSorry to share a bad outcome when I know you\u2019re trying to decrease your anxiety. A lot of others are telling you there\u2019s nothing to worry about, but I wanted to share my classmates\u2019 experience so you might be prepared. I think it depends on how strict your university is on academic integrity.",

Also, by correcting someone else's work, you are learning about your own writing. \n\nALSO - OP's instructor told them to create a whatsapp group \"FOR FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT\"... So this should be included in your deliberations.",

It's really tempting to try and apologise your way out but that just sends a mixed message. Stick with respectful, concerned and aware of the severity of the situation.

As many others have commented, peer review is one of the foundations of modern academic writing and it's common for professors to have students share and critique drafts. \n\nWhat you should learn from this is the importance of documenting everything and communicating clearly your intentions behind sharing your work. \n\nHonestly, I don't think you're going to have much of a problem with this whole situation. Since your friend has already admitted their use of your work and the professor asked that you use the app to collaborate, your only role is to confirm the veracity of everyone else and document whatever conversation occurred as needed. \n\nDon't stress, just get the documents together and trust the system.

In the future, to avoid this from happening I would suggest to never share any final version of documents to anyone. If you really have to, send a reduced form of it and not the whole thing. In fact, I do not share my completed/graded assignments to my juniors at all. Many offered to \"pay\" me for it but you really don't know what people are going to do about it. Even your own friends can be the ones that do the worst to you. Once its out there, you cannot control what others will do to it so be careful about the things that you share to others.\n\nIn this case, I think you can defend yourself well since you have evidence that you developed the work. In the future, I also think it is good practice to keep a journal/log book about assignments you are working on and detail the things you do/change daily. There are many note taking softwares out there. it does not have to be detailed, a short one will do. Bullet points about the details of the work that changed/new ideas that you want to incorporate in your research/assignment.\n\nAt this point, just prepare your evidence of anything you can think of that proves that this is entirely your work.
