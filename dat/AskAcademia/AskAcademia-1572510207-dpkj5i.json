Most of the information requested by \"shitty\" application processes probably isn't even needed until the later stages of interviews and hiring, and they can just ask for it from the pool of finalists then. I'm sure this varies state to state, country to country, and public to private institutions, but OP is right that most of them are like a kafkaesque maze of forms, requests, and errors.",

(The schools that actually outsource---i.e., that host job searches on interfolio---often have the applications with the best user experience.)\n\nThe real problems are \n\n* HR/IT designs the application process (or decides what the application will look like) without input from departments (whether that HR's fault or the fact that professors can't be bothered I'll leave up in the air).\n\n* The people involved in designing these things come from the business world and have no idea how hiring works in higher education.\n\n* HR, departments, and applicants represent three different sets of needs, and so something well-designed from the perspective of HR (i.e. an application form that minimizes the additional work that they have to do) is likely not going to be well-designed from the perspective of applicants or even departments.",

While some schools might definitely want more information from their applicants (information about teaching experience, for instance), the point is that the *system* for inputting such information is vastly superior to basically all the other systems out there. \n\nEven another school that asks for much more information (Duke, for instance, which wanted a dissertation abstract, research plan, and teaching dossier) could have had essentially the same system as Princeton but with more upload slots. That would have been a better system than they actually had (though Duke's system wasn't bad in the grand scheme of things). *Any* school could have a system as good as Princeton's, regardless of how much information they want to see in the first round of applications. The (main) problem is not that schools ask for too much information (though that is often true too); it's that they ask for the information in ways that are pain in the ass for the applicant.",

If they are doing that, then I 100% agree with you, but I don't think either of us knows that to be the case.\n\nPrinceton's is \"good\" in that it is easy for you to fill out, there is no evidence that it is \"good\" for them to actually use to find their most qualified candidates.  I'm suggesting they're not actually using it to find candidates, and that most of their interviewees are already on someone on the departments radar and they just go in and pull those submissions when the time comes. Hell this is how most departments do it at my state uni and we have a full-on annoying application system.

I've been deeply involved in faculty hiring for well over two decades now and have chaired many search committees. We hate the forms and the BS from HR as much as applicants. We don't want your high school (or even undergraduate) grades, or really any of that other material either. At my school faculty are even split on mandatory background checks for finalists, fearing that HR or administrators might kill an application due to some misdemeanor charge for civil disobedience or possession or something that has no bearing at all on their ability to do the job. But every year HR directors go to expensive national conferences where the companies who make the systems that support this sort of information dredging are paying for meals, giving them swag, and marketing their products through \"seminars\" that are really sales pitches. Then they come back and force said systems/requirements on their institutions under the banner of risk management, with zero thought as to how well they work, how they might violate the norms of academic hiring (some of which, granted, are bad and should be violated), or how much additional work they will create for hiring committees.\n\nFor example: my school used to simply accept paper applications, which were scanned and uploaded for committee members to read/download as .PDFs. Once we paid for a $$$ hiring system HR stopped taking physical applications...now everything goes into The Monster and if I want to read 75 cover letters from a pool I have to download each one individually. There is no way to batch download even complete files (which are now full of crap like high school grades and undergraduate transcripts I don't want anyway).\n\nMy HR colleagues are good people, but a significant portion of the industry exists only to provide legal protection for employers, not to advance our institutional missions and certainly not to help use do our jobs. I do not trust the HR industry a bit, nor the lawyers who advise them or the corporations who see them as a profit center.",

The implication is that the system won't take it unless you fill out everything, or it won't make it past the first HR person. Whether any of that is true or not, I don't know, but as an applicant, I can't take that chance.",

HR has to approve each application as \"complete\" before we can review any of them.\n\nAlso, even if things can slip past HR, it doesn't always look good to the search committee. We're not going to delete an excellent candidate because you failed to fill in a box, but for a marginal candidate it could make a difference. And it's not about filling in boxes, but if they ARE filled in, we can quickly see that info, which is helpful when first eyeballing applications and also later when you're going back and trying to find \"that one\" candidate, who you can't remember their name, but you do remember what university they went to. It's nice not to have to open dozens of attachments to find that one person.\n\nThe online systems suck for everyone involved, both candidates and reviewers.",

I don't remember this happening the last 2 rounds of applications I have sent in.  I have emailed the help desk/service center for 3 different universities this round alone because something was broken or wrong with their online forms, typically Oracle or Peoplesoft.  \n\nI dislike applications that ask for your reference letters upfront. I just feel bad asking for them when I know that my letter writers are super busy, and I haven't even made the first cut of applications yet.  I get why hiring committees do it, but I can't help but feel like it's a bit inconsiderate of everyone else's time.",
