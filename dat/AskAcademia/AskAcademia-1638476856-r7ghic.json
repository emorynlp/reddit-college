  "text": "Some years ago I did a postdoc at a dream institution of mine for a field of physical science, from which I had been rejected for bachelor's and PhD admissions. When I started my PhD at my still well ranked but not super fancy name program, I had some interest in academia; by the time of PhD defense I had lost all interest, but I still did the postdoc because I really wanted to go there. When I got the postdoc offer, I took it without hesitation, because 1) I had always wanted to go there, 2) I thought the institution name on my resume would be useful in the future (no idea if it helped my career but it has at least boosted my self esteem), and 3) I did like the topic greatly. After a year and a few months having fun, I got a job in industry at a company I like, making better money.\n\nAnyone do something similar?",

      "text": "I'm (hopefully) doing something similar now! Was rejected from my top choice school (and, well, to almost everywhere I applied) for both college and grad school, but doing a postdoc there now and having a lot of fun (also accepted the offer without hesitation -- it was the only place I'd applied, and where my wife had already matched to for a residency). Also not as interested in academia moving forward (for two-body reasons, mostly), and hoping that the name-brand-edness of my postdoc uni helps when searching for industry positions (I pivoted fields to this one from my PhD work in part bc I thought it a lot more employable and impactful, and my current school's been ranked #1 in it for ages). Glad to hear the trajectory's worked out well for you!",
