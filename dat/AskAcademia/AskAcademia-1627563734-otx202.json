  "text": "Hello Academia,\n\nI am a graduate aspiring to pursue a PhD because research is something that I thoroughly enjoy. To be more specific, reading research papers and learning new things is what highly interests me. \n\nHowever I have this feeling in the back of my mind that all this perceived interest stems from my fear of managing people( instructing people, confrontations etc.). I am tagging along the popular advice to focus on one's strengths rather than working on developing every aspect.\n\nSo as a professor how much of the time goes into actually reading stuff and designing experiments/studies. I can imagine as one grows, profs. would have to take more and more of a project allocator, monitoring and guidance role.",

It is a far far less passive activity.\n\nOnce you're out of PhD and postdocs then managing people, teaching and training people, and working on committees (often with confrontations and disagreements) is almost all of the job.",
