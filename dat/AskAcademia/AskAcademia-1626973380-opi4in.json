  "text": "Hello all! I am updating my CV and am unsure how/ where to put a book/website translation project I completed in 2020.\n\nI translated a programming book/ website from Processing to C# so it could be used with Unity. This included re-writing all of the code and then revising large sections of the actual text. The original text, site, and code were all open source. So is my work. The site/book is now used by a few courses in my department.\n\nThe original work is very popular and I do not want to appear presumptuous by putting it under the \"Book\" section of my CV.\n\nAny thoughts and guidance on how and where I should put this would be appreciated!  \n\n\nedit: typo",

      "text": "Why not simply add a \"Translation\" or \"Adaptation\" section to your CV and put it there? Something like \"Translation (from Processing to C#) of *Book/Website Title*...\" would allow you claim credit for a substantial project without anyone thinking you were trying to pull a fast one by implying you had written the book itself.\n\n(If you translate other books or websites in the future, you can add an \"s\" on the end of the section title so that it reads \"Translations\" or \"Adaptations\" instead.)",
