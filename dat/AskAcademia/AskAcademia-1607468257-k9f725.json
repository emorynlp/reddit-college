  "title:": "Why do professors feel the need to tell students they aren't cut out for certain careers or them to pursue something else?",
  "text": "I know it's not all professors, but why do some professors feel the need to destroy students passions by telling them to drop the majors/minors? From personal experience I've had professors tell me to not pursue STEM careers because I wasn't cut out for it. I was so distraught and hate myself for listening to them. I'm studying environmental policy now and am doing a minor in IR and I've spent the majority of my free electives taking the courses to complete it, the issue is that I've been struggling a bit trying to grasp the understanding of IR theory and I ask for help from the professor quite a bit, recently he asked why I was taking the course and I told him that I was pursuing a minor in it, he looked surprised and then told me it would be best if I dropped the minor, since I didn't seem \"cut out\" for it. I really admire the work this professor does in the field, hearing that just broke my heart that I cried after ending the zoom call with him.",

      "text": "Professors have this weird role (and, yes, I think weird is the right adjective) with regards to undergraduates and career and academic advice. On one hand, professors should be nurturing and always encouraging (almost like a good parent or academic advisor). On the other hand, professors should also be able to treat their students as adults and be able to be honest about potential career and academic prospects. The latter is especially relevant because professors are *very* cognizant how difficult the job market is, especially the academic and non-profit job markets.\n\nI guess my question for you is: why do you want to pursue this particular minor? If you're doing it for your own self-edification, that's great! There should be no downside to it at all. Chalk it off as a flippant remark. \n\nBut if you're trying to make a career out of your major/minor combination, then do realize that this professor is trying to warn you about the difficult road ahead. Unless your professor is a **real** curmudgeon, I am sure they did not mean ill will towards you and was trying to be helpful. \n\nThat being said, I find most successful people I know have a habit of ignoring what other people evaluate their aptitudes and abilities to be but this is, of course, a self-selecting group.",

Every modern PhD graduate has been told at some point to not pursue a PhD because of awful job prospects, but pushed through and did it. While I am lucky to know many successful people who landed jobs they want, I also know people in their third or fourth post-doc with no professorship on the horizon.\n\nSimilarly, my husband's degrees are in the arts and he often jokes that part of earning the BFA/MFA combo is ignoring literally everyone telling you to not do it. He knows many people in jobs they love still in the arts, but knows more who have since left the field (himself included) or are barely making ends meet.",

Trying to be as encouraging as possible, but also honest. I hope that if we do it well, it becomes a self-regulating mechanism, as the more you underperform, the tougher the \"compensation part\" becomes, so at some point a person either finds their path to their goals, or adjust their goals.\n\nExplaining what other options are on the table is also a big part of it. Most young adults (and adults in general) don't realize what jobs are even out there, what educational opportunities, how to combine hobbies, volunteering, and paying jobs, to achieve a personally rewarding balance, etc. Not that I know everything, but two heads brainstorming is, hopefully, better than one :)",

      "text": "There's no way to know what an individual professor's motivation is for doing what you've described.\n\nIn general, though, one possibility is that, in the professor's professional judgement, the student is not likely to have a successful career in field X because of some demonstrated inability to master the subject matter.  People with many years of experience in a field know what it takes to be successful in that field.  Some people have it, some people don't have it but can learn it, and some people don't have it and will never learn it.  \n\nSo, professors are faced with a very tough judgement call, perhaps one that you haven't fully appreciated: do I be honest in telling a student that I see success in a certain field as unlikely based on the student's cumulative performance, or do I allow the student to move forward while struggling and run the risk of the student investing another chunk of years before the student realizes on his or her own that this just isn't going to work?\n\nNow, is a professor's judgment always foolproof?  *Of course not*.  In any field you're certain to find many examples of people who were told they wouldn't make it but later thrived in the field.  No professor can predict the future with 100% certainty.  However, for every person who started off very slow and then later blossomed and made it after all, you have a hundred who started off slow, continued slow, and then fizzled out.\n\nSo, it's quite a difficult decision for a professor to make as to whether to bring up this topic with a student.  Because each professor is an individual human being, each professor will have a different threshold for when difficult conversations like this one are necessary and unavoidable.  If you think about it from our point of view, it's a no-win situation: some students end up bitter and angry that a professor didn't have faith in them, and some students end up angry that their professors allowed them to struggle onward for so long before pointing out the obvious. \n\nNow, it goes without saying that some professors are just jerks, because some human beings are just jerks.  But I can assure you that in general almost all professors want nothing but the best for their students.  No professor wakes up in the morning and says \"How fun and glorious it will be today when I tell X that he doesn't seem suitable for a career in this field.\"  More likely, the professor has been agonizing over the necessity of this conversation for a while, and there's just nothing left to do except to have it and be done with it.\n\nIn any event, good luck, and I hope your current path works out for you.",

Now, is a professor's judgment always foolproof? Of course not. \n\nIf the judgement is not foolproof and it can't be by design (the prof doesn't know the student inside out), why then should they say anything at all about the student not being cut out for the field. Sure, they'll think that they're doing the student a favour, but I do not think that it's their place to do such a \"favour\". Criticism should always be in the form of - \"Hey I think currently you're not doing such and such, so you need to do X and Y to make sure you have a chance to be successful in this field\". That's it. This is the best thing a prof can do for a student. It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions. The profs shouldn't interfere saying leave field Z based on what they think is best for the student.\n\n>If you think about it from our point of view, it's a no-win situation: some students end up bitter and angry that a professor didn't have faith in them, and some students end up angry that their professors allowed them to struggle onward for so long before pointing out the obvious. \n\nThe student can blame the prof saying - I wish you'd have told me earlier. But they'd be wrong, since the profs would absolve themselves of any blame once they tried everything they could do support the student. On the other hand, if the prof steps in with claims of the student being sub-par/not cut out, they're negatively impacting the students chances of success. They would be to blame in that scenario if a student says that they could have been successful if the prof hadn't stepped in and said they're not good enough. The prof can be correctly blamed in that situation. \n\nIMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. The profs don't get to decide that and it will vary from prof to prof anyway, so why dish out a judgement when it's subjective in the first place? Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life. It is very condescending to think that the prof knows better about what the student should or should not do with their life. It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.",

If a student you've worked with daily for a year, or more, shows a consistent lack of effort or abilities that would make them a competitive participant in the field... Then it's the academic obligation of the professor to say something. Academia is also formative, you know? It's not there only for people who have a passion to have a place to go learn things related to it. It's not a hobby club. It's supposed to train professionals. \n\nIn any field in this world, as a beginner you'll be supervised, and told if your performance falls short.

The government loans have some maximum amount (there are no private loans here) and there's a maximum amount of time you can study before you are unenrolled from your degree (i.e. kicked out). Students who fail repeatedly are cutting into limited time and money. By allowing a student to pursue a path that they will fail at, you're dooming them to high debt and no possibility of a degree. They will literally be worse off than if they had never attended university to begin with.\n\nWe can't force students to stop taking a course or to change majors. It's their choice. They're free to ignore our suggestions, but they should at least know what we think. If they think our information is bollocks then they can ignore us.

That's kindergarten. Or a diploma factory, and sadly there are many of those, too. One would certainly not run into any professors saying it like it is there.",

It also depends on how passionate a student is about their subject. If it's someone half arsing it, and they don't mind having to pursue something else in life, fair enough.

The lack of perfect accuracy or perfect knowledge of a situation does not in any way imply that a judgment cannot or should not be made. In general, an expert's opinion (the professor's) is clearly to be trusted far more than a novice's (the student's).  That's the whole point of experience.  As I clearly wrote in my original comment, experience doesn't mean the judgment is always right, but if you had to guess as to whose opinion was more likely to be correct, the professor's or the student's, it's clear whose opinion you should accept every time.\n\n>It's up to the student to decide whether they are fit for a field, regardless of how many years it would take. It's their life, and they would be solely responsible for their decisions\n\nOf course it is.  So what?  The fact that the ultimate decision lies with the student doesn't in any way preclude the giving of informed opinions.  The student is free to accept or reject those opinions as the student sees fit.  The ultimate responsibility for the decision *and its consequences* lies with the student.\n\n>IMO it isn't acceptable for a prof to give out judgements like this to students, even if they're thinking that they're going to do the students a favour, or doing it for the benefit of the student. \n\nOf course you're entitled to whatever opinion you want.  But experienced faculty have a different opinion based on our interactions with many thousands of students over a career.\n\n>Things like this can have very severe impacts on the mental health of students and the prof doesn't know what the student's background is or what the student might be struggling with in their personal life.\n\nAcademic and professional standards don't vary based on a student's private affairs.  Faculty are not social workers, financial advisors, spiritual advisors, psychological counselors, or surrogate parents.  Our responsibility is to teach content X and then evaluate whether a student has learned it.  If learning is more difficult for a student because of difficulties in the student's private life, that's completely understandable.  The correct thing to do is for the student to put off further studies until the student's private affairs are in order, not to charge ahead while underperforming and then act astonished when told that this level of performance won't cut it in the field.\n\n>It's the student's own life and career, they get to decide what they should or shouldn't do.\n\nOnce again, of course it is.  But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the ability (and in the case of faculty, obligation) to give a student honest counsel.",

Doesn't that sound like a parent saying children should agree with them everytime because they have more experience. I vehemently disagree, the parent, like the prof, has had very different life experiences and all of those experiences have made them come to a conclusion/judgement. It's obviously a different matter when the experience and conclusion is objective. For example, a scientist should be trusted because their claims are verifiable and objective. It isn't objective in our case, so that argument doesn't hold weight. \n\n>Of course it is. So what? The fact that the ultimate decision lies with the student doesn't in any way preclude the giving of informed opinions. The student is free to accept or reject those opinions as the student sees fit.

Faculty are not social workers, financial advisors, spiritual advisors, psychological counselors, or surrogate parents. Our responsibility is to teach content X and then evaluate whether a student has learned it.\n\nIf the responsibility is to teach and then evaluate whether a student has learned the content, why not stick to that instead of doing something for what you think is beneficial to the student based on your own subjective experiences which obviously are shaped by living through a different time? \n\nThis statement seems to be at odds with your general stance. If faculty are not surrogate parents etc, why then should they interfere and give out any judgement about the student's ability to make it in a field to save them time? \n\nAlso, do tell me how in the middle of a pandemic, academic standards should not be lowered? \nFair enough that it's the student's private affairs but if they are not in control of a parent or sibling dying or they have to take care of a disabled parent and what not. They're not always suffering because of their own actions. If we're not cutting them some slack it's just setting them up for failure. The privileged will always keep winning, all your talk for 'leveling the playing ground', 'diversity is good' etc. doesn't mean shit if you think academic standards should not be flexible. One can argue that the leveling of the playing ground should happen early on in schools, and I fully support that. In that situation, sure if everyone has had similar opportunities, it would make sense to apply the same rubric for everyone. \n\n>Once again, of course it is. But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the ability (and in the case of faculty, obligation) to give a student honest counsel.\n\nAgain, if they're not supposed to be counsellors according to your earlier statement, why give counsel, especially if it only has a 50% chance to be beneficial to the student? Stick to the job.",

Either the student can speak Spanish at the level necessary for a professional translator, or the student can't.

And again, subjective experiences have nothing whatsoever to do with competence.  The laws of physics weren't any different when I was in school 20 years ago than they are now.  Either you can build a bridge that doesn't fall down, or you can't.\n\n>If faculty are not surrogate parents etc, why then should they interfere and give out any judgement about the student's ability to make it in a field to save them time?\n\nYou don't have to be a parent to make judgments about something.  These are my students, and evaluating them and their potential is part of my job.\n\n>Also, do tell me how in the middle of a pandemic, academic standards should not be lowered?\n\nAs you wish: here's me telling you that, in the middle of a pandemic, academic standards should not be lowered.  Can you work all the problems on the calculus exam?  If you can, you pass.  If you can't, you don't pass.  Sure, some allowances can be made for extra help and things like that, but in the end college credit is given for achievement, not for effort, and certainly not out of sympathy.  Can you imagine anyone at the hospital saying \"Nurse, the dose you gave that patient is was twice what it should have been, but it's ok that you didn't learn that because that lesson was given during a pandemic.\"  Standards can't be relaxed.  Students can be given extra support, but extra support does not mean simply waving everybody through out of some false idea of compassion.\n\n>all your talk for 'leveling the playing ground', 'diversity is good' etc. doesn't mean shit if you think academic standards should not be flexible\n\nWhat on earth are you babbling about here?  Nobody in this thread has mentioned anything about diversity except you.  But academic standards absolutely cannot be flexible based on the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank or how many children you take care of.  A person's private affairs don't affect what they must achieve at university to be given the same degree that everybody else gets.\n\nAnd one final point: In ten years, I have only ever advised a student to pursue a different path/major a single time.  The student had spent the last 6 years pursuing a 4-year chemistry degree (full time, I should add), and in those 6 years had only managed to pass the first two years' worth of introductory courses.  And even after those classes it was clear that some of the passing grades had been very generous, as the student simply didn't have even rudimentary knowledge of the field at that point.  It was an absolute mercy to encourage the student to find a different path.  I can't speak for anyone except my own colleagues, but most of them have similar stories.  So, I absolutely do not think there is some plague of professors running around having a contest to see who can crush the most student dreams or anything like that.  But, from time to time, it has to be done.\n\nEDIT: If you care to respond to any of my latest comments, I'll be happy to read them, but I won't respond again.  Our general positions are fairly clear by now, so I don't think there's anything more to be gained by additional back-and-forth.\n\nPS - it's not me who's downvoting your comments.

Students can be given extra support, but extra support does not mean simply waving everybody through out of some false idea of compassion.\n\nOf course there's a limit to how much academic standards can be lowered. You need a basic level of competence, of course. Like say there are 10 students in a program, all but 2 can understand everything perfectly and apply it well etc, but the 2 remaining can't do the same because of some matters which affected them. Why not give them 2 attempts at an exam instead of one? Or giving them an option to take the exam 15 days later. These are academic standards right? And I think this should be allowed. I'm not arguing for compromising on the basic level of competence required. I'm not saying to pass them for a differential equations course when they can't solve these equations, or pass them for a general relativity course when they can't solve Einstein's equations for a given metric or show they've understood the basic concepts. \n\n>Students can be given extra support, but extra support does not mean simply waving everybody through out of some false idea of compassion.\n\nYeah agreed. That's what I'm arguing for. \n\n>But academic standards absolutely cannot be flexible based on the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank or how many children you take care of.\n\nI think we have different things in mind on what academic standards means, and we'd probably agree if we looked at students on a case by case basis. \n\n>And one final point: In ten years, I have only ever advised a student to pursue a different path/major a single time. The student had spent the last 6 years pursuing a 4-year chemistry degree (full time, I should add), and in those 6 years had only managed to pass the first two years' worth of introductory courses. And even after those classes it was clear that some of the passing grades had been very generous, as the student simply didn't have even rudimentary knowledge of the field at that point. It was an absolute mercy to encourage the student to find a different path.\n\nYes that is the right decision for that case because you waited for long enough, and in your experience maybe profs have been more like you, but it varies for other people. There are indeed profs out there who give out judgements prematurely, like say after a student has worked for 6 months on a research project where they aren't that familiar with the field, and cutting no slack in what conditions the student is working in (pandemic, familial issues related to pandemic, not being able to talk to others about research and blend in with a research group online, US hospital handing out huge bills for an ER treatment that might not be covered by insurance, divorce of parents, roommate issues which leads to shifting to a new house, not enough income). They also don't care about their own shortcomings as an advisor to not be able to guide the student well enough. This did in fact happen in real life. \n\n\nAnyway, I think what's probably happening here is that I'm projecting your comments to an extreme and you're doing the same, whereas we'd lie closer in handing out judgements when looking at specific cases. \n\n>PS - it's not me who's downvoting your comments. I don't downvote posts merely because I disagree with them.\n\nI don't really care if I get downvoted lol, and do feel free to downvote my comments.

      "text": "\"You're not cut out for it\" is a bit harsh, but I have had some talks with students about their expectations for the future. Three occasions come to mind. 1) Student didn't turn in any lab reports or final paper because they said they hate writing and since they are in STEM, it is a waste of their time. I didn't tell them they weren't cut out for it at all, but I did tell them that writing is definitely something they'll have to do in the career they were seeking. 2) I have had a lot of pre-med students, some with GPAs <3.0. No one was having the talk with them how unrealistic it was for them to get into med school. That wasn't doing them any favors. I've been realistic with them about stats needed and looking at other careers or the long path of remediation. 3) I had a masters student who was struggling with grad school, but wanted a PhD. I laid out what is need from a PhD student and how she wasn't there (yet). I told her what I thought she should do to prepare to get there (even though hadn't shown it with opportunities given) but that she also should look at alternatives. \n\nSo yes, 100% there is a role of profs to give sound advice. But then there are the profs that say someone isn't cut out for something when really they prof just isn't able to teach them because of their own teaching shortcomings. I recommend with criticism like this to reflect on if there is truth in what they are saying, and potentially get other opinions as well.",

      "text": "I would give a student more specifics than \"you're not cut out for this.\" I think being that general is just mean and not helpful.    But not saying anything at all is also cruel in a different way. It lets you waste your time and money on something you don't have a reasonable chance of being successful at.\n\nLet me give you an example. I'm in education. Sometimes I have students who want to be teachers but who are actually terrible at getting up in front of a class and speaking. Some will take steps to work on this and improve it, and sometimes they improve... sometimes they don't, no matter how hard they try. And they are NOT going to have a good time getting up in front of a class of kids and trying to teach them. IF they manage to successfully complete student teaching (doubtful, and all the mentor teachers who are gracious enough to host our interns have enough work to do already without having to fix this issue) they are never going to be able to get through a job interview and mock lesson to get a job. An actual class of students would eat them alive. It is more fair to tell them that up front and try to help them find something they will be successful at instead of just let them flounder and waste years of their life and money out of their pockets.\n\nIn undergrad, I had a roommate who was a music performance major. She did fine in music history, theory, etc... but she was *horrible* at her actual instrument. She took extra lessons with different teachers, went to masterclasses, did every single thing possible and she still sounded like a middle school beginner band kid even after 4 years of college. It was simply not possible for her to perform at the necessary level and honestly she never should have been admitted as a performance major in the first place. Her lesson teacher just didn't want to drop a student from her studio because it lowered her numbers. I was so angry on her behalf that after 4 years she didn't have a degree and was unlikely to get one... and she had to change her major *four years later.* How is that not unbelievably cruel? I understand giving her a year to see if she could make progress, but after that, it's time to be up front and honest and steer students in a more productive direction. She went on to have a successful career in a completely different field, which she could have done much sooner had someone told her earlier instead of letting her hang around to pad their studio numbers.",

      "text": "I have a colleague who wants to do this: she thinks we should identify students who \"have no chance of completing the major\" and advise them into some other department by the end of the first year. I'm opposed to that-- and I'm the department chair so I win --because it doesn't accept the idea that students can grow and mature along the way. Moreover, we have a whole sequence of required majors' courses they are required to pass, so in the worst case why not let them fail a few and *then* advise them out? But she thinks it's better to steer them away earlier so they have as much time as possible to complete another major. Part if it is also, I suspect, as desire to minimize the number of students who fail to graduate after four years in our department.\n\nAdvising part of our job. But making decisions *for* our students is not. I think we should be completely honest with them; it's fine to say \"I'm concerned that you won't be able to complete the major requirements\" but not to say \"You can't major in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, go find something else.\" They have to make their own (informed) decisions.",

      "text": "I know it's hard, but I think it will benefit you to think harder about this than to just condemn these professors because their feedback hurt your feelings. The fact that you admired this IR professor is not a reason he shouldn't give you professional advice. That's his job. He may have wanted to help you by not encouraging you to keep pursuing a degree or career in which he, as an expert, believes you can't succeed. When you think back to the work you did for these professors in their classes, can you think of any evidence that what they told you wasn't *true*? If you want to be successful in the areas in which they are advising you, whether their advice was truthful is a lot more important than whether it was kind.\n\nIn my experience, getting better at something where I was struggling to this degree has required a total paradigm shift, not just trying harder and definitely not just rejecting any advice that hurt my feelings. I had to find a new reason to be there, new way to study, new way to manage projects, new way to think. I think that's common. It's concerning to me that you've gotten this type of feedback from multiple people in multiple different fields. It suggests to me that maybe there is something cross-cutting you need help with, like writing or professionalism or being more of an autodidact, that is undermining you in multiple settings. I would strongly suggest talking about this with a mentor you like and trust, and asking them to be candid with you. Whatever they say, don't take it personally-- constructive feedback is a gift. Someone who thought they couldn't help you would be more likely to say nothing.\n\nTake some time and be kind to yourself. It really hurts to receive this kind of feedback, and it's OK to not be ready to process it or act on it immediately.",

He is proud of it but it did take a toll on him (to be told that and to do the phd afterwards).",

In my experience about 10% of students have figured out a reasonable career path when they enter college (unless they want to be doctors, then it drops to 1%, do the algebra).\n\nIf I say to an advisee \"you have not completed any of the required courses for the degree you are seeking\" or \"your GPA is not sufficient for the post college track you are seeking\" they generally don't listen. They keep spending on taking (or retaking) courses to try to meet whatever threshold I identify.

Biology/med school is the obvious example. Let's say you work for Ole Miss in molecular biology. It's orientation day and there are 100 students in the crowd. ~1 will successfully make it to med school. ~3 will get a PhD. ~0 will become a tenured professor. Very few will get jobs in the field because they went to school in Mississippi for molecular biology. Another small handful will go to some other professional school. Exact numbers not withstanding, the vast majority of the students you interact with on any given day will not use their degree in a meaningful way. Only the top few percentile will. Any given student in the audience should be told to switch majors because they're probably not one of the ~10 that will actually use their degree. If someone is a Sophomore and they're getting a C in microbiology right before add/drop, they are almost definitely not one of the 10. This is obviously a bit of an extreme example, but it's not terribly uncommon for STEM to have a greater than 50% failure rate. I don't think giving your honest opinion on a student's chances in those type of fields is really a bad thing.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve discouraged a small handful of students from my STEM field, often because they just seem totally unsuited to it. Many students say they are \u201cpassionate\u201d about something but don\u2019t necessarily have the academic drive or commitment to continue. Are you studying and reading enough? \n\nI  never discourage a student to be petty or mean. This is not always the case among academics. My advice would be to carefully consider your motives and passion for the field and make sure it\u2019s the right thing. Do you have a natural intuition and inclination for the work? And if you don\u2019t, do you make up for it in work ethic, study, and outside reading? He may truly believe you\u2019re not suited to it. He could be wrong or he could be right. Only more time will tell.\n\nPS loving something doesn\u2019t make you good at it. This is often why we tell students not to pursue a field. Some people are truly truly not suited to certain areas.",

      "text": "I wish I could answer this for you - I\u2019ve had similar experiences. I\u2019ve seen professors straight up say to a room of grad students (I was one, at the time) \u201c90% of you will never get a job in the field, or even be published\u201d. It was disappointing, rude, and it had a strongly psychopathic energy. \n\nLet\u2019s unpack. There\u2019s two things - the professors conduct in saying \u201cyou\u2019re not cut out\u201d, and then there\u2019s the career advice they were trying to give. \n\nThe professors conduct is unacceptable. I\u2019ve left academia (as a career) behind and have a fun, satisfying and interesting job in the private sector. One huge thing about working in industry is that you quickly realise that lots of common behaviour in universities is completely unacceptable on every level outside universities. If I told a colleague or a direct report that they weren\u2019t cut out for their job, they would be well entitled to report me for workplace bullying. You just don\u2019t treat other people that way - it\u2019s fundamentally disrespectful. If someone needs training or help to develop, that should be given, not a dismissive remark. Moreover, mentoring is just a part of your relationship with your colleagues, whereas mentoring is the entire relationship between professor and student. Arguably, on both a professional conduct and moral level, casually throwing out \u201cyou\u2019re just no good\u201d is cruel and would not be tolerated elsewhere. I\u2019ve seen some comments here defending this behaviour, and to them I can only say they their cruelty adds nothing to the advice they\u2019re trying - and failing, because of that same cruelty - to provide. Also, good luck trying that outside of the academy. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the career advice. Lots depends on where you want to go after your studies. I initially thought I might go into academia, but I had rent to pay and had to work while I studied. Eventually, after many hours of customer service toil, I landed a job with a not for profit and now work for a government enterprise in an investigations role. The skills I learnt in university are invaluable - and now I\u2019m finishing my studies part time to wrap up that chapter of my life, and then pursue a career more fully. What would you like to do from here? If you do want to become an academic, then seek a second opinion about how to do that effectively. Strategise. Don\u2019t be dissuaded by rudeness but do think the problem as if it wasn\u2019t your own, and as if you were giving advice to a friend. If you don\u2019t want to become an academic, then your professors opinion is irrelevant. Get the skills and experience you need, then build your own rocketship and make a bright future for yourself.",

You have done well in the subject before.\n\nWhen anyone says anything discouraging like what your professor said, really all it means is \"the effort required to dig yourself out of this hole is going to be enormous, more than most students could ever muster, so you should have a well-thought-out plan B\".\n\nIf you really care about getting this done and you can muster that insane commitment to do better, you could make it work. And you should ask your professor for advice on how to do that given all that you've already tried. There may be a resource you're missing or you could be taking the wrong approach. They might be able to suggest a tutor.\n\nAnd you should take their advice about a plan B seriously too. What will you do if you can't do the IR minor? Is there any other way you can be certified for that knowledge? Would it be better for you to self-study in your own time through a system like Coursera before trying again? Are you lacking any e.g. mathematical skills that'd benefit from an extra calculus class (I know a business student who did exactly this and aced the business class he'd previously failed)?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s a personal story to give you a point of view: when I was an undergrad studying a STEM major (microbiology and immunology), I had a few professors that said I was not cut out for the field. I was an Afro-Latina, first generation college student and US citizen, I also graduated high school at 16, so I was almost 17 when I entered my freshman year of college. A lot of my  initial struggles came from having no guidance when it came to completing a degree in STEM and I was figuring things out for the first time on my own. It took a while to get the hang of it, and while I admit my initial performance probably showed that I was not cut out for the field, I was committed and couldn\u2019t imagine myself doing anything else. Fast-forward 7 years and I am now 23 years old and have a BS in Microbiology, a MS in Biomedical Sciences, and an amazing job in the biotech/pharma industry in San Diego where I was able to get promoted within 2 months of starting. I am also currently applying for PhD programs (wish me luck!). I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is to take any \u201cadvice\u201d you get from these professors with a grain of salt. They don\u2019t know your background and all the things you\u2019ve had to do to get where you are today. They may think they know what it takes to be successful, but those things are going to be different for each individual. If you are truly committed and dedicated to succeeding in a specific field, you can make it happen.",

Do you want to? Or do you just want to teach science and not ask yourself these tough questions? \n\nThe reality is that with this attitude, you are setting yourself up to only be able to effectively teach privileged students, or at least to reach marginalized students in only limited ways, if at all. You don\u2019t have to act as a student\u2019s therapist or parent to consider these things. \n\nWhat do you tell a black student who\u2019s struggling in a hostile environment because they\u2019re dealing with racism?

Doesn\u2019t that bother you? \n\nI understand the desire to want to have some professional boundaries, but if you choose to stick to solely considering performance in the way you educate and evaluate students, you are only *really* getting through to white, straight, cis, male students from affluent families.

For a professor who cares about his teaching duties, I think saying things like these -when appropriate- is a responsibility. A lot of people choose their majors with wrong reasons and it is totally okay to change majors even at a later stage.\n\nSometimes I see senior students who obviously shouldn't have passed the first year classes -or graduate middle school, for that matter- but somehow manage to survive four years of college with absolutely no idea about what the hell they are doing, which shows you how fucked up the education system is. (Most professors are overworked, many don't care enough to fail a lot of people as it means low evaluations etv., which matters especially for the untenured foks.)\n\nLike, I'll have students who supposedly took a number of classes that teach and employ certain mathematical tools that are a prerequisites for my class (these are clearly stated in the enrollment page -so they literally can't take my class if they haven't satisfied those requirements-, the syllabus, first lectures...). Then, every year, there will be some students who expect me to teach them everything starting with high school math. Hell, no; you shouldn't have been here if you don't know these and I said so several times.\n\nSome of those students even asked me if they should apply for PhD programs in my field and their prospects etc. and I very clearly said no. Saying anything else would be a lie; they don't come to me for a therapy, I have to tell them facts. Obviously, they are completely free to ignore me. Some of them should ignore me, I am sure there have been people I misjudged. (Hell, I was the laziest student ever, all my undergraduate education I only did homeworks in a grand total of one class because it was the only class where homeworks were to my taste. Based on my records, I am sure many of my professors didn't think I would get a PhD.) I still feel I need to be honest, what good would it do to say \"you are doing great\" to everyone when they clearly aren't doing great. PhD application is not the same thing as major/minor choice but most students I interact with are seniors so they are more worried about PhD and stuff.",
