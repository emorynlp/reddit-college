  "title:": "I'm a failure with no publications",
  "text": "I am in a bad way. I got my PhD in physics like 6 months ago. I have no first author publications. My main result has been rejected by several journals. They kick it around like a mangy dog. My second paper was to be a small methods paper---nothing too ambitious---but last week I found a 20-year-old paper that seems to work better than my method, and is much simpler. All that work might have been for nought. So here I am. I have produced nothing of value. Fear in a handful of dust.\n\nMy advisor thinks I'm wonderful, and wrote me a beautiful letter. I\u2019m afraid that he feels responsible for my failures, and wrote it out of guilt. My peers like me, and, I think, respect me. I did very well in my classes, and feel comfortable with my subject matter. I have been offered a good postdoc, and a couple of other promising interviews lined up, one in a very prestigious lab.  I\u2019m a great presenter. Now, I know what some of you are thinking: \"This guy came in here to brag about how good he is!\" No. This is a pile of evidence that I\u2019m nothing but surface and sheen, with nothing underneath it. I got a poster prize for the same research that keeps getting rejected. It made me furious and bitter. Of course I did. I\u2019m a greasy car salesman. I can talk. But deep down, I\u2019m just a common turd that\u2019s cheated his way into it all. I know, I know, impostor's syndrome. I know it's a real thing, but it seems like false flattery, convincing myself that I have some kind of syndrome and that I\u2019m not a real-deal faker. I know in my bones that I'm an impostor.\n\nIt\u2019s getting worse. I lie awake recounting all the negative reviews and rejections, all the possible problems with my methods and results, all my personal flaws as a scientist. It seems too much. I want to give up. But how? Leaving academia isn't giving up, it's a whole 'nother set of problems. I resent this society where I have to decide---I don't want to decide! I'm a sweaty rat king of anxiety and self-loathing, and in no place to make a rational decision.\n\nWhy can't there be some divine judge who decides what to do with me? Or some super advanced A.I.? Some bureaucrat or some workers' council? Anything, anyone, no matter how stupid, arbitrary, or venal\u2026 Just decide for me where I\u2019ll best serve society, and I\u2019ll accept: Is it doing physics? Cleaning toilets? Would society be better off putting me down for good and letting me fertilize a field? Can I plead *nolo contendere*?",

Not a lot of scientists have that skill. Be proud.\n\nMy recommendation is just read a lot of journals. You get a sense of what the editors like. I am in the medical sciences field and I know my field so well I know exactly what type of project which journal will like. Which makes publishing much easier.\n\nNow that's advice if you want to publish a lot. If you want to do good science, then that takes a lot of work and thinking. But you should still keep reading.",

                          "text": "Firstly, I found it a bit surprising to hear anyway, but your appraisal of several people as 'useless' isn't the most reliable indicator of their true competence. I have many more questions about you based on that comment, if I'm honest. I wonder whether those people all confided in you that they were useless. \n\nTo the point, PhD students usually have to propose their research and have it cleared as useful in itself, by supervisors and committees. Then, in that institution, completing the PhD project is seen to qualify that person, by that institution's standards, as having a substantial enough level of research experience to attain a doctorate. So, much of the critique occurs early on. \n\nLater, at the thesis and viva stage, who passes will depend on each university. I can imagine some universities not being too picky, but that's to their own detriment, and is essentially the entire reason for having to look at where someone studied for their PhD or any other qualification. But a university not being picky doesn't mean everyone (or even most people) who graduates with a PhD from that university is an impostor. \n\nFor all intents and purposes, in the majority of cases in any even half-reputable institution, passing your PhD means you're probably not an impostor.

Doesn't much of this come down to individual and institutional standards? I think if someone 'randomly walks into successful labs', there's an impetus to question how this lab is so successful, if such seemingly incompetent people can just be carried in. \n\nAnd as you say, these are usually junior career researchers. They may have barely got through their PhD, possibly in a slightly different area, and been offered a postdoc position due to appearing strong during interview, but then it might have turned out they weren't that good or motivated in that area of research (or indeed research in general). People can also have mental health problems and other issues that might affect your judgements of them when you do interact. That doesn't necessarily speak to their overall performance, and certainly I'd be doubtful of calling people useless, or especially 'impostors' based on such interactions. \n\nPerhaps we're differing on our definition of what an impostor is as well. For me, it's someone who is genuinely pretending to be skilled/interested, and is getting through on personality alone, or by falsifying data. Most reputable institutions have ways to exclude such people from ending up in funded/paid positions, though I admit, even then, these aren't foolproof. ",

It's pretty obvious. \n\nIf you've been accepted onto a PhD programme (especially if you received external funding, which is the majority of PhD students), and *especially* if you passed the PhD, you've gone through several levels of outside critique and assessment that determine, *by that university's standards*, that you are/were a 'real' PhD student, and not an impostor.

Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism attribute their success to luck, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be. While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Continue presenting well, continue to work hard and articulate your thoughts on why your experiments did not work out as well as you have wanted.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, it is incredibly completely normal to feel like you've been punched in the gut after your paper has been thrashed by reviewers.

If you want to succeed you absolutely have to get to a point where you are confident in your own work, because it's up to you to champion you. All your talk of divine judges and workers councils is concerning, because it sounds like you want other people to validate you. and tell you what to do. Now, you're fresh out of a PhD, so you ahve plenty of time to sort this stuff out. But chief amongst those priorities has to be to stop talking yourself down. You got a PhD. You were examined and found not wanting. OK, so your first paper is hard work. That's very normal. Take some fresh air, step back, and give yourself some breathing room.\n\nIn a few weeks go back to that 20 year old paper and ask yourself properly whether there is truly nothing that your own work does differently? Can you truly say that the older paper does everything better and more simply, or is that the viewpoint of someone panicking about the validity of their work? If it's that old and that unreferenced that you didn't find it until after the PhD then there's likely to be a reason for that. ",

I struggle with the same beliefs about myself but it\u2019s due to the emotional abuse/manipulation I experienced as a child. Lots of successful kids come from homes where grades were a way to make your parents love you/give you attention. I\u2019m not saying you in particular did (I have no way of knowing), but a lot of the most successful kids I know struggled with this. I always knew I had a bad relationship with my mom that was super complex and weird, but it wasn\u2019t until a therapist called it abuse and focused on me unlearning the abuse I internalized that I started to get better. \n\nI know for me, it was a reason I wanted to go into academia and be the best of the best. I was super successful in school and college, but I sort of realized I wanted the prestige more than the actual job (even though I *was* 100% interested in the topics I studied). I realized that a lot of why I was doing it (basically, to have my mom finally say she was proud of me, and to be recognized as a good/ok person) was a bad reason to spend my 20s working all the time. I\u2019ve moved on to focusing on clinical careers now with better job prospects and work/life balance. \n\nIf you already have a PhD, this probably isn\u2019t you, since you made it though a really tough part of getting to academia! But, it might be important for you to define what *you* define as successful, not others. This is still something I struggle with. It sounds like the people around you already do think you\u2019re successful, and you\u2019ve already gotten into a good post-doc. Just because other people have 10 publications and you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t end up in the same place at the end. You seem like you\u2019re already on a good track. \n\nAlso, remember that academia, at the end of the day, is just a job. It\u2019s a very stressful, consuming, and important job, but it is just a job. If you have interests/relationships outside of work, now is the time to reconnect with them. Other people are likely amazed you have a PhD to begin with; they already probably think you\u2019re the shit! Most people in the world have no idea what an academic really even does. Try to take a step out of the academic world for a weekend if you can, and remember that this job doesn\u2019t determine your worth. It can be refreshing to talk to people who aren\u2019t in your career path. They can help ground you and realign your priorities. ",

You're in the impostor syndrome trap, but you also are talking about strongly linking your success in your work to your personal worth. You discuss anxiety and how you dwell on mistakes and failures. You've got buckets of negative thinking that you're taking at face value when it should probably mostly be rejected. A therapist might be able to help you get these thoughts into the open and teach you how to deal with them rather than internalize and believe them.\n\nI really worry that you are linking your worth to your career so closely. I always remind my friends still in academia that it is not a meritocracy, despite their success. There is luck in research, luck in publishing, luck in getting grants, luck in getting hired. You are rejected far more than you are accepted in academics and the cream does not always rise to the top.\n\nCongratulations on graduating!

Few of us conduct experiments that would earn grant money on their own merit. It takes a salesman mentality to *sell* your research to garner funding. You seem to have a negative outlook on your research, but nobody knows the true merit of your research better than you -  what its potential is and why it's worth funding.\n\nAlthough your research may not have panned out well, you could make a great PI... one that can get the funding to conduct research that you think will work better. An awful lot of research success is tied to how much money can be thrown at a project.\n\n> I know, I know, impostor's syndrome. \n\nEven though we all know about it, we all seem to fail to avoid it.\n\nKeep your chin up, my friend.",

Quite a few (often well-paying) opportunities as commercial agents for tech/med/research companies. There are teaching-focused academic jobs as well. \n\nBut if you want to be a research and teaching academic, then take advantage of your postdoc to publish... unpopular but I think honest opinion: many people ITT saying their lack of pubs has not hindered their being employed as academics. But I think an academic with no pubs will likely struggle in what is a huge chunk of the job: supervise efficiently (hugely important for career advancement). Probably some people end up good supervisors, but this is definitely not the norm as I know quite a few people in this position and all over-emphasize teaching and engagement, undermine research activities. \n\nGood luck!",

You use this comparison as evidence to back up the claim \"I am a failure\". But this courtroom is extremely one sided. There is no argument or evidence presented against this claim.\n\nConsider this: you produced a dissertation. You impressed your supervisor. You did well in your courses. You understand your subject matter well (good presentation skills are important, but you can't present well what you don't understand). \n\nI don't believe in positive platitudes. There is no need to look in the mirror and try to convince yourself that you are amazing, and successful, when you don't feel that way. What you need to do is work towards a more balanced sentiment.\n\nInstead of \"I am a failure\" it seems that, in light of evidence on both sides, the truth is closer to \"I have yet to make as much of a research impact as I would like\". Do you see how much more constructive that is? There is nowhere to go from \"I am a failure\".",

I've been too lazy to finish it in 4 years, for the past year my research has been almost nonexistent, and now my supervisor is retiring in the fall. If I were to continue, I would have to find someone else qualified to supervise a PhD in the field - and that person doesn't really exist. Plus, even if I found someone, I would have to somehow scrounge up the little field research and writing I've done in the past 4 years, and convince someone entirely new that they're valid. Which I can't see myself doing.\n\nI also froze about publishing anything, and haven't. The fact that I've started a new job in February didn't help with working on my PhD, but that's not the cause. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, despite recognizing that you are in a bad place now, from what you're saying - it doesn't sound like it's seen so badly by others, from the outside. This might induce an imposter syndrome in you, which is something anyone who's honest about themselves and their work feels at some point.\n\nYou don't really want lack of agency when it comes to your life and choices. You just want to skip forward to a better place. But, since you can't (unless your research involves a time machine, in which case, please, share your results :D ) - get there slowly. One day at a time.\n\nTake the positions you're being offered, and do your best in them. Sometimes, that's the most we can ask of ourselves.",

It became this yoke around my neck and I had no interest in the topic, which then meant I had no interest in writing about it anymore.  I thought, \"Well, I've wasted all this time, why did I bother, I'm not going to achieve anything\" - all the things you're feeling.\n\nIt's taken a while, but now I've actually changed tack, changed my research interests and am researching/publishing on a topic completely unrelated to my PhD.  Eight years later, I'm far more invigorated, far more excited about research.\n\nIt's really tough to get through, but it does get better, I promise.",

The next day someone else is being nit-picked for having *not* referenced your work in their own manuscript.  \n  \nI can say with certainty that in my entire career, I've only come across one bonafide imposter - it just doesn't happen with any regularity.
