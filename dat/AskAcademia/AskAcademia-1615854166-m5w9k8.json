  "title:": "Work-Life Balance for tenured R1 professors?",
  "text": "I'm about to start as an Assistant Professor position in a (very) small STEM department of a well-ranked R1 university and already gave up the idea of work-life balance during the tenure track. However, what's the situation like with tenure? Some people say it gets worse since you're not \"protected\" anymore, others say it gets better since you can more freely say no. Does it get any better? Is there such a thing as work-life balance with tenure and could you significantly reduce your hours, say, when you start a family?",

      "text": "I am on the tenure track so take this for what it's worth, but I have stopped believing in the \"just this one more step z and then finally things will be good\" mentality. Things will always be busy, there will always be stressors, and when the things that made tenure track difficult disappear new challenges will magically present themselves. This is how it was when I graduated from PhD, then transitioned out of my postdoc into a research faculty position, and finally when I got in the tenure track. \n\nTherefore, I think you need to find work life balance now, since if you don't, you'll be burnt out by the time you are tenured. I have two young children that take a considerable amount of time which admittedly results in a lot of stress, but I still take time to go running, do other sports, hang out with my spouse in the evening, etc. because I think I have to if I want to make it work. Also, this is the message I want to send to my mentees who have an even longer way to go making sustainability so much more important.",

I'm objecting to the line \"The more you give academia, the more it takes.\" My point is that people who think \"the more you give academia, the more it takes\" do not have a healthy relationship with their career.",

                              "text": "That's very much the privilege of tenure, though. You, being tenured, absolutely have the luxury of saying no 19 out of 20 times. An Assistant Professor does not, and will probably say yes to most things out of obligation in the pursuit of tenure. Maybe some people can dial that back after they get tenure, but if you made it clear the last six years that you're willing to take on projects, those requests don't go away.\n\nAnd as to your last question, a lot of this can be dependent on the field. Given the topics that the social sciences and humanities may deal with, many students might end up relying on their professors to discuss stresses and trauma. My partner, for example, teaches in criminal justice and deals with gender-based violence. She gets numerous disclosures from students each semester and engages in a lot of emotional labor to help those students get the resources they need and process their trauma. I, as a man in political science, receive none of this, so I don't have to do much emotional labor for my students.\n\nHowever, I think in any field, a student is more likely to confide in a female faculty member on any topic. A chemistry student who is dealing with extraneous stress in their life may feel comfortable revealing this to a female chemistry professor, assuming that they will receive more compassion and understanding from her. If you have female colleagues, I guarantee they deal with this kind of stuff far more often than you do (if you're male). It's the same for me. I'm sure my students are more likely to drop these kinds of emotional labor tasks on my female colleagues than they are with me. All of this adds up to an immense amount of labor that many male faculty don't have to deal with.",

I've said \"no\" 19/20 times since I got tenure, and I probably said \"no\" 19.5/20 times pre-tenure. I've actually loosened up *since* getting tenure! Since the very beginning, they've understood that I'm there to run my lab and do research and that I'll keep publishing/bringing in grant money as long as they don't weigh me down with other stuff. If I ever the sense that I'm getting too close to the sun with the \"no's\", I'll agree to the smallest job I can find and do that as best I can. I realize that my experience isn't representative, but I guess my point is that I wish EVERYONE would say \"no\" up to the point where they start getting serious pushback from the administration. If everyone said \"no\" more often, I honestly believe many of the commitees, etc. would dry up (something that's happened more than once in my career). \n\nAs to the rest of your point, I understand that gender is a major component, as is field. But I also feel like a lot depends on how open one is with your students.

It may ultimately be better if everyone said no, but people are incentivized to say yes, because if you say no to this kind of work and everyone else says yes, now you stand out as not working nearly as much as others and jeopardize your tenure. So, of course you'll say yes. There's nowhere near the level of communication and organization for every person at a university or even in one department to all collectively say no and tell the administration to fuck off. Unless, of course, you're unionized. That tends to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm a man, but I'm also try to be very accessible to and open with my students, so during the semester I have one student per week in my office unburdening themselves of their stress or trauma. \n\nI think this is also an important variable to consider, but I bet your openness nets you roughly the same number of students as a woman who isn't open. And that means that a woman who is just as open as you is going to get even more students doing these things, simply because she's a woman. There's also just more general pressure for women and people of color and other minorities to be open like this, because it's often socially expected. You or I not being very open wouldn't get us negative student evals, but a woman or person of color not being open might, and all that stuff can jeopardize tenure.",

And chairs typically discover to their surprise (even if they were told this in advance) that many of their departmental colleagues now come to see them with grievances, worries, anxieties, complaints (about the administration, the institution, other departments, their colleagues in the department, you, etc.), some of which are painfully petty, cruel or even delusional, some of which are profound and important, and you have to carry all of the weight of those confidences. It's an incredibly stressful position--it's akin to be a joint in a complicated machine where your job is to absorb the shocks and friction created by parts moving on either side of you and whatever insulation you had when you begin in the role invariably wears down until it's metal grinding on metal by the end.",

So you should find a good balance now. After tenure you will definitely be asked to do more service and administrative stuff. Now, some people do drop off on the research after the get tenure. I don't mean completely, but they don't try as hard anymore on proposals and they have fewer students. So you can get more personal time back there. However, the tradeoff is it will be really hard to make full professor. If you want to make full, you basically need to keep your head down and keep going full steam even after tenure. But, if you're happy not going for full, then consider slowing down after tenure. It depends on what you want in your career.",

The truth is, you don't want the stability of being tenured if you are stuck in a job that is going to give you insane stress and working hours for decades. That's just not sustainable.\n\nMy examples: I have a block on my schedule every morning 7:30 to 9am, which is when I run, drink coffee, and get ready for the day. I have a no laptop rule on Saturdays, and usually take a long hike with my partner and our dogs. Evenings are for cooking dinner with my partner and relaxing - sometimes with my laptop, but usually not. I refuse to get sucked into any conversation about how many hours I worked or how late I stayed up doing xxx thing. It's toxic. I'm vocal about leaving work early when I need a break with colleagues and students - I think it's really important to model healthy work/life balance for my students as well.\n\nFor context, I just got tenured last year in a research-heavy position at an institute within an R2 uni, so my research expectations and teaching load are R1-level (I'm half at the R2, half at the institute, so have half the teaching load of my R2 colleagues). My external letters all came from folks at R1s and all were positive. I did give up the idea of being the best or famous in my field a long time ago - mostly because I simply don't want to work that hard - but I'm consistently funded and publish multiple papers per year.",

Teaching is a lot easier to prepare for than it was when I first started, and I enjoy it more. I do occasionally work evenings or a weekend if I\u2019m working toward a grant or paper deadline, but it\u2019s not that often (maybe once every few months?). I have also learned to accept less than perfection, focus on trying to get in 30 minutes daily research writing, and collaborate with people and graduate students I enjoy working with and mentoring them to maximize everyone\u2019s productivity and accountability. I also strongly encourage setting boundaries and promoting work-life balance in everyone in my department as well. The academic culture of overwork sucks badly.

Other full professors (mostly women) go all in on administrative duties and other stuff. I am a man but I got caught in the service wheel for many years (director, director of studies, numerous boards and committees etc.). \n\nAdministration require certain skills and a mindset that is sometimes hard to come by. Therefore, every time you do a decent job, you are certain to be asked to do something similar later on, and again, and again. I had to make a clean break and just decide that I wasn't going to do it anymore. Like a recovering drug addict, it took a while to get used to not having a say in anything and everything, but after a while it became the new normal. I am ten times happier today, and just do stuff that I like.\n\nOther than that, I think the biggest time waste is the way many organize their teaching. Many, many hours are wasted with no benefit for the students.",

              "text": "Imho, the thing that wastes the most time is communications outside of class with students about stuff that is NOT about understanding and content. If you have an LMS or just check your e-mail, how many questions from students are of the type:\n\na) \"I struggle to understand how X relates to Y. I read the book and did everything you told me to do, but I still don't get it.\" (Reply: \"Thanks for your question. I will try to explain this more thoroughly tomorrow in class.\")\n\n...and how many questions do you get of this type:\n\nb) \"When is the assignment due?\" \"I was absent yesterday because... what did I miss?\" \"My dog is ill and I haven't... what should I do?\"\n\nI have done some anecdotal surveys among lecturers over the years, and often (b) makes for close to 90 % of the work. If you can get the latter close to zero, more time to do Reddit, PS5 or research.\n\nAnother time suck is summative feedback after the fact. If I spend 10 minutes on a paper, I may be able to grade it reasonably validly and reliably. If I have to write feedback and communicate strengths and shortcomings of the paper it takes ten times longer. Sometimes this is necessary, but how much time is spent on explaining things that the student got wrong because they didn't study enough or was absent from your teaching?\n\nSuch ad hoc \"re-teaching after the fact on an individual basis\" should be brought down to absolutely nothing.\n\nPersonally I only give qualitative, formative feedback on drafts during the course. When the course is over with they get grades, and if they have questions about them I answer them.",

People mention working 8/9 to 5pm, but I find that if I try to focus for that long in a stretch, I get distracted, tired, and the quality of my work suffers. I\u2019ve read something that says you can really only do 2-3 hours of quality work in a day. I just can\u2019t grade or write or read for more than that in a stretch. So as a result my workday ends up taking over my entire day and I find that I start my day at 9am and wrap up a little past 9pm (with multiple short breaks and a workout and a dinner around 5pm). Note though that I love writing at night, so this is in part a personal choice to maximize productivity. But the downside is that it creates the impression of constantly working. I don\u2019t have kids and this is a major reason why tbh. \n\nI have gotten better about drawing boundaries around weekend work after developing some health issues due to chronic stress though. I try not to work Saturdays unless I have a big stack of grading or a grant due. Sunday evenings are all work though because it helps make the coming week less stressful.",

Associate professors are generally the administrative workhorses of any higher education institution and that brings a lot of new stress into their lives.",
