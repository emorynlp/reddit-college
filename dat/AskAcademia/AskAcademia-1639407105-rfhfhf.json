  "text": "I requested a recommendation letter and the professor submitted all schools except for one. So I followed up if she could complete it and did not get a response. I followed up again two weeks later again, to no avail. Now the deadline is three days in and I don't know what to do. Should I send an invitation (reminder) email through the portal or would it seem rude? Do you advise me to find another person? I already submitted the application and paid 100 dollars so I just need to complete the application.",

      "text": "Sending it to all but one sounds like an honest mistake if there were several overall.\n\nFor most academics I know, a couple weeks ago life was way more hectic than now because classes were finishing up, students were turning in projects, people were writing final exams, etc. Lots of things fell through the cracks for me anyway. Now lots of people are done or almost done with those things, so we're ready to catch up on things.\n\nDefinitely follow up. I'd send a short email (with a subject line that communicates this is urgent) basically at the same time as sending the invite/reminder through the portal, so they BOTH show up in her inbox simultaneously. The personal email should say something like: \"friendly reminder the rec letter for XYZ is due in 3 days, on Dec 16\" and tell her you sent the portal invite just now too so she will have it handy. Then make sure to thank her for sending all the others. \n\nIf she doesn't write back within 24 hours, give her a phone call? or anything you can do to more directly get in touch?",
