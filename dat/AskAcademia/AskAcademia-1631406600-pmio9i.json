  "text": "I'm considering a 2-year assistant prof position at an AMC - this seems like a nice step up from postdoc on the way to a tenure-track psych department job. It's good pay and the work is interesting, I can keep publishing and writing some grants at a top institution.\n\nHowever, recently I've been told that this kind of position (full-time research, soft money) makes it harder to land a psych department job down the line. Is this true? I would like to be on hard money in a psych department - would the interim AMC position be a step in the wrong direction?",
