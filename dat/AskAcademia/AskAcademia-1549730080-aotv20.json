  "title:": "Do others have a very hard time staying focused during talks/conference lectures?",
  "text": "I almost always lose track of what a speaker is saying at conferences. I'm not talking about the typical moments of spacing out that happen and have happened to all of us during lectures going all the way back to grade school. I'm referring to practically a total inability to keep the ears and brain both directed towards the speaker for any meaningful amount of time.\n\nMy main explanation for this is that conferences and talks are often socializing overload. You're surrounded by colleagues and peers in the same field as you, and it's hard to resist glancing over at them, thinking about your interactions with them, wondering what they're thinking about the lecture, wondering what they're thinking about *you*, trying to compose yourself in a way that looks totally scholarly and serious... Of course, there's also the matter of how engaging the speaker is. Listening to someone read 15 pages of a paper that is written in a style intended to be read and not spoken is already a bit of a challenge, but add that to a senior academic who doesn't look up or change his/her intonation even once...\n\nI'm exaggerating a bit here for effect, but I imagine there must be others who experience what I am describing.\n\nAlso, to all those out there who know the topic at a talk well enough to just ask a random question that has little to do with what the speaker was saying but at least saves everyone from the awkwardness of no one asking anything at all \u2014\u00a0thanks. To all those who do the same thing when there are many other people with their hands up \u2014 ugh.",

      "text": "In planning my talks and helping other people rehearse theirs, I try to keep in mind that most people will be fading in and out.  I try to design slides where someone could look up in the middle after not paying attention for the last 5 minutes, and have an idea of what I'm showing. EDIT:  As an example, even if I say \"for these next three  experiments, I used neonatal mice\" on a transition slide, I will write out \"allergic response in neonatal mice\" on every single slide showing data from neonatal mice.  I also make sure that any cartoon I draw is somewhat self-explanatory for someone who has been paying absolutely NO attention since the beginning.  \n\n\nA *few* high-end lecturers seem to know that most people do not have a long enough attention span to listen to a solid 50 minutes of data.  The visiting keynote speaker at a departmental retreat I helped organize gave a 45 minute lecture for her hour long spot, and it was much more narrative in format.  Unfortunately, many senior people who give conference lectures do not put the level of care and rehearsal into their talks that more junior people do.  I'm amazed at how many people struggle to stay on time.",

Cue a crowd of 100+ people (this was a well-attended public event) shouting out suggestions until finally the organizers gave up and told her to proceed giving her 40-minute talk through incessant freezes and connection drops.\n\nWelcome to academic conference lecture hell.",

People don't want to admit to themselves that a good talk provides some sort of entertainment value to hold the audience's attention. The result is many very bland talks that could just as easily be given to the audience to read in silence for 15 minutes before they ask questions. \n\nWhen we give talks at conferences, I think we should consider their stand-alone value as an informative lecture, and not just treat them as another CV line and a bland recitation of our research.",

Maybe the speaker uses a piece of jargon or term you don't recognize and you have to stop and think, wait, what does \"construction of geography-based identity\" even mean? And maybe you spend 5 seconds wrapping your head around the term and thinking \"oh, it means where someone was born or lived shapes their sense of who they are as a person,\" and suddenly the speaker has moved on and you've missed 5 critical seconds and boom, you're completely lost, and have to figure out what they're talking about \\*now\\* -- by which point they've moved on \\*again\\*. In the end your brain just drifts to something easily understandable for a break, like networking or what time it is, or how your shoes don't match your pants.",

Most of them were of these two types and probably most of them in any talk are but we don't realise so nothing to be scared or ashamed of. The 3rd type that I've noticed are those questions that people ask that have their research incorporated and they sound very deep and hard to answer. Keep in mind that those persons have found a link between the two studies and it's not some connection from thin air so we shouldn't feel intimidated. ",
