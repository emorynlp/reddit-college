  "text": "I\u2019m in the second to last year of my PhD (year six). My department (Ivy League, comparative literature) offered no resources, guidance, advice on landing a job or even postdoc. They discouraged publishing too early or presenting at conferences because they claimed it diverted attention/energy from the most important thing: writing a stellar dissertation. Now I\u2019m year 6, no publications, some conference presentations, and terrified I\u2019ve wasted six years of my life. Advice for moving forward/being as competitive as possible on market for TT jobs or postdocs?",

      "text": "Yes, this was bad, terrible advice from a department that only cares about their completion statistics and clearly isn't that bothered about their employment rates. But, second to last year - you've still got plenty of time to fix it. Just get aggressive af with it. Put together a plan, now, to get one article submitted and another in preparation by the end of this academic year. If you put yourself in a position of having at least one accepted article and another submitted (perhaps also accepted if you're lucky) by the time you submit your thesis you'll still be ahead of most of the pack.\n\nConferences frankly less important but yes if there are some big conferences coming up in your field this year submit a paper (a version of one of the articles you're working on), or if you can't do that just go and network. Ignore whatever your supervisor etc says if they try to discourage you - this is what a PhD is for and employers will have expected you to do this stuff. You might also get another publication in the pipeline out of it. \n\nIf you move quickly I don't think you'll have missed the boat in any significant sense. If you keep listening to your department for another 2 years you will, though.",

Someone with a PhD in comparative literature, if they are going to be working in any type of faculty position, whether full- or part-time, will be teaching courses that are run out of an English department.\\* The number of people with PhDs in comparative lit who have or will have careers that are entirely research-focused, without any teaching, statistically approaches zero. \n\nAssuming you work at a U.S. university, what is the percentage change at your employer in the number of English majors from fifteen years ago (pre-2008 recession) to now? My guess is that there has been a double digit decrease, unless you are at an extremely prestigious institution like Williams, where the brand matters more than a student's choice of academic major.  Declining numbers of English majors = less need for tenure-track English professors; sections of Composition 101 can easily be staffed by the legions of lowly paid adjuncts who also have PhDs in fields like comparative lit.\n\nFigure 1 (page 6) in the MLA's 2018-19 MLA Job List report -- [https://www.mla.org/content/download/134145/2569649/Job%20List\\_2018-19\\_Linked.pdf](https://www.mla.org/content/download/134145/2569649/Job%20List_2018-19_Linked.pdf) \\-- shows that the number of English jobs in academia advertised on the job list have been in steady decline since 2007-08 and were at their lowest number since the data began being tracked in 1975-76. While the number for 2019-20 is even lower (728, a 13% decrease from 2018-19), part of that decrease might be pandemic-related. But the twelve-year trend will not suddenly reverse in a year, two years, or even ten years. Every year there are far, far more doctorates granted in English than there are available full-time academic jobs in English.\n\n\\*Unless they are teaching remedial writing or ESL/TESOL courses that are housed in a bureaucratically distinct \"developmental English\"-style program. A comparative lit PhD from an Ivy is not a requirement for these positions.",

Nobody is asking you to \u201cfix\u201d people\u2019s unhappiness. Most grads just want advice that responds to their lived reality which is what is generally lacking. \n\n7.5 billion people on this planet don\u2019t all desire to be in grad school, and a generalization like that is, once again, elitist. Of those 7.5 billion people, how many of them don\u2019t have access to basic education to even know that grad school exists? How many of them have already been harmed by the educational system to not want to do any more school? How many of them chose to professionalize in something like CS so that they could move themselves out of generational poverty, and don\u2019t feel any pull to live the life of the mind? I realize you\u2019re drawing from your own experience here, but you need to recognize that experience isn\u2019t one people can access at this point. \n\nIt would be *enormously* fortunate to be born into generational wealth, thereby the material realities of the institution wouldn\u2019t have a bearing on ones experience within it. But that\u2019s a separate issue. \n\nThere\u2019s a big gap between people saying they want the best for people and actually doing the work to open the gates for that. The notion that nothing can be done to fix it is more about complacency than anything else. \n\nYour acknowledging that 1/2 of the people your department hired were poached from other institutions without acknowledging that many times when people leave a tenured position those lines close. So, my problem with the kind of thinking you are representing here is not that you can\u2019t fix it, but that you aren\u2019t willing to even recognize the ways you make it worse. \n\nMy sincere and genuine advice is to listen to grad students and try and understand that our experiences were never going to be like yours.",

On the flipside, I went to a mid-tier PhD program where I knew students who published multiple articles as humanities PhD students and were still unable to find jobs afterward, or languished as adjuncts for years before landing jobs. So having multiple publications does not guarantee landing a job and is not necessarily the best strategy for marketing yourself. Better to focus on getting a solid article into a respectable journal. And as long as it's been accepted, you can put \"forthcoming\" on your CV, even if it hasn't made it to print yet.",

Alas, I am in rhet/comp so I can only be of minor help to you.\n\nFor me, I found networking in the strangest places. I played World of Warcraft with a bunch of profs and grad students across the country when I was graduating and that really helped. Get yourself into online spaces where people just hang out and don't always talk shop (social media to start, and hopefully moving into other areas). If you can, get some additional teaching experience as well, as that will also be a good place to network. Lots of us are hiring online adjuncts still because of COVID. There are also dual enrollment programs like OnRamps that look for teachers. \n\nPublishing isn't nearly as hard as people make it out to be, except for the getting shit written part. Start editing and sending out papers. However, if you just want to land TT somewhere to start, also look at answering CFPs for edited collections. They require less time up front (just a proposal) a lot of the time to get a yes, and if you don't care about landing a top job right out of the gate can get you to a good, not great, school just fine. (And some of us don't even really care about publications, but lack of conferences would be weird.)",

      "text": "First off, I\u2019m sorry that you are feeling so stressed out about this. There\u2019s little acknowledgement of how panic-inducing all stages of academia can be and I just wanted to say your feelings are totally valid. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m going to go a little against the prevailing sentiment here that you were given such terrible advice and that your dept/advisor is either out of touch or only cares about you finishing rather than being competitive on the job market. After all, making sure that you have a manageable workload, a decent dissertation, and don\u2019t get torn to shreds at big national conferences is a kind of caring advice too. \n\nI say much of this because that was my grad school experience/advice. I did get a TT job (History), as did the two other cohort members under the same advisors. I don\u2019t want to suggest that your end result will be the same; I got a job right away but my classmates spent 1-2 years as postdoc/visiting. My partner (different advisor/field, same disciple, same advice) has had several visiting positions, no TT job offer yet. None of us had any publications until a few years on the market and only a few presented at our big national conferences. \n\nThe reality is, you should be preparing for years of NTT positions and/or non-academic jobs whether or not you have publications. Although it depends on the institution, they will not be the only thing that even gets you invited for a campus visit. Having gone through interview materials and been on the other side of search committees now, I see how much your materials (esp. cover letter) matter. Frankly, I\u2019m not nearly as interested in your CV as I am in how you tell me about yourself and how you will fit in the position/institution. \n\nIf you can and you think it will help, try to get a chapter/section of your diss published somewhere. Even going through the submission/review process and seeing what it is like can be valuable. Just don\u2019t beat yourself up if you can\u2019t because you are surviving the zillion other things that come with dissertating. Remember, you can also put at least a title or short description (not the publication) on your CV of works in progress that you are trying to get published (and the grants you have applied to)\u2014showing that active labor and research agenda is important. Everybody in academia knows that you\u2019re basically constantly rejected from everything\u2014show them what you are working on because it\u2019s not \u201cnothing\u201d just because it\u2019s not published. \n\nOverall, be kind to yourself and try not to get too anxious about this one factor. Remind yourself everything you have done in grad school that may not have had a finished \u201cproduct.\u201d Unfortunately, your chances at securing a TT job are already very slim and have a lot to do with factors you can\u2019t control, like how many jobs there are and who is looking at your application. If you go into the job market with open eyes about all this, it can soften the blow of not landing a job right away (or ever). Believe me, even those of us who do wonder if we wasted all those years in grad school and think about leaving academia altogether\u2026it\u2019s a total crapshoot.",

I'm at a middling R1 state university in the Midwest, and have sat on/chaired/participated in dozens of TT hires, so I know that most Ivies make it impossible to teach in your own grad program. But to make the cut for the long-list, you need both publications (if you're ABD, \"forthcoming\" articles will do, plus a good idea of how your dissertation book will look, and an embryonic second project to pitch) and good teaching experience. Not just TAing a few survey sections, that's really not worth anything on the job market. Get some adjunct work at a state uni or junior college near you. Because even if you do make it to a Zoom interview, 1/3 or more of the questions will be about teaching, and we can spot a total newbie a mile off.",

Your love/hate dichotomy undermines the complexity of the experiences people have in grad school. It\u2019s not helpful. Feeling terrified that you\u2019ve wasted six years of your life is par for the course right now. It hits people at different points in their journey, but I do believe it hits most humanities PhDs at some point. It\u2019s why there is such a HUGE consulting market for helping people to leave the academy, and a big part of that market has to do with the psychological impacts and crises people have to get through as they untangle their \u201cvocation\u201d and dedication to the institution and unlearn their own institutionalization so that they CAN find productive avenues elsewhere.  The vocation narrative doesn\u2019t help when people are in crisis. Loving something doesn\u2019t pay the bills. And you\u2019re also assuming that if they went to a funded program that they don\u2019t have any debt which undermines the material reality that stipends have not kept up with the cost of living, and many people have to take out loans to make ends meet. \n\nCalling people outside the academy \u201ccubicle drones\u201d is elitist and gross. It undermines the labor conditions present inside the academy where more and more labor is funneled into service and administrative work (committee participation).\n\nThis perspective is worn out. \n\nOP. You didn\u2019t waste your time. And you still have time to pull some publications together and get them under review. You were given bad advice, but you recognize that it was bad advice and that is going to help you more than you know. You do have power to make decisions for yourself and you do not have to listen to everything your advisors tell you. There isn\u2019t much by way of mentor training amongst tenured faculty, and no real way of holding them accountable for giving outdated advice. I wonder, too, why these faculty members consider a \u201cstellar dissertation\u201d and how much of that \u201cstellar\u201d value judgment has to do with reproducing the institution\u2019s norms vs making creative interventions into the field at large as well as one\u2019s focus within the field. Shit, I can\u2019t even get my department to explain what the assessment metrics for a dissertation are. \u201cA good dissertation is a done dissertation\u201d seems to reign supreme.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a different field than you, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. \n\nMy field of educational leadership is fraught with the productivity mindset. Most candidates CVs read like they are going up for associate. So having only a few collaborative publications going on the market made me hella nervous. \n\n But I ended up landing pretty much the perfect role in a department that values scholarship beyond peer review (I do more long term and public facing work) and actually value my teaching skills as well. \n\nI am in a 3-year visiting role (still only a 2:3 with full access to funding and support) at an institution that has transition from a regional comprehensive to an R2. \n\nNot all programs look the same or expect the same. You should definitely kick it into gear and get your CV in order but think about where you really want to be.\n\nI study colleges and universities (I know, very meta) so let me know if you have questions about researching schools!",

              "text": "Oh one more idea! I would check out and see what university-wide resources are available to you. A lot of institutions have semester or year long \u201cpreparing for the professoriate\u201d type programs or, at the very least, offer workshops or networking opportunities. If your department isn\u2019t providing you support you really need to look elsewhere. If not your institution, perhaps some of your professional organizations. I really benefited from getting involved with a national organization as a graduate rep which really helped me network in a none cringe/awkward way.",
