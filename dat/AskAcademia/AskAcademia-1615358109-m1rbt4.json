I'm now a data scientist, but having a math/stats/programming PhD doesn't help that much. I should have become an accountant or plumber; I think I'd be far, far happier.",

              "text": "It's not the work; it's the people. \n\nMangers believe that ML is a silver bullet that is going to print blank checks. They don't understand that you won't get Google level results on a shoestring budget, no matter how good you are. It's even worse when you have a PhD because people hold this childish notion that you can throw ANY project at somebody with a PhD, give them no resources, a ridiculous time frame and still get world-class results.\n\nPlus its super easy to bullsh*t in data science - your given a project and you respond with a realistic deadline. But you idiot colleague says they can do it in 1/4 of the time. They just threw the data at sklearn. Doesn't matter if the model is remotely right, or if the data was correctly cleaned. The only metric that mattered was that your colleague was faster than you are. They are obviously the better data scientist. In any other field they'd be outed. \n\nAnother pet hate I have is that everybody expects you to know all the answers all of the time!\n\nThen there is this PhD phenomenon (I don't have a name for it). I have however witnessed many times, or been subject to, the following example: A PhD and a BS candidate both working in similar roles, same company/department. Both need training on a new tech/topic. BS candidate has their handheld throughout the entire process, sent on courses etc., during work hours. PhD was expected to self-train in their own time. The difference in salary between the two was negligible. Excuses made for BS candidate, \"they can't take on project X; they don't have the training\". But when it comes to a PhD candidate, you are told: \"you have a PhD, you're supposed to be able to train yourself! Just get it done\". And when you do pull it out of the bag, you are told: \"So what? You're a PhD, we expect brilliant work from you. THat's WhAT wE PaY YOu fOR!\", meanwhile BS candidate is praised to the hills for completing a paid-for course during working hours. When it came to bonus time, guess who got a raise and who didn't?! (I'll leave this as an exercise to the dear reader). I had no idea that the PhD would be such a burden.\n\nFinally most of the decent jobs are in expensive cities. Even with a decent salary UK living costs are a joke. \n\nI swear blind half the people I've worked for have been lobotomised beforehand.",

There were a lot of tears throughout the whole thing, and even when I last amended my thesis! I never felt like I had direction and somehow mustered up a thesis.",

Yes, you get a doctorate degree which is still great but you still wasted 5 years of your life.  \n\nI got my doctorate and went to a mid tier (25-40 rank) school.  There were definite people that clearly went because they just viewed it as the next step without having the real passion for the science or topic.  They get halfway through and pass their orals and then realize it\u2019s better to just power through.  They end up getting a job that doesn\u2019t really need to Ph.D.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally questioned the value of my degree.  Initially applying for jobs while I had no experience yet.  It felt like I could have done myself better if I just jumped in with a BS.  Within the 5 years of getting my doctorate I could reach the same point professionally, gotten paid more and received industrial experience.  It really makes you question what\u2019s the point?  With that said, there are certain companies and positions and career paths where a Ph.D. Is useful or needed",

That is a huge loss in pay for the family just so I can have a job away from academics. Also, due to health reasons, we shouldn't be far from other family. So unless there are any biotech companies in the south or south side of the Midwest in need of yet another molecular neuroscientist, I am afraid I feel stuck at the academic institutions. In my city in particular, there are only two start-up and both are not hiring, I checked, every PhD in this town has checked. \n\nSo, am I willing to move? Kind of, with major limitations associated with having a life partner. Am I willing to leave her to pursue industry? Absolutely not. That would be dumb for several reasons.",

What you most want out of life at the time you start a PhD might not be the same as what you want out of life 5 - 6 years later.",

If the study you mentioned was just within your grad program, I'd be curious to see a similar study done across different fields.\n\nI actually found it very doable to break into an industry role after my PhD, but I definitely had feelings that I'd be further along had I stayed in one area.

I myself am one of those. I generally had a great experience and learned a lot but since my job wouldn't even require a Master degree I of course wonder what could have been if I would have started there earlier. A friend of mine did a Bachelor degree in biology and started working as a technician afterwards and while again she does not really completely regret studying she often voices that she would have preferred to get related education (which you could be paid for) instead of going into dept. It's more a \"in hindsight\" thing, there aren't that many jobs that require a PhD, so we kind of have to settle for something lower, meaning there's a lot of \"what it's\" going through our heads.\n\nI also suspect this is a bit more common in Germany, where we have to do a Bachelor and Master degree to be able to start a PhD, which of course leaves us with a lot more job opportunities \"pre-PhD\" than in countries where you decide between both degrees and basically compare Bachelor-level job market with post-PhD job market when discussing you options before and after.",

I landed a tenure track job at a state school and love working with students and the research I\u2019m able to do because of this job. While doing my PhD I sought out opportunities to do research in equity and tech and equity and computer science despite the discouragement of my advisor. It wasn\u2019t her main line of work so she had no interest. So I had to do a lot of it in secret. I was able to do an internship in Silicon Valley too. I was ready to jump into industry if it came down to it. If you do a PhD simultaneously prepare for a related career that you\u2019d love as much as being a prof. You have to feel passionate about this \u201cbackup\u201d option so you don\u2019t feel like a failure. If you\u2019re in the natural sciences industry is always an option but it requires extra prep if you\u2019re in the social sciences. I\u2019m interested in humanities success stories but the humanities PhD path looks even more challenging. Most of the humanity PhD students I knew had to work full time jobs while doing their PhD.",

      "text": "A close friend of my wife earned a PhD in neurobiology, just like both of his parents, and then dropped out of his post-doc less than a year in. He's now a pharmacists (and has earned a Doctor of Pharmacy degree while working in that field), and he's happy as a clam there. But I think it's fair to say that he has often wished he had gone straight to the career that makes him happy.\n\nAround the same time he was getting his PhD, I dropped out of my PhD program in ecology. There were a bunch of reasons why I did that, but the biggest was because it was super clear to me, even in 2001, that the job market for academic researchers in fields like ecology is absolutely awful, and I didn't want to do that.\n\nThat said, I defended my dissertation in education five months ago, and am submitting my final revisions next week. I got this PhD while continuing to work full-time as a high school teacher, and I don't know if I'll ever end up in a job that cares that I have a PhD: I did this only because I wanted to-- or, rather, because I had questions that I absolutely needed to figure out how to answer. It was absurdly difficult to do while continuing to work, but it was also incredibly rewarding, even if I don't ever look to see what if any doors it opens to my career.",

It is a complete mindfuck to spend so many years working toward something one cares deeply about--to receive constant encouragement from academia--and then, at the end of it all, to see it thrown away and deemed valueless.

      "text": "I'm happy I finished my PhD, overall, but there are a lot of uncertainties about the future of my career. For me, it helps a lot to remind myself that I'm doing something I care about and I don't have to settle or commit to someone else's idea of what my career should be.\n\nMy PhD years also include some of my fondest memories, some great life experiences, and many amazing friends, and I'm forever grateful for meeting them all while in my program. My time in the lab, however, and with my adviser and coworkers was sometimes miserable, true. Looking at this thread, and at my own experiences, I think the key is to make sure you have a life outside your immediate research group and work. At our school, there was a TGIF on Fridays and everyone would go and have a beer and chat with grad students in different departments, which was great. People also made time to party occasionally, or go out into nature and hike or swim or travel. Others had young supportive partners, or hobbies like gaming, trivia, and MtG.\n\nWhen I see regret, I usually see two cases. One is the people who dedicated everything to a toxic adviser and research group, which sometimes doesn't even result in a degree. If an adviser is mean, has people quitting or lodging complaints against him a lot, that's a real red flag, but sadly many will ignore it or think their experience will be different. This goes for PostDocs, too. \n\nThe second case involves people who go for the PhD out of some sense of challenge or accomplishment, not because they love the field. There were a surprising amount of people who seemed to just want to prove something, who never ever went to colloquium or volunteered to help on student visit day or cared much about teaching their classes. On the one hand, I get it - it's a lot of time and work and sometimes it's too much BS. But on the other hand, if you don't like teaching or hearing talks about the subject, what are you there for? In they end, they often ended up bitter and worn out and saying \"it was all meaningless\" in the end.\n\nTLDR: people need to ask themselves if they're really interested in their field, or what their motivations for getting into a PhD are. Thinking ahead helps a lot. Also, take care of yourself god damnit.",
