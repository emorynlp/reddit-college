  "text": "Just met with a graduate student who was concerned that a recent talk had been derailed by a persistent questioner. I told them that question management is a skill that develops over time, but also provided a few stock phrases that can be used to deflect questions when you don't have a good answer. Here are some of mine - any suggestions?\n\n* For interrupters: \"I might address that later in the talk - could you ask me again at the end if I haven't answered the question by then?\"\n* For repeated questioners who won't stop: \"This is a really interesting exchange but just because we're short on time and I want to give others a chance to ask questions, can we talk about it afterwards?\"\n* For people who offer dumb criticisms of your methods: \"That's an interesting point, what would you have done differently?\"\n* For questions that are nonsensical: \"That's an interesting point, what are your thoughts?\"\n* For questions that point out limitations: \"That's something I've thought a lot. Although this study wasn't set up to address that comprehensively, it's something we're going to look at in future studies.\"\n\nFor context, I'm in social psychology and do quantitative research.",

I want to make sure I make it through my prepared material, but there should be time for some discussion at the end of my talk.\"",

Many people critique methods out of hand without any real idea of what would have been a better model or statistical approach, and it might be fun to watch someone who just wanted to critique you scramble around for a constructive solution.  Alternatively, if they do offer you an alternative, most researchers have thought through their own methods enough to know why the alternative suggested method wouldn't work, and you can always explain that.",
