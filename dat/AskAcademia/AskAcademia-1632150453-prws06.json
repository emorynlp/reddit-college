      "text": "FYI, \"studying abroad\" is a very specific term in the US that means a student who is going to university in their home country does a short (typically 1 semester) stint at a university in another country to increase their exposure to another culture, language, school of thought, etc.\n\nWhat you are asking about is being an \"international student\" at a US/UK university. Most US universities that offer graduate programs accept international students, but is frighteningly expensive ($50-90k/yr after living expenses) unless you have research experience in your field of study already and can secure a research assistantship position where your tuition, health insurance, and a stipend are paid for in exchange for working 20-40 hrs/week for a research group. Age is largely irrelevant and loads of graduate students in the US are in their 30s.",

              "text": ">Won't I be able for those foundation programs?\n\nI think you're missing some words in this sentence so I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but I think the answer is no. International students are typically not eligible for financial aid in the US, whether it's federally-backed loans, loans from a US bank, university-based scholarships, or private foundation scholarships.\n\nUS institutions are only incentivized to go through all the paperwork required to bring in an international student in order to 1) get rich internationals who pay full price to subsidize costs for domestic students or 2) get highly accomplished internationals to pursue scholarship/employment in the US to bolster our intellectual capital.",

So, no Pell Grants, Grad PLUS loans, much of the aid and scholarships at land grant universities and the like. There are some Federal funds for international scholars (e.g. the Fulbright program), but they are rare. When it comes to scholarships from private universities, foundations or other institutions - legally, these organizations can use their money on whatever they like, and many do support international students, or don't gate money based on citizenship status.\n\n> loans from a US bank\n\nInternational students are eligible for student loans as long as they have a US citizen or resident cosigner.\n\n> rich internationals who pay full price to subsidize costs for domestic students\n\nYes but no. The budget economics of US institutions is actually more complex than that. Of course rich international students are ideal, but most institutions admit students based on some formula of ability to pay and merit. Just as it's possible for a domestic student to be admitted to University X with an x% reduction in tuition (which can be billed as merit or financial aid, but from a budgetary perspective, is largely the same thing) in order to \"salt the mine\", it is possible to do so as an international student. You just have to be, say, a standard deviation better applicant than the equivalent domestic one.\n\nFinally, just as an addendum, it's really damaging when people post incorrect information about this online, because everything to do with international student-ing in the US is super murky and there's already a shit ton of bad info out there. So like, if you don't know, don't say anything.",

That said, education in the US is pretty expensive, not only tuition-wise but because as an international student you have to buy a lot of extras like expensive health insurance, probably overpay for housing if you have no credit history or cosigner, international flights, visa fees etc., and you can't work for more than 20 hours or off-campus without special permissions. It's definitely possible to get a scholarship to cover some or all of that (and you don't need to be a genius!), but if you're transitioning into a completely new field, it's harder. Also, if you want to be a practicing psychologist, keep in mind that you would need licensure in most jurisdictions, and in that case you should check whether a US psychology degree/the specific degree you'd be pursuing would be accepted by your country's licensing body. Otherwise, verifying that degree will cost you lots of money and likely lots of time.\n\nI don't know much about psychology so I can't help with more than the general stuff, but I see you're getting some questionable info here so.",
