      "text": "Me PhD in molecular Neuroscience.\nNegatives: Job security sucks. long hours. Lack of structure. No set criterion for success. Low probability of success in academia. Job relocation to undesirable area likely. Pay is very low for education. More training years compared to MDs (10-12+ years common after bachelors).\nPositives: no debt, love the work, diversity in how I spend my days, rewarding work, no patients, better flexibility in my hours even if it's 60ish per week.\n\nMy Fiance M.D. Radiology.\nNegatives: half million in debt, long hours, no control over time, people micromanaging her work and hours, patients suck, call shifts, night shifts, work gets repetitive and monotonous and boring, need to study and work once home, training period still quite long (9 years post bachelors).\nPositives: absurd salary.. as far as medical field goes, radiology grants much better hours and flexibility compared to most others despite long hours still 60ish per week.\n\nFriends MD/PhD.\nNegatives: long training period (12+ years after bachelors at a minimum). Difficult to juggle both clinic and research duties often consuming more time than a single degree with less productivity in both fields, all the negatives of the M.D with a few exceptions, watch friends graduate long before you, can lose track of basic medical knowledge during the 4-5 year PhD stage. \nPositives: no debt, protected research time, separate pool of grants, great diversity in working day, better flexibility of career trajectories, better education overall (same medical standards, science training tends to lack due to most not doing post doctoral training, but most MDs don't know much at all about science).\n\n\nFor me, I chose a PhD because a disease devastated a family member of mine which caused me enough pain to dedicate my life to pursue a cure. If not for this, I would never, ever, ever do science. I hate the scientific field with a passion that grows every single day, but there is no other way to find a cure than through the tool of science. Literally this is the worst career and I wish my family member never got screwed up so I didn't start down this path. It causes me a lot of pain and envy to see my fiance, who we went through undergrad together, having such awesome job prospects and financial compensation, all while I literally beg for money to keep my job all year every year, and know that if I am unsuccessful at appealing to the subjectivity of others, everything I have worked for comes crashing and burning. I want out as bad as I need to stay in. But for these reasons I would never, ever, suggest for anyone to go into science alone. MD/PhD, sure, MD, yes, but never just PhD. You will work just as hard for poor job prospects, no security, and low pay. Don't do it. Seriously. Not unless you have a very deliberate reason.\n\nEdit: now that it's morning I asked my MD fiance directly. She listed the same pros and cons but added that working in medicine can be hard on the emotions. She hates seeing so many people suffer in terrible ways, all day, every day, most of which nobody can help. While she doesn't disagree with work being repetitive, monotonous, and boring, she thinks all jobs end up this way. I can say at least in science this is not true. A technique might be repetitive, yes, but the experiments never are, the reason for doing the techniques always changes, and the project direction constantly progresses. I'm never really doing the same thing twice from an experiment/project perspective, never writing the same thing twice, and that keeps the work fun.",

      "text": "I know many MDs and many MD-PhD's, so I'll deal with only stereotypes here.  Please excuse the broad stereotyping and generalizations.\n\nDr. Zelenko is a big name these days among Republicans who refuse the vaccine. He has an MD. The average MD knows as much about Medicine as the average MBA knows about business. In other words, the average MD, Zelenko included, is presumed to be an idiot among those who do research.\n\nMany MD-PhD's suffer from the same problems. Take Joe Ladapo - Surgeon General of Florida. His PhD was in Economics. Again most serious researchers mock people like that. \n\nIf you are really interested in research and medicine, get a PhD in molecular medicine from Stanford or somewhere else. Or get a PhD here https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/tracks/clinical-and-translational-science/",

Better to have a master\u2019s as well, but I\u2019ve been offered Level D positions without this. People in the faculty I\u2019ve spoke to often say a PhD is overkill.\n\nNow, it depends entirely on what you want to do. For clinical research, PhD is not necessary I think. Mastery of the clinical area is, I think.\n\nIf you want to do basic science research (I\u2019ve done a little, back in the day), I can see a PhD being useful.\n\nI almost did a PhD myself about 12 years back. Ended up deciding that it was easier just to keep working rather than having 3+ years away from the real job.\n\nI\u2019ve been a full-time academic since 2007, was part time for a few years before that.\n\nMain thing a PhD would be useful for for me is upwards mobility. But in my school, 2 of the 3 full profs I\u2019ve worked with got the Level E position without one.\n\nGood luck getting those kinds of roles without a PhD in other areas of academia. But medicine is different, at least where I am.",
