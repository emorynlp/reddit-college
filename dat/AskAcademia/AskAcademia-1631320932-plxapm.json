I know of two cases, both at Big-10 departments, where they hired a person based on an interview and a CV. They never checked the references or contacted people at former U's. *I was one of those references*. The applicant never asked me! I never submitted a letter. And most of that persons \"articles\" were books at vanity presses or predatory journals which publish anything. Plus, this was just an awful person who couldn't manage graduate students, who asked colleagues to teach her courses while she spent a month each term at her remote cabin, and many other things. \n\nI never would have written a good reference, but she used my name anyway. A few months after she was hired (with tenure, I might add), her department head called me to ask how I possibly could recommend her and whether or not I was aware of what a problem she was as a member of the faculty and as a teacher.\n\nThey were (or at least pretended to be) shocked to learn that I would never recommend her. \n\nEven more, and more damaging, I told them to look into her PhD. She never actually earned a PhD although she claimed to hold one. I told her department chair that fact, and in a month or two her dean or provost (( don't fully recall which since I didn't care about her) asked for more full information about her PhD and publications, she resigned mid-semester rather than submit proof of what she listed on her CV.\n\n**Long Story Short (TL/DR):** Some departments hire people without checking anything. If the interview is OK you might get hired. Plus, some department search committees don't check/know if one has published in pay-to-publish (predatory) journals or real ones. \n\n**PS:** Ten years ago  personally had a colleague publishing 30-40 pieces per year, all in journals that he edited and in which he could publish without review, and he self-published a book or two a year. Many of his \"articles\" were the same but in which he simply used a \"global change\" function to rename the nation or place to which the article referred.",

Resources committed to STEM risk no challenge to power elites, to the university hierarchy, to the role of the academic in society, as critic and conscience, or questioning what constitutes social progress. The academy and academe have been reduced to publication-seeking technicians, with industry applications, commercialisation of research being held paramount, in the service of existing power structures. In short, this is simply one of the crassest examples of the neutering of the academy.",
