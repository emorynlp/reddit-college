  "text": "Hi All,  \n\n\nI'm almost done with my MFA (third year, in the US), however, my undergrad is in English and I really want to write professionally as part of my post-grad career. I just saw a call for papers on a topic that I have just written about for a course. I want to submit but I have no idea what is expected with these things. This particular call doesn't have any information other than the topic, a deadline, and an email address. How do I get some sense of what is appropriate to submit?  Do people submit papers they've written in grad school to these things or am I way off base to consider that? If I do submit my paper, should I format it differently than how I did for my course?\n\nNone of the faculty have ever addressed this, and they aren't generally that helpful, hence me coming here. I want to start branching out on my own and taking the risk by submitting something I have already written that is appropriate, but I would feel more comfortable with a little context first. After I graduate I'd like to see if I can find calls posted early enough that I can write something new, so any tips would be much appreciated!\n\nFor further clarification, the types of calls I want to answer are largely art related.",

      "text": "Your post doesn't specify what kind of call for papers this is. A special issue of a journal? A book-length essay collection? Is this academic or creative writing?\n\nGenerally, it's normal to e-mail the editor to check if they think your topic fits the scope of the project. I wouldn't submit a term paper to a call for papers without substantial revisions. Assuming this is an academic article, you could check out Wendy Belcher's *Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks* for a practical guide on revising term papers into publishable articles / book chapters.\n\nIs your goal to remain in academia? If so, I would avoid hunting cfps and instead focus on submitting articles to peer-reviewed journals. These hold much more value in an academic CV. That said, there are a couple places to find cfps. Cfp list and h-net are the first that come to mind. Also, major academic organizations usually manage mailing lists by sub-field and you can often find cfps circulating there.",

          "text": "Thank you so much the advice and recommendations. It's an art symposium, I should have been more detailed.\n\nI would like to loosely stay in academia. By that I mean I am not in a position to relocate and jobs are limited where I am so I'm hoping to piece together a couple adjunct teaching positions and then work on my own research and projects. Your suggestion regarding peer-reviewed journals is especially useful and appreciated.\n\nSince I'm in the visual arts, I'm approaching this from a largely non-writing discipline, which is probably compounding my confusion.  \n\n\n*edited for spelling errors*",

      "text": "I generally look up the person making the call. Look at their CV, maybe read a paper they've written to get an idea of their interests. Many conferences also have an associated journal, it'd be good to browse that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally you submit a 250-300 word abstract of the paper you plan to present. Conference papers are 20 mins long or 2k-2.5k long. Check for other conference schedules in your discipline or the discipline of the conference organizer to get an idea of conference abstracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: oh, art is your field. Maybe check out the Design History Society. Also you need to prepare either a powerpoint or something else (I usually export a pdf from indesign) with slides for the presentation. About one per min is the rule of thumb. You can make the slides and then figure out what you are going to say. Let the images tell the story. Occasionally, authors submit an image or two with their abstract.",

Although, many conferences will want you to submit the paper before the actual conference for grants or to allow the chairs time to review it. I'm sorry if it came off as patronizing. Just, I thought it's helpful info for forming your first abstract. At this point in my career, I almost always have a draft paper before submitting an abstract. It takes practice and forethought to know what fits in that sized chuck of research. So, if time allows, make an outline first. It's not wasted work, because if you get accepted you will use it, if not you can recycle it, and it's always good to practice.",
