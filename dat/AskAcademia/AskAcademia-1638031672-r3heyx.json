  "text": "I\u2019m lonely and making friends is hard. But I also have historically had a hard time connecting with people. I connect best with other people in academia, but I haven\u2019t met anybody that I\u2019ve connected with at my current institution. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a place on here or somewhere else online where I can make friends with other academics? For a little more info, I\u2019m in hard sciences but for whatever reason I\u2019ve always clicked more with humanities people.",
