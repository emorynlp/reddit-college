  "title:": "Have any of you gotten a PhD even when it didn't make sense economically?",
  "text": "I am currently a master's student in a thesis based program. In my field, (I think) a person with a master's degree earn around the same wage as a person with a PhD. I know I don't want to stay in academia, but I would really enjoy doing a PhD. I'm loving the research that I'm doing and want to go deeper into it. Also, since there's still some COVID restrictions at my university, I don't feel like I'm really getting the 'grad school' experience right now, so I wouldn't mind staying longer to experience that. \n\nHave any of you decided to get a PhD even when it didn't make sense economically and you weren't aiming to become a professor? \n\nMy field is robotics and AI, so if anyone wants to give me advice related to my field specifically, I'd really appreciate it!",

      "text": "Not every decision has to maximize earnings. Spending several years pursuing a personal goal, doing something you enjoy, and learning, also has value. \n\nThat said, also recognize that a PhD in a field like Robots/AI does actually open up some new opportunities. Namely, a PhD trains you to be a researcher, and there are plenty of R&D gigs in industry, military, and private institutes in your field that would be high paying, and where a PhD would be beneficial or even required. If you like doing research and want to make it your career, then a PhD is a good option. \n\nAlso recognize that a PhD will likely be different than your MS. It will involve less coursework, more time conducting research, and probably some time teaching. Be prepared for these differences.",

Sorta fold a second bachelor\u2019s into the mix.",

Those in my field who \u201cgraduate and left academia\u201d (which is bullshit speak for \u201cgot a job at a company\u201d) actually ended up with higher paying jobs than those who pursued a postdoctoral fellowship or went to a National laboratory. Academic jobs are very rare, and securing one at an R1 where obtaining funding is arguably easier, is even rarer. National Labs are almost always underfunded and transitioning to staff is equally rare. There is a Renaissance in AI, with many companies and research groups trying to harness its full potential, so you may be in a field that \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d. To be honest, most of my colleagues and I earned a PhD because we were curious and interested in doing experiments we couldn\u2019t do in our garage.",

I've seen people who have parents who are willing to pay off all their debt and people whose parents want nothing to do with them after 18 who are fairly well off. I mean I personally know a professor who had over 100k in debt when he exited his program can't really imagine his family helped out with that one.",

I'm also not confused about the folks who complain one day about their rent and the next day talk about how their parents just bought them a car, pay for a portion of their bills (incl rent), and take them on international vacations. It's similarly not confusing that multiple people are able to purchase homes on grad salaries because their parents forked out the money for a down payment. What *is* confusing is that they are all so secretive about their financial situations to the point of lying about renting homes they own, making up stories that they have to visit family when they are going on vacations, crying about how hard it is to sleep 4 people to a room when they have a suite at the conference hotel, and watch their other performances about supposed struggles.",
