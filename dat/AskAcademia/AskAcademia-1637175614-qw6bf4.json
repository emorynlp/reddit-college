  "text": "Hi all,\n\nNewbie, first book author here. I work on youth cultures and children's literature. I have seen that the *University Press of Mississippi* (UPM) publishes many books in my area (children's literature and dozens of books on it!). Is this a good press? I have seen legit scholars publish books with them. But sometimes, smart academics also have a few publications with the likes of Cambridge Scholars. No offense, but I'd want something decent for tenure (and unfortunately my department has no scholars in my area). If you have any experience with this press, or if you are broadly in literature/cultural studies/children's literature, I'd really appreciate you weighing in.",

      "text": "Normally, any university-affiliated press will suffice for tenure, but as a scholar, you need to develop knowledge about which presses are the best for your specific subfield.\n\nStart by looking at your dissertation's bibliography.  What publishers appear most often?  Look at current catalogues of the presses that publish your favorite theorists and the top-notch scholars in your subfield.  You can even contact colleague in your subfield (via email, or at your next conference), even if you've never met them before, and ask which presses they'd recommend for a manuscript like yours.",
