  "text": "I got into my dream PhD program in January and my fianc\u00e9e and I were making our plans to move there soon. However, my fianc\u00e9e passed away unexpectedly on the 1st of this month and I've been a total wreck. I can't concentrate on my last semester of undergrad and a huge reason I chose this school was because she would love the area/things to do there. I want to still get my PhD but now I'm feeling lost and scared about moving forward. \n\nI contacted the school and they said I can defer up to a year and keep my RA-ship offer and everything and my current university is offering me incompletes to finish over the summer, but I don't know what I should do. My parents have taken me back to my childhood home and they are trying to \"get me over\" the death of the love of my life. They want me to finish my undergrad on time (by May 1st) and start grad school on time (June 1st), but I'm having trouble just typing this let alone thinking about math. \n\nMy end goal is to become a professor at a PUI. Would deferment be looked at negatively? Does anyone know how I can transition back into my life/school? Is it okay to not be able to do any work right now? \n\nI'm also feeling guilty to move on with my life without her. Does anyone have any advice? I'm only 22 and my lover has already passed away.\n\nThank you for any advice.",

Just take it day by day.",

This is why these options are there, when the unexpected happens.  Don't listen to your parents and take your time to get to a point you are okay.  Mental health is already tough in grad school and going in when you are already vulnerable is not a wise decision.  Having a gap year shouldn't be a problem.  Plus, grant, fellowship and job applications all have a personal statement where you can explain gaps like this.  And you have a very good reason if questioned.  But also having a gap year at this stage isn't usually an issue.  This won't ruin your chance to be a professor.  Focus on grieving and dealing with your loss.  And think about would she want you to put your life on hold.  Taking the deferment to grieve is okay.  But also moving on to grad school (be it this one or applying again this fall for another school) is okay as well.",

Your first year after undergrad (regardless of what you do) is really hard.  Also a huge life adjustment.  And obviously your plan is not what you thought it would be.\n\nTake this year to grieve.  If and as you can, and as part of the grieving process, move yourself forward bit by bit.  Work on your physical and mental fitness.  Eat good food. Take walks.

You'd be better off almost anywhere else IMO, for both personal and professional reasons. Give yourself a break and do what you need to in order to reset...grieving during a pandemic is hard as hell (as I and many others now know). Being a grad student ain't no picnic either. If you can take some time to focus on yourself and to heal you'd  probably be in a better place in fall 2021, and it's all but certain that's true for higher ed in general as well.",

It took me about 6 months to feel at all consistently functional.\n\nBut there will also be times when you can do all right and be wanting to move forward. Like when you wrote this message to all of us. \n\nTake whatever time off you have been given. This is not giving up or giving in. Your entire psyche has been shocked badly and you cannot function at your best. You need the time to recover, even if all you want to do is bury yourself in work to distract you from the pain of it all.\n\nIt sounds like both institutions are doing you a solid and giving you the time. Take it. You need it.\n\nI was trying to finish my dissertation when my wife died. My first draft was completely finished. It actually took me another 2 years until I got to my defense. OK, that's what it took. I simply could not have gone any faster.\n\nTry to remember that your parents are trying to help even when they're not. You can also say, \"no, I don't want that.\" They might actually hear you after 45 tries.\n\nNo one you want to work with will look badly at deferment for this reason.\n\nWhen you're ready, you'll know.",

Take time to take care of yourself. You will  of course never \"get over\" this, but moving through normal life again does become less painful. If you dive headlong into your grad program, you're just going to feel off kilter -- deferments and gap years are normal and acceptable if anyone even notices it in the first place, but nearly failing your first year is going to be much harder to move past. I also want to caution you about this: the world of academics and research can be cutthroat in the sort of stress it makes us put on ourselves.

I'm only 22 and my lover has already passed away.\n\nWhat if it way you, and somehow afterlife existed so you could still wish things. Would you wish your lover got stuck in grieving you and live a terrible life? I bet not.  Life moves on, everything heals, and what remains is a healthy dose of missing your loved one.  A healthy dose of grief. Focus on good memories, try to smile when you remember her, and keep in mind that she'd always want to see you happy and at peace.\n\nI was 22 when I lost my dad, it was right at the beginning of my 4th semester of my BA.  All of a sudden, lung cancer.  This stuff works differently for everyone, but I found myself just going to school after the day of his burial.  Not really a conscious decision, more like my gut dictated me that I needed some fresh air, some \"moving things\" in my life. In retrospect, I did have episodes of grief and of just not knowing what I was doing, but I believe it also helped me not go down a spiral of bad mental health.\n\nSo if you listen to yourself and feel like your PhD might help you cope with things and you can focus on stuff in the coming weeks, maybe pushing on through could be beneficial to you. But if you feel that it'd be detrimental both to you and to your education/career, and/or you feel you need to stop and grieve her, to hell with everything else, take the opportunity to the deferment. In doing my MA I'm learning that people who didn't do these stuff are completely ignorant how much emotional labour and stress is involved in this thing, so I'd only take advice of my colleagues and supervisors. Nobody will think negatively of a year off, let alone a year off for a reason that's so serious.\n\n>  Is it okay to not be able to do any work right now? \n\nAbsolutely.",

I'm worried about the fact that you're living with your parents (homophobic per post history). I know that with Coronavirus and financial considerations it may not be possible to do anything else. But I do worry that without something to work towards (independence from them), being stuck with your parents might be further detrimental to your ability to grieve and process.\n\nThat said, I also agree with everyone else that's posted. The stress and expectations of a PhD program are 100% too much for June 1 and you need time to grieve. Perhaps there are other options, like starting in September? Would it be possible to move in with a supportive friend rather than your parents and see how you feel?\n\nDepending on how bad your home situation is (and other factors like Coronavirus), getting a fresh start outside your childhood home may be, on balance, less problematic than your current environment.",

It's an incredibly hard thing to go through so do what you need to do to take time to grieve; I don't think 1 month is long enough. \n\nWhy is your program starting you in June? Most programs *do* have an optional summer start but this isn't a great idea in your case and doubly so with this SARS-CoV-2 business. I wouldn't start until Fall. \n\nAs an aside, although I do think a deferment is the best option, you need to consult with the department about how secure your funding is. Grad students who just got offers the UofA just had their offers pulled if they didn't sign because there is a clause that says the funding is guaranteed barring \"extraordinary circumstances\"; this university had to invoke this clause and thus told the students that they technically still had offers but they would have no funding the first year. \n\nMy only other advice is that you should not think about it as \"moving on\" in life. It's about carrying on like she would want you to do and about carrying on her memory through your life and work. I lost my best friend when I was in college and I felt immensely guilty about getting to pursue my BS and PhD without him but it helped me most to go through the full grieving process (going to where his ashes were scattered before I left for my program, meeting his family, having a funeral at school with his friends) and to not ignore my emotions for the sake of my work. Seven years later it still affects me when I think about how we were supposed to do a PhD together but instead of falling into despair, it carries me through the hard times in my program because I now feel as if I'm getting this PhD for the both of us. One day I think you too will be able to reach the same point but for now just take it day by day and know that everything you're feeling is normal and okay.",

Politically, they may be able to make additional accommodations if they really want you in the program. These are crazy times, especially with corona. \n\nAfter you see the reply from your department, you can make a more informed decision. You already know you can defer by a semester or year by contacting admissions etc. If deferring by a semester you may be able to keep offered aid, a year is more of a question because an RA position likely isn\u2019t through your dept. January semester start is 9 months away. \n\n**sidenote and major IMO: if your school isn\u2019t 100% paid for and you\u2019re not in an absolutely kick ass program, you might reapply to PhD.***\n\nIf you\u2019re flat broke and don\u2019t have many options and access to things like therapy, you might be better off going straight in after a semester and planning on a longer time in school so you have access to things a campus offers it\u2019s students and can pace yourself in the spring. \n\nI am so sorry that you\u2019ve had to face something like this.

Figured burying myself in things to do would keep me distracted, but I ended up just bottling up a lot of feelings and slowly falling apart. Ended up dropping half of my schedule and struggling to meet my obligations as an undergraduate instructor. I was very fortunate to have a good circle of friends in a supportive department or I probably couldn't have limped through the classes I needed to walk away with the minor. Although I didn't walk at graduation.\n\nI took a year off after that. Pretty much from all of life. I rarely left my home for any reason for the first few months. I don't remember much from that year.\n\nEventually I pulled myself together. Accepted the loss. Decided to make something of myself. I studied harder than I'd ever studied before and ended up with a much more respectable LSAT score than my average first go around. Went from a \"we understand your circumstances\" type probatiobary admission to a modest merit based scholarship. \n\nBy the time I entered my first semester of Law School I was ready to come back to life. I poured myself into it. While others started to feel the fatigue of going straight through school, I pushed harder and harder because I was ready for something normal in my life.\n\nI still felt the sting of that loss. I had tears in my eyes when I walked across the stage to get my diploma from the same school my dad attended. But I made it through and now I have a very good life and I love what I do.\n\nI would have washed out if I hadn't taken that year to collect myself. Take your time, get yourself right.

This is a problem for me and my SO too, but we both have goals and we pursue them. We try to find happiness [this video helped me a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUwzrqcPujg), maybe it's not relevant to you, idk. All in all, you are living your own life. You can move homes, companies even countries,  but if you are unhappy in your current position then what's the point of trying to satisfy her. Afterall if you are not happy you won't be able give happiness either, in a sense. Sorry if this is shit-timing for you, in the manner i talk about it. But you really gotta treat yourself. Not get fat or do drugs. I mean, really figure out what you want to do and do that. And if you meet someone you like, the better. But don't give up your goals.\n\nAnyways you didn't specify whether the degree would have been satisfying to you? That's an important question. From the way you are talking i feel like you sacrificed multiple parts of your brain/desires to satisfy her(whilst she was trying to convince you not to) and now that she can't thrive(proposed) in that environment you feel cheated, lost, this is how it comes off for me, but i am not a psychiatrist. Iff you feel like you need one, i definitely recommend you to do it, it can help. Of course you can't jump grieving, that's part of the deal.\n\n>I just am scared to be around a town that I know she would have thrived in.\n\nthat's an assumption, or a lie. You can't know that. If you are so codependent on her emotions you, yourself lose control over yours. Thus creating more stress for the both of you. You need to allow yourself to enjoy things without trying to please others(i know i'm harsh, i really don't know how else to express it).\n\n>  I wasn't going to move somewhere that was going to make her feel unhappy.\n\nThat again, is out of your control. So many things can make a person unhappy, while long distance can definitely put a strain on the relationship, putting both of you to the proof, in the end of the day even if i was with my partner 24/7 i wouldn't be able to my favourite hobby.\n\nDo you have hobbies? Things you like to do? Try to fulfil yourself with them and the energy you gained from pursing your interests shall aid you in making others happy. But if you just try to please....\n\nI really don't know if i'm helping or not. You know yourself. \n\nI wouldn't know what i would do if my SO died tomorrow. I would cry. Feel lost. Maybe suicide. But in the end of the she fell in love with me. The reason i was happy is because she was happy through me. Every each of of our friends likes us because of US(ego) not because we try to please them.    \nIf they don't like us for that reason, then they are not friends.",

                  "text": "A PhD was a PhD. It didn't matter where it came from to me. Where we lived mattered immensely to her. Long distance wasn't an option. She told me that. I have my own hobbies. I did them. We had shared hobbies to that we enjoyed together. I think I made a good choice. I know she had a bright future. We loved each other for who we were. This is the purest form of love that I've ever experienced. I don't think it's wrong to put somebody as your top priority. I was happy to. I still lived my own life, but everything was so much better with her. And now everything hurts.",
