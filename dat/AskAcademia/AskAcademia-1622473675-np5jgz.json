  "title:": "Really embarrassed after being denied an extension... Don't know how to stay on my professor's good graces?",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope I am following all Sub rules.\n\nI just got denied an extension on a major assignment that was due today and I kind of just wanted to hear some advice on how other students/academics manage feelings of embarrassment associated with failure or disappointing others. I'd also like to hear from profs who might have heard from students like me and responded in similar ways to mine. You can all be as honest as possible - please feel free to chastise me if you feel that it is necessary in this case.\n\nI had to move back in with my grandparents during the pandemic to take care of them and have been having trouble with school ever since. Nothing I haven't been able to handle, thankfully. However, after they got their vaccines on Thursday, they fell unwell and I've been pressed for time as I've managed caring for them, finishing this paper, and working. I reached out to my instructor on Friday morning with a brief email asking for an extension on this assignment due to trouble at home, apologizing profusely. He only just got back to me with a no and a suggestion to see a therapist for my home troubles. He might have meant well with the suggestion, but I cannot help but feel a little ashamed.\n\nI'm worried I have lost good standing with him and I am worried I have offended him. I hope he does not think I lied. I don't know whether I should respond with an apology, but I don't know what to apologize for? \n\nAnyways, I may just be overthinking this... Pandemic stress... \n\nThank you for your time nonetheless.",

It's not disrespectful to ask when you have genuine need, as you clearly do. \n\nI missed a major course deadline in the first year of my PhD due to mental health issues and ended up with a C in the course; the instructor let me do \\[a significant quantity of\\] make-up work afterwards to get it into the B range. (I was thinking about fellowship apps, but if you aren't looking to apply for another degree or fellowship, it probably isn't worth the extra work for you and for the instructor.)  \n\nBut \u2013 if you find your grade is significantly impacted by this assignment and you have concerns about it for future goals, it may be worth reaching out with a little more info (you were caring for your sick grandparents) and asking whether there is other work you could do to make it up afterwards.",

      "text": "This sounds like a stressful situation, and I'm sorry that you are experiencing it.\n\nI can't speak for your specific professor, but I do not think it's likely that you harmed your good standing. In general, as long as you approach a request for an extension respectfully (e.g., it's not an indignant demand), you should be fine. A professor may not give an extension for a number of reasons (e.g., they do not believe it would be fair to other students who might also be struggling, they do not provide extensions except with a Dean's note, it was too short of notice, etc.), but it doesn't mean that they think ill of you for asking for one.\n\nMy advice to you is to do what you can to submit the best work you can today. Or, if the late penalty is relatively light (e.g., 10%) and you think having an extra day will help you to have a substantially better assignment, go ahead and take a penalty if you need to. It sucks when circumstances beyond your control affect your grade in a class. Ultimately, you can only do your best, and it is okay if your best today is not quite as good as your best under better circumstances. Good luck.",

      "text": "Also, as a professor and mental health professional (I'm a clinical psychologist, and teach psychology), I'm concerned about all the responses that say it's out of line for a professor to refer a student to counseling.  \n\n99% of faculty have no mental health training.  They can't be the students' therapists.  If they think there is something going on that is out of their league, it's appropriate (and best practice!) to refer the student politely and respectfully to a counselor.  This is not an insult.  In fact, acting like it's taboo to refer to counseling *increases the stigma around mental health support*.  Counseling should be a normalized part of coping with difficult situations - particularly in college where there's often a free or low-cost on-campus resource that's easy to access.",

              "text": "Absolutly, I'd like to add that people with mental health issues (not necessarily an illness but a lot of stress or stressful situations) often don't feel the need to see professional help and its not easy to realise this yourself. I think in a lot of cases hearing from someone else that this is something you should do makes it easier to consider this. Or if you just hear this from one close person you may think you don't need to but when you hear this from people not so close or even just several people you may realise that maybe others are right.\n\nI went to a mental health crisis when I did my apprenticeship in a very university similar environment. I was burnt out and had some personal issues going on and couldn't keep track of assignments and other work so I contacted my advisor and explained the situation and just asked if there is a way to make this work for me as I was almost finished and had good grades before. He referred me to the psychiatry department of the hospital I did the apprenticeship at and made sure I could soon get an appointment as part of staff gets faster appointments within days not months. Before I never even thought about professional help as I thought I could manage this myself. I am absolutely grateful he made this possible and referred me there so someone who is actually able to help me could help me cope with that instead of just pushing deadlines or saying no.",

      "text": "Here are my thoughts as a professor:  \n\nI am constantly trying to balance grace for extenuating circumstances with fairness to the students who are too afraid to ask for extension or who turn in work that isn't their best, because they honor deadlines.    \n\n\nI absolutely detest having to evaluate a student's circumstances.  What's \"bad enough\" for one student to need an extension might not be to another.  I don't think anyone should have to send out health info (and students do - both their own and others!).  I work at a school with a lot of first generation students, and their families often don't understand what college work looks like, and why their student is putting down boundaries.  I literally don't feel like it's my job to figure out what's \"bad enough,\" but I also need to have some semblance of deadlines for my own sanity.  \n\n\nFurthermore, research tells us that a professor (or other authority figure) will never be completely fair in granting extensions and grace.  We all have unconscious biases about race, gender, family situation, excuses, etc.  These biases may shape our responses in ways we're not even aware of.  \n\nFinally, I often find myself less willing to be flexible when I have my own stressors.  For example, I (the professor) had a death in the family the week before finals.  I scheduled myself time to grade everyone's papers before I went to the funeral.  So when  student asked for an extension, I literally did not know when I'd have time to grade it in a timely manner.  \n\n\nI say all of this to put another perspective here: professors are human.  Some are shitty people, some are great people, most are in between.  Their own lives will impact their responses.  The balance between fairness and grace often feels impossible for us - and most of us don't want to have to judge individual life circumstances.  It's rarely personal on a conscious level - I doubt your professor is angry at you as an individual, and no apology is necessary.  It's part of the job.  \n\n\nFinally, my institution recommends that we refer students to the counseling center because professors are not therapists (although I am a therapist on the side, I can't be my students' therapist!). Therapy can be a good and helpful thing, and your prof likely sees this as something he can't handle, so he's referring you to someone who can help you more.",

I would suggest doing your best and dealing with the late penalty, and discussing what to do in future with someone when this happens. There are ways you can tell a therapist or someone else the situation and have them provide support in your request for an extension. \n\nYou got this, don't stress, this happens far more often than you think, this hasn't impacted your profs opinion of you, and one assignment with a late penalty isn't going to matter much down the road.

I also support what someone else said, that then referring you on to therapy is actually a good thing because it means they're not trying to pretend they're equipped to handle this stuff and that they're not pretending it's not a real issue. It's valid, you're valid, and even if you unfortunately can't get an extension your prof sees that.\n\nTry your best to get it in as soon as you can, and your prof will see that as a good faith effort.

      "text": "I'm sorry that you're going through so many stressful things right now. I'm an instructor and PhD student, and honestly I have little respect for profs who show no compassion in the way they approach things like extensions. \n\nPeople justify super harsh/strict extensions policies with the idea that it's not fair for some students to get an extension, or that they need to prepare you for the \"real world\" by having inflexible deadlines. This kind of reasoning just doesn't hold up when you look beyond the surface.\n\nFor one, if a prof is truly concerned about fairness, they have to be willing to think in terms of equity, not just equality. It's a lot easier for a student to meet a deadline if they are neurotypical, able-bodied, don't have caregiving responsibilities, aren't living in poverty, etc. Is it really fair to deny another student an extension because they are overwhelmed with things like caregiving responsibilities? Different students are managing their class work through very different conditions, and so, in my mind, having some flexibility when it comes to offering extensions is the only equitable approach.\n\nThe idea that having inflexible deadlines better prepares students for jobs is also not really accurate. Sure, sometimes one will have a pretty hard deadline in jobs. But other times things will have more flexibility. A really important skill is being able to communicate with your team and employer. If a deadline isn't feasible, being able to discuss that and come up with a solution is the professional thing to do. And even if a worker has an important deadline coming up, sometimes an unforeseeable life crisis just happens and gets in the way; life and it's challenges don't get put on hold just because we have a class or a job. \n\nWhen instructors are so inflexible about things like extensions, it essentially punishes students for things outside of their control (from disability, to illness, to caregiving responsibilities, to family emergencies, etc.). And then the students end up beating themselves up and feeling like they are bad students and should be ashamed, when really it's the instructor who should be ashamed of their uncompassionate and inequitable approach. I encourage you not to internalize this as something you've done wrong. \n\nMy extension policy is just that students have to ask for an extension a day in advance (if possible; if an emergency comes up less than a day in advance we will navigate that as well). I do talk to students at the beginning of class about how sticking to deadlines is helpful when possible, because then their assignments will be more evenly spaced out. But if they decide they need an extension, it is always available if they ask, and I don't require them to tell me personal info to justify it. I have never had an issue with this policy. Each assignment, a few students (out of 30-40) will take an extension. It makes no difference to my marking, as it's not like I mark 40 papers all in a couple nights anyway. \n\nThe only time I can understand extensions not being possible is at the end of term, when an instructor has to have their marks in by a certain time and so they don't have leeway. In cases like this, I think instructors should make it clear to students ahead of time that this is the case. (And even then, in exceptional circumstances, institutions usually do have some processes to deal with situations like this. E.g., a student gets a grade of \"incomplete\" and has to submit all work by a certain hard deadline, otherwise the IN changes to an F or whatever grade the student has with the work that was submitted).\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you're in this difficult situation and weren't granted an extension. It's normal to struggle to keep up with school when you have a lot going on in your life (not to mention the world still being in the midst of a global pandemic). I know that doesn't help you to deal with the situation at hand really, but I hope it reassures you that you haven't done anything wrong and aren't a bad student.",

I realize it's hard to give out personal details, but if you had been more transparent you would have likely gotten the extension. \"Trouble at home\" doesn't tug on any heart strings, unfortunately. But based on what you have explained here your circumstances entirely warrant an extension. Taking care of family who rely on you, especially as an out of the ordinary situation, is very taxing and could easily put one behind in school. A professor who isn't a total jerk should definitely understand that.",

And there's a lot of reason such a request is the right thing to do, and he's responding perfunctorily.\n\nBut no, not only do you have no reason to apologize -- he does... he's fully off base here, and his comment was insensitive.\n\nMy response might sound uncharitable to the professor, but my view here is somewhat influenced by my knowledge of academia. Professors, at least with tenure, have virtually infinite discretion to consider things like extensions. And universities are not providing value and accommodation in line with COVID circumstances -- while determining students' futures, GPAs, etc. and being already inherently exploitative with high tuition prices. So in some respects, it's absolutely on students to push back right now, and these kinds of responses are unfortunate.",

Counseling can help with setting priorities, to understand and recalibrate when you\u2019re taking too much on, to adjust expectations for performance when everything is a priority, and to learn to set boundaries with others who put demands on you. Just saying this as a clinical psychologist, but also as the former grad student who tried to work, pursue doctorate, have 2 miscarriages and 1 full term pregnancy, have a newborn, and care for family member with cancer, have family member die of cancer, etc, all during first two years of my doctoral program. It was only when I started pulling over to the side of the road to cry over a B and, one time,  burst into tears over forgetting my fork for lunch, that I realized i needed counseling. It was just the lifeline I needed, for all the skills and lessons I mentioned earlier.  \n\nAnd my counselor was right, no one else has ever given a crap about that B I got.  Good luck to you, take it one semester or one week at a time, do your best rather than The Best, and know that you\u2019ll get there. I promise.",

      "text": "As a professor, I strongly value good communication in such situations. I don't mind granting extensions to students if they communicate ahead of time the need for an extension. Things happen in life, and any professor should be understanding of that. \n\nWhat bothers and annoys me is when students ask for extensions after the due date of the assignment (quite often, well after the deadline). It is simply unprofessional, regardless of what is going on personally. Writing a short email explaining the need takes no time at all. If any type of professional environment, not completing work by the deadlines without requesting an extension before it is expected to be completed would be unacceptable (and likely, a fireable offense). Since college is a professional environment, I believe this should be a basic standard of professional behavior in a course.",
