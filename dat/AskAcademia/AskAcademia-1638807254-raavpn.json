  "text": "My PhD defense is about 5 weeks from now and I'm really nervous that I'm not going to be prepared for it.\n\nI have been working part-time during my PhD and I just landed a full-time job. I quit my part-time job with my last day being 12 days from today, and then I start my new job the following week. I asked my new employer if it was possible to start after my defense but they said they prefer I start as soon as possible because they are quite busy and need to train me. They said they are happy to give me some days off prior to my defense to make sure I am prepared for it. I've been trying to find the time and energy to study when I'm not working but I'm worried that it will become more difficult once I start my new job. I'll pretty much only have evenings and weekends to study. My PI knows I work part-time and is aware that I've been looking for a full-time job since I was nearing the end of writing my dissertation. \n\nI'm really anxious that I'm going to be unprepared for my defense and fail. How likely is it to fail a PhD defense? Has anyone here worked full-time while preparing for a defense? Any advice or reassurances are welcome. Thanks!",

      "text": "I have never seen anyone failing a PhD defense. Once, a guy was working with a specific method for 5 years, so the committee asked him 'Who invented this method and when was that?' and his answer was simply \"I do not know\". It was also clear that his work had a pretty glaring fundamental flaw, both to me and to at least some of the committee members. That guy still passed.\n\nThe only failed defense I ever witnessed was a Bachelor student, who worked with a certain imaging method and admitted during the defense that he had altered his results in Photoshop. That was the straw that broke the camel's back as the rest of his work was also underwhelming.",

      "text": "The chances of failing a PhD defense, as many others mentioned, are extremely low.\n\nIt is normal to feel like preparing your defense means frantically \u201cstudying\u201d as many topics as possible to cover all possible questions, which makes it feel like there won\u2019t ever be enough time to prepare.\n\nThinking about my defense, the most effective preparation for me was focusing on the actual work I did and think about possible discussion threads that panel members can pick up on (not too different from what journal peer reviewers would do). Thinking about these topics in advance is likely to make you more comfortable discussing your work in a constructive way (and not an attack on the quality of your research). Most questions can be answered with a balanced combination of (1) reasons why certain choices made sense with information available, (2) acknowledging that there are alternative methods and/or interpretation of results, and (3) positioning questions/ideas as future work.\n\nI had my defense 6 month after I started a full-time industry job (in another country!). It does require effort to shift from the day-job mindset and get \u201cin the zone\u201d to focus on preparing your thesis. I\u2019d recommend doing it in a consistent and planned manner (by allocating a couple hours on evenings), and leveraging that flexibility that your employer is giving you.\n\nThere is no doubt that you are the expert in your work/thesis. The key here is practicing the discussion muscle and you will certainly feel confident about your defense.\n\nGood luck, it will be great and then you can fully focus on your next career chapter!",
