  "text": " I'm  at the tail end of 4 years into my PhD (in a field where 6.5 years is  the norm), and the last 2 years have been very unproductive from my end.  Not so unproductive that my committee has had an issue (I've never had a  bad committee meeting) but bad enough that my supervisor has raised  concerns multiple times.\n\nA  combination of mental health problems (depression, suicide attempt),  lack of support network, and of course, COVID, eventually eventually  lead to my supervisor suggesting I master out since November last year. I  felt that was drastic, and opted to take a short leave of  absence...which did WONDERS for my mental health but my productivity is  still not up to my supervisor's standards (e.g. he's been asking for  some figures for the last 3 months that I just...haven't gotten around  to).\n\nI've also been focusing on a  lot of things to wrap up datasets and what not, and still maintain a  positive outlook, but the main issue is that before my leave of absence,  my supervisor directly told me he would likely not write me a reference  upon graduation.\n\nI still want to  do my PhD, not for academia but because a lot of jobs I want require PhD  level experience (plus I'm 4 years in and I like my project!), but has  anyone had success with not having a reference?\n\nI should add, I made the huge, huge mistake of opening up to my  supervisor about some of my mental health issues (just the lighter,  depression related stuff) -- huge mistake.",

      "text": "First, I would say that, at least in my field (molecular biology), most PhD students get 90% of their data in the last year or two, so don't worry too much about it yet. \n\nAs for the letter, many non-academia work won't even ask for a letter from your advisor. Even if they do, you can explain your situation and get a letter instead from a committee member who knows you well. Same goes for getting a postdoc position, though that might be slightly more difficult. But an understanding postdoc advisor will probably be ok with it.",

      "text": "Agree to go to a committee member or collaborator.\n\nOnly advice I have is to not go into a rant about your advisor during interviews. We had one candidate treat the interview like a much needed therapy session. It did not go well.  \n\nIn postdoc PI asked to talk to advisor, there you can say that you had a falling out and be light on the details but more or less honest on the reason\n\nIndustry never asked for LOR",
