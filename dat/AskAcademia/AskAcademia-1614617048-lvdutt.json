  "text": "For those of you who left for the industry, how did you know it was time?\n\nI\u2019ve been on the market for like 5 years now. A dozen journal articles (about half first/sole authored), 50 or so conference papers, and a few book chapters. I was an instructor for 3 years, so I\u2019ve got a ton of teaching experience.\n\nI get a fair number of interviews. I used to get a fair number of visits. I\u2019ve literally never gotten an offer. (I think I\u2019m a decent enough person, but maybe I have horrific flaw nobody\u2019s ever told me about.)\n\nThis year was more of the same. 6 interviews, no visits, obviously no offers, and the candidates getting the jobs generally have much weaker CVs than mine.\n\nI just can\u2019t keep doing this. It\u2019s killing me.\n\nSo for those of you who got out (assuming you wanted in in the first place), how did you know it was time to give up on this stuff?",

              "text": "I'm not this person, but I do work in industry outside of academia, too. The answer really depends on the job that you have, because there are so many ways to scratch that itch.\n\nFor some jobs outside of academia you really can still teach in the classroom much like you would *in* academia, and sometimes can have affiliated roles as a professor at a nearby university. There are policy institutes/think tanks, nonprofits, and other kinds of agencies that have that setup with nearby academic institutions - sometimes for-profit companies have that too, where it serves their purposes. Usually you are teaching far fewer classes - think more one one per year, or one every few years, or maybe a small graduate seminar.\n\nThere's always adjuncting, and there are many jobs that will make room for you to adjunct one class a year or so (or where you can easily make your own room).\n\nI work in an industry role in which I am frequently teaching but rarely teaching in the formal sense. Lots of mentoring, lots of teaching new hires; I also conduct workshops on a variety of topics so I am often teaching in a sort-of traditional sense. It's pretty satisfying to me and I'm someone who loves teaching and was afraid I'd miss it a lot when I left. I also frequently get the opportunity to guest lecture in people's classes.\n\nThe same is true of a lot of other academic tasks, too. Since working in industry I have been on dissertation committees, advised student research project, served on grant panels, guest lectured in classrooms, given conference presentations and written book chapters and articles. I just do precisely as much of these things as I want since my career isn't dependent on any of it.",

Part of my job is reading stuff aloud to people who aren't very technologically literate. But there's also fantastic pay, good raises, and I get to feel like I'm legitimately impacting people's lives. I get to work in a way more collaborative environment than I did when I was still a grad student. I learn a lot in both in technical skills and soft skills. I'm given both the direction and opportunity to learn more and make an impact. I still get to teach classes and lead workshops on occasion. I still get to talk to some wicked smart people who've been in the industry for 10, 20, 30 years, with their own visions and occasionally awe-inspiring skills. \n\nThe bad manager thing resonates with me - having gained some industry management training and experience, it's kind of amazing to look back at academia and see how much variance there is in a professor's management ability. People leave bad managers, not bad companies, and there are plenty of bad managers in industry. But I've been lucky to have a good one, and if I had a bad one I would have way more freedom to leave and find something different than I did as a student.\n\nReally though, the financial freedom is the best part. I think I (and a lot of people in my generation) were attracted to academia due to the idea of tenure, working on whatever you want, and the stability of never losing your job. Not to ignore the specific things they enjoyed about teaching and research, but tenure is what drives a lot of hopeful academics. But with a good industry salary, it's honestly very freeing to have money to invest and to develop skills and a professional network that you feel confident you could leverage even if you leave and find a new job. You can live a bit better than you were as a student, but save a lot of money while doing so. My specific job may not be something I want to do for the next 10+ years, but it helped me build the confidence and a track record that could one day help me find something different.\n\nThere are definitely some perks to being in academia, but the lack of location flexibility both during your PhD and whenever you land a job, or \"fuzzy\" rules like not having set vacation times, are tough.",

      "text": "I don't know that there's ever a \"defining moment\", but the immense relief I felt when offered an industry position (I manage a core facility and one of our external customers approached me about it), was sort of a big flag to me that maybe I was barking up the wrong tree for a while now. I was very close to having a university offer, until COVID related budget concerns evaporated the position in April last year, but even there I was unsure as to me the \"fun\" of what I do was never in the \"grind out a bunch of grants\" part of the job, it was in the discovery, learning and teaching process, none of which necessarily go away in an industry gig.  Unfortunately there's no sort of established 'transition period\" to go from academia to industry, each of us has to figure things out our own way, but I was lucky to sample a number of potential positions in a life sciences business organization's mentorship program, where a local PhD in industry helped introduce me to a number of people for informational interviews; so I might suggest at least making some time to explore what alternatives exist, and identifying what sorts of core competencies you may have, that could help to clarify where to go from here. Best of luck, there are a lot of great opportunities out there, and don't let the harshness of the academic job market impact your self-esteem, it's a bit of a rigged system / pyramid scheme, unfortunately.",

Try to get some informational interviews about their experiences.  \n\nI also like to frame these decisions around 'things that invigorate me' and 'things that drain me'.  Once you get a sense of things from your informational interviews you can start to figure out how the shift might impact you.  I know a folks that were also able to get some consulting gigs, which let them try it out before committing to making the shift. \n\nLeaving academia was very bittersweet for me.  I think my dream would be to be an academic the way it worked in the early 90s or something, but when I look at my field today, I'm glad to be working in industry and just keeping a toe or two in academia in various ways.",

      "text": "No one says that with a PhD your only option is academia :). A faculty position isn't always what it's cracked up to be. There is a lot of pressure and much of what you end up doing isn't actually what you love doing (lots of faculty committees, chairing dissertations, grunt work that junior faculty are often asked to shoulder, etc.). I did a couple of years in a faculty role but decided to leave when I had my first child, after seeing so many female colleagues try to be a mom and a full time faculty member- almost all of them felt like they couldn't be successful in either role and it took a heavy emotional toll on them. Even before I became a mom I was stressed out and unhappy, so I decided to take a step back from academia and have a better work/life balance.  I've worked in a variety of other roles (medical education, senior project management, senior research scientist, etc.) and have been much happier. I've still been able to publish even in these other roles, which has been fun, and I've leveraged my teaching skills into leading workshops and doing corporate presentations. Honestly, leaving academia was the best decision for me, I don't regret it one bit.",

The lab was unfortunately  in super bad shape... It was a toxic environment that would definitely not lead me anywhere, but it provided me tons of time to apply and work as part-time interns. I'm sure academic isn't like this but I was pretty much done of it. So when I got an opportunity to apply for industry jobs I started right away. And don't feel discouraged. I applied for almost 300 jobs and didn't get a single phone interview in my first year. In my second year of trying, I got around 10 final rounds of interviews in the pandemic before I finally got two offers in the end. It's definitely painful, desperate, and any negative word you can think of, but you'll get there.\n\nInformational interviews are helpful. But please please please never say or even think someone's CV is worse than yours. That would just leave you in a position where you really need to think what happened on your other performances. Sometimes it's not really about how smart or how good you are, but how much I want to work with you as a teammate/colleague.",

Sometimes (often) in my experience, the people with the most killer CVs in terms of metrics can also be the most competitive and least collegial. They often interview as very self-centred and not as team players who are looking to uplift the institution.\n\nI\u2019d rather a fellow faculty member with less \u201cpoints\u201d but who can help sort out thorny student issues, be a good mentor, serve thoughtfully on committees, be a great and considerate teacher, and step in and help out their colleagues. \n\nDepends on the institution. Some institutions prefer someone with a bazillion publications who is laser-focused on their research dollars, their lab space, etc., but, those are usually only the top research universities and even those kinds of positions are few and far between.",

Academia operates on the premise of \"just stick it out a while longer and you'll get the big (TT) payoff\", so the act of cutting short ones losses and moving on seems pretty spot on to me.",
