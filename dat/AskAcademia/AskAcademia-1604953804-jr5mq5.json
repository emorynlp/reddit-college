  "title:": "Choosing a postdoc lab - some important lessons",
  "text": "Hi! \n\nI posted this at r/GradSchool subreddit. I wanted to post here too because I see many people looking for some advice. I also asked similar questions here before. So perhaps others may want to share their experience too if they'd like to do it. \n\nSo my story is that I'm a recent PhD graduate and I like my research field. I didn't have to think of other details so much when I started PhD because I had rotations, I decided on the group based on my experience over there. So in my first postdoc, I didn't care about the lab or PI that much. 2 months after joining the lab, we started to have funding problems. My research interest wasn't her/his priority, I was laid off. I wasn't happy and planning to leave already but it costed me lot of time. Nobody told me these things before, If I knew and had more experience in job search I would be more careful. What I learned that you need to:\n\n* Look into the previous postdocs - Are they all listed on the website? Where did they go? Is there a way to reach them out? Learn about their stories\n\n* Interactions in the lab - Is it a cooperative place? Is everything involving around certain members of the lab? Are they patronizing or controlling the lab? \n\n* Is it a scholarship? Do you have rights? \n\n* You like the project and field but is it the main interest of the lab? Do they have expertise in the field? \n\n* Is the PI too hands off or hands on? Is he/she a good mentor or manager? The institute may have reputation but are there any recruiting related problems or scandals? \n\n* Did they manage to publish? How long it takes to finish a PhD or postdoc project in that lab? \n\n* When you talk to the lab members, they can't be very frank, so I would try to visit the lab for sure and observe the atmosphere for myself\n\n* How did they handle the situation during COVID19 pandemic? \n\nBe careful about red flags and don't ignore the problems! Don't tell that it's personal, I would be different or I could survive. You might be into the project, it doesn't mean everything. The mentorship record of PI is very important. \n\nGood luck to everyone",

They can be a little more open in such a setting.  However, I'm not sure how that is accomplished now. \n\nI had a friend interviewing with a big deal PI and another post-doc took her on a tour of the labs.  At one point, she pulled her into a side room, closed the door and said, whatever you do, do not come to work here, it is horrible, and then she walked back out and carried on the tour like normal.",

So, as someone who interviewed at 2 labs earlier this year, one of which was a 3/10 and the other of which was an 11/10....\n\nDefinitely ask the lab members things. How do they like the area? How do they like the department? What is the PI like? Are they enjoying their PhD? You\u2019ll likely get roundabout questions, but you can tell from body language and the way they answer questions. Comparison between two labs when asked what the advisor is like:\n\nLab 1: Oh, she\u2019s my favorite human!!!!! She\u2019s a great mentor and is doing her best to get us to finish within 5 years. And the class she teaches is just so fun and you learn so much from it!!\n\nLab 2: She\u2019s nice. You kind of have to have...thick skin...to work with her? Be able to stand up for yourself...But she\u2019s a good advisor, I like her.\n\nAlso, IDK if this is something postdocs can do but try to get a feel of what other people in the department think of the PI. I remember during Lab 2\u2019s interview process the head of the department spent our 20 minute interview telling me to think about whether I would be a good fit for this lab, because the advisor is a great colleague but is very critical, and (again) you have to have thick skin to work with her. I noped out *so* fast.",

Also, I have some more exploratory ideas with what I am doing. \n\nYou should start by identifying fellowships you can apply for.  This is exactly the intent of fellowships: you write up your own proposal for postdoctoral work, and then (if successful) you do it.  They are very competitive, though, so if you can't get one that's totally fine, you can look for the equivalent in a postdoc job once you are a bit more experienced.\n\nIn postdoc interviews you should ask if you'd be able to start up some small proof-of-concept projects and/or if they'd be willing to supprot you writing a fellowship application.  However, make sure it's clear that you understand that you need to contribute to the group/project first and then spin off afterwards.  Nobody wants to spend their hard-earned grant income on someone who's going to immediately use all of their time trying to get money to do something else.\n\n> Even if I do postdoc at another research group I would like to write proposals with my old advisor too. \n\nYou might want to get a few more opinions about this before you do it.  That might be taken as a sign that you were not an independent researcher, but that you were still being directed by your supervisor.  In fact, some fellowships even require that you have published work *without* your old advisor, to demonstrate that you're capable on your own without their help.",

      "text": "You mentioned in your post that rotation helped at the time of your Ph.D. I would like to know how? Grad schools came up with the concept of rotation so that the incoming new students during their first year can meet up with new potential thesis advisors, work with them and so that both the PI and the student will have the time and opportunity to get to know each other better. But in practice actually, the student traces down potential thesis advisor even before he applies to the program and then applies for admission and after receiving the admission confirmation he goes on to visit the school and the lab and meets up with the group and also enquires about the advisor. So pretty much the entire concept of lab rotation fails, but yeah rotation helps you witness the work culture of the lab, meet the group, get a first-hand experience of the research that goes on in the lab, and different techniques used in the lab. But also the student never really gets to work closely or even work with the advisor in practice, best case scenario- he can end up working with the postdocs of the lab and the biggest disadvantage of lab rotation is that it's like fast dating with the advisor and the research group and at least in the first year of the Ph.D. we don't really have the kind of awareness or maturity and experience to ask the right questions about a research group and the advisor and perform careful analysis and then choose. someone can actually point out to me the advantages of lab rotation, I would be grateful. the points which you have put forth actually are useful and I believe both the PhD students and postdocs should ask these questions before signing up. You do actually asl as many questions as possible about the advisor and the lab with the current students of the lab, but I will be blatantly frank here, \n\nAT THE END OF DAY FINDING A GOOD OR RIGHT ADVISOR AND RIGHT RESEARCH GROUP AT  YOUR GRAD SCHOOL ACTUALLY IS SHEER LUCK AND ONE CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT IT. whether it's lab rotation or even talking to current students, they may help but to a very limited extent, finding the right thesis advisor is completely your fate. This is my opinion after having finished my postdoc and currently trying for a tenure track position. thank you",
