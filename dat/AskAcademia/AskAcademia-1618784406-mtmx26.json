  "text": "I'm a super lost grad student and any advice, wisdom, solidarity anything of that sort is appreciated.\n\nI started my PhD on fall 2019, right after finishing my bachelor's. I worked so hard for it and was incredibly happy and enthusiastic about starting grad school. I've changed continents, leaving everything behind to start a new chapter in the States. A semester later, my mental health crashed completely. Pandemic started around the same time my long term relationship ended, and I was already struggling before then. Moving from a metropolis to a small midwestern town or being pretty much the only non-native English speaker in an incredibly homogenous white-American program (to my surprise), was harder than I thought. Coming from a (almost) failing country, the constant stress and worry about the people and things I've left behind was also hard. And the cherry on top, I'm not the resilient type, I've struggled with mental health all my adult life. I  guess all of these things and the regular stress of the PhD was just too much for me to handle.\n\nIn my second semester, soon after the lockdown, my mental health just crashed. I dropped everything in the last three weeks of the semester and just took incompletes. I spent the summer just trying to get better and failing miserably. I ended up getting hospitalized in fall 2020. I couldn't do anything that semester, except for completing some of the incompletes I had. I'm still trying to pick up the pieces without actually feeling that much better. This semester, I was able to attend to classes, just doing the bare minimum with pretty much no research done and thank god I didn't have to teach.\n\nI'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist at my uni's health center and I'm on medication. Obviously I'd be worse without those things, but I feel like it is much less than what I need. Unfortunately accessing specialized/intensive health care I need is incredibly hard and pretty much financially impossible right now (I'm still in debt from my hospitalization).  I have almost no friends where I live. I couldn't really click with my cohort (cultural differences, clique culture etc.) and I didn't really have much time to socialize anyways due to pandemic. I have good friends though, and they are my main support. But all of them are scattered around the world, living in different time zones. I thought about going back to my own country and maybe take a break, just eating homemade food, chilling with the fam. But losing my visa was a risk and too much fam time is just not good for my mental health anyways, so I just decided against it.\n\nMy advisor has been really understanding during all of this but I know his (and the faculty's) patience is running.  I was told to get back on track asap or there would be consequences (possibly getting kicked out).\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm just sick or if I'm just not cut out for this.  Whenever I check online PhD circles I see that most of the people are  worried about not being productive for a week or answering emails late, while just attending an 30 min zoom lecture is a great challenge for me. I know each to their own, but I can't help feeling like an utter failure compared to my peers. I feel like I fucked this PhD up, ruined any potential I had in my uni and in my field. I feel like I've created a reputation of problem-person and it's irreparable.  I know some of it is me over-catastrophizing, but I also think there is some truth to it and academia is not all-forgiving.  I have overcome rough patches before and turned things around but I can't seem to find a light with this one yet.\n\nApart from my mental health, I just feel disillusioned with grad school, academia and myself. I guess the past year made me realize how unsatisfying it is to produce research on some theoretical stem stuff that has 0 effect on people's lives. How hard it is to establish non-superficial, supportive relationships in grad school. All my close friends (whom I met way before grad school) are in grad school and we're all on antidepressants, we all struggle with similar stuff . This makes me think, okay, this shit is hard and everyone is struggling. But despite this shared struggle, the disconnection in grad school, or at least at where I am, is incredibly isolating. I used to have some level of confidence in myself not only about academic stuff, but also when it comes to surviving and picking myself up. This past year made me lose all of that.\n\nAnd yes, I know that the world out there is so much bigger than grad school and maybe this is simply not my thing. I thought I loved science but maybe I'm not a person to make a career out of it. But realistically speaking, I have no other professional aspirations and grad school may be my only chance (at least in the foreseeable future) at living in a (relatively) stable and free country.\n\nI guess I just want to hear from people who are experiencing or have experienced similar things. If you have overcome it,  what helped you, what do you think about those times when you look back? If you are experiencing similar things, I'm sorry. But maybe we need to know that we are not alone.",

      "text": "You deserve some kudos, friend. You moved continents, got out of a relationship, started a PhD program, and now you are depressed? Give yourself a break!\n\nHere is what has helped me: make a list of crap you want done tomorrow. Think about how you feel, and what you think is reasonable for you to accomplish tomorrow. If you are too depressed - leave it blank! Take the day off! You are caring for yourself that day. It's a \"me\" day.\n\nStart adding to the list when you can, but make sure you don't push too hard. If you find that you can't complete your daily list, reel it back a bit. At the end of each day, cross off all of the things you did, and congratulate yourself for each one. If you cross off everything on your list - crumple up that thing and throw it in the garbage like the champion you are. \n\nNotice that your \"peers\" are not on that list. What they do on their time is their (and unfortunately everyone's) business. Comparison is the thief of joy - focus on your list. \n\nWhen it comes time to be evaluated in whatever way your program has planned, think about your list. If you have been completing all of your list-tasks, you are in good shape! You have pushed yourself as much as you feel comfortable - and what will be, will be.",

      "text": "So other than the first comment here, everyone is getting downvoted and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m gonna throw my process in here and you can take what you think might work for you and leave what won\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m in the last year or so of my psychology PhD and I\u2019ve struggled on and off with anxiety, depression, and productivity issues during that time. It hit especially hard when the pandemic started, which I think is true for most of us. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re also going through this. It\u2019s common, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier. Here\u2019s some advice based on what I\u2019ve done: \n\nOn quitting: the world outside of academia is huge and academia itself is not very forgiving. There is no shame in leaving grad school; it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. If you can make it through the masters (assuming your program gets you one on the way to the PhD), then mastering out can be a viable career option. A masters in many fields will give you skills you can market elsewhere (e.g., a lot of people from my program master out to be corporate statisticians). If you want to finish the whole thing, go for it! However I want you to know there are many options outside of academia for most fields. I know you said grad school may be the only way for you to stay in a stable place, so that\u2019s also important to consider, but I find it comforting to remind myself that quitting is an ok option, even if I don\u2019t plan to quit. It helps reduce the catastrophic thoughts that anxiety can bring about. \n\nHere are some mental health and productivity tips I use to make it through my work. I hope they\u2019re helpful: \n\n1. Minimum physical health is more important to your mental health than you think. Take a multivitamin. Eat at least a couple kinds of vegetables and at least one good source of protein every day. Drink at least eight glasses of water. Find a physical exercise that you like (DownDog is a yoga app that\u2019s free for students, Boostcamp is a workout app that\u2019s free for everyone, C25K is similar, your school might have free classes through the rec center). Get at least 8 hours of sleep most nights. Shower and brush your teeth. All of that sounds obvious, but it\u2019s so easy to neglect your physical health during grad school, and it just makes things worse. I\u2019ve been there. \n\n2. Mental health exercises are also important. You said you\u2019re in therapy, and that\u2019s fantastic! Other things I\u2019ve found helpful are meditating (Insight Timer is a free app that I use) and using Sanvello (another free app that specializes in teaching coping skills for anxiety and depression issues). I also journal periodically, which I find helpful. \n\n3. Your support system is one of the most important things you can give yourself. I know you said you don\u2019t really click with those in your program, and that\u2019s ok. Consider actively trying to build support elsewhere though. I personally call my family once every week or two. Also consider joining a campus student group that centers around one of your interests. I joined the swing dancing group on campus and I can\u2019t tell you how important it\u2019s been for me to have people around who aren\u2019t connected with my work. I highly recommend it if it\u2019s possible for you. \n\n4. Set a reason for yourself to get up. Even if it\u2019s just that you HAVE to take care of your houseplant or it\u2019ll die, make something dependent on you getting up and moving. \n\n5. Set a to-do list and dump EVERYTHING you need to do into it. Mine includes my research writing and teaching stuff, but also includes going on a run and texting my brother. Set deadlines for yourself and reward yourself when you accomplish something. I make myself a fancy cup of tea. I like the Todoist app for this. \n\n6. Last but not least, remind yourself that the minimum is enough. Do everything you can, but understand that sometimes you won\u2019t be able to read everything or get that assignment perfect, and that\u2019s ok. If they haven\u2019t kicked you out, you\u2019re still in. Do what you can and try to remind yourself that you\u2019re here for a reason. Getting 5% done is better than getting nothing done, and generally getting 80% done is secretly enough for you to get by. Just do your best one day at a time. \n\nI hope some of that is helpful!",

I've tried some of these things but I always struggled with consistency. I know how effective they can be with persistence but I guess I have trouble dictating that to my lizard brain. Still, it helps to be reminded of these things over and over again. Mastering out is not an option for me unfortunately but still, the things I've learned in grad school can be viable skills for other job opportunities. \"I find it comforting to remind myself that quitting is an ok option, even if I don\u2019t plan to quit\", I need to be more mindful of this.",

      "text": "I resonate with so much of what you're saying, especially that between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place aspect you briefly mentioned of not wanting to go back to family nor stay in academia because it's not what it's cracked up to be. For me, the solution was leaving both and becoming financially independent while away from my family (I'm not saying that's right for you). The country I was born in is crumbling as we speak, so I get that too. My friends have all become disillusioned with academia and struggled to fit in with peers as well. \n\nThe isolation can be helped by holding onto your old friends. Try to find communities you can join based on your culture online for the time being and see if that helps. Go out for walks and once a day remind yourself of a moment in the past when you were effortlessly happy (try to remember a different one every day). Put your health first, no matter what, and do what makes you feel better. If your health suffers, so will everything else.\n\nPS. Search \"depressed\", \"disappointed\" or \"disillusioned\" in this sub and see the sheer number of posts very similar to this one. You are definitely not alone, for better or worse.",

I'm an open-minded person and I was pretty sure, white or not, most of he grad folks would be the same. But I guess I was unconsciously assuming the grad school would more diverse. And I can't say that my cohort are explicitly discriminatory or anything like that. But there have been times where I have been ditched by the whole group when we went out together or I haven't been invited to departmental events or stuff like that. Maybe it was due to a lack of communication. I'm not coming from a culture where you just join other people's plans so maybe they just expected me to involve myself and I didn't realize that. One time I was introduced to another faculty member as \"X(my nationality) girl\" jokingly (not my name, position or research interests) and that was pretty annoying, lol. I don't know if it's me being overly sensitive or not, but I've realized that when I'm in an diverse environment or when I'm communicating with people who had experienced more diversity in their lives, everything is just so much easier. For example, they don't expect me to know extremely specific American cultural references and usually we can talk about topics that could be relevant to every one in the group. But you are right, I can and should try to find other people outside of my program. Hopefully, after picking myself up a bit.",

I try and do around 3 hours of research spread throughout the day while just finishing up homework as part of my coursework. \n\nWhen I get hit by a wave of guilt, sadness and a bunch of other shitty feelings, I go out for a longish walk and just take in the fresh air while listening to some soft calming music. \n\nI'm guessing the pandemic has prevented you from working/studying alongside people who are also doing the same. I'm sure you'll be able to do a lot better once this is possible. \n\nBut then again, I've not been in grad school long enough to make any concrete statements.",

I am also trying to find people with whom I can be myself; this has been hard for the same reasons you mentioned, but I found some friends here, which made a huge difference.\n\nHave you considered transferring to another program or leaving with a master's degree (if that's an option), taking some time off, and re-applying to grad school, if you want to give it another try? This might be not an easy path, but I just wanted to say that things do not have to be the way they are and that you can change them now that you know more about yourself and what you need to do well.",

      "text": "Maybe consider finding a new grad program? The first grad school I went to (starting a STEM PhD program after working a few years with my BS) did not work out for me. I did not click with many other grad students and did not like the small, southern town. I got very depressed.  \nI started looking around online for different programs in areas where I might be happier. Since I now knew what I DIDN'T want in a grad program, I was able to be a little bit more selective about the places I looked at.\nI ended up moving to a new grad program with a completely different research focus (same field, though).  While my grad school experience was not all roses and sunshine (whose is?) I did make many lifelong friends, successfully defended my dissertation, and have been a professor for over 10 years.\nSometimes, it is okay to say \"this isn't working out\" and find a different path. For you, OP, maybe that different path is a different grad school, a different program, or maybe just getting out of grad school.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, I wish you the best of luck!",

Also, my research topics were very niche and the program I'm in was an exceptionally rare fit. My PI is super nice so far, too. I actually spent sometime in Seattle and with people who were grad students there. Even though they hated their programs and PIs, I've realized I was having such a better time with the people and in the city.

      "text": "Hey there, some other people have said some really helpful things, but I\u2019l try a different angle. \n\nFirst, grad school SUCKS. I made it through. I was absolutely miserable for my first 2 years, because of people, not academics. And I\u2019ll be completely honest that the hardest part of it was NOT the school work, but the games, politics, lack of compassion, competition, professors hitting on me, etc. About year 3, I started to feel better, like I belonged, like I had value to add, like I could hold my own. \n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t find the community I wanted, I created it. I became president of the grad student association and tried to make a better place for others, because God knows the system I was handled SUCKED OUT LOUD. Not everyone can do that. I\u2019m a social butterfly. But maybe that\u2019s a way to say that you can find/create your own place. You are not the first person to feel these things, and I think most grad students do. My counseling center formed a good group, for example, and you might check there for an international student support group, etc. These can be a godsend. Or Facebook groups for international students. Or even just volunteering to tutor undergrads. \n\nSecond, I went for humor when I was miserable.  Someone showed me this \u201cGraduate School: The Game\u201d write-up, and I decided I\u2019d make a bingo game out of it. Damned if I didn\u2019t check almost every box. http://www.obereed.net/hh/game.html. Honestly, just being able to poke fun at my misery helped so much. \n\nAnd here\u2019s an international student version of the same, if it helps: https://elikoch.medium.com/u-s-graduate-school-the-game-pandemic-international-student-nightmare-mode-5e30bcd16144. \n\nGraduate school is brutal. And you\u2019re starting it during a pandemic, while away from your home, and in one of the most repressive places in the US. It\u2019s ok to be gentle with yourself. It\u2019s ok to settle for Bs (the default bad grade), or incompletes you finish off later. It\u2019s ok to take a semester off. Just because you\u2019re struggling doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not cut out for this. You\u2019re very thoughtful, open, and clearly very smart, and if you can take some pressure off of yourself, it might help you feel better. It\u2019s normal to be miserable at first.

      "text": "I definitely relate.  Having come out the other side and entered academia, only to decide to leave for research after 2 institutions (one positive, one negative) I do encourage people who have doubts during their PhD to really consider them.  \n\n\nA lot of people think an incomplete PhD is a waste of time or a bad thing.  It isn\u2019t.  It is a few years of genuine work experience as well as exposure to the field.  I\u2019m telling you that academia has changed, universities have changed, and getting out before you feel even more trapped (\u201cI got this PhD, so I have to use it!\u201d) isn\u2019t a bad lesson at all.\n\n\nFirst, stop shaming yourself.  Instead of asking why you\u2019re not doing the PhD the correct way, ask if the PhD is correct for you. Are you disillusioned because this PhD isn\u2019t leading in a direction you wanna go in? If so, it\u2019s OK to cut your losses and leave. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. It is not a waste of time.  \n\n\nYou have SIX paragraphs of self-judgment before you get to the actual problem: a large part of you is telling you that you don\u2019t want to focus on this research and you don\u2019t like what you\u2019ve learned about academia as a profession.  Of course you\u2019re having trouble!!!!  You are feeling like a failure, but your body is telling you in any way it can that this is the wrong path. Your psyche is telling you that you don\u2019t want to do this, but leaving is something that feels like quitting.  It isn\u2019t.  \n\n\nJust because you haven\u2019t figured out what your next step could be doesn\u2019t mean that this is the only option available to you. Especially as you are working to get your mental health back together, working any other job (even retail, as horrible as that is) would be better than trying to push yourself in a direction that you don\u2019t want to go in.  **You are fighting yourself every step of the way and feeling more and more like a failure.**  Stop fighting, and stop seeing the CHOICE to leave academia as a failure.  \n\n\nTrust me - I would have been in a much better physical (I worked myself into medical problems) and financial (if I had done the \u201csilly\u201d idea I\u2019d wanted to do back then, I\u2019d be racking it in) position if I\u2019d listened to my gut.",

      "text": "I have dealt with mental health issues for more than half my life. There have been many ups and downs throughout those years. I can definitely say that covid has amplified many of the ancillary struggles that arise from my mental health issues. \n\nThis is a tough time for everyone, for those with pre-existing mental health conditions it can be so much worse.\n\nI started my grad in the fall last year (so I'm finishing my first year now). I have found in particular this last term has been exceptionally hard. I feel very bad for the UG students I TA, knowing they have to juggle 5 courses. I don't think I could do it.\n\nI'm not sure where you are going to school, but if you are somewhere with a winter, this has almost made things harder for you, particularly if you come from somewhere without one. Keep in mind that warmer weather and longer days are on their way.\n\nI'm a native to my country, of the ethnic majority, , so I can't speak to that aspect, but I can tell you that being a native has not changed how isolating this experience has been. You are not alone in how alone you feel. The nature of lockdowns often means even seeing people very close to you is not an option. Living by yourself can mean going through long stretches with seeing essentially no one.\n\nIf I can speak a bit to what I do to help me with my struggles: having a hobby you enjoy is essential. Something that takes practice with gradual skill improvement works best for me. When I struggle to motivate myself to do work, I can sit down and play piano for a few hours. The fact that I'm engaged with something on an intellectual level, and that I can see myself gradually improve reminds me that sometimes the long game is what you are aiming for. The fact that I enjoy it helps distract me from whatever is currently bringing me down.\n\nNature is highly important to me as well. Many times social interaction is too much, but just going out and breathing fresh air, seeing trees and hearing birds can really help ground me. The exercise is also a big boost. Many of the negative feedback loops with mental health will keep you in a bad spot. Not doing anything leads to not eating leads to having no energy, leads to not doing anything. You throw on the guilt for all that and you can see how it spirals dangerously quick.\n\nMedication and therapy is a very long game. It is also not a magic cure-all unfortunately. I find particularly that medication is more about handling the most extreme aspects, (for me night terrors and suicidality). Therapy is what ultimately helps me more on a fundamental level. This is highly individual though.\n\nHaving small goals and building up on them helps me build momentum. When I get really low, I'll start by making sure every day I eat shower and go outside. As I get that under control, I add work to my list in a way I can manage. When I can't do anything I don't get mad at myself, I try to imagine myself as a friend. There's no anger, there's just hope that next time I will, and encouragement that I'll make it through it. Managing my expectations is a big thing.\n\nI don't know if any of that helps you at all, if anything it helped me step back a bit. I hope that you know that you are not alone. Keep strong. Keep seeking help and community (in a safe manner). There are many people who care, even without knowing you. The fact that you are where you are speaks a lot to your capabilities as a human. Be proud of that. I wish you all the luck and love. You are stronger than you give yourself credit.",

I've known people who have quit and who have mastered out. There's no shame in that. So OP take it slow and steady, take care of yourself and just take it day by day. Things will work out.",

Whenever I don't feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to, and see work pile up, I feel like I'm a failure and question my ability to proceed. I find the guilt becomes a trigger for a lot of other things and it just grows and grows off itself. All of the advice here about keeping in mind that quitting is not failing are really good. I think honestly the biggest stigma will come from people with no experience in grad school. Many of my grad friends (and I) agree that it is not for everyone, and that forcing a bad fit (for whatever reason) is less intelligent than trying something else. \n\nThis is what I meant about managing my expectations. Sometimes all I can muster is the energy to move from my bed to my computer to watch random YouTube. That's okay. If I had a friend struggling with mental illness and they told me this, I wouldn't think they are a failure. Trying to keep that perspective reminds me to not be so hard on myself when this happens. This is obviously much easier said than done.\n\nWhen I notice I hit these points, I add showering and having *something* to eat (as these are things that I struggle with while episodic) to a daily list and put all my energy into that. I congratulate myself when I do. It's no small feat to face a mountain you can't see the peak of, and continue to climb. This becomes something I try to ramp up over whatever time frame I find I can handle. Sometimes this is a very slow process too, but the persistence is key.\n\nIf I can share a clip from Bojack Horseman (one of my favorite shows and probably one of the best depictions of mental illness on TV) https://youtu.be/hRcWl8k6WQU",

      "text": "I'm experiencing a lot of the same thing. I moved countries to start my PhD which I had some interest in, but in actuality it was mainly for the visa. I did this all in the middle of the pandemic, to a country where I barely spoke the language (although I am a native English speaker so that was somewhat helpful). I thought I could push through for a few years to finish, since I moved to join my boyfriend in his home country, but as the restrictions continued and immigration caused many problems, it took a toll on my mental health. Honestly, just the other day I decided to quit my PhD. It wasn't fulfilling and was actually worsening my mental health, as I took a severe hit to my self confidence due to horrible supervisors. That was the best thing for me, to have a purpose (finding a job) and being free of cruel supervisors. Even if you do like your topic, it might be best for your mental health to quit and take a break, find a job that could get you a visa (with some PhD experience you are already higher in the job market). Then revisit your PhD later when you are better and circumstances surrounding you enable you to have your freedoms. It's very isolating being in another country with a lot of the negativity a PhD program can have. Especially going from a city to rural (which is also what I did). It's difficult, it's hard, and sometimes you just need to find your support system. Maybe you can go home and live with friends or family for just a little while you gather yourself, find what you want to do, and make steps towards that goal? Or stick it out with the PhD a few months longer while you look for another job?",

But I also have severe depression which has been incredibly exasperated by moving North where there's less sunlight and social isolation from being in a cohort of one. \n\nSpeaking of, if you're living in a further north place with less sunlight than you're used to that could be a huge influence on your mental health. Do you feel any better in the summer months? It might be more than just the decreased stress. Invest in a sunlamp, sit under it for at least 20 minutes every day, and add vitamin D3 to your regimen. Sunlamps can get expensive but even a cheap dinky one is better than nothing. \n\nFind a daily routine, starting with a consistent morning routine. Hyper-scheduling your day down to the last minute (as in everything you do goes on the schedule) can be really helpful here. \n\nGive yourself time off, even if you don't think you have time for it. Take a half hour break every couple of hours (I use pomodoro timing and you're so focused while working that you make up for any productivity lost during the break). Take one day off a week entirely. Even if you don't think you have time for it, you'll make up for the lost work time in the form of higher productivity when you're less stressed. I cannot stress mandating breaks for yourself enough. \n\nReject the culture of competition in academia over who works the most hours. There's a culture in academia that the longer hours you work, the better your work is, and that's really just not necessarily true. Academia creates such an unhealthy atmosphere around this and comparing how busy you are to other people will never end well. Most people are exaggerating how many hours of productivity they have each day, anyway. \n\nIf your uni has a dedicated graduate school or grad school dean either in your department or grad school at large, make an appointment to talk to someone about your options. They might know a way around the visa issue if you need to take an extended medical LOA. Our university has a school-wide \"Dean of students\" office whose entire job is to help you navigate the bureaucracy of the university when things come up. They've seen this many times before, promise. \n\nExercise and drink water. I use the FitON app which is full of free 15-20 minutes exercise videos. I also find swimming and running to be meditative when I can get up the motivation to do it. I know everyone else has said this, but it's so important. \n\nI'm also in the midwest. If we're at the same place we can meet up for a socially distanced coffee. Even just talking to another person for an hour can be helpful and strangers carry no judgment. \ud83d\ude42 DM me if you want.",

      "text": "I can relate to some extent, as I also ended a long-term relationship during my first semester of grad school, and felt pretty depressed as a result (I also moved to a small midwestern town for my Ph.D.). \n\nThe first year was the most isolating since I didn't have good friends in town. I imagine with the pandemic the situation would be a lot worse. \n\nOn the bright side, I can tell you that for me years 2-3 were a lot better when I made new friends in my department (as well as outside it). \n\nI struggled the most at the start, especially due to the loneliness/relationship issues. After that things went a lot better, although I still was depressed from time to time about not finding a good romantic partner. \n\nAfter I finishing my Ph.D., I ended up meeting the right person right away and got married soon after. In retrospect I wish I had been able to focus more on the Ph.D. and my research, instead of wasting so much time being depressed (easier said than done!) Honestly I snapped out of any depression pretty quickly once I finished the Ph.D. \n\nSo I dunno, I'm not a mental health expert, so it's good you're seeing professional help for these issues. My advice from my personal story, though, is to enjoy making friends and enjoy your studies as much as possible. Also, later, try attending conferences, meeting people outside the department, taking up new hobbies where you can meet people, etc. \n\nFor now I would say to not beat yourself up too much, and trust that things will work out later on, especially post-pandemic. For now I'd say to get some exercise to improve your mood and get psyched up about your work and remember why you were excited about the academic stuff in the first place. The relationships with other people will come, just takes time.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Your mental health sounds like it has degraded to a point where you both can\u2019t come out of this with what you\u2019re currently doing, and you also aren\u2019t being productive. I don\u2019t think you should quit your PhD, but I highly recommend taking a leave of absence for a few months or even up to a year. You need to allow your mental health to recover, and there\u2019s only so much understanding an administration could support. I hope you feel better soon. I have personally struggled with mental illness in my early 20s and even during this pandemic, also in the middle of a PhD. Just remember, you have been okay before, you\u2019ll be okay again, even though it may not feel like it.",

You have way too much at risk to allow yourself to fail , now. Because you\u2019re depressed. \nYou might think I\u2019m just saying this. \nBut trust me when I tell you that you CAN endure anything and get through it to reach your goals. You kinda have to actually. \nI think if you allow yourself to continue to fail and neglect your program you will regret it for the rest of your life.... but if you decide to get over it and be sad when your done with school ( you can be sad anytime and despite what you think, you DONT HAVE to allow depression to take your life away from you ) \nThe only thing that stops depression from stealing everything from you- is action. Get into action. Just do it. Just keep on keeping on. No matter what. \nIt\u2019s just feelings. Feelings don\u2019t kill you. No one ever died from a feeling. \nBut as soon as those feelings become reasons to quit or to fail ? Then they might kill you. \nYou can do this. \nJust keep doing it. Easy.",
