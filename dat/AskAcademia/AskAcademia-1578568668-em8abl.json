He asked me if I had experience with a particular procedure and I said no but I'm eager to learn new things.\n\nHe then asked me why I applied for a job I wasn't qualified for.\n\nI pointed out that my skills and experience were in black and white on the resume in front of him, so why would he interview a person without the experience he's looking for?\n\nThings went downhill from there. We exchanged some snark and eventually I burst into tears of frustration as I'd been on dozens of interviews over the past several months, as, as it seemed, a quota filler.\n\nI snapped, \"if you have no intention of hiring me, just tell me right now so I can go home and go back to bed.\"\n\nHe ended up hiring me \ud83e\udd37 I was his research assistant until he retired.",

Not an interview but once at a conference someone asked about this telescope collaboration's papers that didn't agree with my theoretical models. \n\nAnd I went into this long spiel about how their data was good and it does agree they are just misinterpreting/misunderstanding the data. I drew a diagram on the board showing how they screwed up said, \"The paper on this is coming soon! Great question!\"\n\n\nAnd then he asked a follow up question very angrily and then another man started agreeing with me very loudly and then the moderator shut them down and we moved on to the next talk.\n\nThe first guy was the lead scientist for the telescope collaboration....yikes.",

              "text": "Saw a similar thing happen at a regional conference for an organization. The national president was also there to receive an award. It just so happened that his group and the group I was in were working on the same problem, but had drawn different conclusions. I felt sorry for my fellow grad student who presented his work, and then the postdoc who had a poster during the poster session immediately after. During the Q&A session for the talk, the chair had to get involved to end if after my PI and collaborators got into a \"debate\" with the president. The \"debate\" then continued at the postdoc's poster. I think the paper they were working on was delayed by 6 months to address all of the points, since we knew he would probably review it.\n\nAnother time, also happened during grad school on the recruiting weekend. I normally volunteered to help out (we got free food), and had to pick a few people up from the airport. Well one person was from a Caribbean island (and did undergrad there, so cold for her was like 70), and the weekend was end of January/beginning of February. I did grad school in the northern Midwest, where we get lake effect snow, and generally don't get much above freezing. Words can't describe the look on her face when we left the airport to walk to my car. Needless to say she did not end up at our school in the fall. We did get thundersnow that weekend also.\n\nAt my current job ((DOD) national lab) we had an interview go down in the history books.  Background: Every DOD lab is on a military base, and our site is may or may not have cell phone service depending on where you are or your provider, we also give directions to get to our site since Google will take you somewhere else if you type in \"Base X,\" and tell people to call us when you get to the guard shack so we can sign you in. \n\nNow for the interview: Guy calls saying he is at the guard shack, and someone goes to check him in. Interviewee was not at the guard shack, and the person calls to find out where interviewee is Interviewee is was at the main entrance to the base, and interviewee is told how to get to our entrance, and to give us a call when he arrives. A few minutes goes by (ie it should not have been this quick), and he calls and states \"his friend\" can't drive him to our entrance, and needs to be picked up. He gets picked up, but interview starts about 2 hours late (it was about an hour to drive from our location to his location). During the research talk, he gives his senior design talk (he had graduated about 5 years prior). As the interview is coming to an end, we tell him to call his \"friend\" to come pick him up since it is a long drive to our site. We drop him off at the guard shack to wait to be picked up. He then proceeds to leave the guard shack and walks along the fence line with his laptop open to try to get internet access to call his \"friend\" (we found out later it was Uber since he didn't have a license). Cops get called, and arrest him. Cops call our secretaries, to confirm that interviewee was on site. We convince the cops to release him under the condition that someone drives him back to the hotel immediately.  He didn't get the job.",

Yes if they don't ask any questions or have any interest in the department/your scholarship etc. that's a red flag, but asking for thorough details on pay/benefits/etc. is entirely appropriate. It might not be comfortable for you to discuss, but it should be something all interviewers are comfortable with doing. Looking down on someone for making sure they can feed their kids or ensuring their (dis)ability/illness is covered is a really scary thought.",

Candidates do not meet with them as there's no reason to. All the \"official\" stuff comes from the department chair and the dean. Meeting with HR would be a waste of everyone's time as they don't really know what's going on at the departmental level or have any role in hiring other than collecting materials and issuing contracts when told to do so.",

Once that happens I (as department chair) generally become an advocate for the candidate and I always coach them through negotiations to the extent possible (i.e. by sharing info on salaries, startup, teaching assignments, etc.) because once we've made an offer to our top candidate I *want* that person to say yes.\n\nBut we also-- and always --provide all the basic info on salary range, benefits, etc. to every single candidate as a formal part of the interview process.

I\u2019m also the department chair and those policies are set by my institution. I can refer candidates to the policies but certainly don\u2019t decide their benefits or how much time off they get, for example.\n\nIt also sounds like your interviews include a separate time to meet with the department chair to ask these questions. What I referred to in my original post is the candidate\u2019s meeting with the entire committee and at the end they\u2019re given the opportunity to ask questions. If the only thing the candidate can think to ask about are questions regarding salary, benefits, vacation, etc. then that is a red flag. As I said elsewhere, a question or two in that moment are fine, but it shouldn\u2019t be the ONLY thing they ask about with regards to the college, department, etc.",

As my supervisors put it (one single, the other with an academic spouse): many departments and committees are looking for any hint that you won't be uber productive in the first few years. For women, the unconscious/conscious bias is the assumption that, if we're married, we'll be getting hired and then immediately going on mat leave. If your spouse is an academic spouse, departments might not want to risk making an offer to someone who will only accept if a second position is found for their spouse. AND, studies have found that search committees *assume* that an academic couple will follow the husband's job, so why bother making an offer to a woman scholar who will likely just be following her husband anyway. My husband is also an academic, but we're following my career. There's no way to say that to a search committee though. It would be great to announce \"I wouldn't want to work in a department so full of sexists, so I'll announce my married status and if they don't want me than so be it etc etc\" but the job market doesn't allow for that kind of grand standing. I want a job. I need a job.  And I'm not going to take the risk of assuming that the search committee *isn't* full of sexist dinosaurs. So, until I have a job offer on paper, I'm \"single\".",

The three faculty at the table made eye contact, and that was the end of his chances.\n\nYes, our department chair was a full time administrator and didn't do research anymore.  But we loved him.   Why would you assume as an outsider that you understood the dynamics of a department you had never visited before.\n\n20 years later and this candidate is a big success, full professor at an R1, but he's still an interpersonal train wreck.

Which is true. That single usage of the word dick cost me the interview (my language otherwise was fine), and I likely could have had the job otherwise. Not my greatest idea ever (and I admit it was a bit unprofessional), but I still find it stupid that that was enough to ruin an interview for a crappy manual labor job in a factory that doesn't deal with customers or anything. Ended up with a different job a few weeks later in a warehouse that paid way more and wasn't on night shift.\n\nAbout a year ago, I had an interview for a manufacturing engineering internship. I was still working that job in the warehouse and going to school, so I showed up on 2 hours of sleep. And then I was like \"I prefer design\". I do prefer design and have little interest in manufacturing, but it was pretty stupid to do that in literally the only internship interview I got. All I had to do was beat 3 other people in the interview, and I failed that.",

      "text": "When I was in grad school I was on the recruitment committee every year, and admissions one year as well.\n\nThe worst candidate ever came to interview my PI by special arrangement during the recruitment event. Unfortunately, my PI had woken up that morning with a super swollen and infected eye, so she'd gone straight to the ER for treatment and could not make the appointment. When we greeted him and shared this news he flipped shit and stormed out. Later he sent her a very disrespectful and accusatory email. I found out later that before this happened, he'd torpedoed any chances of getting into our program by calling the dept chair to scream about his hotel room not being ready at 8 am.\n\nOther mishaps - \n\nApplicant drank so much he passed out in the back corner of the room. Same guy was so hungover the next day that he loudly snored through the entire morning seminar series. \n\nAnother applicant attended the optional graduate student party and creeped on and tried to touch far too many women. \n\nOne applicant whined the whole time about how we were not UCLA and how much better every single fucking thing is at UCLA. *Why are you even here?*\n\nAn applicant had a criminal record. In news articles he claimed it was \"just a joke\" but it was pretty clear from the details published that it was some racially motivated bullying. One of the faculty expressed concern that, based on his background, he would not be a good fit for our progressive and diverse university and relentlessly grilled him on the incident and his current perspectives and opinions.",

I learned at the interview that some students apparently harass the front desk worker about why they didn't get a scholarship (not that front desk people would know anything about it). They asked me how I would respond and, honestly, I immediately said, \"I would tell them maybe they should try a little harder next time.\" The interviewers were clearly jarred, and I tried to backtrack, but I obviously didn't get the job :/ honestly probably wasn't for me if the requirement is to deal with entitled kids all the time",

I arrived at the company... and completely spaced the hiring manager's name. There were about 2000 people on-site. The very nice receptionist helped me out though.\n\nMuch later, as a senior manager, I had been going on a *lot* of job interviews. I of course did my research on each company before the interview, played their games (this is in game dev), etc. And for one of them when asked about the things I thought best and worst about their flagship product (a common question), I went on and on about... one of their competitors' games.\n\nYeah.\n\nThe miracle? In both cases I got the job.",

Nothing has helped me ever. Somehow my brain always finds a way to crash and thus fails to stop my tongue running amok in the most crucial moments of the interview. \n\nThe worst case was recently, when someone asked me: 'Ok, you've told us why we should hire you, now tell us why we shouldn't'... Well guess what, my fucking tongue went berserk and told them why I shouldn't be hired. Long story short, I'm still unemployed. Also, nowadays HR people always get disappointed when the answer of 'Why do you want this position' is not 'because I've always dreamed of spending my life in a meaningless position with no salary increase'",
