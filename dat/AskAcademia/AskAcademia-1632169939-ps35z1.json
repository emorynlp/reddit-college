  "text": "So I am currently an undergraduate studying math and physics. I love the two subjects immensely, but I feel I\u2019ve always leaned toward the mathematical end of things.( While my lecturer babbles on about the double-slit experiment or muon decay, etc I just doze off). Something about physically motivated problems interest me, but don\u2019t ask me to do an experiment lol.\nAnyway, I plan to go on to do a phd program in the future, but I just don\u2019t know whether to choose physics or math officially. \nIs it common for the math and physics departments to collaborate and do research together? Is there a wall between the two?\nPlease let me know your thoughts down below. Also, if you\u2019ve had to make this choice, let me know how you managed to do it.\nThanks",

      "text": "I had to make that choice! I double majored in undergrad and initially went to grad school for physics. Spent one semester there and realized it was not for me (which probably wasn't enough time to assess that, but I don't regret my choice). It took that experience to really pinpoint that I love math, and the physics applications were interesting, but not what I wanted to focus on.\n\nThat said, your adviser is going to be really important when getting your PhD. When picking a grad school, I would look for people whose research is really interesting and apply to the department they are in. Bonus points if there are multiple people with interesting research in that department. The downside is that you might have to take some less interesting required courses for the degree and possibly pass qualifying exams in them.\n\n I'm still working in the intersection of the two fields (in an engineering department, interestingly enough) as a postdoc and loving it. The department doesn't matter as much as the research",
