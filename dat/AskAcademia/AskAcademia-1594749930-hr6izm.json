  "text": "I definitely want to avoid pointless bragging (like booking a table at a restaurant for Dr. Jam). And occasions where I might be mistaken for a medical doctor, because I can't really do more than basic first aid.    \n\nThere's the obvious stuff like applying for jobs where it's relevant.    \nThen I've once used my title when calling landlords about seeing an apartment, because the market in my area is competitive and I tried to look like I have my sh*t together.\n\nHow do you feel about being called Doctor?  Awesome or awkward?",

Established chairs are set up by a university, emptied when someone retires and you interview etc for it, a personal chair is awarded for a high level of achievement. It\u2019s the highest rung on the ladder before going into admin roles like head of department etc.\n\nYou only use the title \u2018Professor\u2019 if you have a chair, generally speaking. We don\u2019t (generally, although some unis are moving to the US nomenclature) use the assistant or associate professor titles, and we don\u2019t have a tenure system, so it works a bit differently. But a U.K. professor is roughly equivalent to a US full professor as described in the other reply.",

I also like seeing that title on my mail. It reminds me how hard I worked for this thing and how far I've come academically. And outside of professional settings, as others have said, the only time I really use it is when I send emails while apartment hunting or for customer service. You are definitely treated better with a Ph.D. after your name, and people go out of their way to give you a little extra if they see that. Given my pretty humble background, that feels a little dirty sometimes, but I'm not going to be afraid to use it when it might help me out.",

It'll help even more so if you have an offer at some institution and you can throw that into an email with a landlord: \"I was recently offered a position at such and such university and am looking for housing in the area.\" They'll know you're a serious prospective tenant, you have a secure job, and you're likely a put-together adult they can trust. The degree, combined with an offer, communicates that, so I don't think it should ever backfire on you.",

I  never want to be addressed as \"doctor\" unless it's in a formal introduction at an event outside of academia where the title matters (i.e. if I'm speaking to a large group of laypeople and need to establish my bona fides). The only other time I use it is when someone is being a dick about status...for example, my kids had a terrible principal in middle school who had an Ed.D. and insisted that everyone address her as \"Doctor Smith\" all the time, including parents. But she used first names with everyone, so I did the same. One time I called her \"Mary\" in a big public meeting and she came back with \"Please address me as Doctor\" so I said \"only if you do the same to me and all the other people in the room with doctoral degrees.\"\n\nI have one credit card with my title on it (an alumni card from my \"elite\" graduate school) that I sometimes use when traveling. I've had markedly better service sometimes from airlines, rental cars, hotels, etc. when \"Dr.\" is on my file, card, etc. Come to think of it, I also tend to use it when writing nastygrams to politicians as well.\n\nBut otherwise never, and certainly not on campus or from my students. I teach at an SLAC and have always been on a first name basis not only with students but with the president, provost, etc.",

I'm just enjoying a slightly prolonged, and probably unnecessary, personal celebration of what I've worked towards for 4 years.\n\nAlso, whilst I think about this, I used to think people who used the title were a bit stuck up, but after completing a PhD, I completely understand why someone would want to use it after earning it!",

My PCP and her nurses have never, ever wavered from using that preferred name. The gyn, however, greeted me before she had ever set eyes on me with a long, condescending \"Mmmmmssssss.

I'll use it, if offered in the drop-down, when registering for a conference or other professional function, and it sometimes shows up when I'm asked to write a reference letter for a student. But, I sign my emails with (and invite students and others to call me) my first name. I can count on one hand the number of times I've called myself Dr. LastName in an email, and they're only in very bad situations :p.\n\nPretty much any other usage seems douchey, so I try to avoid.\n\nI do appreciate it when new folks reaching out for the first time **in a professional capacity** and hoping to draw on my expertise use the title in the cold-call outreach. If you're a media outlet, prospective student, etc, it's solid to show that respect. But I'll reply back with my first name after that.",
