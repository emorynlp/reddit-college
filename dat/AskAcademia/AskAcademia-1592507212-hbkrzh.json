  "text": "This is my 3rd year working in a research lab (am STEM grad student). I've downloaded and read/skimmed at least 200 papers on my research topic (or related topics) at this point. \n\nBut I think there's something seriously wrong with me - I can't seem to be able to read more than two paragraphs at a time nowadays. Skimming papers at a rapid rate to finish my literature reviews and satisfy my PI has conditioned me to skim, and I think I've forgotten how to actually read a piece of text.\n\nI literally have to force myself to resist the temptation of skimming to actually get through a paragraph. I've also pretty much stopped reading anything that isn't social media or research papers.\n\nThis sucks. I used to be someone who read widely and for pleasure, going through an average of like 5-10 novels or paperbacks a month. Now, it's a pain to even get through one. \n\nAny advice?",

                  "text": "Ascendance of a Bookworm right now.\n\nIt's a story about a little girl wanting to read books/become a librarian in a fantasy medieval setting. She was born with a terrible affliction, leaving her sickly and feverish. However, she does possess other-wordly knowledge to make up for that.\n\nIt tells a story where she leverages her knowledge not for profit, not for power, but simply making it she can gain access to books, and to make books more accessible in general.\n\nSomeone with such revolutionary ideas causes a great stir, and progressively soon she has to protect herself not just from the fever, but vested interests.\n\nIt *is* an Isekai, but the author herself said she only made it such to have a background for the character's obsession with books as a poor burgher in a pre-renaissance society, and as basis for her arts & crafts knowledge. This series has some very thorough world-building, and that world-building isn't just window dressing, but rather the driving point of the plot - even if not in the same volume the element was introduced.\n\nStarting june 23, there will be 8 english volumes, which amount to 2 arcs. The names of the arcs are a bit spoilery, I admit.\n\n\n\nFor heavier reading, there's the Expanse. But right now, with all the stress the media saddles one with, I can't really get myself to read the dystopian worlds of the Expanse. Still, it's an amazing series! Once things calm down a little, perhaps late-summer, I'll finally get around to reading book 8.\n\nThe Expanse is a grounded space opera exploring humanity in 2300s when they have colonized the Moon, mars and the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Humanity's expansion was kickstarted when a martian hobbyist managed to finally get special form of fusion drive to work - one that has very high efficiency, greatly cutting down travel times. \n\nIt being a martian invention, it naturally wound up becoming a state secret which, when introduced to the war between the stagnant Earth and the rebellious Mars, forced a cold war to elope and independence to be granted in exchange for the technology.\n\nAnd with that technology, the colony became yet another imperialist, colonizing the belt but putting them through the very same hardships Earth had made them suffer. Earth too made to colonize the astroids. Pallas, Ceres, Ganymede - they were all stripped of ice to fuel the martian terraforming project, and people came to live within these rocks. Smaller rocks also had stations of their own, but life was not easy there.\n\nThe story begins upon an ice hauler, delivering ice from the outer planets to Ceres to then be used as fuel, water and terraforming resource for mars. The Solar system is a heap of gunpowder at this time, with megacorporations vying to gain more and more influence within their governments, competing for contracts; with belters staging constant terrorist attacks to force the inner planets of Mars and Earth to lighten their demands; with the inner planets sending in millitary to quell uprisings without a shred of mercy.\n\nAll it takes is but a single spark for the world to change. And that single spark will happen any moment now.",

Maybe something you've read before or if you don't like re-reading then a favourite author or comfortable genre.

I'll hop around, skim to bottom of intro for hypothesis/goals -> conclusions -> methods -> analysis -> the rest of the introduction for wider material they thought was important for rationalizing their work. The problem with skimming things you're speaking on is that its what leads to so many scientists reading others referencing them and thinking \"when the hell did I say that\". I try to find the parts of the paper that give me the drive to get through it first and start there and it helps. I also try to keep in mind that without reading it in full ~~I'm probably missing something~~ I am missing something. Social media also rewards instant gratification, papers do not.

You can (relatively) easily get the ability back once you stop having to read so many papers at that rate (ie later in your career). But switching is hard. \n\nTo the extend that I have been successful at this I advise two things. \n\nFirstly, when you go to read a novel or something, you have to make some special effort to get into a different mental zone. Try some sort of ritual like drinking a particular kind of tea, going to a particular place, maybe before you start reading, spend five to ten minutes just in silence letting your brain slow down a bit (a much bigger challenge than it sounds: try it!). \n\nSecondly, you could make a change in your research habits. What are you getting out of skimming these papers? Ticking a box basically. I doubt you can really be taking anything in this way. You should be skim reading something only to check if it's worth your time to read thoroughly, there's not much point skim reading everything. This might sound like hard to follow advice, but it has a neat double feature: if you decide not to do it then it means ultimately that you value getting your literature reviews \"done\" (on time or sufficiently \"thoroughly\" or whatever) or avoiding your PI's wrath more than you value reading novels. Admitting that to yourself (if it's true) could be a very useful way to deal with the problem.",

Include the who, what, where, when, how.\n\nIt will help your comprehension and you'll have your lit review done for your thesis. I used a PDF reader and electronically save all my PDFs with highlights and  notes. This is very useful when referencing them later for writing.",

      "text": "I had the same problem due to fatigue bcs of papers and anxiety, and although I'm just a master student finishing her master right now, I may help. 3 things helped me: 1st) Choosing short books; 2nd) Reading novels in my native language; 3rd) Keeping track of my reading with goodreads.\nAbout the first point: more than choosing \"light\" novels, when I am stuck in this non-reading loop, I tend to go for very short books (100 max 200 pages). Even if those are heavy novels like The Stranger from Camus or White Nights from Dostoevsky, the fact that it's short means that I will finish it in a short time and have that reward sensation of \"oh yeah, I'm done with it! Look, I've managed to finish a book\" earlier. \n2nd) I'm not a native English speaker. Reading in English normally is not a problem, but after spending days reading papers in a different language, it felt easier to go back to something that is more natural, and easier to get. It's less effort. If this applies to you, I would recommend doing this.\n3rd) I have a goodreads account, where I set up my own yearly \"reading challenge\". I know how many books I'm reading per months, and it tells me if I'm at good pace to fullfil my challenge. Moreover, it's nice to share reviews about books. However, be sure to don't exaggerate with the challenge. Actually, maybe just \"be safe\" and choose a lower amount of books to read compared to what you feel you could do (I started with 20 books per year, less than 2 per months!). You could always update the challenge. Keeping track of the books you're reading helps you with that aforementioned reward sensation.",
