  "text": "I just graduated from my PhD program this year and will be teaching some courses at the same institution in the Fall. I used to address all of my professors with either Prof. XX or Dr. XX. But one of my professors just told me in an email a few days after my defense to address them with first name. Should I then address all my professors with first name since I\u2019ll technically be their colleagues in the new semester, or should I just call them in a way I used to do until they correct me? I want to be professional but at the same time don\u2019t want to be seen as lack of respect.\n\nEdit: for clarification, I\u2019m in the field of Humanities in the US.",

              "text": "Haha, this made me laugh right out loud in my office, alone.\n\nI love to see the new faculty faces when I address our Dean with a \"What's up, dude?\"\n\nHe was a professor back in the day when I started, we became good hostile friends, sarcasm flying back and forth daily due to his office being across the hall from mine.\n\nIt's so hard to be professional with him even when it's absolutely necessary but I manage, well he would tell you I don't manage it at all.\n\nI'm one of the few old-timers left, I think he stops by our building sometimes just to feel the old sense of camaraderie.\n\nTo the OP - it really varies from my point of view.  Safe to call them all Dr./Prof, etc. until you feel it out otherwise. In front of undergrad students or an audience, always Dr./Prof., in my humble opinion. If you've established a rapport with them, the first name is just fine.  I don't really care how anyone addresses me, to be honest.  I'd probably turn if someone said 'hey dude', thinking they were talking to me. My friends, colleagues, students all call me by a nickname which is just fine with me.  I'm not a fan of the titles but I get it.\n\nEdit to add: I'm not even a guy dude but a female that will answer to dude too.",

It's also become a way to address fellow students in higher ed, particularly widespread in some universities. So the same word is formal or informal depending on context, which is frankly very convenient.\n\nWords like professor or doctor are mostly heard on TV or similar when an academic is introduced. After that they switch to \"hocam\" as well, or maybe sometimes \"say\u0131n hocam\" ~= \"honourable doctor\", but you'll never hear that in a university. I guess they'd take that as snarky and might even get offended.",

                      "text": "Hungarian. It is that one super weirdo language.\n\nWikipedia explains it well under, \"[Hungarian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language#Politeness)\":\n> \n> Hungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n> \n> * \u00d6n (\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here \"you\", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.\n> * Maga (mag\u00e1z\u00e1s, mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as maga. Aside from the different pronoun it is grammatically the same as \"\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s\".\n> * N\u00e9ni/b\u00e1csi (tetszikez\u00e9s): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as \"\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s\" or \"mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s\", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role \"tetszik\" (\"like\") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parents, close friends or close relatives by using \"tetszik\" (\"you like\"): \"Hogy vagy?\" (\"How are you?\") here becomes \"Hogy tetszik lenni?\" (\"How do you like to be?\"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.\n> * Te (tegez\u00e9s, tegez\u0151d\u00e9s or pertu, per tu from Latin): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address God. The highest rank, the king, was traditionally addressed \"per tu\" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of \"tegez\u00e9s\" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and by adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without T\u2013V distinction in most contemporary dialects) on the Internet, \"tegez\u00e9s\" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.\n> \n> The four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"tegez\u0151d\u00e9s\" and \"\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s\".\n> \n> Some anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the te (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop IKEA, whose web site and other publications address the customers in te form. When a news site[45] asked IKEA\u2014using the te form\u2014why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer\u2014using the \u00f6n form\u2014that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France uses the polite (vous) form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite \u00f6n form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite te form.\n\n\nI use \u00d6n for everyone pretty much unless someone asks me not to. \n\nMaga is a bit of a anomaly, as depending on region it is either polite or impolite, as such I avoid it due to people from all over working at my univ.\n\n\n\nSome conflict does arise with more ... relaxed profs. Like my supervisor. He declared he's taking me and the group drinking after his vacation is over to break my habit lol.",

It's my job to push them, critique them, and let them know when they're falling short. Being too familiar with undergrads can make it so criticism feels like a betrayal. Grad students tend to be mature enough to not worry about that issue, though.",

Even professors who insist on undergraduates calling them by Title Lastname have corrected me to call them by their First names.\n\nI don't have a doctoral degree, but you're at a place professionally that anyone who insists on you using their title/salutation needs to address you by title/salutation as well.",
