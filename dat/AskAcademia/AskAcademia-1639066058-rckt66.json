  "title:": "Appropriate to follow up after on-campus TT interview?",
  "text": "I had a TT on-campus interview several weeks ago, and haven't heard anything from the search committee since then--at the interview, they only told me they were hoping to wrap up the search by mid-December, but didn't say when the final interview was scheduled or anything. Would it be appropriate to follow up with the search chair to ask for an update, or should I just let the process play out?",

      "text": "I chaired many committees over the years. It never bothered me to be asked but I never gave any answer other than we were still working on the search. I stopped giving anticipated time frames a long time ago because there are just too many things that can extend a search beyond the expected/hoped time frame.",

If this is the case Then committee meets to decide to make an offer....then the university authorizes that offer. Likely nothing till mid jan to be honest.\n\nWhy do you need to know? If you aren't holding another deadline, my advice is to sit tight.",
