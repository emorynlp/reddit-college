  "title:": "What music do you listen do while doing research?",
  "text": "I hope this isn't too far outside the conventional norm to ask. I've burned through most of my usual playlists and am looking for new music to have in the background while I work. Personally I will usually trend toward lyricless hiphop tracks, old deadmau5, or videogame background music.  \n\nEdit: Absolutely fantastic suggestions here, big thanks to everyone! Hopefully it helped others here too. Enjoy your weekend everyone.",

Favourite genre is melodic dubstep (i.e., Seven Lions and Au5) but I also enjoy progressive house, trance, alternative dance/electro house, future bass (i.e., RUFUS DU SOL, Flight Facilities, Flume, Hayden James etc.). MrSuicideSheep used to be my go-to for electronic playlists back in the day. When I mean monotonous tasks, I mean lab work, field work, data entry, and programming. However, anything that requires concentration (learning new programming or running new analysis), I revert to instrumentals or silence. Field work or lab work with more researchers than myself, usually the radio or someone has a playlist and we rotate each day.\n\nFor work that requires concentration and critical thinking (i.e., when I was writing my thesis and now manuscripts), progressive house and gaming/movie OSTs. My favourite that I have listened to for four years is the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Soundtrack (got a shout out in my thesis acknowledgements), and also the Animal Crossing: New Horizons and World of Warcraft soundtracks. Lots of YouTube channels pair the soundtracks with ambience and nice visuals.\n\nWhat I will not listen to, for any task, are audiobooks or podcasts. They are so unbelievably distracting and I can't stand them, no matter what task it is, and I have tried plenty of times. Silence gets the pick well before a podcast does.\n\nNotable channels: \n\n[Gamescapes](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamescapes/videos) | [DragonRand100](https://www.youtube.com/user/DragonRand100) |  [Everness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa3SDs8cPme7tD9S8BIVYrw/videos) | [Meisio](https://www.youtube.com/c/Meisio/videos) | [MrSuicideSheep](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrSuicideSheep/playlists)",

I have a bunch of stuff I listen to but I ALWAYS come back to them when I want to dive into something.\n\nI started with the interloper album but I slowly rotate them if I\u2019m listening heavy. \n\nI\u2019ve recently been listening to the Alt:02 album that had a \u201cfirst version\u201d of supersede that I love. \n\nAfter that I like similar artists like Aes Dana, solar fields. In particular I like atmospheric music with melodic and driving bass. \n\nA few examples are: \n-  Borderline: Aes Dana\n- vapor: cell\n- Supercede(first version): carbon based life forms\n- dissolving time: HUVA network \n- fossil: connect.ohm \n- emoxygen: sun:monx \n\nAfter that I usually listen to the lofi girl on YouTube \n\nSome other stuff I\u2019ve been listening to that works for me: \n\nPorter Robinson\u2019s new live album \u201csecond sky 2021(live)\u201d is amazing \n\nDaft punk\u2019s Alive 2007 live album is awesome the way they blend the songs\n\nNervous test pilot: music for code album \n\nYoste is good but it makes me sad if I listen for too long \n\nTycho , boards of Canada \n\nSome genres or words I search for in YouTube or Spotify: \n- liquid chill dnb \n- sub low \n- deep study \n- \u201cthis is\u201d or \u201cessentials\u201d for whatever artist or genre I\u2019m looking for if I haven\u2019t listened to them before\n- adult swim bumps playlist \n- botw ost \n- \n\nDoom eternal soundtrack is awesome if I don\u2019t have to do a lot of reading or if the work is not very dense. \u201cEverything is going to be ok\u201d by mick Gordon is good as well.\n\nI don\u2019t usually listen to podcasts but I love last podcast on the left if I\u2019m not actually working or doing the dishes or something \n\nInfected mushroom is good but distracting \n\nI end up being picky about game or movie sound tracks but I have found I like a lot of streamer playlists made on Spotify before the dmca crackdown.",

My go-tos are the Cryptograms album by Deerhunter, the Avalanches, badbadnotgood, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the comet is coming",
