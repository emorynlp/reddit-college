  "title:": "Accepted a PhD position, not sure if it was the right call",
  "text": "So it's been my goal to get onto a PhD for the past 5 years, so I when I was offered one I decided to go ahead and take it. I didn't vibe very well with the supervisors in the interview but figured that was maybe down to interview nerves. However, I've had the chance to meet more members of the team and everyone just seems... unhappy? There are PhD students in my current lab group and, whilst they're stressed, I wouldn't describe them as unhappy. Did I just luck out with my current lab group? Is this a pretty widespread problem? It's making me second guess my decision to join the team and the doubt is screwing with my mental health a little.",

Also if everyone seems unhappy that is a red flag. For the future never accept a position without talking to the lab members first to get a vibe of how working there will be.\nI mean you can give it a chance anyway but be prepared to run if things turn bad.",

My two friends have moved away to finish remotely, my best friend left and all the people I really got along with also left.\n\nI'm in the last months and to be honest it's absolute hell - I'm actually contemplating not finishing. And it's largely due to the fact that I don't vibe with my new PI and my prof awesome as old news. Having a good support system and relationship can make or break a PhD in my opinion",

You will spend a lot of time, effort, and aggravation with politics, grants, fighting with the other PhD who are trying to make you look bad. You'd think people who are supposed to be at the height of intellectual endeavors would be beyond petty human things but if anything you're out in a pressure cooker and your survival is turned up to 11. So I've heard. You mileage may vary.",

      "text": "Biochemistry PhD here. I ran a podcast where I interviewed students, postdocs, and faculty about \u201ceverything but their science\u201d, aka the more humanistic aspects of STEM. For instance, what it\u2019s like to be a woman in STEM, issues of work/life balance, PI politics, etc. \n\nGraduated in 5.5, had a great and supportive grad student group, but I\u2019d never usually have described us as \u201chappy\u201d after the 1st year or so. The PhD is a trying time, with lots of pressure and many reasons to be stressed, but the one thing that helped get us through it was, well, each other. \n\nMy advice: reach out to a student you met who you think will be honest with you via email or text. Ask if you can have a voice call, and really be very frank about what you\u2019re after. I stress requesting a phone call because 1) they\u2019re more likely to talk honestly, 2) more willing to take the time to do so than writing out an email about their experiences, and 3) if they have bad stuff to say about the program they probably don\u2019t want a written record of it flying around. \n\nAsk them if there are *systematic* issues in the department or in individual groups that they can identify that make their lives as grad students worse. This can include, but is certainly not limited to:\n- onerous TA duties\n- demanding/mean/racist/sexist PI\n- other grad students with bad behavior\n- no institutional support\n- the area where the school is sucks\n- competitive colleague culture instead of a supportive one\n- students don\u2019t graduate on time\n- etc etc etc\n\nIn contrast to some comments here, I truly believe there is no incentive for current grad students to tell you anything but the truth about their programs, provided they are asked the right questions. The thing you should *not* do to get a truthful answer is ask something generic like \u201cSo, what do you like about being a grad student?\u201d It\u2019s a generic prompt, so you\u2019ll get a generic non-answer.  Be really specific and frank, and they will 9 times out of 10 give you truthful information. \n\nGood luck",

I\u2019m not sure what field you\u2019re in, and how the program is structured, but it sounds like you may have choice of advisors, or could even be co-advised somewhat. \n\nI will point out that while \u201cintimidation tactics\u201d doesn\u2019t sound healthy at all, all PIs have strengths and flaws both, and some flaws you can live with. If possible, you should 1) try to find out what flaws the PIs have, maybe during a rotation or by talking to students, and 2) consider whether your own work style might actually be compatible with some of your PIs flaws. \n\nFor instance, I knew my boss was pretty involved (not hands-off), but *only* for topics in his subject area. This meant that I was hovered over for years when I worked on \u201chis\u201d pet project idea, but by the time I pivoted to a new project in 4th year (that was not his idea nor expertise), I was really on my own. This worked out in my favor\u2014I learned independence, and had by that point gotten a firm grip on the techniques that were common between the two projects\u2014but *knowing my PI\u2019s flaws and behaviors* at least prepared me for this shift.",

He thankfully has since been forced out due to sexual misconduct, but we worked in a very small research niche where word would travel easily and he would have no problem making your life hellish if he heard you had spoken ill of him. So we all lived in fear of scaring off potential PhD students if they were to tell their current MS advisors what we said. Unfortunately, not everyone in that research niche (that I felt compelled to simply leave for my PhD) either knew or felt similarly about his reputation for crossing boundaries and being overly controlling over his grad students.\n\nWe felt we couldn't be explicit about our experience and instead would tell prospective students how great the other programs they had applied to were and how their interests may align better at those other schools. So it ended up relying much more on nuance and reading between the lines, which many people are not as able to pick up on.",
