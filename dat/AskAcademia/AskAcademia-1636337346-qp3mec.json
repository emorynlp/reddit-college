  "text": "Let me quickly explain my situation ...\n\nUp front - I dropped out of college with 162 credit hours in my back pocket and about one semester left to go for a masters. I am not proud of this, but nearly a decade later - there's really not a lot I can do about it now. Nevertheless, it has left me in an odd situation that I am trying to better understand.\n\nI've been working on an independent research project which I began about four years ago. The time to begin writing a paper is fast approaching as my project is quite close to completion, and I am beginning to feel a bit more than anxious about this.\n\nI am aware there have been others who have published their research without a degree; but I suspect they either had some very solid academic ties or sufficient financial influence.\n\nI am terrified of both writing a scientific research paper (which I have never done before, and I honestly don't know where to begin) and of being rejected based on my lack of academic prestige.\n\nI've been thinking that my best course of action might be to introduce myself to a few researchers I respect at our local state university; I honestly can't think of any other way to do this.\n\nIs that the wrong approach?\n\nI feel very - lost right now. I've been building and running these simulations for four years; and now that things are coming to a close, I suddenly find myself quite overwhelmed.\n\nI'm not sure how much the subject matter is relevant here, but I'd assume that this particular project may just make things a tad more difficult because these are socioeconomic simulations that focus on the flow of energetic and material waste from a thermodynamic perspective.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm currently suffering from the sudden onset of an inferiority complex ... seriously.\n\nFrom your perspectives - what would you recommend for somebody in my position?  \nIs there an equitable and acceptable way I might approach those with the experience I lack?\n\nAny thoughts and/or advice that you think might help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnd thank you :)",

      "text": "Your best bet is to go back to one of the professors you worked with during your master's training. Even if you didn't graduate, they at least know you.\n\nI'm also really nervous for you that you've dedicated this much time and effort to a project without (any?) mentorship. While your effort was there and your intelligence isn't the question here... You may not have produced publishable work in its current form. \n\nMost of academic training is learning how to properly design a study and control for challenges that others have identified. And the rest of it is understanding field norms, benchmarks, gaps, and context.",

I've prepared myself to the best of my ability (ie: courses, books, blog posts, podcasts, etc.); but like you said, there is a certain amount of \"information transference\" that can only be garnered from being mentored.  \nPerhaps it's time I go back through that material as well.  \nI appreciate your reply. Thank you.",

      "text": "Honestly I would recommend you finding relevant literature on your topic or field and reach out to researchers that have similar interests. I cold emailed a professor from Harvard about my research which was very closely related to his and to my surprise he replied very warmly and was interested in my project. He even proposed further suggestions for my research. There\u2019s no harm in doing that, and the worst case scenario is that they don\u2019t reply. But if you do find someone who is interested in your research, they could potentially help you out with the process or at least give you some sense of direction.",

          "text": "heh - I've been doing that consistently for a while now. While I have had a few researchers who've replied positively; the majority have either scoffed or not replied at all (which, I supposed, is to be expected).\n\nPerhaps a short whitepaper might, at the very least, catch a few more replies?\n\nHuh - thank you. This was very helpful as well :)",
