At the start of my career, the editor of a top journal in my field rejected my article after all three reviewers gave a 'publish, with minor revisions' recommendation. I naively called the editor directly, and asked him to clarify what peer review meant in that journal if the editor didn't consider the reviewers' recommendations. He admitted that was a fair question and changed his mind!",

It was a pain in the butt but I think a good thing to do.
