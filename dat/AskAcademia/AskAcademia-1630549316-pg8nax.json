  "title:": "Can an academic institution revoke a degree in retaliation?",
  "text": "Throwaway account and I'll be trying to keep it vague.\n\nI recently graduate from a masters degree program, but in my opinion the program was bunk. Like 3/10 at best. Now I don't think that this schools reputation will make too much of a difference in terms of my career progression because once I had figured out my mistake, I did everything in my power to make sure that my personal education went far and above the minimal standards set by the university program. I worked myself much harder than I had to and will stand by my own achievements, but am concerned that other students will not have the same drive. I have drafted (but not sent) a long letter detailing my concerns with plans to send it to the program director only. Rather than bash the school publicly, it is my hope that my letter may cause some positive changes to the program to increase their quality of education.\n\nMy somewhat paranoid concern is that there may be some retaliation as a result. My letter is not insulting, but there is no way to write 'your program sucks - here is how I think you could improve it' in a way that doesn't come off as insulting. I have not committed any plagiarism and I have had no disciplinary problems. GPA was a solid 3.9. That being said, my fear is that the academic staff will just find 'something' that bothers them and should they accuse me of plagiarism or what have you, then my career will likely never recover. I waited until my degree was conferred before writing out the letter. I wasn't going to risk it until then.\n\nAny advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nAll right, got a lot of perspectives here and there's a lot of different camps on suggesting what to do ranging from 'stop being so whiny and move on with life' to 'jump the chain of command and start reporting higher up'. Ultimately, I've settled on asking if the director would be ok with a 15 minute call. If she is, I can make my concerns known and keep it cordial. Worst case scenario, she says no and I feel like I gave it a shot so I can feel like I tried at least. Best case scenario, we talk and either she dispels some of my delusions that some people here think I'm carrying around or she sees some validity to my points and hopefully enacts some positive change.\n\nUnfortunately without getting into details its difficult to explain the nuances of this situation and I probably could've done a better job in my first post. None the less - I got some ideas to bounce off my head and thank you for your feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThis is a smaller program and the director teaches one of the final classes herself, so I have access to her direct email - we have spoken before as she had to sanction a clerical override for my degree completion.

              "text": "I think you're welcome to do it. Your letter _by itself_ won't do anything, but if these are concerns _they have heard before_ or there are people _on the inside who want to make changes_ then your letter serves as additional ammunition for them in their fight. You will have no idea if yours is the first letter they received, or the tenth. \n\nThis is in general with most \"write a letter of complaint\" situations \u2014 unless you are a big wig, a single letter does nothing, but you have no idea what is going on behind the scenes. It might be used by someone to effect good changes. (There is lots of evidence, for example, that writing letters to a Congressperson can get them to do things they might not otherwise. You won't change their minds on fundamental issues, obviously, but if they are leaning one way or another anyway, it can reinforce their position.) It can't hurt, in any event, and I think the people who say it won't make a difference are really misunderstanding how organizations work. It is also an amazingly pure example of a self-fulfilling prophecy: if nobody gives feedback, then feedback can't have much of an impact, by definition.\n\nI also agree that the odds of \"retaliation\" of any sort are essentially zero. If you were publishing this letter publicly, maaaaaybe they'd get unhappy. But even then, they're more likely to ignore you than to retaliate; the latter would really draw more attention to their problems than the former.",

      "text": "In the UK, we have nationwide student surveys conducted by third parties called the NSS for undergraduates and PTES for postgrads (taught masters level students). These are anonymous and the results are usually taken pretty seriously by universities, because they reflect student retention, course quality, likelihood to continue on to post-grad study, and inform the university's reputation to some extent.\n\nIn addition, my old uni made a lot of opportunities for students to leave anonymous feedback. Now, whether or not this made a difference is another matter, but the opportunity existed.\n\nIn addition to THAT, the Student Union exists to support students in receiving a quality education and will always advocate on behalf of a dissatisfied student, and Student Advice (run by the SU) specifically exists to help students with things like complaints, dissatisfaction, academic problems, visa problems, etc etc.\n\nThere's also Student Support, run by the university itself, who would take any concerns seriously and make sure students are not disadvantaged if they do choose to send a complaint, etc.\n\nI'm listing all this because perhaps your uni has some of these systems in place also? If so, making use of the system (you're paying for it after all) might be better than potentially burning bridges with an email directly to your department head (or whoever). At the very least, to get your frustration heard.",

If you do not land any actual harm, personally I think the likelihood of retaliation is slim. My department haven't done that for almost half century, despite many student totally deserve it.\n\nAlso, it might hurt, at least for my department, master degree is really something close to cash cow. We opened some programs just to turn our decent reputation into cash, since we wanted to buy some really expensive instruments. So what we are doing is just to earn enough money with minimal possible efforts, I teach some programs not because I like those students, but because I want to use that nice instrument .\n\nPlus, most likely your email will end up in the hands of secretary, and she/he will just reply you very politely using template, the director probably wouldn't even read it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\njust to add on, it might be rumor, but we had some major change in our student welfare some time ago, that letter came with a big check, and were endorsed by a senator.",

Other than those three classes, every single other class only had three methods of instruction: book learning, assignment feedback, and (when applicable) XXXXXXX. On the choice of books, I would say that I found them of varying quality (most of the important textbooks were good though). The most useful book was the XXXXXXX textbook while the least useful text was the XXXXXXX text (which if I recall was changed after I took the course in summer of 2020). Text book quality aside, my expectations are that at the bare minimum that professors would provide lectures reviewing the material so that the most salient aspects could be covered in detail. '",

The primary benefit being accessibility and the primary detriment being creative dissemination of instruction material. \n3. I am concerned the program does a poor job because:\n\nA. Probably 80% of the instruction is not delivered from the staff or resources of the university itself.\n\nB. The textbooks given range wildly in quality (was able to find some glaring errors in some of them ), but most were good. My comments about the text book quality were just to give the extreme examples though I agree it comes off as pedantic.\n\nC. Discussion boards and papers (the primary means of assessing competency from the academic staff) seemed to be graded based off of writing to the formula as opposed to the content the writing was regarding. Many of my classmates would write 'responses' that didn't engage or promote any decent discussion of the material. It was as if everyone was going through the motions, but next semester, I would see their names on the class roster. \n\nD. I felt that the quality of my submitted work could vary greatly between assignments, but as long as the formatting was correct, I would get a perfect score  even if I knew the quality between assignments fluctuated. The ease in which perfect scores were distributed devalues the feedback as it implies that all of my work has no room for improvement - I know for a fact that it did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, I know I'm gonna come off as an ass marching in here and making these claims against an accredited institution like I'm some kind of judge of these sorts of things, but my concerns are not isolated. The primary reason I'm being so vague is that I want to police my own profession from the inside rather than have some sort of critical mass be hit and cause some sort of fallout.",

The typical masters student will only have experience with one program, and normally just a bachelor to compare it with. For that reasons, it's easy to ignore what may very well be valid points you make.\n\nYou also have to realize that people are designing that program intentionally, and are likely satisfied or at least content with what they built. It's probably not the case that anyone there thinks it's perfect or anything like that, but satisfactory.\n\nBest case scenario for you is you lose nothing. You will gain nothing, and your letter will not actually change anything. Most likely the top brass knows what you know about the program and might even agree.",

One problem is that there are [large and very well-known institutions that do exactly this,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_and_university_rankings) and those are what anyone cares about. If US News or QS or whoever thinks your department is bad, then you're adding no new information. If they think your department is good, then you're simply wrong. Not necessarily because the department is better than you think, but because we just define \"good\" to be \"highly ranked by these lists\". You're wrong by definition.\n\nAside from that, there's an element of hubris here. Let's assume you're right and the department isn't very good. I imagine that the faculty there who presumably all have PhDs from reputable institutions are probably more aware than you of what quality looks like. There aren't a lot of worlds where a group of faculty who have spent years -- maybe decades -- studying their field and engaging in the pedagogy of teaching it are going to read a letter from a former student and go, \"Wait, could it be that we're not doing this very well?\"\n\nMostly, it's unlikely anyone will care to read your letter. Those who do are likely to have one of a few possible responses: (a) mutter \"no shit\" and move on with their day, (b) have some version of a \"who does this kid think he is\" reaction, or (c) decide you're just wrong.",
