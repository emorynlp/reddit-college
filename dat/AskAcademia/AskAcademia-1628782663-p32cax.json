  "title:": "Interesting article ( actually topic for an article) but awful structure/poorly written: what to do as a peer reviewer? Medical journal",
  "text": "So I was invited to peer review an article, it is an original research article in a journal, but I do not know what to do. The whole structure is SO poor. They use the same paragraph from the abstract in the actual article body for some sections instead of writting a proper section. There are more references than real content in terms of pages. It is a disaster, however, the topic is clinically relevant and the method is valid/not as poor as the structure.\n\nShould I try my best and suggest structual changes in their paper? Even if it will look like I am working harder as a reviewer than they did as the writers? Or should I just reject the paper and suggest they re-structure it and resubmit? I am new to peer-reviewing and I would like some advice- what would you do in my position and why?",

Then list the most serious offenses with the caveat that they are not the only issues. Let them know their methods are appropriate so they do not try to revise the saving grace of the paper. Essentially, tell them what you told us, but be a little more specific. I would also be gentle, as surely Reviewer 2 isn\u2019t asking us here :). I review for a different field entirely, however, so this may not be relevant.",

Once the review process stops with a rejection, the article (usually) gets an entirely new review panel, which, yes, is the entire point of peer review\u2026 but we all know how slammed people are, and I\u2019m not sure someone would be willing to review an article this much a mess with constructive criticism if it was that poorly written. I honestly think some reviewers stop reading after the first page if it reeks of junior scholarship\u2014when these are the very articles that need attention so the researcher can learn the ropes and contribute to scholarship. OP seems like they want to help without doing the brunt of the work, which makes sense to me for R&R.",
