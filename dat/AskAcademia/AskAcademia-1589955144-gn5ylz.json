One of the trees was based on the idea that a certain strain of flu had an incubation period of 8 days exactly. There were dozens of papers that cited this, it made a chain of citations 4-5 links long. The original paper that was cited was a modeling paper that said \"based on clinical observations we assume an incubation period of 8.0\" (paraphrased). Through the scientific game of telephone that we call citations, that value had gone from model assumption to scientific fact cited by dozen other papers. :/",

Papers in the sciences tend to be short summaries of experiments or research. \n\nIn the humanities (History, literature, philosophy) it's not, because the paper \\*is\\* the research. You can certainly skim: just focus on the few pages that discuss the text or concept you're working on, or read one chapter of a book, plus the introduction so you understand the context. But you have to understand the connection of the part to the larger argument. So read the whole thing. NEVER cite something from someone else's paper; there was a pretty radical error in one of the discussions of my first book, and every time I see it show up in another paper I know that person just hasn't fucking bothered.",

Many people do seem to cite without reading much (or anything).\n\nAs a norm: There are lots of situations where you *should* cite the paper without reading it. The obvious ones are significant work in a language you don't speak - it is not ethical to ignore the contributions of people who speak another language, and not practical to learn a new language to get one paper out. So you cite it, and don't claim that you've actually read the paper (e.g. \"the first work is \\[UkrainianPaperX\\]; see \\[EnglishSurveyY\\] for a survey of the field\").\n\nBut the same principle applies more generally: you don't have to read, as long as you don't misrepresent (i) the paper or (ii) your knowledge. The canonical example here is making connections to other fields: it is very helpful to mention if your paper relates to other distant subjects, but it is not possible to become an expert on all of them. So you make a weak citation (e.g. \"Widgets have also appeared in the fields of Gimcrackery \\[PaperA\\], Aphodosis \\[PaperB\\], and Flimflammery \\[PaperC\\]\").\n\nMy example statements are terrible and you should do better if you can - the point is that sometimes the only possible and ethical choice is to cite something without fully understanding it.",

      "text": "Definitely not. \n\nSometimes that\u2019s fine, I think. Like, I\u2019m in literary studies, and I incorporate a lot of linguistics, and sometimes I just need a soundbite definition of [concept/theory/model] that will be understandable for someone who doesn\u2019t have a linguistics background. I\u2019m not gonna read an entire introductory chapter on something I already know about, if all I need is a quote that does a good job of explaining a concept, so I just stop reading when I find the quote I need.\n\nIn general, I think if you\u2019re citing e.g. a definition it\u2019s fair game to not read the whole article. If you\u2019re basing your argument on or arguing against someone\u2019s article, definitely read the whole thing!\n\nI also sometimes see literary scholars getting stuff wrong about the primary texts they\u2019re writing about, smh. Like they\u2019ll straight up reference a piece of dialogue between character x and character y, when it\u2019s actually a dialogue between character x and character z. Or they\u2019ll be like \u201cthe narrator\u2019s name is Ben\u201d and then refer to \u201cBen\u201d throughout, when in reality the author\u2019s name is Ben, and the narrator\u2019s based on the author, and the narrator writes a story about a character named Ben who\u2019s based on himself, but the narrator himself is never named.\n\nAlso, I see a lot of linguistics misunderstood and quoted out of context by literary scholars, but it\u2019s hard to say if they didn\u2019t reads the papers or just didn\u2019t understand them.",

Most of the paper isn't relevant to my research except for that one part. Maybe I needed an example of application or was looking for different reaction conditions to try.\n\n3) A paper that I referenced just to let people know I'm aware of it. Did I read the 1890 paper written in German in a journal that no longer exists? No. But it was the the discovery of this particular subject and should be acknowledged when discussing it.",

      "text": "> or do they just read the abstracts?\n\nUsually abstract and conclusion.  Sometimes more, depending on what I need to get from it.  Obviously it's not necessary to read every paper word for word, especially since there will be parts I already understand well, and parts I don't need to understand for the purposes of my work.\n\n> or do they just read someone elses\u2019 literature review and cite what they said about the paper?\n\nTechnically this is very bad practice, but I'm sure some researchers do it.  I always look for the primary source and if I can't find it, I'll cite the citing paper and their claim about the original work rather than just the original work.",
