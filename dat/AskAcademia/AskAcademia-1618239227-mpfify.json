  "title:": "My advisor was sexually inappropriate - how can I get around a letter of recommendation from him for PhD applications?",
  "text": "Background: I finished my undergraduate a few years ago. Research was my passion, but this burned me out and I've been too afraid to go back. I'm also not in the US.\n\nLong story short, my advisor was a creep to me, I don't want to elaborate in case he's on this subreddit. I know he uses Reddit a lot. I didn't really work with anyone else in the department, and I have no interest in reporting it - it's well known, my department doesn't care. I also don't want to bring this up in a new application, I don't want to seem like I'm slandering someone - and frankly, it's probably irrational, but I'd feel unprofessional talking about it.\n\nI'm finally in a place where I want to apply for my PhD, but I don't know how to explain the fact I won't have a letter of reference from the person I did my undergraduate thesis with. I honestly don't even know who else I can ask for a letter from - it's been so long since I left that I don't think any professors would remember me.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can frame this without it coming off as unprofessional, or like *I* did something to sour the relationship?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks Reddit.",

If you don't have a letter of recommendation from you undergrad thesis supervisor it will raise questions, but if you tell them why it won't be an issue.

You just need to get 3 letters for must universities so you'll need to find someone else to write one.",

          "text": "Also in the humanities and also did not get a LOR from my advisor because of work relationship being far more tense due to direction choices for my thesis. I was still proud of the work and used it as a writing sample and in the end they were helpful. I went with other professors for my LORs from other courses I had taken in grad school which was helped by attending the same institution for undergrad and masters, so I recognize I was lucky to already have some working relationship with those profs. \n\nLastly, I fully agree with your point 2; a PhD is a long-term commitment and being in a poor environment that would not understand your prior situation as target to inappropriate behaviour sounds like an institution not worth fettering to, especially when the post-grad job market for humanities PhDs is not necessarily brimming with opportunity.",

I wouldn't have expected them to be unprofessional and lie about my work or anything underhanded, but I also just felt like going back and asking for something when I wanted to move on was not worth it. If you're thinking about it in terms of a workplace, I wouldn't ask the person I disagreed with on a lot of my work for a recommendation, I would ask the other employees with rank that did support me to provide a recommendation instead. If the new employer asks I explain why. And if they don't understand the idea that \"there's always 1 prof in every department that's extremely difficult to deal with\", then they probably are that prof and crisis averted.",

I don't think you need to bring this up in an application, but my impression is that things have changed *a lot* in the last 20, even 10 years. 10 years ago, at least in my old department, the default position -- even for people who were otherwise concerned etc. and disliked the offender intensely -- was to sweep it under the rug and move on. Not that they don't need to change more. But I think that there are a lot of people who would be sympathetic, and given that it's an open secret in your old department, some people at other departments probably know about the offender as well. Finally, it can't hurt to ask other professors / teaching assistants / faculty (I don't know where you are, what the structure of the dept. is) if they would be willing to write for you. I think it is fine to have letters from people who don't know you so well but have taken the time to re-read your previous work and maybe something else you have done since then (maybe a sample for your new applications). I hope that some of those people will understand that it is their responsibility and part of their jobs to support good students who want to go one. When we do graduate applications here we don't worry too much about who is writing the letters.\n\nBest of luck.",

This would take you a few years, though, because you might have to apply for the master\u2019s now, get letters for your PhD application during your second year, after you\u2019ve taken classes with some people, and then start the PhD the year after.",

This may seem like a crazy idea but can you bring it up somehow in a personal statement or a diversity statement broadly to show what you\u2019re overcoming to apply to a PhD? I also wanted to point out that even if that department doesn\u2019t care, you could go to higher levels at the university. That said you could also ask the department chair for a letter of rec.",

That's the general policy I've seen from most UK universities. \n\nI'd say it shouldn't be a problem to get around a letter from him (or even from the uni at all), since it's a while ago and therefore not the most relevant reference you can produce.\n\nI hope this helps and that you'll get the PhD position you want!",
