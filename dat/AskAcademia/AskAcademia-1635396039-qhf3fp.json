  "text": "I\u2019ve had an interview for the research fellowship. Pretty much dream position right up my alley. I think that the interview went really well. \n\nNow\u2026 it\u2019s been nearly 4 weeks and I haven\u2019t yet heard back. During the interview they said \u2018we need a candidate to start yesterday\u2019 but also \u2018don\u2019t be concerned if it takes a while, things are going slow here\u2019. My hopes are slowly dying\u2026 should I just wait? Follow up? If so, what\u2019s the best way to do so without getting across as pushy?\n\nWhen I log in into the online portal it still says \u2018under consideration\u2019 but it\u2019s been 2 months since submitting the application and nearly 4 weeks since the interview.",

      "text": "You shouldn't dwell on it, and tbh, you shouldn't expect a positive outcome either. Usually, these kinds of delays mean they are negotiating with their preferred candidate(s), and all candidates are notified of the outcome only after that candidate is signed. Unfortunately even if you have a good interview, others may have had better, it's not really a good yardstick for measuring success. While it's tricky not to keep checking, but it's best to think of it as an unsuccessful application, and if it turns out not to be, be pleasantly surprised.",

(You don't want to come off as unreasonable when they are weighing candidates...) You are four weeks in after the interview, and I would say you are way beyond \"too soon\". E-mail the HR person and ask what's up.",

          "text": "The thing is they also said that they are interviewing candidates that week and week after. So if I assume being amongst early interviewed candidates, those other ones would be waiting less time following their interviews\u2026but yeah, i am probably overthinking it and should just email them. After 4 weeks it can\u2019t be seen as \u2018too early\u2019 and if it is probably not the healthiest work environment. This isn\u2019t my first application but it never took nearly this long to know the outcome.",
