  "title:": "How do I tell my supervisor that my assigned grad student is doing no work?",
  "text": "I\u2019m an undergrad with a physics research internship. A few weeks in he told a grad student to work with me but he literally never does any work and takes up all the meeting time pretending he did. I can\u2019t even get a word in or say what I\u2019ve actually done all the while he puts on some show which I\u2019m really hoping the supervisor sees through. I even tell him before the meetings that I have stuff to show but he uses up the time himself anyway and talks about irrelevant things related to his grad program. I even let him speak first out of courtesy and he used it against me!\n\nI\u2019m going to work extra hard this week to emphasize the difference between us to the supervisor but does anyone have any recs on how to handle this situation? My professor is pretty direct and I think and would appreciate me telling me but I just don\u2019t know what would be good phrasing.\n\nThis is quite an important project to me and my PhD and I really need it to go well but it\u2019s hard to make progress with him around. I liked it better with just me and the supervisor especially after realizing a grad student is barely any help at all.",

      "text": "Send your supervisor an email, or say this at the end of a one-on-one meeting if you have those regularly: \"Hey, can we have a chat about how it's going with me working with GradStudent? I have some things on my mind.\"\n\nThen enter that chat with some concrete examples that demonstrate your point. \"In meetings, GradStudent is only pretending to have done work\" is not a strong example because it relies on your judgement of the grad student's statements -- for example, your supervisor could easily disagree based on how they judge people. So, instead you want specific examples, like \"GradStudent said they would have the code written by early July, but it's still not done, and it's keeping me from doing that special analysis.\"\n\nAs in my made-up example above, your examples should also be things that pertain to you, because your job here is not to expose GradStudent as a lazy do-nothing (only their supervisor should worry about that), but to explain how GradStudent is holding you back in your own work. Your supervisor *will* care about that aspect.\n\nAlso mention that you feel like you're not getting a chance in meetings to present your own results. This is a separate issue, and very easily remedied by your supervisor. Just let them know that you're trying to be polite and make sure everyone else has space to speak, but now the meetings keep running out of time for you to speak, so maybe Supervisor can call on you or something every meeting? This is a great request because it's an easy fix.",

          "text": "This is good advice. I'll highlight some additional aspects.\n\nFirst of all, this situation is extremely common to occur in workplaces of any type, so learning how to handle it now, with grace and efficiency, is going to be super helpful. In fact, you might want to read the excellent workplace advice blog Ask A Manager for many examples of similar situations. Sure, your student status and the academic environment make a difference but not as much as you might think.\n\nSecond, and I'm slightly diverging from /u/pb-pretzels here, is: Your goal should be to get what you need from your professor and from this internship. Not to punish / manage / change the behavior of the grad student. The two are related of course, but the grad student is only your problem insofar as they stand in your way. I would therefore advise that the focus of your meeting with your prof is how to solve your obstacles: \"I am not getting to report what I have to say in our meetings\", \"I do not get the code I need at the time I need to make the progress I should be making\" etc. Insofar as you talk about the grad student, keep to facts: \"They originally said they'd get me X by \\[date\\], but I haven't received it yet\" or \"we were supposed to meet weekly, but the meetings are canceled at the last minute\"... or whatever the concrete problem is. Positively stating what it is you aim for is best: \"I really need some allotted time to speak in our meetings rather than having GradStudent speak for both of us.\" Keep away from speculations about judgements (\"they're lazy, mean and devious\") or even stuff like \"they aren't doing any work\" -- that's for the professor to judge.\n\nThe more you present yourself as professional and focussed on outcomes, the more likely it is you will get what you need out of this situation.",

It is way more professional to frame things like this (and like /u/pyrola_asarifolia demonstrates in this comment) than with judgements and speculations. Most people in undergrad have not learned this yet, so the professionalism in this approach will really make you stand out -- which will in turn help your supervisor see you more easily as a peer (or at least not aspiring-peer), so they'll be more likely to impart other bits of \"unspoken knowledge\" (either intentionally or unconsciously) that gets you ahead in professional environments down the line. Or at least that's the way it worked out for me, anyway.",

                  "text": "And sometimes the undergrad does not realize that work *is* being done by the grad student, but that work is much more specialized/difficult than what the undergrad is dealing with.\n\nShowing up with a python script that only has 10 lines of code in it does not necessarily mean the grad student only spent a few minutes working on it.\n\nI dealt with a similar situation last year, albeit with another Grad student. In a group of 4 grad students students, we were working on a project that tied into the PhD thesis of one of the group members. Then there was Bob, Steve, and myself. Steve essentially provided the foundation to our project, since it was based on his thesis, and we were all expanding upon it. Bob and I weren't super familiar with the topic, but we're both pretty good at debugging code, so we helped with that. Meanwhile, Tom was writing code... That never, ever worked without *a lot* of debugging. But, whatever, that is coding - or so Bob and I thought. After everything is submitted to the class, the professor emails us all essentially saying 'due to feedback about group contributions, I am debating splitting credit for the project to be 50% for Tom, 30% for Steve, and 10% each for Bob and McFly. Let me know what you guys think'. Thankfully, Steve stepped up and essentially called out Bob for trying to claim more credit than he deserved (especially since it was based on Steve's own research), and we were able to provide our Git logs to show who exactly contributed what. But still. Tom was pissed off over what was essentially a communication issue, because Bob and I both worked full-time jobs and couldn't always be glued to the slack or group text.\n\nI would also note that Tom was the only group member with zero industry experience. Everyone else was either working in a related industry already, or had four a few years between their undergrad and graduate programs. Tom was essentially a fifth-year MS student, and aside from a couple of internships, had never worked a day in their lives. Knowing how to communicate professionally, and what actually counts as poor communication, are very critical skills that schools don't always teach.",

He might be new to mentoring and thinks that the information he's giving you is helpful (for instance, perhaps he thinks you plan to go to a grad program, and therefore first-hand knowledge about what it's like to be in a grad program will help you). Be direct, but courteous. Because he doesn't seem to pick up on nuance, be as clear as possible: \"GradStudent, I need to talk to you. I am having trouble making progress on this project with you, for these reasons: \\[list them, and be specific but neutral and brief.\\] Based on your experience, do you think that these issues can improve, or would you recommend I speak to \\[advisor\\] about working independently / with a different grad student?\"\n\nKeep in mind that no matter how neutrally you state the facts, he is likely to receive this feedback with defensiveness. It is human nature. If you are able to soften it with positive feedback, and try to view the situation from his perspective, it will likely be better-received.",

It will damage the relationship between you and that person, who you may need to work with in some capacity (even if indirectly) for a long time.

My mentor basically explained to them that was basically the whole point, and that the reason I was working with them closely when we were recruitng people at first was because the project was complicated. When I noticed they were doing well, my advisor had my taper off my support and assist another grad student. This graduate student had a great project idea, but was extremely lazy. I ended up having to scout out locations for research, and assist my mentor with working on their thesis till 9 pm. Each situation is unique and an open discussion with your supervisor is needed. It could be that the supervisor assigned the other grad student tasks especially if it is not just you, the supervisor, and the grad student in the lab.",
