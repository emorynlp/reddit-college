  "text": "I'm going to be instructing my first course early next year (March) and would very much like some advice, suggestions, stories, and recommendations for how to structure and go about teaching! I do have teaching and tutoring experience and am confident in my abilities but never steered and lectured a course solo before.  \n\nIt is a 2nd/3rd-year course in Signals and Systems (for my fellow EE's, you might remember doing endless Fourier transforms for LTIs). Now, I'm pretty confident with this material as I've used it every day at work and my Ph.D. uses this content heavily, however, I am a little concerned that I am very young - 23 - and hope that people will take me seriously as I'd only be 2-3 years older than some of my students. My initial thought is to dress up a little bit more (which I already do as a matter of personality) but would be curious to know other thoughts. \n\nI have good support from my advisor who has kindly provided all manner of resources and sample lectures, recordings, etc but I would be curious to know what other suggestions people would have for me to consider and keep in mind!",

      "text": "I would highly recommend reading this book this semester: [Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Its-Best-Research-Based-Instructors/dp/1119096324) It has more ideas than you can or should possibly implement in your first semester, but it will give you some pointers and things to try that you might not have thought of. \n\nAlso, if your university has a teaching and learning center, tap into them to see if they have any additional resources or coaching they could provide. Many institutions do have these, and they tend to be underutilized. They might also be able to connect you with others who are new to teaching, with whom you can form a network to support each other. \n\nFrom me personally -- as someone who started teaching at age 24, 27 years ago: \n\n- Whatever you do in class, keep students involved. The Teaching at its Best book has a lot in it about active learning, and if you get students involved during class this will help them learn and stay motivated. It also takes the focus off of you and puts it back on the students and their learning. \n- Confidence in yourself and your grasp of the material, along with enthusiasm about the material and what students are learning, go a LONG way. \n- But also be ready to listen to what students are telling you about their experiences and keep them involved in the class, not just the activities. Confidence is great; arrogance and inflexibility suck.",

      "text": "Not to pry, but in the immortal words of one of the world\u2019s most famous professors: Are you a boy? Or are you a girl? Or something else entirely / non-binary? How inherently authoritative and commanding would you say your presence is? Any advice you receive seems like it\u2019d necessarily have to accommodate the broader social context in which you\u2019re perceived. I\u2019ve had friends with PhDs express concern over their lack of authority in the classroom, attributing it to their status as petite, youthful women. Conversely, as a 6\u20192\u201d 220lb guy I never experienced a tiny fraction of their struggle from my first time teaching (as instructor of record of an upper div course) at 21, even when students found out I was one of the youngest in the room lol.\n\nFor example, one scenario could involve how you respond to challenging questions whose answers you do not know. Do you openly disclaim your ignorance? Tell the student it\u2019s outside the scope of the current lesson and to come chat to you after class? Give a somewhat confusing explanation with lots of technical jargon to signal your obvious familiarity? I feel different strategies might play better depending on how you\u2019re more broadly perceived.\n\nOne more generic suggestion could be to visually separate yourself from them in the manner of dress by picking clothes one or two rungs up in formality from whatever they\u2019re generally wearing. If they\u2019re in gym shorts and tanks, come wearing smart of business casual. If they\u2019re in button-ups and chinos, throw on a jacket & tie. Etc.",

      "text": "I get where you are coming from. I started tutoring during my Masters program when I was about 21 and would have been 22 when I started teaching in my PhD program. Does your PhD program have a teaching development/professional development program embedded? Does your uni have a central education support team that run seminars and things like that? Getting in and amongst any kind of community of practitioners is a great piece of advice. \n\nIn addition, I would echo /u/Rtalbert235's comment on learning from literature. Another few books that I would recommend would be [Becoming a Critically Reflective Teacher](https://www.wiley.com/en-ad/Becoming+a+Critically+Reflective+Teacher%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119049708) and [Teaching as a design science](https://www.routledge.com/Teaching-as-a-Design-Science-Building-Pedagogical-Patterns-for-Learning/Laurillard/p/book/9780415803878).\n\nMore broadly, the best advice I can give you is that it's going to be a journey, and just focus on doing the best you can, and reflecting along the way. Further, to the best of your ability try to be authentic in the classroom. Don't overcompensate and try and be a 23-year-old PhD student acting like a 50year old laureate fellow. If you are authentic and passionate I think students will generally see that and respect/respond to it. However, do be aware to draw boundaries as at a younger age its easier for students to start treating you like a friend though I would strongly suggest you create and maintain firm professional boundaries that are aligned to your broady institutional, and cultural context.",
