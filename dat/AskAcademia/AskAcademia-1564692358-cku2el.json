Document. Document. Document. Hopefully, you will never need it but if things go pearshaped you are going to need every piece of corroborating evidence you can get. \n\nYou probably don't want to use the university email to do this in case your supervisor can read it or depending on your field if there is a chance your email could ever be subpoenaed (for example maybe you do drug development research that could be part of an intellectual property case). It might be even better if you could document this by telling someone about this and then emailing them but the person should not be another academic it should be somebody like a sibling or a counselor not associated with a university.",

It can easily impair people's ability to consent, and often does in a wide range of situations. This is bad.\n\nAnd it's also true that in any sane sense of the word \"responsibility,\" an adult PhD advisee who chooses to sleep with their advisor bears *some* measure of responsibility for their choosing. Otherwise, you rob the notion of \"choice\" of all meaning whatsoever.\n\nNo question, by the way, that the advisor is fundamentally in the wrong, while the advisee is just making questionable choices, but it's unhelpful to overstate the case here precisely because *nearly all* human interactions are structured by power gradients that diminish capacity of one party or the other for consent.\n\nThat's exactly what so many second-wave feminists hoped to sidestep via radical lesbianism (until it turned out that gender performance in queer relationships *also* has power dynamics).\n\nPhD advisor and advisee is, without question, a potentially very intense power dynamic that entails substantial diminishment of agency for the latter. That's why most reasonable people recognize that the former bears a level of culpability for their actions that the latter does not.\n\nBut you don't help anyone (except maybe MRAs) by hyperbolically asserting that in such a situation consent is impossible or that one party has no responsibility or agency. Especially on a post where OP has described their own experience in terms of agency, which you are then denying them by insisting that you--with no knowledge of their particular situation--are the one who *actually* knows the meaning of their experience.\n\nAll of that? Don't do it, please.",

Every human relationship involves some level of power imbalance, sure, but we are talking specifically about a case where one actor in the encounter has the potential to influence the employment status of the other. We are not talking generally about queer or any other type of relationships.\n\nI have also not taken away OP\u2019s agency at any point. Just going by what OP has stated here, they consented in engaging in the encounter. That does not mean the encounter itself was consensual, and it certainly was not consensual from the advisor\u2019s perspective. That\u2019s because it cannot be consensual when one party has the potential to influence the other party\u2019s employment status. When the advisor in this situation engages in the sexual encounter, they cannot reasonably disentangle consent given by the OP from agreeableness due to a desire to maintain employment status. It is necessary to frame these encounters in this way in order to provide workplace protections for laborers. And yes, students in this case are employees, regardless of whether the university has yet to realize that. They provide labor and are paid to do so.\n\nI think you are confusing agency and responsibility here. Even though OP truly consented here, the advisor is still in the wrong, and they should be penalized accordingly. At the very least, the power imbalance should immediately be removed from this situation by a changing of advisors, and it should be up to the student to determine if they would like to pursue further course of action by means of a third party arbitrator (not an office at the university). In this case, because the OP consented, I imagine they would not choose to pursue further action. Either way, that should be their choice. This is *entirely* about ensuring the student has agency. None of this makes what the advisor did acceptable, and the responsibility for any fallout or harm that comes from this situation is *entirely* the responsibility of the advisor, in terms of who should be penalized. Agency and responsibility are very different, and I don\u2019t think my previous comments were conflating them.",

By definition, if both parties consent, then the encounter was consensual. Obviously there are a range of factors to consider when determining what that consent means in practice, but at the same time, no social interaction is ever perfectly equitable - from one perspective or another there is always going to be a power imbalance. Clearly we have to draw the line somewhere and most people these days would agree with you that the power imbalance in a supervisor/student relationship is steep enough that sexual interactions between the two are inherently dangerous and risk coercion, should be avoided, and, where they occur, that the blame for the transgression should fall on the senior partner - the supervisor.\n\nBut that is absolutely not the same as saying that any and all supervisor/student liaisons are to be equated with sexual assault and harassment, or that all such encounters are non-consensual; nor, equally, that anyone disagreeing with you on those points fundamentally disrespects women. That is an incredibly hyperbolic and ungrounded discourse (as well as being, itself, problematically gendered).",

In this case, even though the personal experience of both actors were consensual, the supervisor cannot ever be certain of the student's consent because of the power balance. There is always an implicit motivation to verbally consent, even quite agreeably, to protect employment status. That means that it was not a consensual interaction because even though the student can experience consent and give consent, the supervisor cannot reasonably receive consent and be confident in the student's consent. Proceeding to engage in a sexual encounter without certainty of the other actor's consent is sexual assault.\n\nIt's a very different situation but the same argument for why people cannot give consent when they are drunk: the sober actor in the encounter cannot be certain of the other actor's consent.\n\n> that is absolutely not the same as saying that any and all supervisor/student liaisons are to be equated with sexual assault and harassment, or that all such encounters are non-consensual; nor, equally, that anyone disagreeing with you on those points fundamentally disrespects women\n\nAll of these encounters are, by definition, non-consensual directly because of the steep power imbalance that creates an implicit motivation for coercion. Non-consensual sexual interactions are quite literally cases of sexual assault - I don't know how else to interpret that. Allowing supervisors to engage in sexual encounters with students who are afraid to not say yes (Thankfully, that's not what OP's experience was in this case) disproportionately affects women because our patriarchal society more often puts them on the student side of this relationship. Failing to acknowledge the seriousness of power dynamics in a workplace relationship harms women more often than men, so yes it is disrespectful to women.\n\nThere is a very simple solution that avoids this entire scenario and maintains the dignity and agency of students who are afraid not to give verbal consent: remove the power imbalance. If a relationship or encounter of any kind is desired, just switch advisors.",

He eventually would ask me to do work that he would later credit to her, including one where she won a prestigious grant from our professional society that was probably instrumental in her getting into medical school. \n\nThis was 7 years ago. It took me 2 years to recover from the mess in this lab. I'm lucky I still graduated. \n\nYour PI has more responsibility here being in the position of power, as others have mentioned. But there is collateral damage in these situations. And if it's as you say, that tensions have been building for some time, you can bet you haven't been as secretive as you think you have. \n\nCut off all behavior like that and move on.

In that sense it is directly analogous to reporting a crime to the police.  They may consider what a victim wants, but ultimately it is a matter between the government and the defendant regarding an alleged violation of the law.",

      "text": "I am so sorry you are having to deal with this. I completely understand just how thrilled you may feel at the moment, but also, I feel your concern. Try not to panic. As someone else pointed out, relationships between advisee and advisor sometimes lead to beautiful relationships. In others, not so much. At this point, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helpful to talk about \u201cshould have\u2019s,\u201d so I\u2019ve written out a few practical things to consider.\n\n1. Read your institution\u2019s policy regarding intimate relationships between members of the community. There is a wide range of rights and responsibilities that you need to be aware of\u2014every institution is different (sometimes wildly). For instance, my current institution just added a new regulation that requires that ALL relationships be reported to HR, no matter how fleeting (obviously CYA for the institution, and legally questionable\u2014this is something you will need to grapple with).\n\n2. IF (and only IF) you have a trusted academic advisor / senior faculty member with whom you can share this with and can ask for real, grounded advice relevant to your department, institution, and discipline as a whole, then do it. Before you do, you need to be absolutely clear about your institution\u2019s \u201cmandatory reporting\u201d policy and your trusted confidant\u2019s position on the policy (there is no actual legal imperative that faculty act as mandatory reporters, so many have made an agreement to act upon the reporter\u2019s wishes). If your institution holds all faculty responsible for reporting any questionable sexual engagements (and unfortunately, given the power differential between you and your advisor, this will be considered inappropriate), then you may need to go outside of your institution to have this discussion. If there is no faculty either in your home institution or your discipline more widely that you feel comfortable taking to, then a visit to the ombudsperson may be helpful. But, before you divulge anything to him or her, you need to first ask what their role is (for instance, at my current institution, the ombudsperson was NOT a neutral party and, therefore, I could not trust this person\u2014the role has since been dissolved).\n\n3. You need to have a serious conversation with your advisor about how you will be moving forward\u2014preferably on neutral ground, away from the institution and not at either of your homes. This may be difficult, but it is incredibly important that you have a candid conversation and lay out your feelings and expectations. If you choose to move forward with the relationship (even if you intend to keep it to yourselves) it is imperative that you find a new advisor. This will protect both of you. If you are of the mind that this person is the only or best advisor for our academic advancement and career, then you will need to make a very difficult decision about which is more important: the relationship or your academic career.\n\nAnd finally (and I\u2019m sorry to have to add this, but it is important to be aware of\u2014I am the biggest romantic and am hoping for the best of all possible outcomes):\n\n4. If, in your conversation with either a faculty member or otherwise, you may learn some unpleasant truths (e.g., this is part of a broader pattern of behavior of said advisor\u2014which I am ardently hoping it is not), it might be prudent to have a chat with the Title IX coordinator. Before you do, find out as much as you can about how they will use any information you share with them. Anonymity can only be guaranteed to a very limited extent. If a certain number of reporters have come forward, it can trigger a full investigation, regardless of reporters\u2019 wishes (at my current institution, that threshold is three). Once an investigation is instigated, anonymity is no longer guaranteed as the report must be sent as evidence to the defense attorney with all identifying information. Accordingly, anyone who views evidence in a Title IX case is bound by nondisclosure to not divulge any details of what they have read (again, this may be institutionally specific, so be sure to ask).\n\nI have, i\u2019m sure, left important things out, and I certainly don\u2019t intend to be alarmist. I know how confusing and difficult this must be to navigate, particularly given how complex the often shrouded and unwritten rules that everyone else seems to know are, coupled with the intense (and mixed) feelings you are having at the moment.  As for your career, so long as you can be discreet and sort out any potential ethical issues quickly and quietly, you should be fine. These things happen, and even in the worst of circumstances, academics are not naive. We know these things happen, for better or worse your work will stand for itself.\n\nSending big hugs.\n\nEdit/\nQualification: TT professor at R1 institution that is currently going through sexual misconduct lawsuit in a STEM field (across campus) and have recently been required to go through numerous training sessions as part of the institution\u2019s redress",

It really is something that could damage, derail or end your career prospects.\n\n\nWell, game over. \n\n1.) This reflects very badly on both you and your adviser. Schools will avoid you because you are unable to manage a professional relationship.\n\n2.)  Every single one of your accomplishments under this advisor, and all achievements going forward are now going to be perceived as ill-gotten gains. \n\n3.) If word gets out, no one will take your advisor's recommendations for your work seriously anymore -- they will lose all power to be a strong advocate for your work.\n\n4.) Your relationship with the most important person in your academic career is now fraught with personal tensions.\n\nThe best situation would be if you and your advisor forgot about this as quickly as possible and pretended this didn't happen, and no one ever learns about it. But the chance of that happening are small to none.\n\nGood luck!",

The advisor has a strong incentive to do so and OP doesn't seem to want to say anything either. \n\nBut these potential consequences are very real and I think it's good that someone laid them out for OP. That isn't to say OP shouldn't disclose to the Title IX office or HR if they feel violated or the advisor starts treating them poorly, but if they want to keep things secret then need to be very careful to do exactly that.\n\nAlso I have to say, if \"tension has been building\" for a while then it's fairly probable that other people have noticed. It doesn't take much for people to start gossiping and even baseless gossip can be damaging to a fledgling career, fair or not. OP should really strive to create and enforce strong professional boundaries with their advisor going forward because it sounds like their relationship was already too close before this happened.",
