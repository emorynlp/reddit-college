  "title:": "Is presenting at the MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference worth it?",
  "text": "Hello all!\n\nI found out that I got accepted to present at MIT URTC \\[[https://urtc.mit.edu/](https://urtc.mit.edu/)\\] to present a poster. This year the conference is virtual.\n\nHowever, I have to pay $120-$160 to present for 10 minutes. \\[I don't have IEEE membership so I'm trying to get a membership so the price is reduced\\]\n\n**My question is, is this conference even meaningful/prestigious? Is it even worth it to present/who will see it?**\n\n**What does this mean for my research? Will it get published in poster form on IEEE or something like that?**\n\n**\\[I'm also a high schooler, so I'm not really sure how much weight or importance I should put into this\\]**\n\nIs it worth it to mention on a resume...how hard is it to get accepted?\n\nBased on last year's conference only 32 posters got accepted to present, and my application number for this year said I was #100 ish for posters.\n\nI'm pretty new to the world of research presentation and publication and would appreciate any guidance.\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, I'll repost somewhere else if necessary.\n\n**So far, I'm leaning towards presenting, but I'd like to hear the opinion of others in Academia and people more experienced than me because I'm virtually clueless.**\n\nThanks all!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: grammar\n\nedit 2: Clarification that the cost to present is the cost of conference registration. On the website it says you have to register and then click 'Accepted presenter non IEEE member'",

      "text": "I think this would be a good experience if you haven\u2019t done a lot of CV-grade presentations before. Just try to make the most of it by engaging the audience and getting involved in other conference activities where you can get a feel for how scientific conferences work. Remember that science careers involve a massive amount of delayed gratification so the \u2018payoff\u2019 for individual experiences (even ones that take a ton of your time and sometimes money) may not be obvious but the cumulative effect of a persistent commitment to broad scientific activities is obvious to those who are selecting for grad programs, positions etc.",

      "text": "So this varies drastically based on your field, specialty, and goals.\n\nI\u2019m in neuroscience and always consider too many conferences a huge red flag.  Why is someone more interested in attending conferences than advancing their work\u2014it gives insight into priorities.\n\nHowever, if you were to have only a single conference and it were to be the one you are talking about, I would take it as a positive and you would stand out to me, especially as an undergraduate.\n\nThe red flags for me are mainly when I see someone with a PhD who attended four conferences per year.  \n\nI think my view is common among the, for lack of a better word, hard core science labs in academia.  \n\nCertain fields, like anthropology for example, don\u2019t have much to do other than go to conferences.  \n\nIf your goal is private industry, whether in a consulting position or at the bench initially with the goal to climb up the administrative ladder (and don\u2019t fall into the bias prevalent in academia against private industry\u2014there are tons of perks and dynamics that are fun and interesting there (I have a couple good friends in Biotech, whereas I stayed in Academia)\u2014then these types of conferences look good.\n\nBut in the end, it\u2019s not a CV check mark you should be after.  You can feel out some of the people in different labs or companies, which will give you a better idea where you want to go to grad school or get a job.  Pick people first, when deciding what to do after undergraduate. If you hit it off with a group, your CV is basically inconsequential and you\u2019ll be able to end up there if you want. \n\nGood luck.\n\n* Yes I know I write a lot. I type fast.",

This would be my first conference ever, and my research wasn't too unique, it was more of an addendum and modification from others that I worked on for a year.

A lame conference at MIT or Harvard is going to look a lot more impressive on a CV down the line (esp. at an early stage) than an amazing one at a mid-tier school. Shouldn't be the case, but it is.",
