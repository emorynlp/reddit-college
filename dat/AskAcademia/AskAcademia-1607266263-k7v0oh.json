  "text": "My current postdoc position is ending early next year, and I'm starting to look for my next position.\n\nJust wondering what is the etiquette regarding some of my previous work colleagues who are now at other universities. I don't mean previous supervisors, direct collaborators but for example admin staff from my PhD who I am on friendly terms with. Or other grad students I worked with before who are now at other universities. Is there some line that should be drawn when reaching out to your network?",

I think if you knew each other and are on good terms it shouldn't be an issue at all.\n\nWhere it comes to recommendations I would make sure you had worked with them enough for them to feel comfortable recommending you. Just give them an out when you ask and make it clear you won't be offended (e.g. \"If don't feel you've seen enough of my work to be comfortable recommending me that's totally fine, but if you do I would greatly appreciate your help\").",

      "text": "Prior to getting the job I ended up getting, I had drawn up contingency plans (in my head) for this sort of thing. I was interested in non-academic jobs primarily in this, but maybe this would be similar. The e-mail I had planned to send would be to a lot of people, and would be along the lines of, \"My postdoc is ending and I'm looking for work opportunities \u2014\u00a0if by chance you know of any, or of people I ought to reach out to, let me know! I'm interested in X, Y, and Z, but would also be interested in things that have to do with A, B, and C.\" \n\nThe goal here was not to make it look like I was begging anyone for a job \u2014 that's awkward for everyone \u2014\u00a0or that I was assuming that there would be some position that would magically show up for me (or be made for me), but rather that there might be opportunities I wasn't aware of, especially of the non-TT, or even non-academic sort, that might be out there. Which is almost certainly true. Even academic jobs are sometimes hard to \"see\" (I wouldn't have applied to the TT job I ultimately got if someone hadn't explicitly pointed it out to me, because it wasn't listed in the sorts of places I had been looking). It can't hurt to let people know that you're on the market; you never know how it might come up in a conversation. Certainly for short-term work it can be of value (e.g., adjuncting or things like that), because those positions are often created with specific people in mind.",

If there's a vacancy, it'll be advertised when they're ready to anyway; and it might be a little awkward in the sense that if they're serving as a source of information for you at their new institute, it could easily come across as implicit support for one particular candidate (however much it's denied explicitly).",

That\u2019s how lots of jobs work- they hire people they know or people who work there in other jobs. There is tons of research showing if you have some contact with people or just see them a few times you like them more, rank them more highly, etc..... everyone should be using that the best they can. Plus it shows that you\u2019re interested. I\u2019m applying for jobs right now and I most certainly am using my connections even when it will be public jobs.",

I pitched a project to them and asked if they\u2019d consider taking me as a postdoc and they did. 2nd postdoc ended with a faculty job and a short time later a career development award. So, yeah it can work but a lot of things fell the right way for me.",
