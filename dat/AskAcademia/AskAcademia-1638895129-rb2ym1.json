  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nMaybe it's a little late to ask this question...but I would really appreciate all suggestions. I would love to hear any advice on choosing a PhD in public policy program.\n\n**Background:** I got a Bachelor of Economics (my major was public finance) from China with a GPA of 3.84/5.0. I ranked third out of 41 people. I also got an MPA from USC, and my GPA was 3.77. My GRE is V158+Q168+AW4.0. I have two recommendation letters from my professors in China and one strong letter from a professor at USC.\n\nI have submitted applications for the PP/PA Phd program at Delaware, FSU, GWU, PSU, NC States, and the joint PP/Econ program at Tufts and CMU. I just feel like it would be better to apply for some more programs, but unfortunately, I can hardly find any relevant information on Chinese websites. Could you recommend some programs to which I might have a higher chance of getting admission? I really do not want to take another gap year\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\n\nAppreciate all the help!",
