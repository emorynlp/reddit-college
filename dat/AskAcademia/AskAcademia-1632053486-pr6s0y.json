  "text": "For example, in computer science it might be helpful to have a tool that will keep track of variable name definitions in equations (i.e., highlight all instances of the variable and give definition upon hovering). That way, you don't have to keep searching backwards for what *z* represents.\n\nI'm curious what the most annoying part of papers in other fields are. We have so many cool tech tools at our disposal but reading PDFs of papers is still pretty non-interactive.",

These are small issues that add up the frustration quickly. \n\nIt also suffers a lot of the lack of quality of life improvements. For example, the inking has worse quality than other good note-taking apps. The text editing is very cumbersome to use. The lack of OCR makes navigating a large workspace painful.\n\nI\u2019ve sent a lot of detailed feedbacks to the developer during the last 4 years. But nothing really changed during the course. Now they\u2019ve come up with an extremely expensive service to enable syncing, which are also quite buggy, slow, and have security/privacy concerns. \n\nI really hope its technology being picked up by the open source community.

Some pdfs even are generated with hyperlinks on eq. references, these could simply open a tab/division.\n\nFor double column papers on a phone, have a button that disables horizontal movement, so you can scroll down a column easily.\n\nAlso for phones: no scrolling bar popping in and out of existence, making you suddenly skip 40 pages because of a misstouch. No need for scrolling bar, just put a decently sized page number thingy on top: if you need to scroll like a lot, then tap on the number thingy and scroll through the page numbers till your destination!\n\nGod damn, I didn't know I felt so passionately for these things.",
