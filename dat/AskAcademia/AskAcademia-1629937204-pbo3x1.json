  "text": "So I'm used to the ups and downs of funding situations and I try to keep it from impacting the students. But sometimes it spills over and I'm having a hard time shielding them from it.  \n\nAnyone have strategies for recruiting students or negotiating projects when funding is uncertain? I try to be as transparent as possible,  but sometimes that seems to be worse. Is it better to just never discuss potential projects until everything is squared away? And I'm just learning things the hard way?",

Too many students get roped in on promises of \"almost certain\" funding only to be left to rot when that doesn't come through. By the time your grant application is rejected, it will be too late for them and *you* will have trapped them in a bad situation. It will be *your* fault. \n\nSo you should tell them that funding is uncertain and that you cannot promise anything. Tell them what the alternatives are when you don't get funding. And suggest they keep their options open and look elsewhere. \n\nIf you can't recruit students because of your funding problems then that sounds like an institutional problem. You either need to wait until you (or the student) has guaranteed funding or your department needs to officially guarantee funding for all accepted students (perhaps with TA/RA work). \n\nApplicants are just being smart when they avoid your group. They're looking at the risks and they're making wise decisions. If anything, you should be concerned about the applicant who would sign on to your group when funding is so uncertain, since that's clearly a poor decision unless they're very wealthy.",
