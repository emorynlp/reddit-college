  "text": "I\u2019m eager to go graduate school for wildlife biology soon. I have a great amount of experience and did exceptionally well in my undergrad career. I\u2019m also currently working for the state department of fish and wildlife. I have already reached out to a few professors to express my research interests. I\u2019ve never really had the opportunity to learn about grant funding during my undergrad though. I really wish my college offered a course on writing grants. That being said, this is all rather new to me. What I really can\u2019t seem to find an answer to is the question of when I should apply for grants. Should I be applying for grants before applying to grad school, or would I collaborate with my advisor after being accepted into a graduate program? Should I wait until one of those professors reaches back to me before applying for grants? Can someone please explain to this novice?",

      "text": "Generally, in the U.S. you would apply for grants in your 1st, or most often, 2nd year of grad school. Most larger research grants require you to be affiliated with a school and mentor already. There are a few smaller awards I believe for people applying to grad schools, but those are mostly to help cover the costs of the applications, interviews, etc.\n\nMost people do not learn (or need to learn) about grants until grad school.",

      "text": "Short answer: the sooner the better. Extra money is always a good thing.\n\nLong answer, which seems to be in a contradiction with the small one. I don't know about US, but in Europe it depends on your level. You have to understand that you might have to compete against other people with much bigger research experience than yours. So in order to win you need to compete with people of your level and slowly scale the ladder. If US has grants for financing graduate studies, then you definitely can apply (programs like this do exist for financing PhDs in Europe). Usually you have to submit a project with a possible advisor, and you get as a reward more money for yourself and for travelling than an average student. But at your level don't expect lots of cash. The best way now, in my opinion, is to enter the grad school first and start learning about funding opportunities from your advisor and older students. In order to write a successful application you will very likely need two things anyway: a) A proposal of someone who already won this grant, b) one or several persons who will proof read it.\n\nI hope that some people from the states will come and explain what grant opportunities you have at your current level. But yeah, more money is always better, if there is a realistic possibility of getting it \ud83d\ude09",
