  "title:": "My married PhD advisor [53 M] is making me [28F] increasingly uncomfortable with borderline romantic gestures/e-mails",
  "text": "I've posted this under /r/relationship and was suggested to post it here as well.\n\nAddendum: I should mention that I really do not want to switch advisors. I have put a ton of work into this project and am only a year away. I pretty much only have to write the thesis and finish up some statistical data analysis. If I go to the department chair or someone above him, I will take more than a year to graduate. My husband is leaving 200miles to start medical school this summer. Every extra month that I take to graduate is another month I can't be with him :(\nAlso, my husband knows everything about this. He wants me to report him. Or blackmail him lol.\n\nI am a Chinese international student about one year away from graduation. I am married (to the best man [26M] ever) and have my Green Card. I have known my advisor for 3 years. For the record, he knows I am married and they have even met when we all went to a college football game (though they didn't talk much at all).\nFor the first year or so, we didn't meet often (like once per week to discuss my research) and it was a very professional relationship. About a year ago, him and I took a trip to a meeting in a far away state for a research conference. During that trip, we went hiking together and became somewhat closer. I was fine with this.\nHe started buying me lunch and inviting me to do things with him. Last birthday (in 2015) he invited me for lunch and afterwards we walked along the river. He asked me about my family and I was telling him about my mother who recently had a stroke and he must have thought that I was sad or something because he grabbed my hand and looked me in the eye and asked if I'm okay. I took my hand away and said yes. Then he was driving me back to lab, and as he parked, my hand was on my thigh and he put his hand on my hand said \"Everything is going to be okay\". I thought he was trying to comfort me at the time.\n\nAfter that, he moved offices to the same building as my lab. So we see each other more often. He gave me his favorite Simon and Garfunkle CD. About two months ago, he took an international business trip and e-mailed me frequently with non-business related items. He finished his first e-mail with \"I actually miss you and will be glad to see you next week\". Then a second email he sent the lyrics to the song \"I am a Rock\" by Simon and Garfunkle and about how he relates to the song's lyrics and wrote some philosophical stuff about love and friendship. I started getting the vibe that he might be romantically interested in me. I replied with a very short e-mail and said that I like the song Cecilia because it sounds happy.\n\nHe replied \"Thank you for writing to me during my time in [Foreign Country]. I really appreciate it. Your e-mail helped transform my times of loneliness in Africa into happy thoughts about you. I feel that our writing during this time helped us to understand each other better and made our friendship stronger. That is very important to me!\" I didn't reply.\n\nAfter he returned, he sent me an email that simply said \"I wrote a poem inspired by you. I would like to recite it to you when I get a chance. I hope you can open your heart and try to understand my words.\" I didn't reply\nThen when we were in lab, he asked me if he could recite it. I said okay and he said he would some time.\nThen he invited me to racquetball last weekend. In the middle of the game, he saw me sweating so he came up and brushed my hair to the side.\n\nThen today, he e-mailed me early this morning about my research project. Shortly after (2 hours ago), he sent this:\nI hope you know that I love you -- I think you must know that. I have not tried to hide my love and growing friendship for you. I feel that you love me also. Your friendship is very important to me. I hope to share the poem I wrote for you, but the poem makes it clear how important you are to me and that I value your friendship. With your permission, I will recite the poem to you, but if you do not want that, I will keep the poem silent. I really want to be respectful of your wishes.\nLove, [Advisor's name]\"\n\nNo reply. Then he sent this e-mail (30 minutes ago):\n\"I am worried that you might think differently about me and that you might be mad at me. From my point of view, nothing has changed. I am your friend and that is the most important thing to me. I like our friendship as it is, and I do not want to lose it.\nLove, [Advisor's name]\"\n\nThen just as I'm writing this, he e-mailed me again asking if I'm mad at him and that he hopes nothing changes and that his friendship with me is very important to him. He then sent me a text message saying the same thing, and signed it \"Love, Advisor\"\n\nThis is making me uncomfortable and I don't know how to let him down easy. I will need his help writing my thesis proposal. The only thing I want is to hurry up and graduate so I can join my husband (he is leaving 200 miles away for medical school this summer and we will be apart for however long it takes me to graduate). My husband was not sure what to do either, so he suggested posting on here.\n\ntl;dr: I think my advisor is romantically interested in me. I just want to graduate without making things weird. What should I do?",

      "text": "(Faculty, FWIW)  .  Let me give one peice of advice:  go with evidence to your department chair now (or Monday) and explain.  This needs to be dealt with swiftly.  You might think this will go away if you reject his advances.  It will not.  You will only open yourself up to more harassment, and even worse, potentially open yourself to losing a political battle.  Think about this phrase: \"if she didn't like it, why did she not complain?\"   As ugly as it is, this is where you might end up unless you bring this to someone's attention RIGHT NOW.\n\nDo not worry about anything else.  With good departmental supervision, you should graduate on time.  You will likely be a sympathic figure and everyone in the department will be falling over trying to help you. At least this is how it would go in my department\n\nPlease keep in mind that it will not get better if you do not go to someone ASAP, it will only get worse.\n\nBest of luck, sorry you had to go through this.",

          "text": "(Faculty too, FWIW). I might recommend Human Resources first. There is a small possibility that the department chair will be sympathetic to the professor (they are likely to be life-long colleagues and know each others' families, whereas students come and go) and rational people can become irrationally protective of people on their \"team.\" In some universities there are ombuds(wo)men who are advocates for the students, and often they might become involved in cases like this. The first point of official contact should be a person or office that is unequivocally on your side (or at least who does not have a potential conflict of interest). Then, you/they/together can approach the department chair or dean. I hate to say it but there is a small but non-zero possibility that the department chair or dean will quash it for the sake of their colleague, or to keep down negative publicity in their turf. There are also many excellent chairs and deans who can handle the situation impartially, but it's really hard to tell beforehand; and there are offices better suited to handle the situation.",

What can one do when it is some form of abuse, not sexual, but perhaps borderline unfair treatment and abuse. Is it no hopes in those cases? What can one do?",

Not much can/is usually done unless there multiple such cases against the same professor; also formal complaints need to be filed or else people who want to help cannot impose any disciplinary action on the faculty member (otherwise action cannot be taken based on \"anecdote\"). For fear of retaliation (or students just leave and don't want to look back), it's often difficult to get a lot of formal complaints filed - but it has happened before. Also, save email records, etc. that supports your case and present them to the ombudsman.",

      "text": "This type of behavior is entirely inappropriate, and eerily similar to a situation that happened at Caltech recently. A professor in astrophysics, Christian Ott, made similar advances (poems and all) toward one of his female graduate students then later fired her when his feelings were not reciprocated. He is currently on a year long leave from the institute. There's an article that was written by Buzzfeed that goes through the full detail of the story ([link here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation)). \n\nIt is unfortunate, but it sounds like your advisor has already tarnished his mentor relationship with you. Your advisor should be an ally for you professionally both in graduate school and later after you graduate. He's there to help you finish a thesis now, but also to get a job later and to help you advance in your career. From the sound of it, there's no way this situation plays out that works well for you. I would strongly recommend looking for another advisor in your department who can help you finish your thesis. \n\nMy advice to you now would be to collect any and all records you have of these interactions (any texts, emails, letters, etc. that he's sent you) and submit them to the deans office, the Title IX office or the department head at your university (or all three of them). This type of conduct between a student and advisor is completely unacceptable, and needs to be stopped as  soon as possible. I cannot say how your university will handle this, but I sincerely hope that they will shut it down immediately. I will also say that if he's behaving this way with you now it's likely that he has done or will do something similar to other students, so if you don't do this for yourself, do it for  every other graduate student who may befall a similar fate.",

I'm married and have no intention or desire of being unfaithful to my husband.\" Hopefully he's just feeling lonely and will get over the rejection -- but in case he doesn't and acts foolish or decides to take some sort of action against you, it'll be important for you to have shown documentation of his forwardness toward you to someone within the department.

Your dept can find you a new advisor, or someone on your committee can step in for him, especially if your project is mostly done. From their perspective, they don't want to fund you for another 5 years either. \n\nYour biggest worry should be how this person can affect your future career. Ditto recommendation letters. But is he the type to get vindictive and try to poison the well? Even assuming that everyone realizes he's a shit (unlikely), this is the type of scandal that makes one notorious. Remember what is happening at UCR right now. I don't know the political situation in your dept and how this will affect it.\n\nBut you do need to address this with someone, if not your chair then Title IX",

If this is the case, you can try suck it up for a year, try to avoid him but finish your degree fast. After you get a job, report his fucking ass. And this kind of things will get him fired. If you do not need a job in academia, and do not need his letter, just report him right now. \n\n\n2. If his behavior is unbearable, which I think it already is, it is totally okay to report him right now. There is no need to wait. You can't be bullied and sexually harassed for the next year. \n\n3. If you worry about finishing your thesis, do you really need this guidance?  If this is just to stamp your thesis saying you pass, I am sure your department can do that for you. These sexual harassment issues are looked at seriously in academia, I am sure that once your voice is heard, the faculty/chair in your department will back you up. Make sure you have all the proofs. \n\n",

Not to mention the fact that your career depends in a large part on the recommendations he may (or may not) write.\n\nIt's an awful situation and my heart goes out to you, but the only real option at this point, is to go to someone (Ombudsperson, HR,  the Department Chair, the VP of research maybe?).

While I feel bad for the guy because he's just ~~following his penis~~ seeking intimacy [EDITed to remove unintended sexual tone] like the rest of us, I think he's had plenty of warning (every prof. knows you don't hit on students) and you should bring it up to the department head.  Worst, worst case scenario you're in court and you can say you told the department head right when it started.  \n\nThe reason I changed my mind is that this is a better case than the worst case scenario of your telling your advisor firmly to keep it professional or else.  In that case, he could agree, and everything would seem to go fine for a while, but he ruins you academically--first silently behind your back (recommendations, delaying papers), then publicly.  And unfortunately at that point you don't have a card to play.  The reason I find this a likely scenario (more likely than court anyway) is your advisor's hitting on his mentee who's half his age and married--it shows that he's not emotionally stable or disciplined, a condition which often responds to rejection with childish scorn.\n\nMy disclaimer now is my disclaimer for my previous opinion; don't take my advice over others'.

It's a workplace, not a sonnet. He should deal with his inappropriate feelings and/or hypothetical loneliness on his own time without making them her problem to agonise over. In another context, I might be more sympathetic, but this is a gross abuse of power and an exploitation of the precariousness of her position.",

Just because it's hard doesn't make it an excuse, and a repeat offense should bear the threat of forced retirement.  I guess what I'm saying is I'd still carry out the punishment, but it'd be coming from a place of pity rather than anger.\n\nThat's not the point of my post, though, my point is the conclusion that she should report him to save herself from an emotionally undisciplined person in power's response to rejection.",

Try to work it out before you bring up any sons and daughters to buy into this bullshit. It ain't gonna stop until everyone works it out.",
