  "title:": "I am moving abroad (Italy to Netherlands) in 10 days for my master degree. Although I was extremely confident in this choice one year ago, I am now experiencing fear, extreme anxiety and great sadness. Did anybody of you go through something similar?",
  "text": "Hi, as the title says, I am really worried. I am afraid this was a bad choice, not because of the academia I am going to, but because I am losing family and friends behind. I am afraid, I don't want to go. Do you have any words of advice for somebody in this situation? Deep down I like the idea of traveling a little, seeing the world, going out of the comfrot zone, but right now emotions are running wild\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: thank you very much guys, sincerly. All your love and support truly helped me. I reached out with a close person I didn't spoke in a lot and that helped a lot too. I am still scared but in a more positive way. Thank you, truly, xx",

      "text": "Hey ! I moved halfway across the world from Singapore to England when I was 20 to do my Bachelor\u2019s. I had no one there, and once the initial excitement wore off (within the 10 mins I moved into my dorm really), I cried. Very hard. \n\nI felt like I made the worst mistake of my life, I should have just stayed home. I have no friends or family. They are 8 hours away from me in terms of time zone and I couldn\u2019t talk to them very often. I was very alone. And my mum already told me that because flight tickets are so expensive, I won\u2019t be able to fly back more than once a year. \n\nI spent the first week in my room avoiding my flat mates. My door was always closed, I listened to people\u2019s voices to know when it was safe to go to the common areas, I figured out everyone\u2019s living patterns so I could avoid meeting them. \n\nThen after that, I realised. Am I having regrets ? Yea. Did I come all the way here to isolate myself and not make a single Friend ? Hell no. \n\nSo I opened my door when I\u2019m in so my flat mates could talk to me. So I sat in the same room as them and watched TV together. I asked if I could go for dinner with them. And I made friends with them ! We went on to have the best 3 years of my life and let me tell you, if you let the fear paralyse you and you don\u2019t make the effort to do what is needed to make your MSc years worthwhile, you would end up exactly like what you feared and end up hating it. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to be fearful, it\u2019s normal to be fearful. What matters most is that you learn to breathe and just put in tiny efforts to make friends. I did my MSc in Sheffield, a different city from my undergrad and I started from zero all over again. But it\u2019s okay. Once you do it, you can always do it time and time again. \n\nIt would get better. Figure out some sort of FaceTime/Skype schedule with your family and friends, think about all the times you are going back to spend time with them. Make new friends and make the most out of your MSc years. You can do it !",

      "text": "I moved from the USA to the Netherlands for my MA as well! I felt similarly - excited about this new adventure but also terrified by the thought of moving to a country where I had never visited, didn't know anyone, and didn't speak the language. I think that \"I don't want to do this\" feeling is a gut response a lot of people have before a major life event that involves a lot of unknowns. Remember that at this point it's easier to go along with the plan you've made, which you made for a reason, and see how it turns out. If you really give yourself time and still find it a miserable experience, you can take the steps to find a new path and shape the life you do want. I often find this Kurt Vonnegut quote helpful when embarking on new adventures: \"we have to be continually jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.\" Give yourself some time to develop these wings. DM me if you'd like to talk more about life in the Netherlands as a non-Dutchy! It's a lovely country to live in, and be sure to eat lots of stroopwaffel and bitterballen!",

But you got this and there's a 99.9% chance that it will be a positive and life-changing experience for you.\n\nI uprooted my family (wife, young son, and dog) from London to Denmark and then Hamburg for my MA, and I'm still in Hamburg three years later. Bless them all for their support. My wife and I were pretty sick of London anyway (I grew up there and my wife lived there for thirteen years) so shifting location was quite inviting for us .\n\nI'm a \"mature\" student, and have a family to support and be with, so there were several personal struggles connecting with my (much younger) fellow students at points but it worked itself out in the end. We have made plenty of friends (locals and expats/migrants) both in Denmark and in Germany and have both found plenty employment opportunities here in Germany (much easier than I would have back home). We were on a terribly low budget at first and any kind of funding to support me during the MA was scarce, but we survived by hook or by crook, and now, after settling in Hamburg for a while we are more or less comfortable. My son goes to a German school and pretty much mastered the language after a year (he speaks much better German than us!). \n\nIt was scary, it was a struggle (especially financially and finding accomodation, etc.), but we got there in the end and right now I can safely say we are really happy we made the choice to uproot. It has been a blast, and I think I can safely say that it will be for you, too. \n\nMaybe you are more rooted to your home country than I was when I made the jump (and the idea of going back to the UK at the moment, with the political and cultural climate there right now) just makes me shudder. We still left behind friends and family but we are never *that* far away, and regular contact is very simple to maintain.\n\nI think these are just last-minute nerves you're experiencing, but I suggest you overcome them and dive in head first.\n\nGood luck mate!",

I arrived in Krakow and I only lasted a week out there. I came back to the UK and had to withdraw from my 3rd year of study. I got a part time job and put myself together. That was over 2 years ago and now I am due to graduate. \n\nPlease talk to someone! I hid all my anxieties and I ended up having a breakdown abroad, in a place that I did not know too well. The best thing is to vent and share. I hid all my anxieties to the last moment. I do not wish to scare you, I just hope you tell your year abroad tutor or personal tutor, so that options can be discussed. \n\nWhat you are experiencing is completely normal when you\u2019re about to study abroad, but if you feel like you are preoccupied by these anxieties, please talk to someone!",

I work at a business school where we have new excited and anxious international students every year and they all turn out fine. Start making your room personal as soon as you arrive, Skype with friends and family and start exploring the city. Before you know it, you will be busy with courses, hang out with new friends and telling toerists the quickest way to the Van Gogh Museum! All the best to you!",

      "text": "It is really, really common to feel the way you are. I personally have moved around in the US several times in my academic career and I've gone through the same arc of feelings as you. I recently had to again, and I was feeling the same apprehension when it came time to actually do it. My friend pointed out to me this time that I had the same complaints about not wanting to leave/feeling comfortable where I was currently when it came to the move. It was an eye opener for me because I had forgotten, and still can not remember not wanting to go. The mind forgets the fear after it passes.\n\nRemember that you sought this experience because for a lot of positive reasons. When it comes down to actually doing it, it is totally normal to feel apprehensive and sad. Leaving the comfort of \"home\" or you usual routine is emotionally disruptive. People are creatures of habit. It's okay to feel what you are feeling, but DO NOT let it stop you from doing what you have planned. Don't make any decisions based on your feelings at this time. DO let your feelings make you more prepared; like if you're nervous about being far from family, do your research on the best airports or train stations or driving route to be able to visit on holidays. DO NOT let your feelings decide for you if you are \"happy\" in your new position until you've given yourself enough time to create a new routine. This usually takes about a year.",

Don't be afraid of this, just by the mere fact you chose to go abroad this will happen! \n\nGet into social things with collegues first and join a club: sport, music, anything. Try to get out of Italy/home by not checking social media of your friends constantly, not calling home every night, etc. \n\nAnyway.

Change is scary but people don't grow when they remain in their comfort zones! Enjoy the experience of living in this new place!\n\nAlso, in this day and age you can never truly leave people behind if they're important to you. I am 11 hours ahead of people at home and I have a schedule set up with my mum for Skype calls so I can speak to her (and see the dog) and I regularly keep in touch with other family members on WhatsApp.",

Find a few groups within the university that you want to try our, be it music or drama or sports, and look at what social events are happening too. Don't completely cut out everyone from home, but definitely pay attention to how much time you're spending chatting to them when you could be out making new pals. You could also join Dutch classes, you'll definitely meet people there and also learn Dutch, kind of useful. \n\nGood luck!",
