  "text": "I thought i would give an update on my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/iay66p/ethics_violations_in_peer_review_process/\n\nIn short, i had a paper submitted for peer review and one day co-supervisor #1 had asked me to send him reasons why the paper was significant and to provide one point of \"minor revision\". \nI thought that was extremely shady, so i had asked my other co-supervisor  #2(corresponding author) about what to do. He suggested that there was nothing wrong with providing reaons why the paper was significant, but didnt address the minor revision request.  So i provided those significant reasons as well as one point of minor revision (something i thought i could have improved on after rereading the paper) to supervisor #1. i also informed supervisor #2 that i suspected we would see those same comments back when we got the reviewer feedback from the editor of journal. \n\nSo after anxiously waiting for another 2 weeks, we finally recieved reviewer comments back and lo and behold reviewer #1 is word for word the same comments i had originally provided to supervisor #1. I couldnt believe it. So informed supervisor #2 of the issue, and after a lot of deliberation he made the decision to inform the editor of the journal that reviewer 1 was compromised but first he had to inform supervisor 1. He ensured that he was going to try to leave my name out of all of it, but i think it was obvious that i told him. Late at night supervisor #1 requested a video call with him which i flat out ignored, cuz i couldnt deal with that shit.  Anwyways i dont know what went on in the their conversation, but supervisor 2 proceeded to inform the editor about the situaiton. Surprisingly, the editor responded right away and simply said to only respond to the other reviewer comments and that they may send it to additional reviewers. So i guess that was the best outcome out of all of this. \n\nas for my relationship with supervisor #1... well he hasnt aknowledged anything, its like none of this happened. so thats that. the end.",

And I could see why nobody in a department would want to be the one who has to follow up on this lest they get a reputation as the person who renders other academics jobless.\n\nSo everyone will be content to just move on from this, though the supervisor's reputation will (at least hopefully) take a bit of a hit. The Reviewers probably more so as people gossip. In the long run though, if this is a one off, or even part of a relatively limited pattern of behavior, it won't amount to much.\n\nIf reviewers were paid a decent wage, it would probably be a bigger academic violation. But as it is, a lot of peer review is largely done as a favor for journals anyway, so its in nobody's interest to make a big stink about this.",
