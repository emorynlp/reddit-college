      "text": "The school you are at should have their own funding like scholarships or extramural fellowships for travel. Check with the financial aid office or the graduate division office. Usually there\u2019s a separate travel grant outside your department. \n\nSee if you can tell ur dept. that you will be paying for the conference up front and turning in all your receipts will help them give you the money. My program makes us pay ourselves but we give a complete itinerary and we give exactly how much we think we are spending and then they reimburse us. Depends on the school you\u2019re at, but my school for example doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m doing my own research. But I\u2019m humanities. Might be diff for stem. \n\nContact the conference people. Maybe they\u2019ll be willing to pay for your flight and/or help find you a place to stay with someone close by to cut the cost. Sometimes they do. \n\nCongrats on your paper being accepted that\u2019s amazing!",
