  "title:": "The actual number of papers (first author) you published as a PhD?",
  "text": "I\u2019m going into my second year of a PhD (civil eng) and I\u2019m severely panicking about number of publications. I know that it\u2019s really early on in the PhD but I\u2019m struggling to understand what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d. And, yes, I\u2019ve talked to my advisor about it but they keep being really vague about number of papers (\u201cpublishing anything by now is good\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ll get \u2018enough\u2019 papers eventually\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s ok that we had to push this one back\u201d, etc) and I can tell that me asking repeatedly for reassurance that I\u2019m on track is annoying them a little. \n\nI just\u2026 want to know if there\u2019s like a number of papers I feel is achievable before I graduate or if I should master out now before wasting a bunch of time on it. For the record, I like my PhD and feel good about it in general but I just don\u2019t feel super confident that I *can* do it. Like, I enjoy working on it for about 40 hours a week, feel generally interested in the problems I\u2019m working on, but feel annoyed when I have long weeks \u2014 but that feels normal for any job. The paper count problem is really my biggest gripe with the PhD and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a real problem or one I\u2019m making up in my head. (I have a therapist and am working on the self confidence issues.)\n\nBut I was wondering if there\u2019s consensus on how many papers I should count on to finish my PhD (not to become an academic at an R1 or anything). Particularly first author papers. My lab doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of collaboration unfortunately but I have friends in other labs who are put on as 3rd or 4th authors and it kinda is skewing my perspective I think. \n\nI\u2019m feeling particularly disheartened right now because I have 2 papers in the fire that I was hoping to submit in September that I think are going to get pushed back to later conferences/journals.\n\nEdit: 4->40",

They'll know the standards of your field, subfield, and institution. Some friends of mine had six to eight first-author papers when they defended; but they're theoreticians, while I'm an experimentalist. They could run dozens of calculations in parallel, while I was plunking away with one sample at a time.\n\nThat being said: you're only working on your PhD for about 4 hours a week? Did you drop a zero in 40? If you're literally only working on your research for 4 hours a week that's a much bigger concern than any paper count.",

Don't get too caught up on \"publishing on schedule\" or comparing yourself to friends in other groups.\n\nFor more context, I was able to publish a paper in my second year, then didn't get anything else out until the year I defended. If you look at papers where I took a major role (not necessarily first author, but substantial contributions) I averaged one paper a year, but they're *not* evenly spread out, and you shouldn't expect them to be.",

I was told a PhD student spent their first year just reading.\n\nA thesis was expected to be a single, original piece of work. There were some people who published a few papers and then \"stapled them together\" (the words we used then) into a thesis, but they seemed almost embarrassed about it. Nowadays of course it is the norm.\n\nMaybe I'm just a grumpy old man now, but times have changed a lot, and not for the better. Academics are judged much more by numbers now (number of publications and number of citations). We're also seeing an exponential growth in the number of predatory journals, which I'm sure is a direct (and predictable) consequence.",

This was in a place where everyone already had a research-based masters so you were expected to be able to hit the ground running with full-time research, and at that point you should be able to average about a paper per year.  Some of us actually did about a paper a year, and other people ended up publishing all 4 in their last 1-2 years.\n\nThis was a \"guideline\" rather than a strict rule, but it was the department's way of roughly indicating how much work you should have done for a PhD.  It also ensured that graduates would at least be reasonably competitive candidates for postdoc in most countries, if that's what they chose to pursue afterwards. \n\nI had 4 published when I finished, and a fifth out a while later.",

You're effectively saying \"I'm not competent enough to achieve a PhD\" and then looking at them to look into their crystal ball and tell you you will definitely get papers and a PhD. You're also not taking ownership of your project and it's suggesting to your PI that you don't understand where it's going or what you're seeking to achieve. You need to understand where the project is heading and have some vision of what the bare bones of a paper from this project will look like.
