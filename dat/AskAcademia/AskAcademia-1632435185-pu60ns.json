  "title:": "I'm leaving postdoc early for an industry job (currently interviewing but no commitment yet) - should I talk to my PI about it? Feeling sneaky and duplicitous, need advice",
  "text": "I've been in my postdoc barely a year. I don't want to run a lab so I'm interviewing for jobs - since I'm mostly remote I can do it from home. But I haven't told anyone about it. I don't think I need to unless I commit to a job. But I feel badly about it - especially planning future experiments that I know I won't do. I think this is where academia is really different than industry, because PIs are supposed to help you take the right next step (vs you wouldn't ask your boss for help finding a new job, lol). But I feel like this is even different than typical because I barely know the PI / lab and I'm ducking out early. Should I have this conversation anyway? Thanks.",

      "text": "There\u2019s something to be said for a graceful transition but there\u2019s no need to alert the pi before you\u2019re certain you\u2019re leaving.  They could take away the very responsibilities that might make you attractive to an employer.  They could think twice before giving you a cool project even if you don\u2019t leave this time around.  They could also be a dock about it.  Instead, you can negotiate a delayed start in order to get your work to a good stopping point. \n\nBut, you also shouldn\u2019t feel sneaky.  Post docs are are meant to make you attractive in future job searches; the skills learned are important too but we\u2019ve all gotta eat.   There are people who end up permapostdocs and you really don\u2019t want that; that\u2019s besides the point.  Getting a good job after a brief time with your pi may mean bragging rights for the group and if your pi ends up being petty, that\u2019s their problem.  \n\nI recently left a physics research gig at an Ivy League school for an engineering gig at DOE facility.  My role was a few rungs above a postdoc but it still has that academic loyalty assumption baked in.  I stressed about it a lot.  I would not let anyone know until I had an offer letter in hand.  I thought I was being sneaky, ungrateful, etc.  In the end, it turned out to largely be in my head.  My supervisor (who is about to retire and wanted me to take his place) was sad but understood.  People did not want to see me go but they were happy for me.  It also turned out that many people before me made the same exact move and that it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.  I arranged to stay a month to hand things off; not everything got handed off 100% but I still have computer access so I can help if needed.  I\u2019d say do the logical thing and don\u2019t worry about it too much; it\u2019s just anxiety finding tentative validation.  \n\nGood luck!",

But as others have mentioned a postdoc is a job and you have to do what's right for you.\n\nAs for future experiments, try to make an effective plan/methodology so whoever takes over after you isn't starting from zero. That way even if you're not going to be the one that'll do them, you're not wasting anyone's time when you do talk about. That should make those conversations feel less duplicitous.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

These jobs and institutions are not committed to us. ***One helpful thing to remember: there are many, many qualified people eager to take your place.*** The academic job market is brutal in almost every field. We are all very replaceable. Your PI knows this. They'll likely feel temporary annoyance about whatever steps they have to take to find your replacement, but it's part of the job. They won't have any strong feelings about you in particular, especially if you barely know each other. Moreover, a postdoc is, by definition, temporary.\n\nSome other people have given the right advice: continue doing your job well while interviewing for other jobs. Inform your PI when you've signed a new contract. Presumably your new job won't start right away, so you can be generous and continue at the lab for a few weeks to wrap some things up (to the extent possible). Good luck.",
