  "text": "I\u2019m in high school, I love psychology and would love to become a professor. However, I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s not really realistic to try and become one. For psych, do you need to get a PhD to become a professor? I\u2019m worried about spending a ton of time and money to get it, and then not being able to find a professor job afterwards.",

      "text": "Yes, you do need a PhD to become a professor. Is it worth it? In my opinion, this is up to you and what you wish to strive for. To start, I'll share a finding from a report published in the UK 11 years ago to give you a feel of the challenge. \n\nIn this report by the Royal Society in UK (titled \"The Scientific Century: securing our future prosperity\"), figure 1.6 illustrates that only 0.45% of scientifically-trained students following a PhD ends up making the grade as professor.\n\nYou may wish to follow-up for a more recent update to the psychology field.",

Learn skills that are broadly useful even if they aren't required for your psych major (coding, stats). Explore other fields and career paths. Think through lots of potential what if's. If you're still jazzed up and interested junior year of college, think about grad school and do the same thing (spend a few years doing lots of good research & gaining broad skills) *then* decide if you want to continue on to try to be a professor. \n\nAlso worth mentioning: you don't pay for a PhD. You'll make a small stipend (25-35k) and your tuition will be covered. It is 5 years of lost earning potential in your career though.",

      "text": "Hey, I'm a fourth year PhD candidate in Educational Psych. \n\nI wouldn't worry too much about realistic at this stage. A better starting point is to think about your interests and values, try to continue developing your understanding of what being a Psych prof entails, and then see how closely those two match. It's totally understandable that your interests and self-awareness will continue to develop, but I've been pleasantly surprised how well my attitude testing results from when I was 15 still hold true a decade later.\n\nRegarding \"realistic\", first, I'd recommend having 3-4 options, with backup plans in place. That way, even if getting a PhD doesn't work out you have other alternatives available.",
