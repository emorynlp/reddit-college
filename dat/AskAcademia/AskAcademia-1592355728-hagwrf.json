  "title:": "How do you switch off your brain and resist the constant urge to be productive in your free time?",
  "text": "For context, I recently finished a PhD in a subject I absolutely love and my graduate studies went really well, but I am frustrated with the academic lifestyle and moving to industry. But all those years in grad school, I developed unhealthy feelings of guilt any time I wasn't trying to \"get ahead\" somehow in my spare time. Even after finishing the PhD and having some free time on my hands, I can't switch off. I constantly feel the need to be learning something new or doing something productive, and it causes me a ton of stress, guilt and anxiety if I don't. I learned to live with it during grad school, but I'm surprised to find it still gets to me. How do you guys switch that part of your brain off?",

This helps me remember to see those activities as also required. So I check off yoga, bike rides, walks, video games, reading for fun, etc. This has helped me immensely. Good luck!",

      "text": "There are a number of good suggestions here focused in cultivating new pastimes and unplugging from work. I agree with many of these. \n\n\nI would like to take a moment and acknowledge that what your asking isn't, \"else should I do with my time?\" instead I understand your question to mean, \"how do I unlearn compulsive work behaviors I developed during my PhD as an adaptation and coping mechanism for sustaining the academic effort I felt was required for success.\" \n\n\n\nTo my thinking, what you're going through partially a result of all the time dedicated to your PhD where you needed to remove non-phd-progressing habits and partially a grown up realization about what we can realistically achieve in life.\n\n\n\nTry to think about what your career is going to look like with your PhD. What do you want to achieve professionally and what do you want personally?  I presume for most people they desire to feel successful and fulfilled in both arenas of their life. You've spent so much time and energy focused on getting to the PhD milestone it's time to cultivate what life looks like after it. What do you want at work? \n\nIn 30 years looking back what do you think will help you feel accomplished and satisfied; publishing, research, leadership, promotions, things in your discipline or out, serving on boards, etc.? \n\n\n\nAnd looking back from that same point what personal things do you want to have achieved; family, marriage, kids, travel, home ownership, etc. \n\n\n\nOnce you have an idea what you might want in the end, that list is where you start making your changes. If you don't need to be a dean or academic chair, but you want to stay in your lab - great! Go for it. If you won't feel fulfilled until you have kids or travel the world, then figure out those things. Make them priorities now. There are no guarantees for the future and it can't be just one thing. \n\n\nWhen we're old and gray as the cliches go we won't want to look back and think 'gee, I wish I spent more time in the office' by the same token diversion and recreation can be the same. We need a balance between a focus on productivity and personal fulfillment. Whatever that balance is try to move it everyday with good habits. I say this because I don't know anyone who can change overnight. As creatures of habit we get the most accomplished and the most achieved when we work on a task consistently over time whether that's a PhD, a hobby, weight loss, reading, working out, finding a partner, or cultivating ourselves personally. \n\n\nAnyway, that turned into a book. TL,DR; figure out what you want not just what you want to avoid, and work on it over time.",

There are also other ways of taking marijuana that don't involve smoking it, such as edibles and oils. \n\nMy point was that not all drugs are \"bad\" just because the government decided they should be some 100 years ago. Some have tangible benefits than can improve quality of life, and people should be so quick to dismiss them just because they don't personally like using them.",

It might feel more personally satisfying but if you actually want to convince someone, it isn't a very efficient tool.",

I rarely talk about my PhD outside of research situations now because most people don't get it and most people don't care about it. So we talk about anything ranging from games, economics, something a celebrity said, lifestyle things...and just mundane banter, like who hooked up with who last weekend. And honestly, it's nice not to talk - or think- about my research during those times. \n\nWhen I started my PhD I thought I was \"above\" chit-chat like that, but turns out it was integral to maintaining my social skills and sense of fun and relaxation. Chatting research only with academics hammered my social skills and blurred lines of work and leisure. I struggled to maintain conversations more and more in non-academic settings. Unfortunately I have found that a lot of researchers are interesting when they talk about their topic/field (to a point), but beyond that most are kinda' not very fun and don't switch off.",

      "text": "Set some boundaries with respect to what time you spend in the office (or, given the current situation, have your computer on at home). Focus on your work during that time, but when things start to wind down for the day you should start to write a to-do list of tasks for the next day. Be as detailed and expansive as you like, the key here is to try to empty your mind of annoying little things that might pop up later in your head and switch your mind back to work. Once that's written, tell yourself you're done for the day.\n\nThe easiest way to disconnect would be to leave home for an hour or so without your phone or laptop and go for a walk. If you have a stand-alone music player then take it with you, or a book, if you need something to run through your mind. But take the time to give yourself some healthy isolation. Hopefully you'll start to appreciate things you see on your little walks that distract you from wanting to *do* stuff. \n\nIf you really have the desire to learn all the time then channel that into more healthy pursuits than returning to work. If you have any sort of hobby then start learning about it obsessively - if you have a favourite sports team then learn more about that team's history; if you like cooking then choose a recipe to tweak and perfect to the Nth degree (/r/macarons would be an easy way in to obsessive cooking/baking, speaking from experience); maybe start to learn a new language...you have plenty to choose from.\n\nTurn this nervous energy into something positive and set yourself goals to accomplish by the end of the week/month. I could recommend a load of YouTube channels of people who set themselves challenges to learn a new skill (useful or not) or change something in their life: The Goal Guys, Mike Boyd, Wheezy Waiter, Matt d'Avella...\n\nAbove all else, remember your employer pays you for a set number of hours per week. Working more than those hours means you work for free, costing you money and your personal time. Your boss wouldn't allow your personal life to encroach on your contracted work hours, so you shouldn't allow your work to encroach on your personal time.",

Perhaps you can keep track of your tasks during the week to remind you of your hard work so far? Then, you can rest assured that you have done your best during the week, and you cannot possibly do better than your best. Therapy and meditation can also help with that.\n\nScience and results are really nice, but they are only a small fraction of all the world has to offer. \n\nGood luck!",

Here\u2019s how I handle it now.\n\nI don\u2019t try to switch off the urge too forcefully, I try to notice it, sit with it. I schedule downtime, I track when the urge hits me and explore what it feels like. I use the same curiosity I have for intellectual pursuits for this peculiarly personal phenomenon. This is part of mindfulness so I also encourage exploring mindfulness meditation which helps you be a better noticer. For me, riding the wave of the urge is more manageable than trying to remove it from my life entirely.\n\nWhen trying to take a real multi-day break, I put up barriers to checking email (I disable it on my phone, make it hard to check on other devices). I used to do this to enforce time-of-day limits as well, but with time I didn\u2019t need that anymore. You can limit time on apps incl email on your phone. Any barrier helps so it can\u2019t be reflexive.\n\nAnd because I so identify with my work I characterize my downtime consistently, publicly and internally, as something that benefits my overall productivity. Eventually this becomes its own habit \u2014 both on and off serve the mission.",

Just 1 hour in a week, but surprisingly it really helped me mentally. In the evenings I started to practice half an hour and that helped me to get rid of the stress of the day somehow. It still counts as learning, it is still productive, so you really don't feel bad or unproductive, you just enjoy it. I'm 25 and never had a piano lesson before, so sometimes it gets a little frustrating but even the frustration makes me happy, it's a promising challenge. I think you can start a hobby from the zero, like learn a new instrument or start painting. This type of hobbies won't make you feel like you're doing something unproductive, because there's also a challenge to learn them and the results are better than playing video games or watching mindless movies.",

Try to be aware of your feelings of guilt and tell yourself that you might not be productive now but you will be another day. It might also help to set realistic work goals each week that you can check off. Lastly as others have said, planning your free time probably helps as well. The more busy and in need of free time I get, the more likely I am to end up on the couch bored, staring at the TV, not enjoying myself and feeling guilty. Probably because I was so busy that I didn't plan what to do with that free time.",

I actually cannot play video games by myself anymore, gotta have a friend or I can't enjoy it :(\n\nI used to use weed as my brain-off switch and it worked perfectly, but I became a machinist and I can't risk weed ruining my career so I had to stop. \n\nI'm hoping I can redirect this crippling need to be productive into a hobby I enjoy but I do not have the means to do so at the moment so I guess I'll just have to sit with these butterflies in my stomach for a while.",

If that's learning to follow stock market trends, great! But I think for the most of us, a few weeks of Netflix and birdwatching might be slightly more helpful. Best of luck, OP!",
