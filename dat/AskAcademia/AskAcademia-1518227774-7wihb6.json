  "title:": "Just Earned PhD in Cognitive Psychology & It Wasn't Worth It",
  "text": "I received my PhD in Cognitive Psychology in August 2017 from an R1 university (I'm not going to identify the university right now).  To get straight to the point:  It wasn't worth it.  Not even close.  If I could go back in time and turn down the offer, I would.\n\nBut I can't, so here's the reality:  I currently have a one year position as Assistant Professor of Psychology at a small liberal arts college.  My initial starting salary offer was $51,291.59.  After two months of tense and frustrating negotiations, the university made a second offer, so my salary for the 2017-2018 academic year is $56,549.17.\nI bring home $1,523.58 biweekly after taxes.  After paying rent, electricity, internet, cell phone bill, groceries, and student loan payments, I have very little money left over at the end of the month. Additionally, I have no job security-- I am constantly applying for (and being rejected from) faculty positions for the upcoming 2018-2019 academic year.\n\nI have astronomically high student loan debt.  I will be making payments for the rest of my life.  There are very few faculty positions open for cognitive psychologists and when those positions do open up, the search committees receive tons of applications.  One of the positions I recently applied for had 58 applicants.\n\nAdditionally-- if you are currently a PhD student and think that earning your PhD is the light at the end of the tunnel, you are wrong.  You will continually be forced to prove your worth over and over again.  You'll need to prove your worth for job applications, for tenure track positions, for raises and promotions.  \n\nI have a bachelors degree in psychology, two master's degrees, a PhD, and an advanced graduate certificate.  I have publications.  I have years of research experience.  But I feel like none of that matters.  I'm back at square one again.\n\nThe four years I spent earning my bachelors degree and the two years I spent earning my first masters degree were very enjoyable.  Those were the six years that made me fall in love with psychology...with science as a whole.  With academia.  \n\nThe five years I spent in my PhD program (where I earned my second master's degree and my advanced graduate certificate) were the worst five years of my entire life.  I worked day and night...60-80+ hours each week.  My stipend from being a TA wasn't enough to live off of.  The department knew that; it was common knowledge that most of the grad students were struggling to put food on the table...but no one with any power cared enough to do anything about it.  \n\nMy PhD advisor was abusive.  She expected me to work non-stop, to be available any time she needed to meet with me...evenings, weekends, holiday \"breaks.\"  She constantly put me down.  It wasn't constructive criticism.  It was abuse.  Minor, often inconsequential errors resulted in a barrage of criticism-- I wasn't good enough, I would \"never make it\" in academia, I don't have \"a scientific mind.\"  She would criticize me for planning to go home for the holidays to visit my family and if I went anyway, she would flood me with emails asking when I was coming back to work.  She was constantly pushing me to work harder, to work faster, to be more productive...design more experiments, run more participants, analyze data faster, know every single detail of the results, etc.  Memorize the means, the standard deviations, know every single inferential statistic.  Write it all up.  Perfectly.  Drafts would be returned to me with pages and pages and pages of edits and she would sigh and shake her head in exasperation if a new draft with all of the feedback incorporated wasn't returned to her within the next day or two.  I barely slept, I barely ate.  I always had a million things hanging over my head.  There was no relief, not for a second.  I ended up in the hospital for 5 days from exhaustion and was then put on anti-anxiety medicine.  But it didn't stop.  It actually got worse, because on top of the criticisms, she would add that I was \"overly sensitive.\"\n\nLong story short-- I made it through.  I graduated.  But now what?  Few job opportunities, low pay...I feel like I have no control over my life.  If I want a good job, I need to be willing to go wherever someone is willing to hire me.  There's little to no chance of being able to stay close to my family and friends.  \n\nI'm frustrated and angry.  My mental health has been destroyed.  My confidence is completely gone.  I have more student loan debt than I can ever possibly pay off.  \n\nI wish this doctorate came with a money back guarantee.  I would have returned it a long time ago if it meant that I could get my life back.  If I could follow a different path where I would make more money, have better options, more control, more job security.  I've invested so much time, money, effort...I've sacrificed more than I can describe.  I feel like I'm completely stuck and it is devastating. \n\n\n",

      "text": "Are you committed to academia? I agree that abusive supervision is bad, working 60-80 hours is bad, having student debt from school will also limit your freedom, and restricting yourself to academia will also limit your options.\n\nYou don't need to go to square one. Research in cognitive psychology is extremely in demand in government, tech companies, consulting, and marketing. Your experience is valued if you go into these areas, and more positions for industry research leads actually have you doing the same work you would do in academia.\n\nIn fact, the company I work for exclusively hires psych PhDs and you would receive a raise by switching to our company. I wouldnt suggest it given your current state - most companies are looking for confidence unfortunately, and people do better often when they've addressed any barriers to wellbeing they currently have.\n\nFeel free to PM me and I guarantee you I can find a pile of jobs you haven't considered yet that would pay better and use your skills if you give me ten mins.",

And I think everyone should have the chance to work in a position that compensates them fairly, gives them challenging work, offers a work-life balance, and gives them a chance for growth.",

I'm 29 years old and I've been in academia since I graduated high school...so about 11 years.  Sometimes when you are deeply invested in something, it's hard to see other opportunities and honestly, I never really learned about other ways of applying my education outside of teaching and research.  I'd definitely welcome any additional suggestions you have and will PM you in a bit.  Thanks again!",

And even those assumptions about undergraduate are eroding, as human experimental skills become more in demand in industry.\n\nWe can chat about how closely you would like non-academic work to mirror what you currently do, as you can choose from basically being a PI without worrying about grants to doing work that barely resembles your current work. There are also different functions and industries, from niches in finance, marketing, and sales to nonprofits, government behavioral insights teams, to inside corporations and external consultants. We're all living in a slice of the industries available in the world, as academia is really a tiny sliver of the total options at any given time. And yet we think it's the whole world!",

If you look at the \"price tag\" of a gradate degree in History it can be quite daunting-- three years of coursework plus many more years of research/writing while one is required to enroll in \"dissertation credits.\" If you add up all the tuition it can be $120,000+ easily.  By \"funding\" we are talking about scholarships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and other means by which a graduate program will pay that tution *for* the student *and* generally provide a stipend meant to cover living expenses. This funding is typically awarded in five year packages, so those who receive it know they will be able to eat and not have to pay tuition for the duration of their required residency typically (the actual time to Ph.D. in History in the U.S. is now about ten years, which is another issue).\n\nThere are some graduate programs that will admit students but not fund them; many in MA programs in fact, fewer in Ph.D. programs. The general advice is that if you do not receive funding you *should not go to graduate school* because going deeply into debt for a Ph.D. in the humanities is a poor decision in many ways. Not receiving funding is *also* a signal that either 1) the applicant is sub-par, or 2) the program itself is sub-par (because it doesn't have enough funding to cover all of its students). Both are red flags, because if one is seeking an academic career in History one must almost without question be a *top* student in a *top* program. Being a mediocre student in a mediocre program is a guarantee of nothing good, and piling debt on top of that would be a nightmare.\n\nSo the \"should I go to graduate school in history\" question is quite often shortened to \"only if you get funded.\"",

This ceremony was important to me for two reasons:  (1) Because my first, abusive PI repeatedly said that I would never finish (I ended up moving to a different lab with a new PI a full year prior to completing the program), so being hooded was a needed boost of confidence, and (2) my family came from several states away to attend the ceremony and express how proud they were of me.  I'm the first person in my family to go to college, let alone graduate school, and sometimes they've had difficulty understanding my motivation for being in school so long, so the fact that they made such a big deal out of this meant a lot to me :)",

My family are all college graduates and most have graduate degrees. While I was the first Ph.D. in the family, it was expected from high school TBH so less of a big deal. Different families, different circumstances.\n\nThe hooding is interesting though-- so your school hooded you shortly before your defense? Or even earlier? What happened if someone failed a defense?  The issue with us was that the average time-to-degree in the humanities is about a decade, so while we had a long period of required coursework (three years) almost everyone moved away for work or research after perhaps five years (as I did) so did not feel the connection to town/campus as one might in a shorter program. Going back to stick it to a crappy PI would be a nice victory though...I was lucky in that my advisor and entire committee were outstanding and were 100% supportive of my desire for an SLAC career even though the department/university of course preferred them to churn out more R1 research stars. It was fun returning for the defense, which was really pro forma in my case; we spent almost the entire period talking about the book that would come from the dissertation.\n\nThere's a lot of variety between programs and among universities in the US. And of course among the grad student population as well. My partner was a first gen undergrad so for her family seeing either of us earn a graduate degree was a big deal. Even today they can't quite seem to understand why we can't both leave our academic jobs and return \"home\" to work at the local university.",

          "text": "Hey!  OP here-- I agree about not paying to go to grad school.  Most of my student loan debt comes from paying for tuition and room/board for my bachelors degree.  I'm a first generation college student-- neither of my parents went to college and both work blue collar jobs.  They work really hard and have worked hard all of their lives, but they couldn't help me fund my education (nor did I expect them to). \n\nThe thing is that when I graduated high school and was faced with how to pay for college, I didn't really have any guidance.  I was 18 and didn't know anything about student loans, so when student loan companies began contacting me, I took out high interest loans without really knowing what I was doing.\n\nLuckily, I was able to earn very good grades as an undergrad, so when I started my first masters degree program, I was given a tuition waiver and hired as a graduate assistant.  But the stipend for my assistantship was only $2,500 per semester...which clearly isn't enough to survive on, so I took out more loans to life off of.  \n\nThen when I was accepted into my PhD, I was also given a tuition waiver and a small stipend, but my university was located in a part of the country with one of the highest costs of living (if not the highest cost of living in the country).  My monthly income as a doctoral student was barely enough to cover my rent, let alone food and other necessities.  So I took out a few additional student loans during this time to make ends meet.",

Nobody in graduate school should ever be surprised about salaries because [the AAUP publishes them](https://www.aaup.org/our-work/research/annual-report-economic-status-profession) for most non-shitty schools every year, by rank. Geography and institutional resources are a factor for sure, but ~$55K is very good for a visiting AP at an SLAC outside of SFO/NYC and a few other markets. We started new tenure-track assistants at about $58K this year and that was on the margin of the top quartile of the salary distribution for baccalaureate institutions. The median was in the low $50K range last I checked.",

Completing a PhD is an amazing achievement, on top of all the other achievements you have already completed (bachelors, masters, publications etc).  \nAlthough you seen to love it, I wonder if you would consider leaving pure academics? Your university, or another one in your area (I\u2019m not in America, but am in another western country and work at a top university, ranked within the top 100 in the world) might employ you in a different way? At the University I work at, PhDs work across the university on things like academic special projects, educational design, career development etc. So there might be opportunities in areas you might not have considered, outside pure academia?

The first two are pretty self-explanatory, but the service component can take many different forms.  One of the more common responsibilities involve serving on committees that evaluate programs, design curriculum, work on special academic projects, etc.  It's just part of the job and there usually isn't any additional compensation for these tasks.\n\nThere are administration positions...lots of them, in fact, at universities in the US.

At the University I work at yes the phds work in faculty doing teaching research etc, but there are also plenty of phds who didn\u2019t want to continue in the in-faculty / academia route so are doing other work centrally. Various central portfolios hire phds all the time to do various work, and none of it is admin-focussed (as that is lower level). To clarify - they are not doing admin, they are working centrally across all faculties and all education to deliver certain projects or pieces of work.

Summers, obviously, are unstructured for most of us but the pressure to publish *even at an SLAC* means it's hardly a vacation.

It must be painful to get out of 5 years pursuing a graduate degree only to stay unhappy. \n\nOne of the best things you can do is to take some time out in nature and breathe in and out for a little while thinking about what it is that you want out of life. Your phd is a symbol of your commitment to better future, and now you\u2019re in the moment when it can begin. If academia isn\u2019t working out at the moment, perhaps public or private sectors are the right path. \n\nNetwork within your field and see where alumni from your program work. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but there are most likely other people who have gone through what you feel (maybe with different degrees) and had to find a way to make it work. By allowing that positivity to enter our lives, we shun this pessimism that constantly tells us how bad our lives are. \n\nInvite in the happiness through broadening your horizons of what can be and can\u2019t be. Search for jobs that will take your degree and reward your knowledge. Most importantly, be good to yourself. You finished a doctorate degree under terrible conditions, and you\u2019ve been able to do other great things in your life that have brought you to this moment. I know you want more, and you can have it by focusing on the solutions, not the conditions of the world around you. Carpe diem, and fly high. \n\n",

I\u2019ve known people in their mid 40s who are still doing post docs or have short term contracts for fucks sake.\n\nYou\u2019re not likely to get any sympathy in the academia, since being treated like utter shit is quite common, plus having a PhD and publications is nothing special, nobody cares.\n\nIf you ever want to feel somewhat valued without having to prove yourself over and over again for the next 20-30 years, I would highly suggest to get the hell out of the academia and never come back. I know that sounds scary since most PhD programs don\u2019t really give any tools to do anything but research (figures...), but believe me, it\u2019s worth the shoot. I\u2019m about to land a job as a R&D manager at a biotech company and I can already tell the difference; people there are more welcoming, I feel valued, my wage is gonna be way better than anything the academia could ever offer and I\u2019m only gonna have to work office hours,  no more all nighters. The only \u201cdownside\u201d is that my job is gonna be restricted to what the company wants, rather than doing \u201cfree\u201d research, but I don\u2019t really care about that anymore.\n\nLike an old friend says \u201cThese days the academia wants monks, not students\u201d.

      "text": "Unfortunately, abusive PIs like yours are scarily common. I'm deeply sorry you had to go through all of that. My PI is one of the best mentors in the department and still has tendency towards acting in ways you described, and that's hard enough on me as is -- I don't know how people do it. For people who don't know what this can be like, if you've seen the movie Whiplash, when I saw that I was like \"wow this is like grad school.\"\n\nThat being said, I think people who want to go into academia need to be informed/warned that it is more akin to becoming a professional athlete or artist. You can spend a very long time at it and still not be one of the best. It's not an effort model, it's a talent model. We don't have the same outrage that someone can devote their entire childhood and young adult life to being a baseball player, to get not make the major leagues, and get stuck in the minors, or quit, or have to leave due to an injury. We understand that that is a job that almost no one gets and that you take that risk if you try to get it.\n\nFor better or worse, academia just isn't comparable to other more conventional job paths. I'm not saying this as a justification, that it's good that it is this way. But I think people are misinformed going in about the potential outcomes. I also think people misunderstand how much they need to be obsessed with their work to be one of the ones who makes it, and to like it even if they make it in spite of this. (That doesn't mean you ALWAYS have to feel this way, everyone has fluctuations.)\n\nI think what anyone looking into a career should know the following (CAVEAT: I am familiar with the U.S system only):    \n\n* NEVER EVER EVER PAY FOR GRAD SCHOOL. If you have to pay for grad school (with the exception of professional degrees), you're already, ability aside, almost by definition not going to be someone that gets a stable academic job     \n* Think about what you would do if not grad school. If the questions you want to research in grad school aren't questions (or similar to questions) that you'd be still wondering about in another career (in job or your free time), it may be hard to drum up the internal motivation necessary to get through grad school.     \n* If you aren't sure if grad school is for you, get more experience as a lab manager or research assistant. When these jobs pay, they typically pay better than the grad student stipend, and you will become acquainted with the academic culture in your field.     \n* Use extreme discretion when choosing a school/lab/PI. If you get into one school and the PI seems like an abusive asshole, don't go. You're better off reapplying because if you go, things will be infinitely harder than they need to be. \n* Related to above, get as much information as you possibly can from the grad students/lab managers etc while you're on an interview.     \n* Many go into grad school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. This is good! It's good to be passionate and excited. But have an exit plan and don't be ashamed of the exit plan. Academia is not for everyone and sometimes you can't know that until you're in it. Be aware that that is a possible outcome.     \n* Don't sacrifice mental health. Grad school is a marathon, not a sprint (although it can feel like a sprinting marathon). Take a leave of absence if you need to. Your work will be infinitely better and easier when your own health is taken care of. It's important to prioritize yourself, not just for self-care type reasons, but also because it actually makes you more productive and do better work.     \n* Develop generalizable skills (programming, statistics) while you're in your program. Data science is booming, and even if you're sure you want to stay in academia, it is reassuring to know you have options, and it makes you more confident in yourself and your work when you know you have skills that are sought after",

Both of my parents work blue collar jobs and live paycheck to paycheck.  There was no way they could contribute a penny toward my college education.\n\nI had very little guidance when it came to choosing colleges and funding my education.  I took out high interest loans to pay for tuition and room/board because I was 18 years old and I didn't know any better.  All I knew was that I had high tuition bills that needed to be covered.\n\nI got very good grades as an undergrad (a 3.96 GPA), so when I applied for master's degree programs, I was fortunate enough to receive a tuition waiver.  This is not common.  Additionally, I managed to secure a graduate assistantship, but it only paid a $2,500 per semester stipend.  It's not possible to live off of such a low amount, so I had to take additional student loans to cover living expenses. \n\nI worked my ass off during my master's degree program, taking classes and doing as much research as possible so that I would have a chance of getting into a PhD program.  \n\nI was accepted into a doctoral program and had to move to a part of the country with an extremely high cost of living.  I had a tuition waiver for my PhD, but my graduate assistantship as a teaching assistant didn't provide me with enough money to survive.  As before, I took out more student loans to cover the costs of living so that I could complete my program.\n\nIn terms of researching how much someone with a PhD in cognitive psychology can expect to make-- I definitely did this.  There is enormous variation in annual salaries for cognitive psychologists.  New faculty members at small liberal arts universities don't make very much, while tenured professors at larger universities make substantially more.  Additionally, jobs in applied research, industry, etc. pay differently depending on skill sets and what is in demand at the time.  The PI in my lab, for example, makes over $150,000 per year.  While I didn't expect to make this much after graduation, I did assume that I would at least be comfortable.  I assumed I'd be making sufficient money to make student loan payments and not have to struggle to make ends meet.  \n\nThis situation absolutely could not have been avoided by \"forethought.\"  In many cases, you don't know what the important questions are to ask until you are looking back on what has already happened.

It sounds like you were very poorly advised all the way through...someone should have explained the process, the market, the debt challenge, and all these other issues to you *before* you made the decision to apply for that first master's degree. Doing so is a regular part of our major's courses in my department-- we do it right in the senior capstone class --and faculty are very careful to have these conversations with students as soon as they start talking about graduate school or asking for LOR's. When I taught in a master's program the same was true for students who talked about going on to a Ph.D. somewhere else.\n\nIt's unfortunate but understandable that you did not know to ask these questions on your own. It is *not* understandable that your faculty at every level seem to have failed utterly in doing their jobs as advisors.",

The culture there is awful unless you\u2019ve got a tenured senior position. \n\nIndustry is desperate for people with phds in fields like yours. I work in pharmaceutical consulting with a dual bachelors in psychology and neuroscience. never got a PhD and started out doing some bench work jobs after college for 30k a year. \n\nAfter deciding I hated working in a university lab, I decided to look into jobs in private industry. I got a job starting at 50 at age 24 and now make 6 figures at age 31 as a grunt in my company. \n\nA ton of my friends went into PhDs and are just now getting out and saying much of what you\u2019re saying now. That they\u2019re disappointed with the pay at jobs they\u2019re finding. But after talking to a lot of them, they just never considered jobs outside of academia. They\u2019re not used to the idea of working for someone other than a university. \n\nBut the jobs are out there. As a Pharma consultant we are constantly doing studies and advising companies on their protocols and a lot of it includes things like label comprehension and cognitive effects of psychotherapy. \n\nWhen I say I\u2019m a grunt in my company I mean as someone without a professional degree, I have a limited capability to advise companies of all their needs. Experts with PhDs are needed to do this work. They get paid a lot more than I do. \n\nGo find a job in industry. You\u2019ll get paid a lot more and you\u2019ll probably find a better culture and work-life balance. ",

          "text": "OP here-- Yes, I did.  The abuse didn't start all at once.  It was subtle at first, then it progressively got worse.  When it started getting really bad, I spoke with the department chair about it.  I told her what my PI was saying to me, I showed her some of the emails my PI had sent to me and some of the comments/feedback I received on paper drafts...and the department chair just swept it under the rug.  She gave me this whole lecture about how PhD programs are hard work, that students need to understand that PIs have our best interests in mind and although we might not always agree with their methods, we need to trust the process.  \n\nMost of the PhD programs at my university and at many of the universities my friends have attended have a culture of abuse ingrained in them.  Suffering is seen as a badge of honor.  During one of our weekly department brown bag meetings, for example, another faculty member stated that if doctoral students were getting more than 5 hours of sleep each night, they weren't committed enough to their work.  Verbally abusing your advisees was seen as \"tough love.\"\n\nLuckily, a new department chair took over about a year after I spoke with the first department chair.  The new chair scheduled a meeting between my advisor and I.  My PI came into the meeting and spent 15-20 minutes tearing me apart in front of the department chair, who sat calmly at her desk and didn't say a word.  After my PI's tirade, the department chair asked her to leave the room so she could speak to me privately.  She then told me how sorry she was for what had just happened, that this type of feedback was completely unacceptable, and that she was going to fix the situation.  And she did.  Within 48 hours, the department chair had moved me to a new lab and also transferred the other PhD student in my lab to a new advisor.  My PI was not permitted to take on another doctoral student for the next academic year.  I'm not sure what went on \"behind the scenes,\" but I know my PI was reprimanded for her conduct.",

I don't love having to fight for $56k per year when I have a bachelors degree, two masters degrees, a PhD, and an advanced graduate certification in neuroscience.  \n\nI also don't appreciate someone who doesn't know me, doesn't know how hard I work, and doesn't know anything about the success of my students suggesting that I have \"no place in front of classes.\"  If you have to read a wikipedia article on cognitive psychology just to understand what it is, then you have no place judging someone in that field.",
