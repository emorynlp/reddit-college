  "title:": "Considering going back to school for an advanced degree in Economics",
  "text": "I'm curious how optimal my plan sounds. \n\nI'm currently about to turn 25. I graduated with a BBA with a major in Finance and a minor in Economics in 2019. I had a good internship as a research analyst in investment strategy at a large pension fund, as well as internships in wealth management and as a python programmer. However my GPA was only slightly above 3 and I didn't take many purely quantitative courses. \n\nI'm currently studying for the CFA level 2 after passing level 1 in May while doing music professionally full time. \n\nWhile studying the CFA material, I preferred the quant sections, economics and portfolio management sections, and really didn't enjoy the traditional financial accounting stuff, so I think seriously learning econometrics would be fun. I've taken some Coursera courses on Math for machine learning and really enjoyed it, but it was pretty basic and I can't say I've retained it (use it or lose it). \n\nI'm considering going back to school in order to pick up a bunch of math courses so that I can become a competitive applicant for grad school (given my current low GPA and lack of math training.) \n\nI hope this was coherent, I wanted to provide as much context as possible. Does this seem like a good game plan and has anyone had a somewhat similar path?\n\n(edit: some grammar)",
