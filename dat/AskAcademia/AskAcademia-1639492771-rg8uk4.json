  "text": "I won't lie, there's been a massive learning curve for me this year to get used to how things are done at this level. Even simple things like writing papers, reports and presentations demands a standard I'm not very used to. \n\nMaybe I'm just being self-conscious and potentially reading the situations wrong but I always leave supervisor meetings feeling exhausted and somewhat put down if that makes sense? Like yesterday, my supervisor seemed very cold and distant, only offering criticisms of my work. Maybe it's just me?",

      "text": "Yes and no. You are now working at a completely different level than you did before, with completely different expectations. You have a whole lot to learn and a lot of the learning is through feedback and criticism of your work. That\u2019s not bad or negative, it\u2019s just exactly what is expected. \n\nReframing your expectations is key to surviving it. Getting criticism of your work is helpful, because it helps you improve your work. That\u2019s a positive thing. It\u2019s not negative. Learn to be grateful for the feedback instead of taking it as an ego hit every time. Once you do that, you will feel energized by it instead of exhausted. \n\nPart of the key is to realize that someone criticizing your work is investing energy in doing so. They don\u2019t have to do that. The worst thing they can do is ignore you. Investing energy in your work is investing energy in you. Learn from their criticism. Positive constructive criticism is the easiest to take in and digest, but even the nastiest negative criticism teaches you something about your work. Learn from it. Ignore the nonsense and see what truths are behind it. \n\nHere\u2019s another thing to recognize: your feelings about the criticism are mostly due to your own insecurity. That\u2019s something you can work on, and it is worth doing so. Separating your feelings from the content of the criticism is helpful. When I receive reviews on a paper I have written, I read them several times. The first time, I read them and just let myself feel whatever I feel. Indignant, outraged, elated, \u2026. whatever. When I\u2019m over that, I go back and read them again, this time for content\u2014to try and figure out what the reviews are really saying (instead of what it feels like they are saying). Sometimes it takes a few readings to get everything. It\u2019s easier to do that with written feedback, but applying the same kind of thinking to verbal feedback can be really helpful.",

              "text": "None of what you're describing rises to the level of \"putting you down,\" which, in my view, means actively doing or saying things with the purpose of making you feel bad. If there are problems with your work and you are informed about them, that's not putting you down. Now if they're calling you stupid or yelling at you over bad work without giving any feedback on how to improve, that would be unacceptable behavior, but it sounds like you are just receiving tough coaching that is solely intended to help you improve. Would it be nice if they were warmer and praised anything good you do? Of course. But a lack of top-notch people skills in a manager is just a reality of the world, especially in academia where faculty are almost exclusively measured on hard endpoints like publications and funding and not on how much their research staff like them.",

OP might want to stick around for that.\n\nOr OP could switch advisors and work with someone who's not nasty. Staying and succeeding in a nasty work culture will likely turn OP into a nasty advisor or manager when they graduate. Is it worth it? Idk",

Moreover, even if we wanted to discuss this kind of stuff (and, again, i DON'T think it's particularly useful), it would be even more difficult in a situation like this, where you can hear only one of the parts...\n\nWhat is an objective data is that OP has a difficult relationship with his advisor, and i agree with you when you say that they should consider whether they want to find a way to collaborate with them, or if they would prefer to change advisor (if possible, considering also what could be the con's, etc....).",

You are shifting from being the consumer of knowledge (as an undergraduate) to the critic and producer of knowledge (as a graduate student).\n\nHere are three pieces of advice that really helped my mental health in graduate school:\n\n1. Try to find a more senior graduate student in your program to serve as an informal mentor. This is particularly useful if they are in your same lab but any student who has been through a similar thing can help. It really helped me to talk to others who had been through what I was going through. Senior graduate students always seemed so put together and on top of their work, that hearing they had similar struggles eased my anxiety a lot. They also can become invaluable assets in getting information about random paperwork and milestones. Academia is filled with red tape and having a resource who has recently had to navigate it helps a lot!\n2. Faculty will only invest the time in criticizing your work if they care. The worst thing an advisor, reviewer, instructor, etc. can do is to either ignore you or passively tell you that you're doing great when you're not.\n3. You need to separate your self-worth from your work. I'm not saying that it is easy to do but it will help you survive in graduate school and in an academic career beyond graduate school. I found that once I was able to separate evaluations of me as a person from evaluations of the work I submitted, graduate school got a heck of a lot easier.\n\nBest of luck in your program!",

      "text": "This has been quite an interesting thread to read. \n\nI've just finished my PhD and I can definitely sympathise with not feeling comfortable with my supervisor to begin with: not really because of anything they did, but more because it is a very different working relationship than I was used to after undergrad. And obviously because they were just a new person and it takes time to get used to how different people interact with one another.\n\nHaving read through everything here I do have to say I agree with the people saying that OP's view of their supervisor might come down to OP's own anxieties rather than the supervisor's actual actions. Or at least what OP has described downthread doesn't sound terribly bad. And again, I can sympathise with PhD related anxiety, and taking professional criticism personally, as it can be really hard to separate those feelings out when you're so personally invested in your work.\n\nI've also read some of the arguments that have kicked off in the comments, and in some cases I can blame other users snark (we can be a sassy sub) but also I definitely think there are places where OP took something critical (but not rude) the wrong way and everything devolved from there. Which I think potentially kind of mirrors the situation with OP's supervisor (except here OP feels more comfortable talking back to people).\n\nSo if I were to leave OP with some advice after all of this, it would be to try to take a (mental) step back from a situation where you feel like someone is being cold/menacing/critical of you, and take a moment to really consider whether what is being said is warranted, and whether it is professional and constructive or if it should be taken personally. Doing that does mean uncoupling your personal feelings from your work and professional interactions. But I do think you'll feel a lot better about things if you manage to do so.",

But if they are simply telling you what is wrong with your work and giving you notes on how to improve then that is what you want from a supervisor, and you need to get past taking it so personally.",
