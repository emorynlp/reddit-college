  "title:": "Advisor has taken two years to read my paper",
  "text": "Long story short, my advisor told me to work on a project, I worked on the project, finished it, wrote a paper, got other collaborators to contribute comments, but my advisor still has not read or commented on it in the past two years.  This is the only hurdle to submission.\n\nHe says he wants to do a really deep dive into the background literature first, as he claims he is very worried it will be submitted but a reviewer might claim the background is incomplete or the paper irrelevant.  I have told him that I am 100 times more concerned with being scooped than with a reviewer objecting, but he doesn't budge.\n\nThat would be fine if he \\*\\*were\\*\\* doing the background search, but he isn't.  He is instead working on other projects for other students, some of whom started later than me.\n\nWhenever I raise the issue, of when is he going to read my paper, he accuses me of being disrespectful, and implies we might not be working together in the future.\n\nI presented the research and preliminary results publicly three years ago, saying I'd have results out soon.  I did, but I haven't published them.  I have been turned down in grant proposals, the reviewer mentioning my lack of publication in the notes.  I have to every semester submit submit a progress report to the graduate chair to prove I'm not lazing around, and every semester write that I \\*\\*still\\*\\* haven't submitted the paper.  It's even hurting when I apply to jobs.\n\nIt's been two years, and it's beyond typical absent-minded professor stuff,  to  the level of being deliberately rude and insulting.\n\nWhat do I do?  Is there someone higher up in my university I can report this to, without reprisal?  I just want to publish, graduate, and get a job.\n\nWhat options do I have?\n\nPS. Field is physics, if that helps.",

I imagine you've already been direct about wanting him to review the article, but if you haven't been direct about an explicit timeline, collaboratively establishing a deadline in particular may be helpful.\n\nBeyond that, though, there's really not much you can do. What your advisor is doing, while falling far short of good mentorship, is not against any rules.",

      "text": "I had something similar happen -- wrote a paper, co-advisor kept saying it was great and he just needed to make the last 2% of edits... for years. Also gave a talk at a conference many years ago on this work. Unfortunately subsequent papers all explicitly built upon that first one, such that I couldn't really publish the later stuff without either gutting that first paper or else having some really awkward structure. So I kept postponing and postponing.\n\nEnded up getting scooped by a thousand spoons, new papers coming out over the years that steadily siphoned away my work's novelty. Then COVID hit and the co-advisor ghosted me lol. Ended up graduating without actually publishing anything (but 3-4 papers written). Doing a postdoc in a different field now and it's unclear if I'll ever return to that grad school work!",

The other, works on the paper like the snail with 3 experiments over 2 years!!!! In any case corona made things worse! \n\nYou have to do the background search! What does it mean background search? You cannot possibly have all literature in the paper, usually at a point we add reviews. \n\nMaybe you have to find other colleagues that will comment and help you on the paper. Is there anyone with expertise on this subject that is not a competitor and you can ask for help and comments? \n\nIf an advisor says he has to dive into the literature probably it is not in his field of expertise. Usually advisors know every single detail of a paper in their field ( and the stories etc) since the beginning of time. Probably he doesn't like to dive deep into this subject. \n\nLastly. there are persons that influence the advisors. Find who this person is and start crying to her/him so that he/she mediates so that the advisor pities you.",

In the US, 5 years is normal for some areas like theoretical particle physics, whereas as others may take 7 or 8 years, depending on availability of data or equipment and how long your advisor is trying to keep students for.\n\nRegardless, I can't think of any subfield where waiting on a completed paper for 2 years is even remotely acceptable. Even 18 months before this point would have been far too long. The advisor's concerns also aren't a very good reason to keep from submitting for so long. If that's a reviewer's feedback, that's a relatively minor change in my opinion, so let the reviewer day that. At worst, it calls for addressing and submitting elsewhere.",
