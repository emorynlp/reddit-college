  "text": "I don't know if this is the place to post this but I am feeling raw and this sub is the only place I could think to post this. I am a first generation immigrant and minority from a family that doesn't really see the point of my field but I got into my dream graduate school this year after busting my ass for years in undergrad. I overloaded on credits for several semesters and achieved high marks in addition to doing research at my school and at other institutions concurrently with the overloaded course schedules to stand out. It seems I held this too far above things in my personal life.\n\nI just had my girlfriend of 2 years break up with me. She felt that the relationship was always number 2 to academics. I know I have been laser focused on school, but she was the person I feel I invested the most in. I opened up to her about things I never have to anyone in my life, she was the person I could always just be me around, my only friend and now I'm completely alone. I'm feeling a rush of emotions, I cried for the first time in years. Looking at my grades and my acceptance letter now it feels like a hollow victory. I got my dream but now what. It feels like I gave up the person I love for numbers next to the letters GPA. I feel like the king of the ashes and I don't what to do. I'm heartbroken, upset, angry, confused. Has anyone else been through something like this?",

These are just the feelings humans feel when they are rejected.\n\nThat said, yeah, academia (or any highly competitive job) will erode your personal relationships, and I felt the same as your ex with my academic exes. Ultimately whether it's worth it to you is something only you can decide (but don't make any rash decisions - girlfriends come and go but the degree is forever). Academia does make dating harder, but lots of academics are in happy relationships. One day you will find someone who can live with your schedule and priorities.",

I remember fondly my undergrad department chair and her husband who also was a professor in the same department. They were both German and had two cute little boys they would bring on field trips with us (geology grad here). Such a cute family. Super funny having their 7-yr-old follow us students around and tell us what rock we're looking at :) Also my current boss (chem department chair) and his wife, who is a professor in the lib arts field at the same college. \n\nI loved hearing the conversations of both these couples, super high level thoughts but with that closeness. Don't worry OP, she's out there. You may just not have met her yet, and that's okay.",

As I go deeper and deeper into academia, I see that there are people who give up all relationships to get their work done and advance their careers. I also notice some manage to have a life/family outside of academia while maintaining a good CV. Aside from resorting to dating someone in academia \\(which I can't, as my long term partner isn't in academics\\), I want to learn how to be like the latter, so I'm following this post.",

      "text": "Hey, OP. This is probably one of the most important learning moments of your life. It is where you ask yourself what it is that you really want.\n\nIn undergrad and grad school, people try to do everything because that's what they think life/research is. Overworking yourself year after year will take a toll on you and facing failures in that setting might completely break you. But, the ones who succeed in grad school are the one who pace themselves and understand what is truly important to them. Is success in the eyes of others, their acceptance and their awards truly the most important thing to you ? Or is life for you to do what you want and at a pace that you find fun? \n\nFew people realize this early on. It is why they are not upset when they fail or have a paper rejected or even fail qualifiers. They have a broader perspective that helps them be alright.\n\nI'm guessing you like me were not wise enough to handle and prioritize a relationship along with research. What you have to take away from this is that that is one area that you need to grow in. It takes time but once you feel like there is more to life than being at a dream school, once you truly feel that losing any title or position won't make you any less of a person, then you will be ready to devote enough attention to people that care about you because you will know what is important. So, take a break now OP and grow. It is going to be a hard and tough growth that you will have to do alone because self-reflection is the only way to grow. Ask yourself what chains tie you down and how to break them.",

      "text": "I'm sorry about your breakup. The fact that you look at your academic situation as hollow right now reflects a lot of humanity on your part. Don't overlook that.\n\nI have not been in your situation, but I can tell you that if your girlfriend was holding out that you would have more time for her once grad school started then this is the best case scenario for both of you. Grad school is a major time/brain commitment - I don't buy into the late '80s framework (which has often been cited to me) that grad students are overly needy partners, but I definitely experienced grad school stresses in my relationship (which went from dating, to engagement, to marriage during grad school). Many times I have felt lucky to have had a partner who understood my commitment to ridiculous sleep schedules, low pay, tedious document proofreading, and moving all over the country to find work, because I know people for whom things have not worked out. Now, 10 years post PhD, all of these things still affect our relationship, but the relationship still works, and, for me, it has helped to have someone with me in this experience for the long term.\n\nMy takeaway for you is that balancing work and life is a long-term issue for all academics - it doesn't get better. What that means is you need to find a way to make it work for you. That might mean finding the right career/partner/etc. to keep you balanced. It will almost certainly mean that you need to consider your own priorities and goals, and where you might need to be more flexible. One thing that I found very hard as a student was saying \"no\" - it feels like you are letting someone down. What I've learned over time is that sometimes (often?) saying no to someone  in my academic life means I can maintain a more healthy personal life.",

Sure, I might sometimes feel bored by not having a long term partner, but I know I care more about achieving my career goals. Conversely, I could indulge my social desires more, but then I would get much more upset feeling like I've left behind my ambitions. The opposite may be true for the next person. I think it's important to emphasize that preferences differ across people. It's natural to feel sad over any breakup, OP. But you may very well be able to find somebody who understands or even shared your ambitions. And it's up to you decide whether you want to search for that kind of person or if you care enough about having any relationship that you would sacrifice your career goals.\n\n",

      "text": "As others have said, this moment is serving to pause you in your life. Take the time to reflect and consider what kind of work-life balance is best for you. It wasn\u2019t a breakup that served as my wake up call, but a family emergency at the end of the first year of my PhD. I walked into my dream program after 4 years of undergrad and a 2 year MA wanting nothing but to pore my heart into research. I landed in a class led by a professor who made it his mission to force me out of the program. He was aggressive in his comments (asking me in front of my peers why I hadn\u2019t dropped the class yet) and his grading. He failed me on a midterm and then on our final exam, which raised problems for me progress in the program. My advisor was told I was a trainwreck and the prof soured my reputation with all of his colleagues, effectively blacklisting me from taking their courses. I was told by another prof to work harder. So I went from 8 hour work days to 12-14 hour work days. By February my anxiety was so out of control I was having night terrors that my room was on fire and sleepwalking in my efforts to get out. \n\nBy March I was seeking help, but at the end of April I learned my mother had cancer. Her tumour was discovered when it partially ruptured. There was a concern that she would need emergency surgery. I went to my professors to ask for extensions on final papers, and special circumstances for an exam. I was told no by 2/3 of them - including my own advisor! One also made particularly insensitive remarks when I asked them. I found out two days later that that same professor had allowed a male student in our class to write the exam remotely from Taiwan. \n\nI almost walked away. It didn\u2019t seem worth it. Why were these people asking me to sign away my life and my ability to do anything for my family? It was glorified by many of my peers that one of the men in our program had come in for committee meetings and to work the day they were married. This was their vision of a perfect student, a top student.\n\nI realized then and there that I would never be that person. What saved my commitment to grad school was a pair of conversations, one with my undergrad/MA advisor, who had supported my pursuit of academia, and one of my other professors. Both made it clear that I was not less than for wanting to prioritize family. I realized how important it was to work with the right people. So I finished my coursework and vowed never to work with those who wanted me to work 12-14 hours a day or sacrifice time with my family. \n\nI went into second year with a dog, having spent the summer helping my mom through her first round of treatment. 4 weeks before generals my mom was rushed into emergency surgery after developing life threatening blood clots due to complications from her cancer spreading. I was able to leave short notice to be with her, and defer generals and end of term coursework with ZERO pushback from any faculty. My new advisor was an immense support in this and everyone reassured me I was okay in doing this. \n\nI\u2019m now in a position to get back to work, and in a way I have to push back on my commitments to family and assert that I still need time to do research. There\u2019s no crime in this - it\u2019s a balance that will make me happy and I need to live my life. But this is the key: it\u2019s what works for me. It\u2019s taken me a hell of a long time to get to this point and in some ways I\u2019m still considering what I want in life. \n\nOne of the best pieces of advice I received was that grad school is not a race, nor is life in general. Find the pace that works for you. Other people might be extremely critical of those choices (I was told that getting a dog would hurt my career by taking time out of my daily schedule...). But the key thing here is that it\u2019s your choice, not theirs. What works for you might not work for them. And that\u2019s totally fine. ",

      "text": "Sorry -_-\n\nAs an academic with a currently tolerant GF, I can relate. Her and I have talked about what she may be in for and have made a point to have honest conversations and check ins about needs and expectations. This strategy at least makes clear the choice between academia and relationships.\n\nIn reality, you are always making this choice, and academic research is extremely time consuming and isolating.\n\nAre you in a position that you could now choose between restoring your prior relationship at thecost of your academic progress? Which would you choose at this point? My guess is the answer of IF you could choose is YES, at least if she feels as strongly about you as you do about her. But it would require a sacrifice that you may be unwilling to make (your academic dream, or at least its timeliness.)\n\nThat is no small choice, and only you can make it, but I would suggest that it is one you will ALWAYS be making. The treadmill doesn't really end and is still getting more burdensome (at least in the US).\n\nYou can also choose to hold out for another partner who might be more compatible, and/or make a point to strike a mutually agreed balance and live by it.\n\nIf nothing else, you may find this experience to be solid fuel for thinking through all of your commitments better.",
