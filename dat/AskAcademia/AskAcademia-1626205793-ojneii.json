  "title:": "Is it normal to become more convinced your discipline is detached from practical reality the more you study it?",
  "text": "I know this might read as a trollish post, but I *promise* I'm serious.\n\nSo, I'm currently halfway through my Adv. MSc. International Relations & Diplomacy, and while my undergrad was a Liberal Arts BA, that was also heavily IR-focused. Honestly? I love it, but only in the context of academic bickering about pointless minutae that do not matter outside the walls of the faculty - the more I've studied IR theories, the less my remarks of \"we're a humanities field trying to masquerade as a hard science\" and \"if you open the dictionary to 'Ivory Tower Academia' you'll find a picture of our faculty\" have become jokes. I know there's always going to be a difference between academic theory and practices in reality - you clearly *need* to perform abstractions when creating a theory, but several of the main theories in my field just feel like they fall apart at the first dose of being exposed to the outside. I've always had this feeling to some extent, but it's grown rather than diminished, and I'm now actually worried whether or not I'll be able to put any conviction whatsoever in my master's thesis next year.\n\nIs this just a natural side effect of learning more about your field's theoretical frameworks and therefore being exposed to case studies where they *don't* work more, or am I just seriously disillusioned/too cynical?\n\nTL;DR starting to feel like my entire field desperately needs to go touch grass and talk to people, is that normal?",

I plan on leaving academia and never looking back.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the problem of being so wrapped up in theory land. It\u2019s the fact that, even when academics study phenomena with real practical salience (for example, human rights violations), they frame their work to get published in circle-jerk journals rather than to speak to concrete policy implications (to follow through with the human right example, torture is a variable to plug into a regression rather than a real thing that happens to people that we should work to prevent through our scholarship). They might hand wave to the policy world in the last paragraph of a journal article, but academics are primarily writing to impress a very narrow group of other ivory tower sycophants who review their articles and tenure files, not trying to do research that\u2019s practical or normatively relevant for the real world.\n\nDo I sound bitter and jaded enough?",

The hallway to my lab was filled with crooked tiles that shifted and made noise when I stepped on them. It was depressing just waking to my lab.\n\nI think to work on theory one must really have passion for finding truth rather than worry about how applicable it is. Mathematics has far reaching impact and it generally takes several lifetimes to see any applications of its findings. Nonetheless it can be incredibly beautiful and impactful. So to me, a bigger concern than wasting taxpayers' money is insufficient allocation of money to important fields like mathematics.",

And there is TONS of that kind of research in IR. \n\nResearch in IR that lacks normative motivations and engagement with policymakers (and other relevant on-the-ground actors) is being produced purely for the professional advancement of the author, as incentivized by academia's incestuous definitions of what constitutes \"valuable knowledge\". \n\nI have explicitly been told (by multiple people in the field) to avoid substantive engagement with \"the policy world\" because a lot of that kind of work 1) does not make heavy enough/generalizable enough theoretical contributions to get published in the top IR journals, and 2) doesn't count/counts less for tenure considerations than purely academic publications. I've also been told multiple times that normative motivations are not sufficient to justify a research project; I need to be motivated by answering broader questions about international power interactions. \n\nI'm sure IR is fulfilling for people who want to have elaborate theoretical discussions to appear intelligent at conferences and dinner parties with other IR scholars.

Often, they were correlations NOT causations and the conclusions they suggested were not only wrong, they were biased and sometimes pretty worrisome. The larger point is that I see academia as trying to avoid making science tell the story they WANT instead of telling the story that IS. The assumption is that science will provide the means and evidence for others to use for positive ends but the reporting scientist shouldn't be the one to do it.\n\n(edited for grammar)",

But if you want to go for it you gotta reframe some things for yourself. \n\n While most education programmes still assign the \"Great Debates\" from the 1990s, that's not at all representative of the type of stuff that gets published these days. Thank God we're not in the 1990s anymore.most people in practice work on mid range theory on a specific subject. Then it becomes a lot more concrete.But beyond the Great Douchebags they're also a ton of of amazing scholars - but I don't know what area you work on so I can't recommend much\n\nHave you read beyond the classic theoretical debates and looked into other approaches? Postcolonial IR, queer IR, critical IR, Foucault, poststructuralism, grams I, bourdieau, Latour, etc etc?  Try to read broad and wildly and especially read stuff you're unfamiliar with and that's outside your comfort zone\n\n I get the sense that you're frustrated that people dress up their opinion as an IR theory? It drives mental too, but remind yourself that all science is ideological, as the sociology of scientific knowledge has shown us. \n\n Have you looked into qualitative methodologies too? Europeans are much more into qual while Americans love quant, if you're frustrated with the US empirical slant",

My BA really focussed on the postpositivist schools which really kept my belief in the field alive, but I've constantly been told neorealism and neoliberalism (though, let's be real, potayto potahto there,) are the dominant paradigms, and that just makes me worry for the whole field tbh.\n\nAnd I don't really have a problem with people dressing up their opinion as an IR theory - all science is ideological, as you said, so I've always just been of the conviction that it's best to explain your biases and how they influence your assumptions and then build your theories off that instead of pretending they don't exist and you're doing a physics experiment in a labratory. My problem is with people dressing up their IR theories as scientific fact on par with saying 1 + 1 = 2 instead of even *attempting* to acknowledge the ideological assumptions within their core tenets (Gramsci says hello on that one). Basically the same vibes I get from economics, tbh.",

We have been working on this problem for decades, with vast expertise built up on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific, and not insignificant computational resources when measured collectively. For DeepMind\u2019s group of \\~10 researchers, with primarily (but certainly not exclusively) ML expertise, to so thoroughly route everyone surely demonstrates the structural inefficiency of academic science. \n\nSo to answer your question, yes, it seems that in STEM at least the only reason certain problems are allowed to exist is because smart people neglected to solve them, not because they are unsolvable.",

I thought the theories we discussed, for example Copenhagen School / Securitization were quite practically oriented and they continue to inform my worldview to this day (together with my sociology classes from undergrad). Sure, I wasn\u2019t particularly impressed by the classical realism-liberalism types of theory but there is a lot more out there than that. And it\u2019s definitely helped me in my career in \u2018industry\u2019.",

Maybe you can do research papers on various human rights issues or something like that.\n\nFor me I really enjoy space related things, which is why I am planning on working in an astrospace company or organization.  \n\nEveryone is different and you have to figure out what you can do that makes you feel good about the work like it has meaning not objectively but subjectively to you is the work you plan on doing going to be fulfilling not in the work as a hobby sense but in the I'm getting things done that actually matter to me.",

I think I was fortunate to work in my industry for 8 years before I went back to grad school because it gave me perspective that my peers just didn't have access to. But what drives me to continue my academic pursuits was the idea that not all theories hold the same amount of water. I've just learned to ignore the branches of post-modern philosophical waxing and find and develop the theories that are applicable and CAN be used in the real world. \n\nArguing for my dissertation topic was an uphill battle, but it was important to me that if I write something, that it be not just statistically significant, but practically significant.",

      "text": "I dropped out of a biomedical engineering PhD (my focus was in optics), which you'd think would be a field more \"applicable\" to \"practical reality.\" Out of the huge swathes of ongoing biomedical research, only a few applications have had a direct, measurable, concrete benefit on people's lives. When I read *The Emperor of All Maladies* (nearly seven years ago), it pointed out that for all the cancer research that goes on in the world, the greatest health benefits were made via anti-smoking campaigns. \"Eat well,\" and \"exercise more\" are up there too. Dozens of labs work on nanotech, we do see advances in antibody therapies and drug delivery, or in imaging and image processing to ensure higher throughput of testing. But they feel years away from actually directly helping people, especially if you compare putting the same time/effort/resources into interventions that we know work. And especially in medicine and with US medical costs, there's just a pervasive sense that the vast majority of people are never going to be able to benefit from the technological advancements.\n\nOn the academia side, there was a whole cascade of \"we barely know what I'm investigating is a real phenomenon,\" \"even if we build something it'll take years for us to get it published,\" \"it takes years to go from publication to FDA approval,\" \"it takes years to go from FDA approval to medical acceptance/widespread impact (and commercial success).\" Conversely, it feels a lot easier to get an industry job and work on the 'applications,' leveraging existing technologies and aiming for low-hanging fruit to make people's lives better in measurable ways - reducing documentation time, automating processes, enabling discrete data collection and analytics, reducing barriers to help patients get the care they need. I'd assume there's a similar feel with actually working on policy directly.",

      "text": "Sorry a bit off topic, but as an interested amateur, is there any interest in a more empirical approach to IR theory? For example approaching the field through a falsification paradigm, where dominant hypotheses and theories are filtered through large data sets. For example, a paper falsifying constructivist theories could for example analyze large amounts of internal government documents from the Xiaoping era in China and find that despite no significant ideological changes within the CCP, China's relationship with the world changed significantly, suggesting that constructivist theory had poor predictive value in this specific case.... I feel like such an approach would be productive and also encourage the field to focus more on primary documents and primary accounts of events.  What are your thoughts? Does something like this already exist?",

          "text": "In any social sciences this falsification method gets taught (at least I hope so). But to be fair, it is not the only way to get to knowledge about the world. And it's far more complicated than in theory. As you said, a falsification would only be viable for that specific case, bc we examine the reality and are not in a lab and can do fancy double-blind experiments. There are most certainly variables we have not accounted for and therefore have a hard time to establish theories that work on their own. \n\nTheories in Social Sciences are more of a structured instrument, helping the researcher remember different possible influencing variables. Therefore every \"big\" theory alone feels detached from reality, bc it is just one way of many to think about reality. And every theory has some insightful aspects and cannot be falsified. You will always find a case, where a theory mattered in one way or the other. \n\nThat way we should always use theories as what they are: a helping instrument. Not an explanation on their own. \n\nExample from something I work on right now: Positive Integration in the European union. There is theory that says: If a directive from the EU is far away from existing rules in the member state, the member state will do a bad job at transforming the directive in their own law. That alone own is false very often, but is a great way to start the research, as you can ask: why do some countries do very well, even if they have to do a tremendous amount of work to do it and others are doing a bad job in implementing the directive, despite not having much adaptation to do at all.",
