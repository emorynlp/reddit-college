  "text": "Hi all! \n\nI\u2019m a PhD student in my final year who struggles with anxiety after hitting the wall during my master\u2019s. I really enjoy my job, but I struggle a lot with sending my work out - as, for example, in working papers for conferences. I know that anxiety is a common mental illness in academia and I was wondering if this group might have any advice for how to deal with these aspects of the job? They\u2019re extremely important, of course, so I know I need to do it, but crippling anxiety hits me every time and it would be nice to find some way to deal with it. \n\nTo note: I\u2019m already on anxiety suppressants and I do have a therapist I visit regularly, so this is more about ways you might deal with anxiety as it relates specifically to your tasks and any tips you might have on how to deal. \n\nThank you!",

Stop caring what my advisor may think of me (I know I am a great scientist or have great potential). Stop caring what my peers may think of my abilities (most of what others think of you is a projection of how they criticize themselves) And stop taking criticism personally, I welcome it now with open arms if it is constructive. Makes me better. If it is rude, I politely explain I will not be talked down to and if they would like to engage as adults I will wait for another time. I excuse myself. \n\nThe biggest thing for me is discovering my self-worth as a human being and finding a sense of deeper purpose in life (that\u2019s ongoing). I know that\u2019s not something you just convey with tips and fun facts. But I always encourage people to dig deeper into themselves, as scientists the answers are outside of us in the material world. But we\u2019re people too.",

And today, when I woke up, I realised that my anxiety levels were just way too high for me to be productive. So I\u2019ve spent the day trying to relax, doing my hobby, walking and cuddling with my dog. Tomorrow is technically a holiday where I am but I don\u2019t celebrate it so I\u2019ll make up for it then if my body is up to task.

The goal of mindfulness is to help you build a better awareness of your body-mind connection. You practice by focusing on your body with non-judgemental observation of everything you experience. When you are feeling anxious, mindfulness helps you recognize it and observe it which ultimately helps you resolve the discomfort. It is also a really good reason to take 5 minutes whenever you need a break from everything; just do nothing and feel your breath and rest.\n  \nIt has really been a game-changer in terms of managing the impact of my anxiety on my performance.",

It is not easy and it is not rewarding financially, and while it can be great at times it\u2019s a real grind.\n\nI don\u2019t know what field you work in but *every single PhD graduate I\u2019ve ever met* has taken for granted the fact that we learn an analytical way of thinking that has great application to jobs outside of academia and outside of research. Do not box yourself into the rat race just because you have been at university so long.\n\nMajority of PhD graduates will never stay in academia, majority of the academics who have trained you will have been in academia their whole life and will have very limited knowledge of life outside academia, from how to get there to what it is like experientially.\n\nGood luck.

      "text": ">I really enjoy my job, but I struggle a lot with sending my work out\n\nWhy do you find this to be a struggle?\n\nIf it's anxiety over making mistakes then you might find it useful to have a strict checklist before sending work away.\n\nFor example, you might put things like \"check title for typos\", \"check bibliography formatting\", and \"check equations against original source\". As you do each one, you physically place a tick next to the item and jot down any changes you had to make. When it comes time to finally submit, if you feel anxious then you have this physical piece of paper as evidence that you've checked all of these things. \n\nIt's kinda like someone with OCD taking a picture of their locked door in the morning. It can help remind you that you really did do X and that you don't need to check.\n\nReally, lists in general are **hugely** beneficial to anxiety. Not only for sending away work, but also that general anxiety you might get over \"forgetting something\" (which you usually haven't). Focus all of your anxieties into getting the lists right for 10-15 minutes and then give yourself over to them. If you really did leave something off the list then do the thing, add it to the list, and immediately tick it off.",

      "text": "I'm a PhD student in my first year and I have anxiety too, particularly when it comes to public speaking - which sends me into a sweaty, shaking spiral of shite. To deal with anxiety I used to drink a LOT of alcohol in the evenings and on weekends, which is a coping mechanism but not a good one, long term. Now I take cbd oil in the evenings, I exercise for about an hour midday (WFH), I make sure to go outside every weekend, I try not to work past 6pm. When my anxiety was particularly bad, I was prescribed the SSRI citalopram, which I found to be amazing.",

      "text": "I would try to identify exactly what your anxiety is about. Then make a for/against list of only object facts which support the anxiety belief e.g. if you are anxious that you will have written something stupid in a paper and not notice, a 'for' fact might be that someone else told you that you do this often, and an 'against' fact might be this has never happened before. List as many as you can.\n\nThis helps put your anxiety in perspective and seeing how realistic the beliefs are on paper can reduce the associated feelings.",
