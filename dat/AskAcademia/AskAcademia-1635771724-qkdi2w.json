  "title:": "How much into depth of a potential supervisor\u2019s research an applicant for a PhD should go into?",
  "text": "When applying for a PhD students normally apply to several schools and have to be familiar with different researchers\u2019 field. How much time should I invest to become fairly familiar with their research? How many papers I should study and how much time should I invest? Is one year enough to study 5-6 different researchers\u2019 work? What should I pay most attention to? \n(I am still preparing for undergrad in STEM field but hope to prepare myself enough for a PhD later on. As the years go by so fast and I know my future aspirations..)",

      "text": "You don\u2019t need to study them in so much depth. Give each of their lab pages a good looking over and then read over recent a review or perspectives from them. Then go on NIH Reporter and look at their most recently funded grants. To get them interested in you, you should show familiarity with their work (their web page and papers) and also demonstrate you have the skill set and aligned interests to take them where they want to go next (grants in Reporter)",

      "text": "I'd say even more important than knowing their research, you should carefully choose them based on their personalities/character. Your supervisor has the power of making your life hell (or heaven), so I would suggest the most important thing is to chat to their students and try to spot potential red flags.  Jem Heesmtra wrote a helpful article on how to choose a supervisor: [https://cen.acs.org/careers/graduate-school/Choosing-graduate-adviser/99/i33](https://cen.acs.org/careers/graduate-school/Choosing-graduate-adviser/99/i33)",

      "text": "You don't need to be an expert in their research. Look at some of their recent papers to get a sense of what they're up to, but if you're spending days studying their papers, you're going too far. Completely agree with /u/belamalta10 that it's more important to understand what your potential supervisor is like as a person  - assuming that it's just about research is the biggest mistake potential PhD students make.",
