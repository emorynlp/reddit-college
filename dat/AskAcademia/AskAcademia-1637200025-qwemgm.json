  "text": "I've been lurking on this sub for a while and everytime I come here I'm reminded of how dumb and unmotivated I am. I'm currently doing my masters and I feel like a loser already thinking I'm here because of some dumb luck. I see motivated and intelligent and talented people around me, who has got a clear of idea of how things should pan out. I have narrowed down my PhD options but I'm so scared to look into it because I'm afraid my beliefs of my abilities will be true. I am sad and hopeless and I feel so alone in this journey.",

      "text": "Imposter syndrome is real, & it is a real pain in the ass. It tries to haunt, taunt, & inhibit *us*, often as an unseen & unremarked on presence. But let me do you a solid & tell you about it, so you know it, by name. It is not you, it is an imposter trying to tie itself to you, but it can\u2019t tie anything to anything, not really, because it lacks agency. You have agency, & what agency it is! You\u2019re working on a masters degree-you had to work to meet the requirements of admission into your program, apply, & get accepted-& you did & you\u2019re doing it. Those around you had to do the same things you did in order to get it-they are there with you, just as you are there with them. I am willing to bet that, in this instance too, looks (or how people *look* or *seem* to be) are not everything, & the very people who look motivated & intelligent, & in possession of a clear plan for how things will be, might very well be those things (just as you are), yet may too be feeling the presence of an imposter. \n\nI know what a ceaseless menace this imposter syndrome can be; throughout my associates, my bachelors, my masters, & all through (now ABD of) my PhD, it pulled at me, droning on & on, whispering stories of my imminent demise. After years of it trying to be a harbinger, I can now clearly note, it fucking lies. Sure, it is still there, lingering in the back-most background, but it\u2019s now more or less buried by internalized acknowledgments of my accomplishments, & is muted by a stronger sense of self value &  worth. \n\nThink of *everything* you had to accomplish to get to where you are now, & acknowledge all of that for what it is, & for what that grants in you as the one who accomplished it. You did the work to get there, if you\u2019re still in the program, you\u2019re doing the work needed to remain there. Know that it isn\u2019t luck that gets most people, including you, into advance degree programs-that is accomplished by each individual, just wall as it was with you.",

      "text": "I don't say this to be harsh, but from a place of genuine concern. Are you sure a PhD is for you, or at least a PhD at this time? You seem to have already decided you are too stupid to do one and are happy to tell everyone that. If you have a bachelor's and master's you're as well equipped to do a PhD as anyone else, but you say you are unmotivated and claim to be too dumb. A PhD is a long slog and mentally tough. If you go into one believing you can't do it, do you feel you'd have the mental resilience to see it through without destroying your mental health? \n\nI sympathize strongly with imposter syndrome and being unsure, but honestly when someone states as vehemently as you that they cannot do a PhD and talks about themselves in the language you talk about yourself I fear a PhD would destroy your mental health. You're already half way to quitting and you haven't even got on a program yet.\n\nIf you came to me I'd probably suggest deferring a decision about a PhD and I think you'd benefit from therapy to deal with your mental health. Then revisit the question of doing a PhD.",
