  "text": "I moved to the US to complete my PhD in Economics. My scholarship placed me in a low-ranked university (Southern Illinois University Carbondale), and I\u2019m starting to worry about this. When I tell other people that I go to SIUC, they ask me why I\u2019d choose this university out of all places. Well\u2026 I didn\u2019t! I\u2019m starting to have a lot of anxiety about this. I\u2019m thinking I ruined my future since I can\u2019t go to another school now. I\u2019m now embarrassed to even say what I do (where I go to school). 2 years in and I\u2019ve thought about dropping out. I\u2019m wondering if my future looks gloomy because of this.",

And my other coworkers agreed with my opinion. So yeah, after observing the people around me, I have concluded that the brand name of the schools doesn't mean much.",

If someone asks how you chose your school, you can just let them know that SIUC offered you the best opportunity and you\u2019re excited to learn and research through that program! Also, I know enough about central and southern Illinois to know that people may wonder more about how you chose that location (that doesn\u2019t have a lot going on) rather than that school in particular. \n\nRegardless, you are there and it just may be the perfect place for you. Congratulations on getting in a PhD program. I hope you have a great experience, a wonderful mentor, and if your school doesn\u2019t offer everything you\u2019d like to be a part of, I hope you are able to find any extra opportunities you need or want. \n\nI know brilliant people from various types of schools.",

I am getting my masters in business leadership from a small private college in the middle of Iowa and everyone keeps telling me \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you go to the university of Iowa or drake university\u201d. And I am getting ready to write my thesis and it\u2019s incredibly discouraging. At the end of the day I am always told a masters is a masters and a PhD is a PhD.
