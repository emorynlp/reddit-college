      "text": "Times are changing and I\u2019d say yes. \n\nVery formally speaking, the habilitation denotes the \u201cability to teach\u201d (facultas docendi coming along the degree \u201ehabil.\u201c) at the very institution you obtain it. That could even be limited to one faculty of a university, in theory at least. When given the \u201cvenia legendi\u201d (the permission to teach), in many universities both are given together, that gives you independence in teaching, including the supervision and examination at doctoral level. Here, you typically change to the rank of a \u201ePrivatdozent\u201c (edit: regardless your employment status), but again many universities do both facultas docendi and venia legendi in one breath.\n\nThe very qualification alone, however, is then typically taken in other countries as the equivalent to their \u201chabilitation\u201d and considered explicitly by recruitment and promotion committees; for example, it is seen as equivalent as the docent status in Sweden. I myself obtained my habilitation in Germany and became a full professor in Sweden (when changing there, my habilitation was seen as equal to docent). I know from past discussions with colleagues that the same holds for Austria, Spain and Netherlands (just to name three very distinct systems that I explored out of curiosity). The habilitation processes, however, are very very different.\n\nFinal note: in contrast to many countries (all?), the habilitation in Germany is formally an academic, postdoctoral degree (e.g. dr. rer. nat. habil.) and, hence, is recognised as such in other academic systems.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEDIT: reason for changes are, in my opinion, that it is becoming easier to compare along the career paths from TT assistant prof positions to tenured positions and beyond. At least that is my impression.",

      "text": "Short answer, generally no.\n\nLong answer: some systems like german speaking swiss and germany may accept the habilitation (and both systems allow for instance for PD positions, as in the german system)\n\nOther systems may have similar requirements so that getting an habilitation in the other system may be easy, but it is unlikely that the german habilitation will double count as French habilitation, and it won't double as an habilitation for the Italian system.\n\nSo depending on what you are applying (or willing to apply to) it's probably good to touch base with the target institution, as there may be some shortcuts or not, but it depends on both country and field",
