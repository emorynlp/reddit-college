I have no problem with my research or the field I'm in, but I prefer plain old teaching over teaching and research. I was contemplating applying to schools for a PhD once I graduate, but I'm wondering if I need to. Can I teach at the university level without one? I understand PhD programs are heavily rooted in research, which again I have no problem with doing, but I'm wondering if this path is necessary if I'm interested more in teaching.",

Which might be possible given that a TON of colleges are hiring masters degrees to teach a lot of classes. Saves them money.

But you do need to be a confident go-getter and a great student yourself.",

      "text": "Take this for what it\u2019s worth as I\u2019m speaking from a social sciences perspective. I\u2019m an academic who strongly favors teaching and I knew that since I was in grad school. In my field, it is increasingly, and already very difficult, to obtain any sort of teaching gig without a PhD. With higher ed finances the way they are now, I don\u2019t see this changing. I was hired about 4 years ago on the tenure track at a teaching focused university. They still expect us to be professionally engaged in research (although the expectations are very different than what you would find in a research focused school.) Even though teaching ability was central to the hire, all serious candidates were involved in both high quality teaching and research. I\u2019ve seen a lot of friends with strong teaching and research abilities struggle to find jobs, so the competition is very strong. My research centers on student engagement/learning, so I\u2019m able to intertwine the two to an extent and still enjoy both. \n\nEven if you\u2019re not looking for a tenure track role, full-time lecturer positions are hard to find and very competitive. The other option is to adjunct but those positions are being cut, increasingly competitive, and not stable at all - every semester is a crap shoot to what classes you might be assigned and if you\u2019ll even get any classes, the pay is an abomination to the amount of work you do, and you\u2019re not guaranteed great benefits. With the market the way it is, I expect higher expected qualifications from adjuncts and other part-time lecturers. \n\nThe most success I\u2019ve seen from people moving into full time lecture or \u201cmore secure\u201d adjunct work is from people who invested greatly into the teaching they do at the institution where they are working toward their degree and after time, securing the golden egg lecture position created for them to stay (this is anecdotal.)",

Another good point this poster made is taking advantage of teaching development opportunities at the institution you\u2019re currently at. Workshops, certifications, etc. are a great way to keep focused on the teaching goal while disguising yourself as prioritizing research in a doctoral program.",

      "text": "This might be too radical, but have you considered teaching at the high school or community college level? I strongly considered a PhD and got my MA, but knew, like you, that teaching was my main interest, research less so. It's relatively easy to find a teaching job at a private high school where you have a lot of discretion over classroom content, teaching style, etc. While the level content  leaves a lot to be desired, I've been developing my own electives that scratch that itch and gear them towards the advanced students. Plus, because I'm not trapped in the higher ed paradigm of lecturing, I've created dynamic, gamified courses where we reenact and simulate the content and it's been great fun. Especially with a PhD, you should have no problem finding a teaching gig at a private high school where you'll have autonomy, a focus on teaching, strong staff support, and a salary equal to or greater than what you might be able to expect vying for hard to find TT faculty positions.  \n\n\nThere are of course downsides. Should you land a TT position, you'll probably eventually make more than a private high school teacher (but from what I can tell, that's a serious roll of the dice). You won't be able to dive into your subject as deeply as you'd like which is my main problem. I go off on the political economy of the Early Modern Period when these kids don't even know the three branches of government. And your mileage will certainly vary when it comes to administration (though mine is amazing and at many private schools they will be far more receptive than what you'll find at public schools).   \n\n\nMy dad is tenured faculty at a major research institution and basically got it made making lots of money from salary and publishing so I know what you might be missing out on. But he spends 10+ hours a day doing research and writing and has my entire life. Teaching is very much secondary. So if you're not in love with the research, I'd definitely suggest going a different route. Plus, after this year, there's going to be even more major teaching shortages throughout the country as up to a quarter of my compatriots are thinking about quitting due to shitty covid conditions",

I got an MA in my subject and, to teach publicly, I'd have to go into debt to get a credential. Instead, at my private school, my class sizes are capped at 12, I have broad discretion over the curriculum, tons of support, my colleagues are awesome (several have PhDs, all have interesting backgrounds), and we're not overworked and expected to go far beyond our teaching responsibilities for a caseload of 125. I have fewer than 50 students this year and an administration that has my back.\n\nIt's probably harder to find a job, but not that much harder (I paired up with agencies like Carney Sandoe). The pandemic is hopefully a one off, but my school had the resources to get everyone set up with all the tech they needed. Yeah, it sucks, the teaching is nowhere close to as fun as it is normally, but higher ed faculty are dealing with the same issues.\n\nIf you're already looking at faculty positions, then the prospect of potentially working somewhere that's not your top choice is already there. With that proviso, higher education, and a placement agency, you will find a job that will lead to a comfortable, if not glorious, standard of living.  \n\n\nIt does, however, break my heart that not only can I legally not teach at public school, but that all the incentives are stacked against it. I was educated at a public school and philosophically think that they're one of, if not the, most important institutions in a country. But class sizes of 30+, shitty administrations, low pay, and needing to get an additional degree at my own expense dissuade me from that route",

That being said, my university probably has a half dozen master's level lecturers, but they all teach writing composition (we don't have a doc program in that to have them teach).  The sciences also has a few MS level lectures that coordinate the lab classes.  Of the adjuncts in liberal arts, somewhere between 25-50% of them have a MA (once again, most of those teaching composition).  \n\nThat being said, fewer than 10 full-time positions out of 300+ full-time faculty is not something to bank on.  And you do not want to count on making a living out of being a part-time adjunct. \n\nWhen I was at a small teaching-focused liberal arts college, everyone hired in the last couple of decades had a terminal degree.  \n\nAt the community colleges in my area, the full-time faculty are about 50/50 PhD and MA/MS.  The more rural community colleges have a higher proportion of MA/MS full timers.",
