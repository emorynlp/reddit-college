  "title:": "Being added as a co-author without contributing to the actual research?",
  "text": "My advisor recently asked me to convert the formatting of a paper that was rejected from one journal to the formatting of the next journal they will be submitting it to. In exchange they have offered to add me as a co-author. I also created one part of a figure that appears in the paper, but that didn't require me to have any knowledge or understanding of the paper. \n\nNormally I wouldn't have considered editing or figure art enough to deserve being a co-author. I'm slightly concerned about how it would make me look if someone asks what I contributed. The answer would have to be something like \"not much, just some formatting of the final document\".\n\nShould I accept their offer and put my name on the paper?",

      "text": "I think your contribution could easily add up to authorship depending on the norms of your field, and you are just coming in here with some imposter syndrome. Even if not, I'd take it as a \"gift\". Everybody else who you're competing against later in your career is playing the authorship game, you ought to too if you want a competitive CV.\n\nNobody is going to bamboozle you at a conference demanding you explain your contribution to a random paper of yours is. Even if someone does, you can simply answer \"I made figure x and contributed to the drafting of the paper\", and that's both perfectly true and in line with typical authorship guidelines.\n\nTo be honest, it looks almost more like your advisor is trying to help you by honestly getting your name on to some more papers rather than they just want to bribe you to do some bullshit reformatting.",

Something you should know about research is most manuscripts are written by really only 2-4 people even if there\u2019s tons of co-authors.",

When I'm interviewing someone and I ask them about a paper on their CV and they have no idea what it contains, it's not quite a red flag, but it will immediately make me question how much else on their CV is just padding. It also makes me wary in the future of other people coming out of that lab. If on the other hand, they're like \"well, I was a pretty minor contributor on that paper, I was brought on in the last minute to help get it out the door, but the major findings are X,Y, and Z\", it'll reflect much more positively on them.",

If it's inappropriate/unstrategic to make a thing out of it with your advisor you can just do it for your own satisfaction and have it ready to mention, honestly, if it ever comes up.",
