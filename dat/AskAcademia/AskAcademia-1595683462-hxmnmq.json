  "text": "I've been an unpaid volunteer for a few years. A professor I'm working with wants to make me lead author of a paper because of all the work I've done to help him. I've done a lot of basic programming to manipulate genetic data. But the guy really doesn't seem to know what he's doing. I have to keep explaining things to him and telling him/sending him the same things over and over. And reading some of the paper he's made a lot of basic mistakes. So we'll use a program somebody else made that does one thing, and he'll list it as doing something slightly different in the paper. But still enough that anyone who knows what they're doing would look at it and say \"What?\"\n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to afford to get a Bachelor's degree, so if I planned on having a career in academia I might be more worried. But are there any other negative effects from being the lead author of a bad paper? For me I thought it would just be a cool thing to be able to say. When he initially offered it to me I declined because I thought I'm really not educated enough on the subject to be attached to the claims being made in the paper (though he told me he was very cautious with his claims).\n\nAm I being used as a scapegoat or something? Thank you for any input, we've been working on this for years and quite frankly I just want it to be over",

      "text": "It sounds to me like he\u2019s trying to woo you to research for him more long term. Or another option is that he\u2019s gained a reputation for writing bad papers and his submissions keep get rejected from journals that do not blind the submission process, so he\u2019s hoping that putting your name on it might help him get an actual publication. And last possibility is he\u2019s in a field where the last author is considered most prestigious (I think some life sciences do this, but I\u2019m not sure which), so what he\u2019s offering you isn\u2019t as amazing as you think. You could ask him which spot is most prestigious. \n\nYou could ask him if he\u2019ll pay you, or secure you a scholarship for undergrad, as those would be more useful to you than a first authorship. Or could ask him that you do the actual writing. Or even just that you get to edit what he\u2019s written. Anything that has your name of it, my personal opinion is you should do the best you can to make sure it\u2019s something you could be proud of. \n\nBut as for whether this will hurt you, even if you do end up going for a Bachelor\u2019s, I doubt it. Most academics assume that the quality of research a person can produce is directly proportional to the level of education they\u2019ve completed, so they won\u2019t expect someone with a HS diploma to be first author of *anything*, and if you are that\u2019s already a bonus, and if it\u2019s not the best paper and they happen to read that and see, they\u2019ll chalk it up to your lack of experience and an incompetent prof on the project. But an admissions office isn\u2019t going to read your papers.",

Ask him or suggest that you go over the draft and make those corrections yourself and then give it back to him to check.\n\nMany prof/PIs can be pretty scatter-brained and dont really remember details of conversations etc. Better to be first author of a paper thats correct than one that's inaccurate. Although it likely wont hurt your career, it'll probably bug you down the line as it would be easy to fix it yourself now by just writing in what you know/ corrections.",

However, if you cautious and data backs up what you say, there is nothing wrong with submitting the paper.  \n\nAs for the quality, bad papers are submitted by good researchers all of the time.  I have peer-reviewed papers from excellent labs that were complete trash.  I look back at some of my papers from grad school and cringe.  Most papers are never read anyway.  At your stage of your career, any publication is quite impressive.  Just also be prepared that if it is as bad as you think, that the peer-reviewers will tear it to shreds. \n\nAlso, someone mentioned about last author being more prestigious.  I publish in the bio-med field.  Yes, last author is important, but so is first author.  The first author is usually the trainee that did the most work and the last author is the professor who runs the lab.  This system was developed so that both the trainee and professor get credit appropriate to their stage of career and so that trainees did not get screwed out of credit by senior faculty like you see in other fields.  So there is nothing shady if he offers you first author and he takes last.",

The hypothesis and narrative in the introduction turned out to be widely inconsistent with the data available. Normally, this would not be a major issue, however this paper was a clinical case study (you can't make up nonsense to reinterpret X for Y in these kinds of papers).\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that, as first author, you may have the opportunity to correct mistakes in the paper so that is both publishable and technically accurate. \n\nSo, my question for you is how much work will this paper be for you? Are the errors so egregious that the whole paper will need to be rewritten? These are the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself. \n\nOn a final note, I do recognize your concern as well, which is a valid one. You don't want to be an author on papers which are poorly done or dubiously conceived, nor should you associate yourself with individual researchers who simply have no idea what they are doing or willingly publish poor or fraudulent research. You should count this experience as a blessing because these lessons often come too late for many people in your position.",

I think you'll end up in a scenario where you tell them and they react positively, but it feels anticlimactic because you know the work is bad.\n\nTo give an example: you tell your friends you got to spend some time in Japan, and it was amazing. They're impressed and say things like, \"That must've been incredible!\" and ask you if you had any good food.\n\nMeanwhile, you know that actually you just had a six-hour layover at the Tokyo airport and ate at a Starbucks. Their reaction is genuine, but it doesn't penetrate or feel good if it does, because you know something they don't (and you can't tell them that thing). And you might even feel like you kind of \"tricked\" them into being impressed. (Not saying that it's a bad or mean thing to do at all. Obviously no one is hurt or at all affected by such interactions, and I think we've all done it at some point, which is how we learn.)\n\nHope that makes sense. Definitely get paid for your work, even if that requires getting a new position. I'm frustrated to hear that this professor has dangled the possibility of financial support in front of you multiple times but never followed through. You sound like a diligent, focused individual.",

      "text": "Even if you do go for a Bachelor\u2019s it wouldn\u2019t matter; people would only bother to look up and read the paper if you applied to a research based graduate program (e.g. a PhD program, *maybe* some Masters programs). So, I wouldn\u2019t worry about negative repercussions.\n\nWhat you should do beyond that depends on *how* it\u2019s bad. Does it have unfounded or incorrect claims? Is it unclear and poorly/weirdly written in terms of syntax and structure? Can it be fixed with proofreading? Is it the work itself that\u2019s not very impressive?\n\nIf the researcher insists on unfounded or incorrect claims, then I wouldn\u2019t associate myself with the paper. If the paper is just riddled with tiny fixable errors then I would correct them. In principle any author should sign off on everything in the paper.",

          "text": "Hello, thank you for your answer. I don't think that there's anything factually inaccurate in the paper. He made claims that he says he believes are very cautious and take into account limitations we've encountered. The whole process has felt less than professional however. I'd maybe even go so far to say he's struggling to understand and apply the things that need to be known for this project. I'm not sure there's anything too damaging in the paper. Maybe if we're lucky it will simply be a disappointment",
