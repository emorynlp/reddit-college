  "text": "Hi everyone, My father and I live in an EU country and lately he's thinking about working in the USA as a physics teacher (in college). I don't know if it's possible (I'm worried it will be hard as foreigner to find a job there), I'll tell you about his CV:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- he's a degree in physics and a ph.d. (he did it in the usa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- most of his career he worked as a high school teacher (teaching in college is almost impossible here without knowing someone)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- BUT he wrote a lot of articles (more than 100, most in English) and he even did some important discoveries (I Don't know the details because I don't understand anything about physics), he's very active in the research field and very good in his field (non linear mathematic etc... Sorry I'm not more specific, I don't know the subject)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any chance of finding a job in the usa for him? (I know trying in another eu country would be easier but he always loved the USA) What would the salary be? His age (almost 60) woul be a problem? Where should he starts looking? Thx for the answers\n\nEdit: his H index is 20 and the articles are peer reviewed",

      "text": "Him being older and a non-citizen are non-issues; a lot of US faculty are foreigners, and really the only time where citizenship can become a problem is in engineering departments because of how much DoD money there is floating around (particularly if the school has a solid nuclear engineering program), but even then they only countries they worry about are basically just China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\nThe bigger issue is just that there aren't that many open positions for professors in the US; the ratio of doctoral degrees to faculty openings is arguably like 20:1, and may be upwards of 50:1 for some fields.",

It probably won't matter for a contingent or adjunct faculty position, but it will very likely matter for a tenure-track appointment at a research university, since there is a substantial investment in junior faculty, which universities like to see pay off in the form of significant impact on the field eventually.",

              "text": "To be honest, I have never seen an article published by a high school teacher in a peer review academic journal. Because you have to provide your affiliations and never seen a high school. Sometimes, I see statisticians (from private sector) because they do the analyses, but this is also not common. If you don't mind can you put (give a link) one of his articles that he published with co-authors? So, you will be able to keep the anonymity. Alternatively, you can write your father's name on Google Scholar. Even if he has not an account, it must show all articles he published (if they are academic articles). Having too many articles is not something good. The quality of the articles is more important. This is also something quantified by h-index and total citations your articles get. For instance, 10 articles with 500 citations is better then 100 articles with 100 citations. Since he has a PhD, he has some research experience, has a chance, but new graduates will definitely have a better chance for a position unless your father's articles are really academic (peer reviewed in academic journals) and impactful articles. The other thing is why are you asking these questions for him? If he has a PhD, he should definetely know what I told you regarding peer-review, h-index, citations etc. and how academia works.",
