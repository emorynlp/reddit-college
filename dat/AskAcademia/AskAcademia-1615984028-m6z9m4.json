  "title:": "Does anybody feel like academic publication pressure is becoming unsustainable?",
  "text": "I am becoming very frustrated with the publication culture in my field. Becoming an expert takes a long time and so is making a valuable contribution to the literature.  However, publication pressure is turning many contributions into spin-offs that are slightly different from the publication before, and they are often redundant. Further, a failed experiment would never get published but it would actually provide insight to peers as to what route not to explore. I think that publication pressure is overwhelming for academics and in detriment of scientific literature.  I feel like we seriously need to rethink the publication reward system.  Does anybody have thoughts on this?",

I've thought of this from a philosophical / probability point of view.\n\nLet's consider a biological analysis method that doesn't actually work. However, just by random chance/noise it might produce the hoped for result 5% of the time. 20 researchers work on the method around the world. It doesn't work for 19 of them. They never publish. The one person who represents the 5% random chance gets into Nature and gets a career. By publishing noise.",

If you don't come with at least one Nature or Science paper or a gigantic pot of funding, you have no realistic chance of a faculty position. You almost certainly won't get a gigantic pot of funding unless you have papers in Nature and Science. The editors of these journals have never demonstrated their ability to determine which papers are the best (quite the opposite if you ask me), yet we basically let them determine how funding and faculty positions are distributed and therefore who gets to have a career.",

                  "text": "I took a postdoc in a federally-funded research center in my topic area, in large part because no faculty offers were forthcoming when I graduated. I figured a postdoc beat adjuncting. When I got here, I realized three things:\n\n1. I don't care for full-time, balls-to-the-wall policy research. Too monotonous.\n2. My boss was mentally unbalanced, but badly in need of a coordinator for our many grants, initiatives, and policies. She was so busy teaching and growing her tenure file that she left the day-to-day operations in the hands of work-study students, and it was a mess.\n3. I'm surprisingly adept at managing programs and people, and don't mind yanking a task out of someone's hands if I can do it better/quicker.\n\nI learned what I could about administration - taking on-campus training courses in research management and pre-award, meeting all the right administrators, learning how our system worked and how our federal sponsor liked things - and applied for the administrative position when it came open. By that point, my crazy-pants boss knew she had no choice but to hire me. I had trained myself into the job before I even had it. I made a lot of big changes right away, but people keep telling me how much more focused and productive things are compared to years before. I'm now building a career as a research administrator. They have a certification for that field, and there are always courses and webinars to grow my skills on either pre-award (helping PI's find and apply to grants - hugely popular) and post-award (what I do now, which is handing out money and monitoring for compliance. This is more boring and meaner, so most people don't like doing it). They also let me adjunct from time to time, so I can teach a little if I want to.\n\nThere are tons of administrative jobs out there on places like insidehigheredjobs, and you'll see that most are very focused. It's easy to gain experience in those roles, but you usually have to do your own legwork. A lot of administrative jobs seem to be a matter of slipping a finger in the door, and slowly widening it until your skills and their vacancies line up. If you want to be Director of Student Housing, find an entry point there. If you want to be a research administrator, or something like a director of service learning, you may have to find a crack and fill it. And plenty of Ph.D.'s end up in admin roles: IRB readers, grant managers, directors of research or special projects, etc.\n\nA great many (I might even say most) research faculty HATE administrative functions with a passion. They want and need grants, but hate writing budgets and progress reports. They don't want to hire students, write press releases, create podcast episodes, or match up their deliverables with industry partners. I do all these things in my job, and despite cracking the whip at times, they seem appreciative that these duties are in the hands of someone they know and trust. I don't miss the faculty hunt.\n\nUniversities need good managers. If you're good with details, willing to juggle different tasks and deadlines, and able to be firm with powerful people who break the rules, you might be a good candidate for management. Plenty of brilliant scientists are terrible managers, and that's okay.",

                          "text": "In my field, we often have PIs who \"round up\" their student workers. Say your project really only needs 1.25 GRAs on it, but we can afford to pay you for two. So you hire two, split the work, and end up annoyed at how little the kids seem to get done. Meanwhile, \"management\" is still solely on you, the PI. In this lucky scenario, I've seen PIs have great success in using one GRA to do the research/analysis, and the other to do all the paperwork, compliance, reporting, etc. Administrative work is just as vital to learn as data analysis. It's not as sexy, but it's instrumental in growing a young scientist's career. One just has to get the right person in the role - someone who's great with deadlines and willing to tell a professor \"You have a deadline!\"",

That's the one that gives you a number N based on having N papers with N citations. \n\nSo an h-index of 4 means you have at least 4 papers with at least 4 citations each. \n\nIt's far from perfect, but it does give you a sense of both a researchers productivity and how much the community respects their work. IMO one benefit is that one or two highly cited papers aren't going to change your h-index, so it's not skewed by popularity/lucky timing as much as other metrics.",

It is a bit out of control, but good worth while Scientists stand out and are competitive enough to obtain funding. \n\nThe problem in academia is that there is too many PhDs competing for the same position, and nobody has enough grit to admit they just aren't good enough to be in the upper echelon. Unfortunately that upper echelon isn't governed entirely by ability, but it's still important to know when you have lost this rigged game. \n\nI don't direct this at you personally, but if people are really smart they will quit complaining about this sinking ship and know when to cut their loss and get out.

The most prestigious (and therefore secure for tenure purposes) publishers are university presses, and we all know the financial condition of universities these days. They're getting hit on the demand side as well, because fewer and fewer libraries are buying books (and these are the kind of books that mostly only libraries buy). So the presses might not even look at your proposal, let alone send it out for review. Universities have effectively outsourced P&T to presses that are on life support themselves.",

The sad part is to see that all about the journal names. Nobody cares about the continuity, robust data or reproducibility, they keep looking for fancy experiments to fit fancy journals. Our lab discussions don't involve around the scientific ideas,  they involve around journal names (e.g. this would be a Nature paper etc.) I mean after all our PI is  \"ambitious\" enough to keep pushing us by telling \"I want that each one to have a Nature paper\" and yes, this is a toxic lab environment. I think this is why many people want to quit  academia.\n\nPS: This also creates a huge inequality in terms of fellowships etc. Many of us don't have luxury to do a 8 year PhD project and wait for a publication for that long.",

      "text": "Yes indeed. This is what I think various metaresearch studies, starting with John Ioannidis' much-cited work, have been documenting that has especially affected science and social science--that the pressure to publish and the growth of various metrics for measuring not just quantity but impact factors, combined with a standard that says negative results are non-publishable, has become an incentive system that is pushing scientific knowledge towards false or misleading claims. Not because people are deliberately falsifying data but instead they are conducting studies in ways that are increasingly and perhaps often unconsciously designed to churn out publishable outcomes in a reliable way even if those outcomes turn out to be marginally significant or largely an artifact of the research design and thus not reproducible or applicable in a broader way. \n\nWe are doing this to ourselves. Academics still in theory have control over the evaluation of their peers and still in many research institutions control many aspects of faculty practice. We could seriously de-escalate the standards we use to hire, tenure, promote and reward researchers and stop this race to the bottom. We could do that at the same time as taking back control over scholarly publication from predatory for-profit publishers who contribute to the overproduction of scholarship, because it's the voluntary labor of faculty that adds the important value of such scholarship (both in peer review and in doing the research in the first place). We need scholarship that has the room to breath. We need researchers to publish negative results. We need scholars to have time and space to think, to noodle around idly with ideas that aren't easily turned into an experimental design. That is how the knowledge that has mattered in the past has come into being. Many of the most important findings and arguments and ideas that we still use and value today came from long-term, slow-accumulating research of a kind that would never be fundable or publishable today, and would never survive the scrutiny of neoliberal styles of institutional management.",

I could--in theory--publish one world-changing article in a top journal in 5 years or 5 mediocre papers in an barely-non-predatory journal, and as far as the accreditation body is concerned, the 5 papers make me more qualified to teach.",

The result? A bunch of new journals and a flood of half-assed articles. \n\nIf R2s would be happy with one quality article every 12-24 months it would benefit everyone. Editors and reviewers wouldn\u2019t have to deal with so many hastily prepared articles, many faculty at R1s would have a quicker review and publication time, and faculty at R2s could take their time and publish work reflective of their abilities. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that every article published by an R2 is not good science - I\u2019m not saying that at all - I\u2019m simply saying the rising expectations for R2s is throwing the whole publication process off balance and it\u2019s not fair to anyone.",

But it is worth thinking g about the causes of this. \n\nIn my mind the main driver of all of this is that the job market is ultra-competitive. Most fields produce an order of magnitude (or more!) PhDs than they have TT openings. As such there is a massive culling at the postdoctoral level and then at the Assistant Professor level. \n\nNow of course some fields are not training PhDs to necessarily go into academia but many are and in those cases this pressure applies. \n\nFor example in my department we regularly get 500+ applications for every TT opening. This is very typical for my field and many others. \n\nSo you need some criteria to separate people and at that scale it will obviously not be a subtle or thoughtful process. Counting pubs is obviously not an optimal algorithm but if we didn\u2019t do that, we would need some other metric. Letters? We get 500x3 letters, how to separate those? Etc. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not to mention grants and in particular final grant reports. If you are writing the final report for a $400,000 grant, you better have something listed there. Pubs is usually the thing\n\nAnother issue is something that has occurred more recently, but it\u2019s that now many places that aren\u2019t really research schools at all now require a solid publication record for tenure. In my opinion this is unwise but faculty doing research is good for a small school\u2019s prestige.  Obviously this trend is an outgrowth of the factors mentioned above.",

Without some kind of self selective mechanism the system would be abused more than it already is.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't issues with publish or perish. In fact, I think that the worst issues are yet to come. We are forced to compete to sustain our jobs, which inevitably will result in more cheating, corner cutting, and manipulation of the system. I think if you look at places more competitive than the US or EU, like China for example, you can use China as a future projection for how Scientific misconduct and pressure will trend upwards globally.\n\nAnd while I agree that short spinoffs are annoying, when you really think about it, those studies are a fantastic support for the reproducibility and reliability of an idea. I did my dissertation on genetic engineering of stem cells, which makes all my work exactly this kind of spinoff. This used to frustrate the heck out of me, but now I look back on this as an in opportunity to show that the various mechanisms at play are reproducible even in the hands of a novice (at the time), which is another compounding support for their use on people, which has recently begun. \n\nIt sucks. I know. All Scientists know. If you aren't publishing often then you at least need to publish big. And if you do get negative data, you better have a plan for validating that the negative effects are biological (or whatever) rather than technically sucking at your job. If you do Science correctly, demonstration of a negative effect is as valuable as a positive effect, but only if it's negative because of nature.\n\nAgain, the pressure to publish is not much different from other fields expecting you to be productive at your job. Publications are our product. If you don't produce, you are wasting money and shouldn't have the job. Academia is one of the most brutal fields you can do. For now it's self selecting, but I do agree with you that the pressures will eventually turn this self selecting process to bias those best at the game, honest or not, rather than the best at Science.",

          "text": "I mean it's great that publication can sort of indicate that people are being productive, and encourages funding people who do good science. \n\nHowever, the complaint here is that the drive to publish has had negative effects on researchers. Whether research remains a sustainable lifestyle is still a worthwhile question, in addition to the question of whether you are \"wasting money.\"\n\nIf you just focus on the effects it has on science, it has negative effects too. It discourages projects that might take long periods of time to generate data (but might be scientifically important). It also excludes contributions from scientists that might have valuable contributions to make, but take longer to produce them. Rather it incentivizes a greater quantity of publications over quality. How many garbage papers have you read with a bunch of crummy experiments strung together? How many projects used to generate 2-3 thin papers that could have been 1? How many pointless repetitive literature reviews, or commentaries?\n\nWith regard to the effects on researchers, there is only so much that humans can do. You can push people to work 100 hours weeks, but their productivity will go down, and they'll miss out on other parts of life like family. The model of a researcher who can spend all his time in the lab while a spouse does housework and raises children doesn't fit the way most families work in 2021. \n\nI think there's an assumption that those pressures will generate a meritocracy, with the best researchers rising to the top, and very often I've seen the opposite. Brilliant researchers will become fed up with the grant process and leave. Smarmy businessmen with an army of postdocs and R01s will gobble up all the ink in Nature and Science. People publish useless nonsense chasing fad techniques that cost a lot, but just make it harder to find signal in the literature.",

Thus I really think it's important that these incentives are fixed so that people don't need to make tradeoffs between what's good for science as a whole vs what's good for their career. \n\nHowever, I don't see that aligning incentives would make the competition any less fierce (although it might become a bit less soul-sucking as you no longer need to do such tradeoffs), as it seems to stem from following fundamental fact: namely, that more people want academic jobs than there are positions available. As far as I see it, there's some fixes for this but none of them are very good:\n\n* make academic jobs less lucrative by making the working conditions even worse. I really don't see how this would improve science, even if the competition became less fierce.\n* increase the number of positions: this only works as long as academia grows exponentially,since the the average prof graduates more than one grad student. On a finite planet, I don't see this as a viable solution.\n* make less people able to enter the competition, by graduating way less PhDs. This might work, but (i) it messes up with how science is run in many fields and (ii) mostly just moves the bottleneck earlier: now one must compete like crazy to get to grad school, even if it's easier after.\n\nThus I really don't see a way out of academia being competitive - it's just (perceived as) that great a job! The best we can hope for is that being great at the competition correlates better with what's good for science.",

      "text": "There are very few TT positions, and many of these have research as a moderate to major component of their appointment. Why *wouldn\u2019t* you expect those pressures to drive up output?\n\nWhat would selection for a TT job look like research productivity was removed? Impact? Novelty of research program? That is very much like what midcareer and senior searches look like. How would you do that at the junior stage, without just simply replicating prestige networks?",

There is currently very little pressure to be more productive from a research perspective. By that, I mean there is very little pressure to increase our knowledge at a faster rate. The pressure is entirely to create more papers which is typically done at the expense of research productivity.",

      "text": "Yup. Since the incentives at research universities are centered on number of publications largely (as long as a minimum journal quality level is met), there are a lot of people who have gotten good at performing to that metric in terms of being able to divide what would have been one or two publications of content into four or five. \n\nI'm not judging on the whole - I personally disagree with it, but I understand why. If that's what the incentives are, that's what people are going to figure out how to do.\n\nThe issue arises that we're often evaluated by committees of people who aren't in our field and are just looking for quick metric comparisons. People who have lots of papers on their CV - even if many of them are least publishable units - will look better in the eyes of most academic committee evaluations. \n\nSo when you're someone who tries to write a lower amount of more substantial papers, you end up getting evaluated as lower-performing and that affects a lot of practical outcomes. This becomes less of a problem if you're more established because you'll have enough of a reputation with people in your field and that will be reflected in external letters, etc..., but for early career researchers of any kind this type of dynamic can prove to be an insurmountable barrier to getting a permanent job, winning grants, etc...",
