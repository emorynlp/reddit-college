  "title:": "Postdoctoral associate position at an Ivy League university or postdoctoral fellowship at a European research institute?",
  "text": "I am a physics researcher at the end of my first postdoc, and as the title says, I have received postdoc offers from two places. \n\nOne offer is a postdoctoral research associate position, let's say at Harvard University, where I am expected to mainly work on a project related to the PI's grant, which is in the same field of research but a different subfield. \n\nThe other offer is a Fellowship at a European research institute, let's say one of the Max Planck Institutes, where I will have 100% independence. I already know and collaborate with a few different people there. \n\nBoth positions are for 3 years (with no pre-made path to a permanent position, as far as I know). The other parameters of the offers are also similar. \n\nI am currently a postdoctoral fellow at a relatively unknown European university, although in a department whose director is considered the \"father\" of my research field. For what it's worth, I have a fairly strong publication record, with ~10 first author publications in top journals, with a few being sole-author. My goal after this next postdoc is to get a tenure-track faculty position, either in Europe or the US. I am American and my wife is German. \n\nDoes anyone have some words of advice for me? I think either one would be great, but I do have to choose!",

That is not much time - do they expect you to obtain funding for yourself in that time period? That may be tough, depending on the type of work you do (is your work theoretical or do you have long data collections/instrument development times?) What is the path forward after that? A 3 year guarantee for a postdoc is pretty good if there is a chance of being extended. I would take the postdoc position in this case.",

Two examples: MPI for Astrophysics and MPI for Gravitational Physics. However, this fact might not be known to the industry outside of Germany or Europe.\n\nIn terms of research freedom, I can speak for the former. You have *zero* pressure to work for anyone here. You\u2019re really free to talk to and work with anyone you want. As you indicated, you seem to be able to build and manage your own research plan, why not build on it?",
