The problem, though, is that now I know I can always write something down, whenever, wherever, and that has added to the constant thinking. That said, the ability to just write it down and be done with it anywhere anytime has overall lead to a reduction in thinking about research. As you said, it\u2019s a learned skill, and I\u2019m still learning.",

My research got so exciting it carried me over to another state with a better university where I could dedicate 100% of my work towards this research. Truth is I really do think about research more than I should as well. Can't help it, I'm a scientist to the core, research is fun (usually) and exciting (sometimes) and even rewarding (high profile papers/grants) hence it takes up a lot of my thoughts.\n\nI will say this, getting out into the wild (say, camping for a week) without a cell phone connection does wonders for the soul.",
