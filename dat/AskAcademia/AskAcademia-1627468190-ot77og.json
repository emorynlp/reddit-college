  "title:": "Pros and cons of taking a year's break between Master's and PhD. Please help me decide.",
  "text": "Apologies for the length. I'm desperate for advice and help.\n\nI am going to graduate next year with an Integrated M.Sc (5 year) degree in Physics. I am interested in astronomy and want to pursue PhD in the field. I have some relevant research experience in the form of summer internships at good places (remotely due to covid). I am also working on a project that should lead to a publication. I have a good GPA. Top 2 in my batch. My profile looks decent and I have been looking up US schools to apply to and some places in Europe (I'm from India).\n\nMy reasons for considering to take a break are:\n\n1. Mental health and impostor syndrome: Covid has been hard. I have been at home without human contact for 16 months now. My 4th year was online and it looks like my final year will be too. I struggled a lot and even though my grades are good, I feel like I didn't learn much at all. I feel exhausted trying to do my projects. These things that used to bring me joy and make me excited but I feel numb now.  I have always dealt with impostor syndrome but the lock down in this pandemic slashed my confidence completely. I have been having panic attacks, something that I haven't had for 2 years now. I thought I left it behind but maybe not. I feel scared of starting a PhD in this mental state.\n2. Research profile: My internships were good but short as they were only over the summer. I only have one other project that may or may not have a paper by the deadlines. I will start working on my master's thesis which again might not have much results by the deadlines. I feel like I can use this year to not only take a break but also take up longer internships or relevant positions to improve my experience and hone down into a sub-field I truly enjoy. \n3. I have been overworking and stressing myself out trying to get multiple projects done and work on applications. When I thought of taking a break, I felt like a weight lifted from my shoulders. It felt like my body was trying to say something to me. Maybe it's just the stress of so many projects and the uncertainty but I really want to give my mind a break and maybe go to a psychologist frequently.\n\nMy major doubts are:\n\n1. How will this affect my applications next year? Is it unusual or not preferred? Will it reflect poorly on me if I explain my reason for a break?\n2. What are the prospects of finding relevant work in this break? Do professors at universities or research institutes take up longer internships (6 month or a year)? Are such remote internships sought for? Are there any jobs I can apply for that will be relevant for my interest in astronomy? I don't know of many prospects in India.\n3. If I publish a paper in this period, what will be my host institution? (Was thinking of continuing to work with this professor that I'm currently working remotely with)\n\nI am sure about wanting a PhD. I know I like research and I love working with astronomical data.  But I am scared and uncertain of starting it in such a fragile mental state. It has been a very difficult year. Any and all insight or advice will be very useful to me. Thanks for reading!",

      "text": "Take the year out! It's really not going to look bad on an application, and in fact will make you more attractive if you get relevant work and a paper. Not getting relevant work won't be a disaster either.\n\nWith respect to host institution on papers it's whichever organisation employed you and paid for your research (this includes pay, consumables and equipment etc). If you move before publishing that's still your affiliation but you can add in your new address as current address. \n\nTake the year out and enjoy yourself. It will make you a much better PhD candidate.",

The prof has been guiding me and he requested institutions and got me data that was not publicly available. Right now, the paper I'm writing will have the name of my institute. I was wondering what will happen in a similar setting if I'm not getting paid",

              "text": "I'm not quite sure what you're asking or what you mean by \"he requested institutions\" but your affiliated institute is the one paying for the research - so even though you're not getting paid they are still footing the bill for all the costs associated with the research such as your supervisor's salary, the subscriptions to journals, grant administration and overheads etc. So they are the the affiliated institution. If you move somewhere else they will still be the affiliated institution on the work you did while you were working with this PI because they paid for it. Your new institution will be your affiliated institution for the work you do for them. You can list the new institution as \"current address\" on papers from your old institution.",
