  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm doing my thesis in a research lab and I'm under a postdoc. Basically she tells me what to do following the directions of my thesis supervisor. But she doesn't have any communication skills. I just fu**ed up a week long experiment because her directions were unclear. Also, she could have noticed the mistake days ago if she just cared to look.\nBesides I feel like everytime I ask her about a doubt that I have I'm disturbing her. We never chatter, we only (and rarely) talk about the experiments I have to perform. Is this even normal? I feel much more comfortable talking to my thesis supervisor than her. And I can't even talk to my supervisor about this because I'm afraid it will be seen as bad mouthing behind her back.\nAny advice on how to handle this?",

      "text": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b,  I've had this issue before when I was a summer intern. My supervisor traveled a lot so I had a Ph.D. student mentoring me. It was the same issue, he's brilliant as a researcher but as a mentor at the beginning... \n\nThe best way to settle this is to bring up the issue to the postdoc directly. Be respectful but honest. I told my mentor (Ph.D. student) that his role as a mentor is to supervise me and let me know how I'm doing in terms of progress because I'm here to learn from them. If I'm doing anything wrong to let me know so I can fix it. I also reminded them that I'm an undergrad student and that they're a Ph.D. and that they can't expect me to have the same knowledge as them since they've spent years becoming an expert on the topic/research while I'm there temporarily for the summer. \n\nAfter that conversation, he changed 180. He would ask me how I'm doing and if I need any help. He was a lot more hands-on. \n\nRemember Graduate/ Postdoc students are busy so they can easily forget about things or not pay so much attention. So they most probably aren't aware of what's going on or how you feel. So communicate it to them in a respectful way. Either way, this is something you will have to deal with anywhere you go. A successful research lab is one where everyone works as a team.\n\nSide note: I will be returning to that lab \ud83e\udd17, for my Ph.D. and that mentor, is now a postdoc there so it was good that we're able to work through that.",

      "text": "I agree that it would be a good idea to directly talk to you your postdoc. If that doesn't work, you can bring it up to your PI. \n\nIn general, as an undergrad, you're likely seen as a nuisance/annoyance to the postdoc. Obviously it's not your fault at all because you're learning, but from the postdoc's point of view, mentoring you might be more like a charity. (Though there are many postdocs who do care about a lot about mentorship and takes it seriously). Often, a postdoc is \"stuck\" mentoring an undergrad because the PI asked them to.",
