  "title:": "Starting a postdoc in January but am being asked to do some work now.",
  "text": "I have a postdoc that is starting in early January. I thought it would be starting at least a month ago, but whatever. I just got an offer letter with an early January start date, but I have also gotten an email from the PI and my future labmate asking me to read some papers and provide help with some methods on a grant they are writing now. \n\nI feel like this is not uncommon. I also understand that they have to submit this grant on a deadline, but I am hesitant to start working on this for at least 2 reasons.\n\n1) If I start doing work now before I am getting paid, what other problematic expectations might develop? \n2) I have to wrap up my current position and try to get some publications out the door, I don't want to get pulled into doing a bunch of work on something that will get in the way of this other work.\n\nHas anyone else been in this position? I don't want to start off by being a shitty team player, but I also don't want to start off as a pushover who will let myself be exploited. I could probably complete what they are asking for without too much effort, but again I don't want to set the tone that I will jump to do things that don't feel right. I would welcome any advice on how how to politely establish boundaries here. Thank you!",

Will the text of the Methods section define what you can and/or must do, if it's funded?  If so, there's some substantial self-interest in doing a quick review of their text and making suggestions, if it means you get more control over how you spend your time for the next few years.",

      "text": "Yes it does seem a bit exploitative, and despite the all too common attitude among PIs that postdocs and students should grovel and grind, I believe you are ahead of the game by taking charge of your own time and effort management. Part of what some people learn as a postdoc is how to be *independent*. How to work for yourself first, basically.\n\nI do not believe you should heed advice that encourages you to habitually sublimate your time, effort, and independence to the whims of your PI. You're an adult. Who has earned a PhD. Your time is valuable, you are working, and you should be paid for your work! You have goals that might not always align with the PI's immediate needs and that's ok. Part of the PI's commitment when hiring a postdoc is to carve out time for mentorship and development (or at the very least, acknowledge that the postdoc will need to devote a non-zero number of effort hours to development and training in addition and that this is indeed \"work\"). A great PI will actively and regularly engage with you to see how they can contribute to your training and how your training fits in with the broader mission of the lab.\n\nAlways have a crystal clear shared agreement with your PI/colleagues/funders about exactly what projects you will be working on and what responsibilities you will have on those projects (including timelines and deadlines!), and keep these expectations explicitly balanced with your long term goals for your postdoc. Do not go long stretches of time where there is a mismatch between what you have mapped out as your timeline to meet your long term goals and the allocation of your effort and responsibilities across projects and work products (i.e., publications, presentations, grant applications, patents, etc.). Develop the skill of making these kinds of conversations routine and non-threatening, if you can.\n\nAs for what to do right now, think about what your needs as a trainee are (including the possible need to have a funded project for your postdoc!). How closely tied to this grant application will your postdoc be? Will you be working on any project that is (or would be, I guess) supported by that specific grant? Do you want or need experience on grant writing and preparation? How many hours of effort are they asking for? How much extra emotional labor will it be to stick your neck out at this moment?\n\nHere's something that I think is totally fair: \"I would be happy to help develop and refine this grant application before January, though if I am expected to contribute a substantial amount of effort hours before January, then maybe we should discuss an earlier start date.\"\n\nAnother totally fair statement in my eyes: \"I am very busy wrapping up my current projects as I prepare for my January start date. I don't believe I will have a lot of time to contribute to the grant preparation prior to my start date, but I think I could fit in about X hours.\" And you fill in the X.",
