  "text": "I'm at a \"top\" university and (mis)fortunate enough to sit in on lectures with huge names in the field (even Nobel prize winners and semi-famous people) but nearly all of these huge names are terrible teachers.  Seems weird to me that if you super get something you should be able to teach it, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The onus here seems to be on the students to figure out the material for themselves if a class isn't taught by a lecturer.  What gives?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: It seems the consensus is that teaching well is not incentivized as much as it could be at universities. To what degree as the current and future generation of professors do we have the responsibility to change/improve the situation? ",

      "text": "Teaching well is not incentivized at research universities. The institution requires that you teach acceptably well, but does not reward outstanding teaching. Meanwhile, there is no upper limit on the credit you can receive for achievement in research, and falling behind in research will compromise your career. Basically, mediocre or bad teaching at high level institutions is the result of a poor incentive structure that sets education as a low, and perhaps even non existant, priority. Personally, I am disgusted by the system and because I did not want to take part in it, I opted to have a career focused on universities where teaching is the priority.",

      "text": "Because teaching and researching are two different skill sets entirely. And yes - teaching is a *skill*. If you've ever heard someone say \"those who can't, teach\", it's a bald-faced lie.\n\nTeaching requires a lot more than just knowing a lot of things, it requires effectively helping people learn those things. Among other things, this includes: putting together a curriculum by figuring out what things students need to know about X subject, including determining what background you can expect them to have; communicating this knowledge in a way that promotes learning (conference-style slides do *not* accomplish this - which is why researchers can give great conference talks but be awful at presenting information in the classroom); adapting for different learning styles or unanticipated holes in the students' backgrounds; designing assessments, homework, and other assignments to accurately assess and facilitate learning; and being able to adjust on the fly to changes in the course situation often with little or no preparation.\n\nBeyond the skillset, it's a very different mentality from research. In research, you're driven primarily to achieve tasks or goals which may or may not be constrained to a particular timeline. In teaching, the situation is the opposite as your role is to drive or motivate a number of other people, who are not only less capable than you with the material but also by and large much less interested in it than you are, to learn what they need to complete tasks or goals set by yourself according to a very constrained timeline (one semester). This takes a different mindset, shifting from \"what do I need to do to succeed\" to \"how can I help 20/50/400 other people succeed\", and just because you're smart or a good researcher doesn't mean you have that mindset.",

      "text": "To the generally accepted answers here, which are all correct, I'd like to answer the actual question of \"why\" (vs. the \"how\" of how top researchers don't develop into better teachers):\n\nImagine you're at the top of your field. You're knocking on the ceiling with your brilliance and there are maybe 100 people in the world that can keep up with your sophistication of thought. And then you're given a class where you 1) have to teach \"elementary\" topics to students, half of whom either don't want to be there or shouldn't be, and 2) have to devote time to matters of lesser import than your amazing research. Out of generosity let's say your research has every indication of saving millions of [lives, dollars, headaches] and the world could use it yesterday. Top researchers aren't dumb so maybe we'll grant that maybe they are even self-aware enough to know they suck at teaching, or that they don't grade fast enough, or that they could give their students more attention. The \"why\" of shitty teaching is a strong preference to devote resources to matters of greater significance. While we might debate whether those matters are truly more significant, or the ethics of being a shitty professor for students that are paying for a quality education, this is the price of a society that pays the smartest scholars with the contingent requirement that they pass on their knowledge in classroom settings. (Of course, there exist shitty professors who aren't doing important work and just want out of the hassle. And there are amazing researchers that are also amazing teachers.)\n\nI'm not a top researcher so I'm not trying to defend the phenomenon wholesale. But it's important to acknowledge that some people literally have much better things to do with their time than to teach undergrads. I would bet heavily that many of those same shitty teacher-professors would be rigorous advisors of independent research if it was well-oriented, significant, and original. To that end, I actually believe that it's better to learn the basics of any subject from the plethora of resources that are available basically to anyone. Once a student demonstrates a penchant for learning beyond those, that's when I think top researchers take notice and start to think about how to actually employ their students in applied scholarship.\n\n",

A few profs took one class in grad school, oftentimes some kind of TA supervision with no organized curriculum.\n\nSo professors are expected to teach but haven't actually learned how. Immersion learning. Learn-by-doing. That can work, right? Well, it works best if you have some kind of clear, immediate feedback on how you're doing. That's why you can plink out a song on a piano - each time you hit a key you can hear whether it's right or wrong. But quality teaching is subtle. The effects might be slow or invisible. You might not know until you see your course evals 2 months later that your careless comment was really hurtful.

      "text": "They're fundamentally different types of performative art. Academia broadly speaking requires three broad sets of skills.\n\n1. Research - This is the ability to study a topic, gather your data, collate it into written material and publish it. Here you're judged on the published material, on writing style, originality of idea, depth of impact on the subject, etc.\n2. Classroom Lecturing/Teaching - This skillset involves leading a class through a preset syllabus. It could be plain lecturing, but often also involves leading and directing group discussions, guiding young scholars expected to be unfamiliar with the area to new terrain and material, etc\n3. Supervision - This is also teaching, but its more one on one. Supervising a student's thesis is a tad different from leading a class. There are of-course commonalities, but there's a more fluid relationship at play here, since you need to guide the student through his own material, which he will select, and also provide a form of critical feedback that class room teaching doesn't really call for.\n\nA person could arguably excel at one area, and not really the others. I'm a grad student, but I've also grown up surrounded by academics. Some are fantastic teachers and supervisors, but don't really publish prolifically or groundbreaking research. They have legions of students absolutely devoted to them because of how they guide them through work. Others might be amazing researchers, and even amazing supervisors, but not very good at classroom lecturing. Similarly, You might have an amazing lecturer and researcher, but somehow a poor supervisor. The grab bag of good and bad can go on really.\n\nWere it just this, it would still be easy to understand, but as with any relationship oriented skillset, there's no definitive evaluation. I've known teachers who some students regard as a fantastic classroom teacher, and yet others consider insufferably boring. Its really what clicks with people. In one's capacity as a researcher, the dialogue is more controlled. You accept the work as its presented, and question it on its own turf. In essence, the researcher does the work, and then accepts critique and seeks to defend it. Classroom teaching is different. Its not just about knowing the subject, its about finding a way to present it to someone who might be totally unfamiliar with the terrain you're on. Finding a way to communicate this. But in a much more organic way than just writing a paper, and letting others judge.\n\nThe simplest way to imagine this. Some redditors might be fantastic writers, but it doesn't follow that they are as funny or charming in conversation right? You'd think, broadly the skills are the same, after all, its just one form of communication. But in reality, with changes in media, also come changes in the nature of interaction. So they're different skills",

      "text": "In addition to differences in priorities, as others have said, teaching and research very different skills, and there's also little formal training in teaching for professors interested in a research-oriented career. It extends beyond teaching in the classroom though. When it comes to giving lectures based on their research at conferences, many of these \"huge names\" on the research side of things tend to give truly mediocre talks (and that's sometimes being generous). I'm not talking about the research content, but rather the delivery, visual presentation, organizational structure, pacing, answering of questions, and the like. Of course, that doesn't go for all great researchers (just how there are great researchers that are also excellent teachers in the classroom), but it's clear that explaining things in an effective manner does not always go hand-in-hand with research prowess.",

Teaching is a real skill and is not connected to being a good researcher, if aresomeone is bother because they are either are extremely lucky or they worked hard on it. But when you apply for a position at a \"top\" university, they are only interested in your research. That's it. And they want you do your research, not spend time on your teaching, so there isn't much time or incentive to improve. Undergrads are mostly irrelevant to the academic goals of a university, they are only there to \"pave the sidewalks\" as people say, for their tuition money. Teaching is downright denigrated in many academic communities, particularly in science where you can get big grants to pump up your status.",

      "text": "Teaching isn't just something that comes naturally with knowledge. As others have pointed out, most research universities care little about teaching (because it doesn't bring in grants or headlines or publications) and of course American Ph.D. are themselves all products of research universities. If an individual wants to be a good teacher odds are they will have to work at it-- which means time away from research. There's no incentive to do so at research universities, so it simply doesn't happen most of the time.  Teaching well, it must also be noted, requires a lot of time-- time spent preparing, grading, meeting with students, reading about pedagogy, revising courses, etc. --all of which means less time for research/publication.  That is the primary reason for the dichotomy between \"research universities\" and \"teaching-centered institutions\" like liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and come comprehensive universities. Unless there's an incentive structure to support good teaching, accountability for instructors, and a hiring system that selects for teaching in the first place you're going to end up with exactly what you're experienced OP: productive researchers who often can't teach worth a damn and nobody above them who cares anyway.",

      "text": "As others have said, teaching is a skill and it takes TIME. Research is the #1 way to keep your job (if you are tenure-track) as well as advance in your position and in the professional world. There are so many hours in the day, so one decides where to spend time, either on research or on teaching. I have had good teachers and bad teachers (from a student perspective). Now, as a professor myself, I try to be a great teacher and a mediocre researcher (my personal choice). You can't be excellent at both of these at the same time. Again, there are only so many hours to dedicate to a task. Also, don't forget that the student has a personal responsibility to be an active participant in the learning process. A teacher cannot make you learn anything- he/she can only facilitate the process. ",

      "text": "So 99.99% of research is done by trainees. The job of a professor is to train those students or postdocs and provide them immersive experience, supervision, and guidance. So, a successful research career is evidence that a professor excels at certain aspects of teaching.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that a classroom is different from a laboratory, and a class of 400 people is different from a lab of five hand-picked trainees. There is generally little training and support for professors to learn how to teach in these different environments, how to design lesson plans, how to guide different types of learning, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also, frankly, argue that a 400 person lecture hall is a shit learning environment no matter how good a professor is, and that professor who is stilted and boring in a massive lecture hall might well be engaging and interesting in a small 20-30 person class. The fact that universities would rather dump money into facilities, admin, and branding rather than paying to hire more faculty is part of that problem and that falls partly on the students for demanding these sorts of frivolous campus upgrades.",

It\u2019s not that this professors can\u2019t become good teachers but rather they aren\u2019t rewarded for becoming better teachers. Promotion and tenure is based on just about everything other than teaching. Also, good teaching takes time, so at most institutions professors are better off ignoring pedagogy. Some professors have even told me that they would enjoy the job more if they didn\u2019t have any students.",

To get hired at an R1, you need to be the best of the best, and being the best of the best at research requires sacrificing a lot of other things (not necessarily, but often does). There is little incentive for the researcher, or for the school, to care that much about teaching. There are almost no financial repercussions to either, if teaching is bad.",
