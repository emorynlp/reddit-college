      "text": "Most posts here seem to involve STEM and lab work; my career was humanities, in the U.S., at a large research university. A couple of thoughts, though...\nFirst, surely it would depend on the issues/ personalities/context. \n\nIn the U.S., universities have changed considerably in recent years and my university has created many new mechanisms for reporting and dealing with complaints about faculty at every level, including both academic and personal issues. Sexual harassment cases in particular have led to much greater awareness and scrutiny of the power dynamics between students and faculty and the need to set behavioral expectations and regulatory mechanisms to enforce them. We now have student and faculty committees, grad student unions (and a host of other mechanisms) to mediate between faculty/the department/students, and students are encouraged to meet directly with faculty and with department chairs if they have issues with professors, teaching assistants, lab supervisors, etc. Conflicts and complaints used to be handled at the department level, which generally meant nothing was ever done, and students who reported issues were often exposed and vulnerable to faculty retaliation. Grad students who were sexually harassed by faculty often ended up leaving the university, and the department kept issues with faculty confidential.\n \nNow faculty are expected to listen to students and take them seriously. Departments are obliged to keep some student complaints confidential, to take appropriate action and to refer students to newly created program offices and/or communicate serious issues and complaints to the central administration. Most of these changes are very recent, within the last 2-3 years.\n\nSo at my university, yes, it is now much more possible to lodge complaints about faculty without fear of reprisal. These issues will never disappear but conditions have improved.",

How often do those relationships improve after one person's bad behavior is shared with a third party who then reports back to the offending partner? There are the rare cases that things improve with outside professional help, but such help doesn't exist in academia. In an intimate relationship, there's usually a lot for both partners to lose, but in a supervisory relationship, the supervisor has fairly little to lose by moving on to the next person and little to gain by staying with someone they won't trust.",

I would recommend bringing it up to the thesis chair and the chair will be the mediator. The chair will decide if a change of supervisor is necessary (which almost always is). There is no way to stay with the same supervisor if you reported them once. That is like burning the bridge. Look for other alternatives to deal with the situation.",

You are just a student passing through, while they are coworkers who they will see regularly for the next decades. Plus, nothing will improve it. They're grown adults and feel like they set their own rules because they bring in the grant moneys that run their labs. \n\nOnly report if it is sexual abuse or youre in immediate danger. And it would mean leaving the lab completely.",
