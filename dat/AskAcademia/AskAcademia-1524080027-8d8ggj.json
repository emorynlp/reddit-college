  "text": "I have no idea where to share this, but this experience is too specific for anyone outside of Academia to understand.\n\nI have an X-files level anomaly in my grading.\n\nIn a big lecture class, I have two students with the same first and last name (ok, first name is different by one letter, think Katerina vs Katrina). Not that weird, sometimes I've had siblings etc.\n\nThese students just turned in a response assignment--the class has 120 students in it, and the response is due on Monday, but they submitted it at the exact same time--one email came at 11:24, one at 11:25.\n\nWeird coincidence huh?\n\nTheir emails are identical--except for a single apostrophe: \"Here's the second response\" vs. \"Here is the second response\", and they signed them identically e.g. \"--Katrina\" vs \"--Katarina\"-- same double-dash, same format, everything is the same.\n\nThe responses are similarly on the exact same subject (despite the essay topic being very open), and yet completely different.\n\nSo what is this? Are they clones? Soulmates? Are they pranking me? How does this even happen? Am I ethically obliged to introduce them to their spiritual twin?",

Back in the mid-1990s when I was a grad student I was teaching a  huge lecture class at an R1...something like 350 students. I had a take-home final that included a short essay with very clear instructions about not talking about the question or working with anyone else. As I started grading I alphabetized the papers and broke them into stacks...in the one I did I read a decent (solid B?) response, then two papers later read another decent response that seemed similar enough that I flipped back to the prior one-- they were identical, word-for-word.\n\nI confronted the two students separately, and both claimed not to know the other, couldn't imagine what had happened, etc.; then one eventually said she might have left her essay open on a public computer in the library (back then people used public computer clusters) and perhaps the other student stole it? A bit more pushing and they both admitted they cheated, wrote the essay together and submitted it thinking nobody would notice in such a large pool of exams-- they didn't consider the chance we'd aphabetize them before grading and that their last names were just three spots apart in the roster.\n\nI failed them both on the final. Turns out one of them was the child of an associate professor in my graduate department who was flunking out of school, which made for some awkward hallway encouters for a few weeks. ",
