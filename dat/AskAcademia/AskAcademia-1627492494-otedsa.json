  "title:": "Apprehensive about starting a Ph.D. program, should I do it? Is dropping out after 2 years a good option?",
  "text": "I have been struggling to decide whether to accept a Ph.D. offer I've been made in an engineering program. It has been several years since my undergrad, and what worries me most about a Ph.D. is the time it will take for me to graduate. I'll be well into my mid-30s, and I view the next 5 years as crucial in terms of starting a family. Additionally, I'm not 100% sure the research area is something I want to focus on exclusively for my whole career - in fact, another area is more appealing to me. The coursework involves high-level math and modeling which were not my strong suit, and I remember feeling depressed and overwhelmed in my undergrad when I got into some of the higher-level math/technical classes (I was always more a fan of the design, conceptual, business, and application of things). I'd be playing catch-up with the other students getting back up to speed as well. I've also heard the potential advisor can be a little demanding and harsh sometimes, and I can see myself feeling depressed, overworked, and possibly isolated if I was overwhelmed and feeling pressure from them.\n\nBut, on the positive side, this is a funded and stipended position at a well-known university. Financial security has been a struggle for me since I finished my bachelor's many years ago, and the funding for the degree will allow me to feel more comfortable and less like I'm losing all the savings I've worked for over the last several years if I were to go into a self-funded masters program in a field I find more stimulating. I've had a lot of difficulty finding decent work since graduating, which has come with a lot of depression and other problems, and this finally seems like an opportunity to become a real professional and feel a sense of purpose and value. Additionally, the lab is well-linked to a few particular large industries, and from what I've heard, Ph.D. grads from the lab are highly sought-after by those companies, so the potential for job placement may be high (if I can make it through the 5 year Ph.D.).\n\nI've considered asking my advisor if he would be willing to take me as an MS student instead, but I've heard from other students he's unlikely to agree to that. I've also considered starting as a Ph.D. and leaving after getting an MS on the way, though I've heard that doing that may leave you with a bad reputation and labeled as a \"drop-out,\" instead of as someone who got their MS in a difficult field as you would if you had gone into it with that intention. However, doing that seems to give me the most of what I want: a funded graduate degree in a short amount of time.\n\nAre my apprehensions a red flag that starting this will be a major mistake, or would the mistake be giving up an opportunity for fully funded education at a good university?\n\nThank you for your advice.",

      "text": "I would advise to never start a PhD program with the intent to master-out. Maybe you should explore a master's program or a specialty certificate to develop your skills. You may even be able to get a job which will fund some of your advanced courses. Having a masters when going in for your PhD will increase your starting pay usually.",

      "text": "A few thoughts from reading your post:\n\n> The coursework involves high-level math and modeling which were not my strong suit, *[...]* (I was always more a fan of the design, conceptual, business, and application of things).\n\nIf you are more of a fan of the business and application side, you will find that much more easily in industry. These things do exist in the academic world but it is relatively rare and not usually the focus of a PhD.\n\n> But, on the positive side, this is a funded and stipended position at a well-known university.\n\nYou should be aware that this is considered the norm for STEM fields, an *unfunded* PhD position would be unusual and a major red flag (for master's programs this will vary depending on the nature of the program). And jumping back up a bit:\n\n> I'll be well into my mid-30s, and I view the next 5 years as crucial in terms of starting a family.\n\nA PhD stipend is not enough to raise a family on without financial support from other means (i.e. a working partner). In many cases it may not even be sufficient for yourself depending on the circumstances.\n\nIt is *also* worth noting that if finances are a chief concern, remaining in the workforce will likely give the better long-term financial yield. a 5-year PhD program is not only 5 years of poor wages, but also five years of lost wages that could be earned at an industry position as well as lost networking, promotion opportunities, etc. Unless you specifically want a position that requires PhD skills and qualifications, you generally are not better off pursuing a PhD.\n\n> Are my apprehensions a red flag that starting this will be a major mistake, or would the mistake be giving up an opportunity for fully funded education at a good university?\n\nI would err towards the former.\n\nProbably a better option if you are looking for a MS degree and financial stability is to seek stable employment at a company which offers employer-funded master's program support, which is common at many companies that will value the opportunity to develop specialized skills in their workforce.",

I am 31 and I have still 2 years of phd to do and do not regret returning at all. However, it's a long and difficult ride and I think that you need a lot of motivation and passion to make it through the end. If you do not really want to do it, it might be best not to.",

      "text": "I agree with /u/redifredi that besides the ethical part, it could lead to a lot of stress. Because you'll be harboring a \"lie\" the whole time, so when your advisor asks you to look into an important project that may slow down your coursework, you'll naturally argue against it but won't be able to explain why. You'll be fighting a fight no one else understands or cares about. People in your lab will wonder why you're trying to interview or talk to companies, while everyone is expecting you to develop your research vision. Finally, once you are \"found out\" or \"confess\", your advisor can make things hard or impossible for you to get a Masters. Basically, it'd be a tenseful experience, especially for someone suffering from depression.",

      "text": "I appreciate all of your advice.  Since posting this, I spoke to the professor and the Graduate Studies Chair about my concerns and the possibility of switching to an MS.  I was told that they recommend staying in the Ph.D. in case I choose that option, but that leaving with my MS would not be a problem if I choose to do that (it would be a choice to make between years 1 and 2, where I decide whether to work on an MS thesis or the Ph.D. qualifying exam).  Being upfront with them about my intentions has eased some anxiety.  However, I found out since then I will need to TA full-time my first 1-2 semesters which I am dreading...  Maybe this is imposter syndrome somewhat, but I have been out of school for a while and feel like I'm not at all qualified to do that at the moment.",
