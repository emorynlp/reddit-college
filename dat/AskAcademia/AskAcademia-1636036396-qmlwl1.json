  "text": "Hi folks, I'm a PhD student in a humanities field and I'm applying for a position as an assistant for a journal. I know that in the non-academic world of hiring the conventional advice for cover letters is that they should be a maximum of 1 page in length--is that also true in academia, or is it alright if a final paragraph bleeds onto page 2? Also, are there any other ways that expectations for academic cover letters differ from non-academic ones, or other general advice you can share? Thanks!",
