  "title:": "Is it appropriate to give a professor a card/gift?",
  "text": "I have really enjoyed one of my professors and learned a great amount through the semester, so thought it would be nice to express this with a card written out to them. I would like to give it to them before the holidays, as I will not see them again after. I thought about also including a small gift ($10 amazon card) to express my appreciation. Is this appropriate to give to a professor? I don\u2019t want to create any uncomfortableness but really want to express my appreciation. Also, I do want to note that I have considered asking this professor for a recommendation letter in the future, but don\u2019t at all want to come off as bribing or sucking up for this. Any thoughts?",

Oh, and no, don't give them a gift card, but an actual gift.\n\nFinally, I can assure you this: They will really appreciate it, both the gift and the note. But most of all, the nice gesture. Good luck!",

      "text": "Yes, do it after your complete the course. Probably do not include a gift card. Your meaningful note will mean a lot. If you give a gift, make it meaningful. For example, I got my organic chemistry professor a shot glass shaped like a flask with a lab that said \u201cTe\u201d to stand for tequila, like an element. She frequently seemed to enjoy drinking while grading exams, so she much enjoyed the present. She had tons of mugs and signs that said \u201cworlds best\u201d and then whatever. She didn\u2019t love them. This was for her birthday. At the end of both of my courses with her, I got her an organic chemistry scarf, and then made a matching bandana for who dog, who she loved greatly. These kinds of gifts meant a lot more to her than a gift card or a prewritten hallmark card. Write a note with specifics. If you do a present, make it meaningful",

      "text": "I end each semester reminding students to email me as needed, without hesitation, hoping at that point they recognize the offer extends well past when our course ends & well into the time they may need a letter of recommendation. Over the years, only a handful of students I can\u2019t recall off the top of my head have emailed asking for such, & in the same amount of time, three students I can easily recall gave me a card, with a small gift (a coffee ship gift card; a shirt that said N.O.P.E. on it; & a trinket from their recent visit home) at the end of the semester. The gifts were funny, as each fit something about me & our time in class, but in truth I felt sort of off about them\u2026 BUT what they communicated in the cards connected with me the most, & was totally appropriate, & so appreciated, in each situation. \n\nWhen I got accepted into a PhD program I sent one of my professors (who is, incidentally, now the chair of my department) a very honest card, thanking them for, well, existing I guess, & for being so focused on helping student learn. When I finished my associates degree, I gave a beloved professor a full-on letter explaining all the ways they helped me & how grateful I was for all of it. Both sent thank you cards in response. \n\nI think such exchanges largely depend on the connection between student & instructor. A kind card expressing gratitude will likely be appreciated; I\u2019m not sure about the gift card though. Maybe take & print out an awesome photo of a fabulous fungi find & include that instead (ok, shit, that might just be something I\u2019d appreciate).",

I keep them all and look at them when I'm struggling. \n\nBut every time a student gives me a gift I feel like I shouldn't accept it. But I'm not usually left with any choice because they give me the card on the last day of class, then I go home and open it and don't see them again. Plus I don't want them to feel bad by returning the gift. \n\nThe only time I think it's okay is if you're a defended grad student giving your advisor/chair a token of appreciation. \n\nGive the card. Be honest about how much the class meant to you. Skip the gift card.",
