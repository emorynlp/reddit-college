  "title:": "So so tired. How to rediscover my lost passion and drive \ud83d\ude25",
  "text": "Perhaps this feeling has been cliche by now, with everything going on in the world. But does anyone else out there just feel totally *done*? I'm going into my 3rd year of my PhD (out of 4 total), my \"analysis year\". (Previous two were mostly lots and lots of fieldwork, collecting data, presentations, some general analyses and papers but not focused on detailed analyses.) I used to love my research. I still do, but feel totally separate from it. Just can't motivate myself to work on anything for my dissertation the past few weeks. I'm tired all of the time and don't know how to refuel my drive... I'm guessing others must feel the same way. Suggestions on how to get out of this slump? How to feel refreshed, recharged, and passionate again? There's just so many shitty chaotic things occurring, speaking from the US perspective but globally as well. How does anyone focus on research, or anything for that matter, anymore? I'm just so tired...",

The problem might be to think that one is wasting time during that break but my experience is usually that after a good break, I'm more effective.

It requires a lot of problem-solving and planning that is extremely difficult to tackle when you\u2019re feeling burned out. I get what you\u2019re saying, but I think it\u2019s more complicated than just forcing yourself to show up.",

What I ended up doing was showing up and start writing and push myself to work on the dissertation. The result was that I slowly got back into my groove and got reinspired about it, and went back to what I had written the first days and corrected the shit out of it. It wasnt good at all, but it served its purpose, it kept me on track and helped me get out of my slump. So when I was actually mentally present and inspired, I could correct it.",

I know this is a very common suggestion, but this is how I keep myself focused. I run a mile everyday which really isn't much, but in the long run I've would've ran 365 miles after year. I like short simple workouts because it doesn't conflict with your schedule and if you're consistent you'll see results both mentally and physically.\n\nAnd I'm in STEM too, I have to tell you this is very common, especially when you've been spending time on all of the low level stuff (coding, collecting data, math, etc). My second suggestion is to watch movies on your subject, play video games on your subject, travel (maybe just road trip due to covid for safety), etc. I just notice that seeing your subject in a high/abstract level can get you excited again.",

Especially as someone who\u2019d generally published solo work in the past. The experience definitely brought me out of a slump. I ended up working with the person for quite a while and giving them coauthor credit on the study. Finding a great collaborator, whether junior, senior, or a peer, can be energizing. Admittedly, it might be harder to do on a solo dissertation project, though.",

As for undergrads, I think you're definitely onto something that I hadn't thought of/forgotten! Working w undergrads *has* definitely upped my enthusiasm for my research before (and they've received authorship credit and LOR, which is pretty cool all around!). I kind of forgot that since they couldn't help me much this summer. I'll have to think on how I can involve them again, albeit in a limited capacity w covid19 restrictions/safety.",

The paper was accepted but now I'm meh.. don't want to write my dissertation proposal (ours are in our 3rd year which is not ultra helpful), don't want to start any of my analyses for the next paper/chapter. And I've lost a lot of my research support systems in various ways (collaborator promotion- no longer available to help, undergrads not able to help in the lab, busy PI/ collabs, COVID19 restrictions and collab WFH difficulties, and terribly, suicide of a close colleague/collaborator) and so I just can't get up the motivation to start on the next project. I keep saying I'll start tomw, or I'll start next week, and here we are 2-3 weeks after I submitted that last paper and I still haven't started any of my other projects. It's unlike me, but I feel so... I'm not sure of the right word, tired? Uninterested? Down? None really fit, but sounds like you get it.

Find some colleagues (not profs, but also fellow phds and also people who have been less long in the dept than you have been) to talk about your data and discuss things that are nice, bad, good enough etc. You can wrap it like you just want to talk about how to make a red line for a publication story and you need a third eye. The good part about this is that people can help you with new interesting insight, analyses that are fine spending less time on, and things that look done while you think they aren't. What is also nice about showing data to people who haven't seen it is the compliments. That is something that always fires up my passion. Compliments are way underappreciated by profs, but not by fellow colleagues (at least in my experience). Good luck with your 4th year! You'll look back later thinking why you were even that worried.",

      "text": "One small thing that i think is touched less on by the other (excellent) suggestions, is to talk specifically to some people who are not knowledgeable about what you study, but somehow interested still. It doesn't have to be talking about the in depth stuff you study. If you study the proteomics of a receptor in the brain, talking to them about basic neurology, perhaps quickly broaching \"your\" part of the field, but focusing on their interest. \n\nWhat i've noticed is that i feel very refreshed whenever i talk to someone from the \"outside\" about the stuff inside. \n\n1. It let's me lend their fresh perspective, which affords me the opportunity to see, again, why the field is so interesting. \n\nand \n\n2. It allows me to \"identify\" with the subject, as i realize that i *have* become knowledgeable about this thing, and that real life worries and wonderings of serious people are answered with the understanding i have. \n\nI am continually surprised of just how social animals we are. How the approval of ourselves and the approval of others are inextricably linked and connected even to things we like to keep it separate from, like our \"raw interest and passion for the sciences\". \n\nPersonally, i really like to have a circle of people who are just on the outside, but still people interested in stuff. I'm studying medicine and trying to do research simultaneously, but i love talking to especially a historian i know. Then there's the philosopher, there's a veterinarian, someone in comparative evolutionary biology, and so on. The differences in scales of shared understanding, while still having a general interest in knowledge is a big source of happiness and drive for me i think.",

I knew it was coming and yet I was still surprised how shit it feels.\n\nI should be doing analysis right now and I\u2019m way behind. But the last few days I\u2019ve been reading papers (to decide what analyses I\u2019ll do) and that has helped to kickstart me. I\u2019m getting ideas and   I\u2019m interested in my field again and my brain is sort of working again. It stops when I sit down to code, but still... reading might be the answer.\n\nGood luck, friend =]",

My bad advisor and overall work fatigue also contributed to my burnout, so I understand where you're at.\n\nI managed to take roughly 2 weeks off from any work or research, and I recovered a portion of my mental stamina. Enough so that my constant mental refrain wasn't \"I'm so tired, I wanna go home.\" \n\nI still haven't recovered the passion I had at one point for my work, but I do feel lucky that I got a job during the pandemic, so that helps temper any burnout I'm feeling. Also being fine working more standard hours helped. I stop checking my work emails after 6pm, and that's helped chip away at the fatigue.",

Feeling total burnout and exhaustion, and even work that should fascinate me isn\u2019t motivating me to do it. Finding a therapist with a PhD in psychology has been super helpful, because she knows the struggles of PhD life, so that might be a good course of action. She helps me break things down into little doable parts, or routines and deadlines that actually feel realistic and attainable for me. \n\nI\u2019ve also been struggling with trying to find that \u201cspark\u201d again. What my therapist helped me realize, and through my own small steps towards doing work, is that this \u201cspark\u201d doesn\u2019t just come back magically. It comes through the small achievements\u2014getting a small piece of a project done (for me, a literature student, that might just be reading a chapter of a book I need to write about). Feeling like you\u2019re talking small steps and actually doing them will build back that passion and reminder of why you\u2019re doing this.",

Even if it weren't though, the response above is important, mental labor is real and it's exhausting. \n\nPerhaps to help you better understand the multiple roles grad students juggle, here's my experience. Most graduate research fieldwork is over the summer. Mine is 11/12 months of the year, w ~5 months working 60-80 hours/week, hiking and driving up steep cliffs, carrying packs, caring for animals. I also take courses, TA, have other lab responsibilities as an RA, train and mentor undergrads, and lead volunteer efforts during this. Before the pandemic I worked side gigs during my \"lesser\" weeks of ~50 hrs/week, bc as grad students know well, we're not paid much. Tbh your example of waking up at 5 AM, done by 5 PM, that wouldn't phase anyone that does fieldwork, especially with wildlife. But I'd still take my actual field research over any other job. It's the analyses, writing, *thinking* that I'm totally burnt out on. That was the point of this post. \n\nAs for putting food on the table, I hope most grads have career objectives in mind before pursuing higher education. It sounds like the lieutenant you knew did not, and that happens! Mine is within the realm of public/environmental/wildlife health, and seeing the current state of affairs... I don't think those problems are going anywhere.",
