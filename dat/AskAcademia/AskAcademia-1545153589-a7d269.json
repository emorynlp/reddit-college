  "title:": "A PhD Program posted the wrong deadline on their website. They won't consider my application after I missed the true deadline. Do I have options?",
  "text": "I'm applying to PhD programs. My top-choice program listed their application deadline on their department page as December 15. I planned my application season months ago and had everything ready to submit on time, and I could have submitted early if I needed to without any problems. However, when I went to submit my application on the day of the deadline, I discovered I had missed the deadline by one day.\n\nAfter freaking out a bit, thinking I must have written down Dec. 15 instead of Dec. 14 in some kind of fit, I learned that the program's website had listed the date incorrectly. They had eventually updated it, but with very short notice and I (obviously!) didn't catch the change, as my application was already started at that point and I wasn't going back to their website to look up basic application information. I found evidence on the Internet Archive that their department website still showed the incorrect date as late as Nov 28, i.e. about 2 weeks before the deadline (and it's possible it was up even later, as Nov 28 was the most recent archiving). So I wrote a very reasoned and polite email, and sent it off immediately to the director and grad admissions people. I figured I couldn't have been the only person to have experienced this issue, and surely since it was their fault they'd be able to make some exception.\n\nThe director seemed to be on my side initially; she was the first to respond and apologized profusely and said she'd take care of it. (Specifically, she said in part:  \"I've just left a message for our Director of Graduate Studies, \\[REDACTED\\], concerning this very pesky issue, and I am sure he will look into a solution at once. As the error is on our end, I am sure \\[REDACTED\\] will do all he can to ensure we can take your application. Stay tuned! Thank you so much for alerting us to this issue and apologies for any inconvenience and stress it has caused.\")\n\nThe grad admissions people, however, don't care. They will not entertain an exception--in fact, they won't even admit the university's at fault. (I assume it's in their legal interest to do so.) They keep telling me to apply next year. They pointed to another place on the university website that listed the correct deadline, but that was on a completely different site (i.e. the general graduate college, rather than the program's department). I have pushed back with more evidence and more politeness, but they keep replying with (nearly) the same response. \\*\\*ETA: the program director has been included on all these emails, so she's aware of what's going on. She asked them for an exception over email, cc:'d me on it, and they also told her no.\\*\\*\n\nSo: do I just give up? Do I call up everyone and make a big stink about it? I'm not interested in legal action (don't have the money for it, and frankly I don't think this issue is important enough to warrant it) but it would be nice to know what my options here are, if anything.\n\n(crossposted)",

I ran into something similar when I was applying to PhD programs, but the university was kind enough to email me (as I already had an application started) and let me know they were moving their deadline up 10 full days. Unfortunately it was finals time (I was finishing up my master\u2019s) and I had all my deadlines and due dates planned and scheduled and that simply wouldn\u2019t work for me. I decided that if that was something they were comfortable doing for applications then it was a reflection on how they likely regularly operated, so I did not apply. I now have a colleague who earned their PhD from that university around the same time I was applying and they confirmed my suspicions \u2014 some of the internal workings there were hectic, disorganized, and sporadic. \n\ntl;dr Let this one go, moving deadlines up without warning is a dick move.",

Tread carefully with the director but cc her on these emails.\n\nTo be blunt, sometimes tiny peons get very large heads about their unimportant jobs. You need someone who can force their hand.",

See you on Monday, professor.\"\n\nA lot of admin problems can be solved. A lot of rules can be stretched. They can make a one time exception. They can do a lot more than you think.\n\nNo promises, but I think if you want in to this program, push hard and remain firm. Don't put anyone at fault. Your only interest is to get your application in. You aren't here to sue.\n\nGood luck.",

Even in cases where your application is accepted hiring managers often form a short list from earlier applications. So applying early will serve you better in most settings.\n\nYes it sucks, but it's how the world sometimes works.",

Chances are one of them can help you out. Much of academia is informal and can be a simple hallway conversation that will change the course of your application. Believe me, i know. \n\nExplain the situation and if they are reasonable and work with you - then you should have a fair chance. If they aren\u2019t, then you should really reconsider that university because chances are you\u2019ll find other issues or problems in the program as well that they will not own up to.\n\nBest of luck!",
