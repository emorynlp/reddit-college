  "title:": "The corporation with whom we are collaborating uses IP review process to force removal of their employees from the author list and block publications. What should I do?",
  "text": "Note: I know you can not give me a perfect answer because this is largely a legal issue, and it depends on many tiny details. But any ideas or thoughts are highly appreciated.\n\nOkay, so here is the situation.\n\nThe lab I work in is in close collaboration with a massive corporation. But recently the milestones the corporation set were not met (the topic was waaay overhyped). On top of that one of the postdocs in the project was found to be tweaking the data in the way they definitely should not. That was inexcusable. Nonetheless, I have no reason to believe that anyone except for that one person was doing anything malicious or inappropriate. And I am 100% sure that no one who is affected now was involved in that - almost everyone started working in this lab only after the related paper was published. Understandably, this led to a PR s**tstorm, paper retraction etc. This sucks for us, but I get it. Tough luck, someone screwed up and there is nothing we can do about it.\n\n(Edit/clarification: none of the directly affected people were involved in the wrong treatment of the data. The people involved should be subject to appropriate investigation. Me and my colleagues who were most affected had joined the group in the period after misconduct and before it was revealed.)\n\nRecently the copro part of the project is a complete mess. I don't understand exactly, but they have some issues between the managers, senior researchers, and I guess they worry about PR.\n\nIn the agreement with corpo and the uni, the uni promised to send the papers and public presentations for IP review, before they are submitted. Annoying, but makes sense. We get money, they want to patent stuff, fair enough. They have certain deadlines to give us a thumb up or flag the submission.\n\nAnd here is where the problem lies. There is no clause for what can be the reason for flagging the submission, and there is no clause for what happens if they don't meet the deadline. There is only a clause that we cant submit without permission.\n\nBut what they started doing is this. on some occasions they do not meet the deadline and just keep us waiting. On other occasions they say: your submission is approved provided that you remove J. Doe (employee of the corpo) from the author list. A far as I can tell, this is against policies of all publishers, and in breach of contract. And I know a bunch of people whose careers start suffering, because they are not able to publish their work. But if we submit the publications, then we are in breach of contract. Even though the contract states that the intention is to publish all our work.\n\nI do my best to push the representatives of the uni to resolve this, but there is no date by which there will be any decision. Any day now, my publication will also get stuck in the limbo...\n\nWTF can I do? Just publish after the official deadline? Because otherwise my scientific output starts taking a hit. Sit quiet and hope that the problem will solve itself? Because then the corpo may go legally after the uni.",

There are a zillion frustrations and delays around publishing anyway.\n\nIf they miss the deadline by like \\*months\\* you/the appropriate contact people could at some point flag that the delay is causing problems for you and try to work it out; which if they care about the relationship, they'll presumably want to.\n\nThe authorship is tricky since it's mixing different ethical/legal contexts. I'd personally flag it with the Editor if someone has to be left off because of a corporate decision, to cover myself if it becomes an issue. You might be able to at least provide an acknowledgement as a compromise?",

But when my job opportunities start being at risk...\n\nGood idea to let the editor know about the authorship problem.\n\nTo my mind, removing authors is very illegal. IP and the money that comes from it is one thing, authorship is another. It's like the difference between paying shitty money to the book author for making a movie adaptation, versus denying it was their book. The former is not okay, but legal. The latter is illegal.\n\nIf they asked to add \"any opinions and recommendations in this work do not represent the position of corpo X\", I have zero problem with that.",

The actual laws would involve, say, IP, copyright, contract law - work-for-hire stuff, which might well not give a legal right to be a co-author on anything if the company denies it :(\n\nI could see them going for that \"does not represent the company\" statement though - I wonder whether you might also be able to avoid the issue by removing the person's affiliation (with the company's permission)?

It's pretty common even in academia for people to request not being on a publication (don't feel like they should be an author, don't want to bother, don't agree, whatever). For the time frame aspect, I have to give a bare minimum of 1 month, more is better, to get my presentation/publication to legal. The legal people look through it and send it off to a bunch of other people who look through it. Sometimes 1 person in that process being slow can hold up the whole thing for weeks.

That's bad contract language - typically my university will agree to give, say, 30 days' notice for review to flag issues, but we wouldn't agree to requiring *permission*.  But if that's what the university agreed to, it's what they agreed to and you're bound by it.  All you can do is work with legal counsel and perhaps your sponsored contracting folks who agreed to this contract in the first place, to see if you can push this review along.  *Maybe* you can do something like say \"if we don't hear back from you in the next two weeks, we will take it as permission and move ahead\", but definitely not without legal counsel's approval to do that.\n\nIn the cases where they've said you can remove an author and submit, then that's what you do.  Disclose the situation to the journal and let them decide whether publishing without that author is a problem, but sure, go ahead with the submission.  But where you don't have a response at all, you just have to wait and keep pushing for responses.  (Or pushing your advisor to push for responses; there may be an element of politics here in who actually does the contacting.)\n\nYour scientific output may in fact take a hit.  And it's unfortunate and frustrating for you that this is happening due to an issue with the lab that you weren't even there for.  But those seem to be the facts based on the limited information you've given us.  Your scientific output and reputation will take more of a hit if you spend years tangled in lawsuits about whether you can publish.\n\nYour nuclear option is to talk with your department about finding a different advisor, since the lab's reputational problem is now affecting you.  But obviously that will slow you down in another ways you're not going to be thrilled about, and isn't something to do lightly.",

I was also shocked that there is no clause for what happens after the deadline.\n\nSadly what falls under IP review is a matter of the topic, not the supervision. I do what I can to get as far away from what the company is interested in. Hopefully far enough that my future papers do not classify for the review.\n\nThanks for the advice! I will be pushing the representatives at the uni to give me a thumb up (in a written form) for the approach \"if there is no response by date X, than you can submit\".",

Say, the entire lab studies spiders, and the company is interested in... military application of spiders. The guy claimed he discovered 6-legged spiders and claimed that it was because of some genetic change, but it turned out that he was cutting off the legs of those spiders. It would be pretty groundbreaking if you could modify genome like this, so people were very excited, but also very suspicious, and indeed, it turned out it was a fraud. Meanwhile, I study how spiders make webs, and other affected colleagues study how the coloring helps them to avoid predators. It's also about spiders, but neither about genetics, nor about how many legs they have. It is easy to identify the claims that can or can't be treated as reliable, given the area of work of that guy. So I understand that they want to look into the setup for genetic testing, or leg-counting. But at the same time I feel fully confident that the data on the spider webs and predation is okay. Also, I have studies spiders all my life. I can't immediately change my field.\n\nIn other words, I understand how serious the situation is. But the connection of the topic in which there was a fraud, to the topics that are affected is so small, that the reaction seems completely misplaced.",

It doesn't matter that your work is on something different; it matters that you are working in a research environment that has quite publicly been proven to have inappropriate leadership, operating practices, and publishing practices to have detected and dealt with fraud before it was published.  A collaborator's concern isn't just going to be \"what did that one bad guy do\", it's \"what is the lab culture and ethical culture like at this lab that it was ever allowed to get as far as it did\"?  Everything your lab does is under a cloud now whether or not it's directly related to what that other person did. That sucks, but it's not something unusual this one company is doing to your lab.  It's just how these situations work.\n\nIt sounds like the company is doing appropriate due diligence in ths situation. The problem is only that they aren't doing it in the specified time frame and you can work on lighting a fire under their feet about that, or that you have a bad contract that never specified a time frame, in which case maybe you can talk with your contracting folks about trying to negotiate a contract amendment to handle this in the future.",

I am doing exactly that. I work on an unrelated thing. And that unrelated work is being blocked! That is the exact point! Should I quit my position, move abroad away from my friends to another uni? What exactly course of action are you suggesting? Because I do all I can to distance myself from the tainted work, but there is only so much I can do without handing in the contract termination notice...\n\n> You can't just say everyone else is fine, therefore let's just carry on like nothing happened, I'm insulted, wah wah it's not fair.\n\nWhere did I say that everything is fine? Or where did I say that the investigation into the misconduct is not fair? Or that the excessive caution, and prolonged delay in reviews are not fair? All of this is fair and justified. All I say that it should be done within the established legal boundaries and targeted at responsible people, and not indiscriminately at everyone.\n\nI imagine you work for some company, or at the uni. Say that you have a colleague who used to work 3 desks over, and moved a year before you joined. Two years into your work you find out that he was falsifying reports. Someone comes to you and tells you that it is your fault. Are you gonna go \"well that guy screwed up, so it's fair that I won't be able to find a job\"? In what world does this make sense?\n\n> your attitude is that the company is at fault for not being happy with the project.\n\nWhere did I say that I blame company for not being happy with the  project? I explicitly brought that up to indicate that they have every right to be suspicious. Stop putting things in my mouth that I did not say. I try to phrase things precisely. No, what happened is not fine! But use the legal tools you have to put the responsible people to justice. Stop the funding if you decide so. But do not use tools which are in breach of contract to target people who were not involved and have no power to do anything about what happened.",
