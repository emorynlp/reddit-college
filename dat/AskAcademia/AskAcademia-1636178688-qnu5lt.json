  "title:": "Department forcing me to teach a course even though my advisor has funds available to fund me from a grant",
  "text": " TLDR: My department is forcing me to teach a course even though my advisor has funds available to pay me from a grant. Is this even legal? Should I contact the dean of students or graduate school? \n\nMy advisor has funds for me to use for research from his grant so that I don't have to teach in my final semester. Unfortunately my department is denying the request and forcing me to teach a course to be funded since they are low on teachers. 75% of other students are being allowed to use research funding in my department, and I am one of the 5 who is not being allowed. The reasoning is because of timing and a change of policy that once the department determined they were running low on instructors they started denying requests for research funding.\n\nI have exhausted avenues within my department and have still been denied. I do have a lot of savings and could afford not to be funded at all. Honestly, I am tempted to deny teaching altogether. Of course I would not earn my 10-15K + health insurance + tuition benefit that I would get for research funding or teaching or being on the grant for research, but it is doable and honestly tempting to me right now. I am really upset about this. Teaching takes 20-30 hours a week of my time. \n\nI am going into my last semester and need time to finish my thesis, find a job, and everything else that comes with graduating. I simply do not have time to teach and have been counting on this funding from my advisor. I think it is completely ludicrous that the department is telling my advisor he cannot fund me using the grant money which was set aside for me.\n\nCan you think of anything I can do to fight this? It seems both immoral and illegal to me. Should I contact the graduate school or the dean of students? Do I have any legal recourse for this? It just feels they are stealing the grant money from me because they won't allow my advisor to give me the grant money meaning I am forced to teach if I want to get paid.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas, I am open to hear them. I can also clarify things if anything is unclear. Thank you.",

It\u2019s well within your employers (departments) purview to offer you one job over another based on their needs, just like faculty often have little to no say in what they teach, which is largely determined by need.\n\n::edit:: A possible intermediate would be for your advisor to pay you a salary for your research, rather than as an assistantship.

What if you warned them you were on the verge of burning out? \n\nAs a genuine hypothetical, because in your situation this would absolutely happen where I live, how would they cover you if you were ill, due to stress or anything else? You're a student, I assume they can't sack you from the program for inability to teach. \n\nI'm really bemused that they can force a final year grad student to essentially overload on their studies and expect no pushback on mental health grounds. Where I am, student mental health is a big deal, and doctors wouldn't hesitate to write a student off sick for a couple of weeks in your situation.
