      "text": "In my experience there will be some additional interviews with staff on the project, a department manager, and maybe some other postdocs in the department so that you can ask them questions.  \n\nAlso,  US National Labs tend to be pretty straight laced, so jokes about partying and stuff aren't encouraged. I would air on the side of being as polite and enthusiastic about the position as possible.",

      "text": "Don't be afraid to ask your own questions about the department/group you'll be in, etc, during the interviews you'll have.  Be prepared to discuss how you would extend your research in the future (even if that isn't what they intend for you to do) because that is a natural question during your seminar.  I agree with being polite and enthusiastic.",
