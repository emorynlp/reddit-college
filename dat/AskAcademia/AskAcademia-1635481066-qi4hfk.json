  "text": "Finishing Chemistry PhD next year. Some trouble happened with the government agency that pays me (my \"salary\" plus money for lab stuff), the result of this is that, to me, science in my country (not USA) is dead to me the day I turn in my thesis. I abhor the idea of coming back to teach/ research and spend my life begging for crumbs. I am tired. I want stability and peace. \n\nOn thread, to those of you with a (mostly) 100% work experience in academia, how did you make a CV to go to industry and other fields? How do you list academic accomplishments (congress presentations, articles/book chapters published) to people who are completely outside of academia? What skills do you list?\n\nOf \"general\" info that I can think of, is that I did a year of my undergrad in the US thanks to a scholarship that I won, and that I know 3, maybe 4 languages. Is experience abroad an experience worth mentioning? On academics, I have 5 (soon 6) published works, half of them with a research group that is considered to be one of the best in my field of study.",

      "text": "1. Go on LinkedIn or any job listing site and search for jobs with your degree as the requirement (e.g. Chemistry PhD).\n2. Ignoring the jobs that come up which are completely unrelated, and start noting what tends to come up in the job descriptions. Certain keywords tend to come up a lot.\n3. Try to tailor your resume to match the skills that those keywords look for. Also, one thing I find is that academia tends to teach us to be very skill-based in writing our resumes (e.g. these are the skills I can do which are transferrable). while industry is looking for the impact you did (e.g. when I did this, it affected that).\n4. The cliche \"get some experience\" advice. I don't know what it's like for chemistry, but for myself, I had to get some experience in a lab completely unrelated to my field but very related to industry, and then it made my resume pretty kickass. I picked that lab based on what I saw companies were looking for in my LinkedIn searches.",

      "text": "Problem, Solution, Product \n\nWhat general problem were you working to address, what methods/solutions did you use (successfully or not), what was the output (paper, grant proposal, presentation, poster, patent, et ).\n\nThat should form the bulk of your bullet points in the experience section.\n\nCompanies care most about what you do in terms of methods/experience on a technical level. Domain knowledge is a plus, but its easier to teach a new hire context vs experience working and troubleshooting certain tasks.",

It\u2019s okay to list publications if you have space but it should be last and selected ones if you have many. Highlight leadership/mentorship roles, collaborations, and other team related work.",
