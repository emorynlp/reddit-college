So know let's say that 1000 researchers independently decide to test Hypothesis A, which is actually false. 950 of the researchers will get a \"non-result\", and simply stop - they won't try to get it published. 50 researchers will, however, get a false-positive. They *will* submit for publication, and will get published. If everybody knew about the 950 other studies that found nothing, it wouldn't be a big deal since we would figure out the result wasn't really there. But since neither we nor the journals see all those failed tests (because the authors just stop working on them and never write them up for publication), it looks like a new hypothesis has been proven statistically when if fact it's just a bunch of false positives. (this may be what OP was referring too, but it affects all empirical fields, nit just biology.) ",

Would be great if there were a way to \"catalog\" failed tests so that people could see when a topic had been explored.\n\nIn the hard sciences you can normally demand that others independently replicate results, including generating new data through experiments. In the social sciences this is much more difficult because we rely on data observed from real life and you just cannot go get more data. For example, in my field of finance you may want to use stock market data to test a theory. You cannot ask others to replicate the results with different data because there is really only one stock market and you just have to live with the data you get from it.\n\nIn short, it's a very hard problem.",

If I take your grant money, do the best I can, and it just doesn't work, then sure, at the end, I'd love to publish that paper. But that's not normally how it works. How it works is, \"I tried one thing, and that didn't work well enough, so I made a bit of a tweak here and there and then it did.\" In those cases, no one wants to publish the failure, because it's going to go into a venue no one reads, and if they do, then they scoop themselves out of the publication that did work. The positive result might have been a Nature paper before, but now it's a minor tweak on earlier already published work, which is going to kill it from the big journals.\n\nI can sympathize with the goal here, and I support mandatory open-access publications for all publicly funded work.

For example, a bunch of journals in my field (Psychology and Marketing), now explicitly ask some questions, that typically get omitted.  It's a lot easier to omit information than to overtly lie.  \n\nFor example, researchers might have collected a few control variables but since they didn't predict anything, didn't report them.  OR they may have tried a similar version of the study 1 or 2 other times and not found the effect, but then got it on the 3rd try (this ups type I error).  So now, journals ask about these specific questions.\n\nIn addition, there are some open-science projects going on.  The one I'm most familiar with is the [center for open science](https://osf.io/about/) \n\nThe call now is to pre-register every study we do.  It might slow down science in the short-term, but if it means less false-positives,  it will only be  a good thing!",

The tests you described are set up so that even if there is no effect, there is a 5% chance that you will observe a false positive (observe a p-value less than 0.05). \n\nThis is entirely different than what you have stated.

In this case, all of these results (100%) have been observed in error. Not only 5%.\n\n",

Many of the best economic historians, who use very innovative approaches, are American. I really think it tends to be different more on the micro / institutional level.

          "text": "I know the discussion here is in good spirits, but I can't for the life of me comprehend how anyone could ever come away with such an idea about literary studies. \n\nI mean, it isn't my field (I'm in the History of Art), but humanities scholarship circulates pretty freely between literatures, philosophy, histories, etc. so a lot of reading overlaps. Maybe I just don't get it (this mindset, I mean). It's practically impossible for me to see how people think \"literary studies is just making things up\" or just throwing words around, because (from my perspective) the theoretical work (good theoretical work, obviously) is as rigorous as can be; the archival work is as precise as can be, and just...everything is so logical, so systematic, so incremental. \n\nI mean, read Ricoeur, for example. His work on meaning, metaphor, narrative, hermeneutics...for me he's one of the most systematic and precise thinkers in the history of human thought. There could be countless other examples, but my point is...I just really do not get how it's possible for someone to think \"this is made up, but *that* (perhaps because it contains numbers and graphs?) is not made up.\"\n\nI won't even touch on deconstruction because the lay public pretty much just doesn't get it; they got acquainted with it through highly warped, oversimplified media misrepresentation, so yeah. Deconstruction at its best is perhaps the most powerful critical approach of the 20th century. And really good scholarship (some of Derrida's finer essays, Martin Hagglund's work, etc.) shows that. \n\nI know a lot of this has to do with lay confusion over \"objectivity\" and \"subjectivity\"...differences that draw from a long, confused history involving observation and interpretation, positivism, etc. I know that the 20th-century fascination with empiricism and consequent denigration of literary studies is only a very recent fad. Still, it's incomprehensible to me. It makes me sad, too, because the people who think that way...to imagine how much they are missing out on...wow.",

It's like taking high-school physics and then making claims about what graduate researchers do. It makes me believe the problem is at a more basic level--perhaps something in the way that American schools (or most of them anyway) teach literatures to kids. I mean, of course it'll be pretty formalist at that level because you need to learn the basics of reading and interpreting a text beyond the surface, but if it's giving people such a misguided idea after the fact...maybe something should be fixed there. \n\nYes, you read texts and decipher meaning from them, but no--there is not a \"lot of freedom\" in the \"anything goes\" sense. Meaning doesn't emerge within a vacuum; it emerges from within specific discursive structures. So it's really not the case that you can read this post and interpret it as an allegory on the Middle East crisis--and if you do, there *will* be a specific constellation of discourses that might, plausibly, make  such an odd reading sensible.\n\nIt's this crucial condition that seems to get lost when people say you can just read a text and \"make meaning\" from it.

In quite a few domains, \"hand it off to a SAT/ILP/SMT/whatever solver\" is considered an acceptable strategy and actually produces (commercially) deployable results. Type inference for ML programs is EXPTIME-complete (and actually printing the inferred type is even worse), but we have still managed to compile large programs without having the sun engulf the planet.\n\nEven fancy, new static analysis techniques tend to collapse when applied to programming languages people actually use. Nobody knows what to do with `eval`, but JavaScript has it whether we like it or not.\n\nSome promote dependent types as the way forward as they allow much more thorough (machine-checked) specification of how some code should behave. However, implementing an underclassman-level data structures homework assignment in this \"correct by construction\" manner is considered a significant research result.\n\nThere's a lot of concern about \"programming in the large,\" but nobody really has the wherewithal to properly study how a range of different language features affect the productivity of professional programmers working on large-scale projects. There have been a fair number of empirical studies, but practical concerns generally limit this to observing students attempting small, artificial tasks. I suspect this is the hardest problem in PL research.\n\nHaskell programs have effects (ok, not that much of a secret, but still something many people are loath to admit).",

It's used for data analysis.\n\nWhen samples are measured for radiocarbon dating using AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) you directly measure the ratio of C12, C13, & C14. This is different from Libby's way of counting using the beta emissions. Now measuring the carbon ratio is something, but quite literally means nothing without some sort of context (i.e. a standard). This standard will depend on the lab, but the two I'm used to is OX-I and OX-II (oxalic acid, harvest from beet sugar back in the good old days). These standards are used to tune the AMS for a specific sample run and for data analysis. We know the carbon isotopic ratio of OX-I and OX-II...so we normalize \"or fudge\" every data point collected to the ratio of OX-I or -II. \n\nOnce the data analysis is complete, the software spits out a ratio for the sample in question, that ratio is plugged into a equation, background corrected, internal/external error calculated, etc etc.. and out comes a FmC value (fraction modern carbon) and an age (radiocarbon years). This age needs to be calibrated using OxCal to get a calibrated age. \n\nKind of seems...anti-climatic...\n\nedit: Alright...will discourage the use of \"fudging\" the numbers when performing data anaylsis...we *normalize*",

Every isotope geochemist normalizes data to a standard because these machines have excellent precision within runs but terrible accuracy. Therefore in order to get usable data they must all be corrected to the same well known standard. If you didn't normalize to the standard then it would be impossible to compare the results you get with anyone else or values from literature. The standard in question here is used by many AMS labs around the world for 14C and has been rigorously tested by intercomparisons. Also, AMS is infinitely more complex than IRMS in that a lot of tweaks can be made in terms of machine tuning and ion source behavior (ion sorcery), therefore, if you didn't normalize the true ratio as you call it would actually just be subject to the conditions of machine during the run. By the way, that's a nice little AMS system - 500kV? Try to make it to AMS14 in Ottawa in a few years!",

The website has a nice picture: http://www.ams.uottawa.ca/Radiocarbon/welcome.html and the sample processing page has the details about water trapping an vacuum since the temperature and vacuum of each sample are continuously monitored. The automation also makes it possible to avoid human error from certain steps as well. So far the AMS data for 14C has been top notch. I would say that getting the material to CO2 is the most labour intensive part of the process.\n\nOur AMS system is a brand new 3MV HVE since we are doing cosmogenics, 129I, actinides, 14C as well as setting up an experimental AMS line as well to play with isobar separation.

It's pretty amazing. The archaeological collection is great too. I've met Grant on my way through a few times. It's a small world, particularly amongst people working in the Yukon!\n\nI was working a on a few watersheds throughout the Yukon and up near Fort McPherson for a while looking at geochemical cycling and storage of 129I. We have a few people doing work in Old Crow though as well. \n\nThe reason 36Cl is a hassle is that not many labs can analyze it due the 36S isobar. The sample prep is pretty easy (precipitate as AgCl), but you need a very large AMS with a gas filled magnet to drop the isobaric interference. We are working on doing it with a 3MV, but aren't there yet. Right now only Purdue can run 36Cl easily in North America. ",

If it causes your jimmies to get in a twist, then you are free to not provide a source, ignore the request, tell me to google it myself, etc.\n\nBut to provide an answer and be helpful *while* being a jerk... this is new lol.\n\n>Next time try actually asking a specific question if you aren't sure about something. I wasn't even sure what you wanted a source on.\n\nFirst, you obviously understood my request... as you provided the exact answer I was looking for. Second, my \"source\" request was in response to your sentence post with no more than 30 words in it. If ever there is a time when nothing more than \"source\" is sufficient enough to communicate, \"can you link me to something that supports what you just said,\" this would be it.\n\nRelax. <3",

So I'm calling it out whenever I have to deal with it. It is like going to a journal club and having everybody bitch about the statistics in the paper rather then saying something meaningful about the paper. \n\nIf you were actually interested in climate gate you could have checked the wikipedia article on climategate, hit clt+F typed \"trick\" and look at the 1st citation that came afterward (which is what I did to give you your source). You could have even taken the time to type \"This is interesting to me. I hadn't ever heard about someone referring to a statistical method as a \"trick\" as being the powder keg that caused the climate gate mess. Do you have a source?\" and gotten a completely different response with the same information.\n\nAnd I actually didn't understand your request, I thought you were a climate change denier who was going to claim that there was actually some sort of misconduct found in \"climate gate.\" I originally was going to respond to that but I figured the guardian article would get you riled up and then a climatologist (which is not my field) would come along and set you straight.
