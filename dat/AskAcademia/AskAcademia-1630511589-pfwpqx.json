  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am not sure whether this is the right place, but we are looking for a journal that we can pre-register our study during the data collection. Generally, journals indicate that it should be prior to data collection. However, I saw some (pre-registered) papers indicating ongoing data collection. Unfortunately, I don't remember which journal because it was very long time ago. By definition, there are also phrases like prior to data collection, or at least before the analysis. Our data collection part will take at least 5,6 months, but the thing is we have already started to collect data. \n\nDo you know journals that allow/accept applications while data collection is ongoing? Fields are: neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, clinical studies, brain manipulation.",

I mentioned this track in another comment - I don't think the OP's case fits with what most of those journals offer when they say they allow registered reports containing secondary analyses. They usually mean that you pre-register an analysis plan before accessing data from another source (e.g. another lab, a database).\n\nFor example, Wellcome Open Research states:\n\n>Wellcome Open Research welcomes Stage 1 Study Protocols proposing secondary analyses of existing datasets, provided authors can supply sufficient evidence (e.g. self-certification; letter from independent gatekeeper) to confirm that they have had no prior access to the data in question.\n\nThe OP is talking about pre-registering their own study, where I would assume they do have access to the data. At least, it'd be hard to argue that they didn't.",

Some journals (e.g. Royal Society Open Science, Scientific Reports) allow registered reports to contain secondary analysis of existing data, but it's usually not your own, and you have to establish that you didn't have access to it at the time of pre-registration. \n\n  \nI don't think pre-registering an analysis plan while data collection is underway is pointless, but it doesn't really work with the journal registered report format.
