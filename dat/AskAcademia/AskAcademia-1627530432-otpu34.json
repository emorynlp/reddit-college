  "text": "For background I just graduated with a biology degree and didn\u2019t get to participate in research with professor. I am wanting to pursue a job in research (genetics, cell biology, anything really) but I can\u2019t seem to land a research assistant position fresh out of school. As well I am under qualified for most master\u2019s programs. \n\n\nWhat jobs should I be looking at that will give me lab experience but also help me get into graduate school? I was thinking about working at Lab Corp  but it is medical tech position and I don\u2019t know if that experience will help me pursue a master\u2019s. Any advice would be helpful. \n\nThanks.",

      "text": "As other people said, research experience is king! I'd add that at your stage the PIs who are considering your applications or cold emails or whatever are most concerned about sinking time and resources into you without a return on their investment. It'll realistically take six months of hands on training to get you to be a productive member of a lab, and if you quit in or after those six months the PI has just wasted a ton of time. \n\nSo in looking for work or experience, your job is to alleviate that concern so the PI is excited to take you on. Ways to do that include being super enthusiastic and curious about the research so the PI is sure that you're motivated to stay in their specific lab, or searching for positions where you can be useful off the bat, eg washing beakers while training to do a research project. You can be subtle about addressing these concerns (don't just out and say \"I know you're worried I'll ditch you\") but keep that in mind as you go, it may help you get a spot! \n\nAlso keep in mind that PIs often don't post job offerings or forget to take them down once they're filled, so it's okay to just email a PI. Introduce yourself, say what you found interesting from reading their research (lab website, latest paper, etc), tell them that you want to apply to grad school in your discipline, and ask if they have any positions available. I think it's important to include that you're grad school bound because you'll attract the attention of PIs who enjoy mentoring people to and through grad school, and probably end up with a better experience from it.\n\nGood luck!",
