  "title:": "Discussion on undergrad school representation in grad school acceptance",
  "text": "For some context, I'm discussing this topic with regards to PhD programs in the USA, particularly in STEM.\n\nI'm currently a PhD student in a STEM PhD program at one of the well known institution in the USA. Recently, my program's DEI committee began a discussion about increasing representation of undergraduate institutions in the program cohort -- i.e., increasing the number of entering graduate students coming from less-represented undergrad schools. Concern over such representation makes sense, given the current reality where every year, the program accepts many (>4-5 each) students from strong STEM schools (think MIT, UC Berkeley) while accepting 0-1, rarely 2 each from other schools (generally public state universities; think CUBoulder, UMichigan, UCSD, etc). The end result is that every cohort each year has multiple students each from strong STEM schools, 1 student each from relatively well-known/\"stronger\" schools, and maybe 1 student each from other universities but only once every 3-5 years or so.\n\nIn an ideal world, representation from these less-represented undergrad institutions should be higher. However, given the cap on cohort sizes, this can't be done unless seats are taken away from other would-be accepted students from over-represented institutions, i.e. from MIT/Caltech/etc. It's a zero-sum game.\n\nI'm curious to hear what you think about this dilemma and what the most practical, moral solution could be. While I agree that the current admission scheme at my program definitely needs work, I am uncomfortable with the idea that students at top undergrads would lose their seats at top grad schools for the sake of increased undergrad representation.\n\nMy current take is this: at the end of the day, I think that the best students with greatest potential should make it to top grad schools. It's hard to truly distinguish these students given the large spectrum and variability in resources/research opportunities/funding/privilege/etc from each undergrad institution. However, a quota-like rule like \"accept 1-2 student per institution\" seems unfair to students who chose to attend highly competitive undergrad programs.\n\nI want to acknowledge that this can be a difficult topic to discuss but not something many talk about. I'm curious to hear your thoughts (for, against, or otherwise), and feel free to call me out on any of my misconceptions or bullshit. Let's discuss!",

      "text": "Something the DEI committee at my university likes to talk about is considering \"total distance traveled\" as opposed to directly comparing objective achievement level between applicants. So for example if someone went to MIT and had their name on multiple papers from undergrad, comparing them head to head with someone from a small state school who maybe did an REU but didn't have the chance to get published because their school doesn't have a strong research program, the MIT student is going to win. But if you look deeper you can potentially see that the student from the state school worked through undergrad while also volunteering in a lab and excelled the best they could given the circumstances. These two students start to look at lot more comparable and then you have to look at other things to make your decisions. I think continually emphasizing that to ad com members as they're reviewing applications could help them tilt the scale a little bit without anything as confining as a quota. That being said, our incoming class last year was still heavily weighted towards a handful of prestigious schools. It might be overly optimistic to expect professors who fought their way to the top of the system as it is to be able to change it to make it more equitable without being forced to.",

              "text": "If they are targeting those schools as under-represented then I'd say their whole DEI program is fucked. \n\nI think OP's \"dilemma\" is based on a total fallacy which is that those at top schools deserve those places more than those at other schools. You aren't \"taking away a place from them\" because it's not *their place*, it's *a place* and it should go to the best candidate. And if you improve your selection criteria so that you aren't simply judging candidates on what a candidate who goes to an elite predominantly white school looks like, then you can actually start recruiting talent from all over the place without believing you're taking places away from the elites.",

      "text": "I agree with the comment about total distance travelled. After an applicant meets a certain threshold, our admissions committee tries to evaluate them in the context of their circumstances, and this usually results in a more even distribution of students from both big name and non-big name institutions, without any deliberate quota-filling. They do a similar 'calibrating' for people coming straight from undergrad vs. people with masters degrees or work experience as techs.\n\nJust anecdotally, my PI has said they haven't observed a difference in performance depending on undergrad institution. IME from observing members of my own cohort and mentoring junior/rotating grad students, the advantage of being from a big name school or R1 is not as big as it seems and these students aren't necessarily hitting the ground running more than their public state school/small liberal arts college counterparts. Usually, the bigger factor in terms of who gets into the swing of things fastest is whether someone is coming straight from undergrad or took a couple of years to work as a tech or get a master's (a serious one, not a pay to play).",

      "text": "What does the faculty (or admissions committee) representation look like? Similar to what they see for the graduate program, where everyone comes from a select group of schools. Also, are there better areas to improve representation for the program than what university their students come from? This is an incredibly common thing with faculty - hiring the majority from a handful of \"elite\" institutions. Is the program also looking at its hiring practices there?\n\nQuick note - UC Berkeley is a public state university. It's part of the University of California system, same as UCSD and UCLA.",
