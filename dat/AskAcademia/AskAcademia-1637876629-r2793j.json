      "text": "There's a lot of subtle (?) differences. For example, you will generally have more wealthy peers at elite universities compared to state schools, have access to \"better\" professors (most famous research groups are often at fancy universities), possibly better chances with internships and job applications, and the location can open up more unique opportunities (for example, if you want to start a tech company, you probably want to be at Stanford). There's probably thousands of other things but there's certainly massive advantages to being at an elite university.",

The \"top\" universities you listed are more comparable to the research-heavy Ivy schools.",
