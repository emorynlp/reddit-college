  "text": "I've been working in the same academic lab for 2+ years, and have responsibilities beyond a typical RA; I am supervising an undergraduate student and am coordinating two studies. However, I've been applying to other jobs and have the possibility of moving to a clinical research setting, which I would prefer. I feel like I see a lot of stuff on here about, \"you don't owe your PI anything,\" and so on, but I really would feel horrible abandoning this lab, the projects, and the student, and I will likely want to use my PI as a reference in the future. Any suggestions for the least bad way to go about this?\n\nEdit: I am a research assistant, not a grad student!",

      "text": "I hope your transition goes smoothly! I think a cognitive reframing would be helpful: **getting a new job is not** ***horribly abandoning*** **your old job.** Those are strong words for a strong feeling that definitely isn't reciprocated. Your institution and your PI, however friendly, would never see themselves as abandoning you if they let you go. And you'd never accuse your friends or partner of abandoning their employer because they pursued a better position.\n\nOther posters gave useful strategies. Just be professional and civil. Unless these people are bizarrely vindictive, don't worry. In fact, if they're well-adjusted, they'll be happy for you!\n\nIt may also be helpful to remember that academic job markets are brutal, and **there's pretty much an endless pool of applicants for them to choose from.** Moreover, no one assumes an RA will stay on indefinitely. Good luck.",

For example, if you can give extra notice to allow for a smoother transition, like 4 weeks (or more) instead of 2, that's great. Or if you can continue supervising the student remotely for a while. Or continue participating in the studies (and coauthor). Things like that. Just don't commit to anything that you are going to come to resent before you are done.",

Some professors expect you to be there until they no longer need (or can afford) you. Those types do not take it well when you leave. Most professors, however, understand that an RA will eventually move on. The really good ones will encourage you to move on! It is the nature of the job. As another person said, giving as much notice as possible always helps things end well.",

Her website is full of great advice for all things career-related. \n\nHowever, my advice would be once you have an offer to tell your boss face to face that you're leaving, tell them how much you've enjoyed working there and thank them for their support over the years and then start negotiating the notice period. Don't be apologetic or overly effusive just keep it simple and honest.",
