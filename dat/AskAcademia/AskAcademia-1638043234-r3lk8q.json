  "title:": "Need advice about relationship with my supervisor",
  "text": "I would like to start by giving a bit of context. \n\nI have been working with them for almost 5 years, in May 2022 the sixth year will start. I am a PhD candidate in his last year. In June 2020, I passed my thesis proposal and by the end of the summer I had already published 3 papers with them as the co-author. I have been working on the 4th one for almost two years and this paper has been ready for them to read since the middle of summer. In September 2020, 3 colleagues,  my supervisor, and I were invited to work in a project with an industrial partner. It was a 16-month project, which is supposed to end this December (2021). During this project, I have been paid to work on this and the project has been my main focus during the last 15 months.Because of this project, our \"relationship\" grew and we were close to the point that we would talk everyday, at late hours, and during a hard period of my life, due to high stress related to the project, I opened myself to them.During my time working on this project my performance was outstanding and a great part of the development was on my hands.\n\nBy the end of the summer (2021), I said to them that I wanted to submit my thesis before the end of the year, because I wanted to defend somewhere between January - May of 2022. Another colleague from the project that I described above also requested the same, as they had obtained a postdoc position elsewhere. My supervisor said they thought it was a feasable plan for me and agreed. They never said \"no, you can't\", \"you are not ready\" or showed any opposition to this idea. I finished writing my thesis by the end of October and I told him that it was ready for feedback. At this point, my thesis in full and the 4th paper were on their \"desk\" waiting for feedback.As the time passed, they didn't read my thesis, but my colleagues thesis was read in full and reviewed.My colleague is defending before the Christmas break.They will be joining their pos-doc position in January. \n\nAs all this happened, the project with the industrial partner slowed down due to problems on the partner's side.  Unfortunately, the project won't be completed before the end of December, and it will mostly likely be finished somewhere between January and May 2022.  As of today, my supervisor and the industrial partner have not given an official statement or said anything about the future of the project. During the bi-weekly meetings people only say \"this will be completed in somewhere in January\", \"this thing will be tested in February\". But nothing official has been said.Of course, my colleague won't be participating as they will be joining other lab, and the work with the industrial partner is secret. \n\nAt the beginning of November, I spoke with them and told them that I was in conversations to accept a full time job in January, but I wanted their blessing. Once again, I told my supervisor that I wanted to submit my thesis before the end of December, and they said that they didn't foresee any major issue to submit my thesis before the Christmas break. During this conversation, I told them that I would even TA for them during the Winter term (January to May 2022) as I know how important for them is to teach and to have a TA on which they can rely. This is, of course, more work for me, but I want to them to be happy so they read my thesis.They seemed glad with my offer. For me, this was their blessing. I accepted the job offer this week. \n\nNow, this is where it gets tricky, my supervisor has not read my thesis as of today. They don't seem to be interested in doing so. The lab where I work has weekly meetings and I planning to tell him that I won't be joining them once the job starts in January. I am not doing any experiments, my thesis is already written, and the project with the industrial partner is officially done in December. The payments will also officially stop in December 31. I don't know what the industrial partner plans to do once 2022 starts, but I won't be joining any meetings with them as well. \n\nMy questions are : is there a way I could push them to read my thesis? Is it okay for me to say \"I won't be joining the lab meetings in January\"? Have I acted wrongly at some point? \n\nMy supervisor gave me the opportunity to do my PhD, I am very thankful and I don't want to screw my relationship with them, but at the same time I have given all of me to this endeavour and I want to move on in my life. \n\nAny thoughts and advice are well appreciated.",

      "text": "I think there could be a miscommunication here. It's very easy for students and supervisors to understand the timeline in very different ways. In the summer you said you were going to defend sometime Jan-May. You might have been thinking Jan/Feb, but its quite common for a supervisor to assume this means closer to May. Later, you mentioned that you'd be willing to TA until May. This may have also given them the impression that you are likely to be there until May. If you are going to be there until May, then there is no hurry to review your thesis. It's probably not a lack of interest, I think they don't see it as urgent.\n\nMy advice is to send them an email with the information and timeline. Be polite but clear. Hey I wanted to let you know that I took that job I mentioned a couple weeks ago. They want me to start on Jan 15th, so I need to get my thesis submitted by ____. Is there any way you can get your comments to me by _____? I'm really excited about this opportunity. Thanks for all your help.",

          "text": "Thanks for your advice. The reason why I push them to read my thesis before February is because my PI teaches a lot of classes in the months o January to May and it becomes impossible for them to read anything. \n\nI will use your advice and send them an email next week! Thanks again!",
