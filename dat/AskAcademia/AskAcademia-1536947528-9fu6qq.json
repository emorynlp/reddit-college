Keep a log to keep yourself honest. Requiring a small number of words (250-500) from yourself every day is super manageable, eliminates writing guilt, and adds up super quickly. \n\n-Challenge your narrative about how you write and how you think. Be willing to make changes to your writing process. I didn\u2019t become an efficient or a productive writer until I developed a willingness to stop writing in the way that I did in college and grad school and experiment with other techniques and approaches.  I thought I could only write in long chunks once or twice a week because that\u2019s \u201chow I thought.\u201d I tripled my productivity when I was finally able to call bullshit on that and started writing in tiny chunks every day. \n\n-Learn how to use Scrivener. Do the tutorial. Then force yourself to at least try writing one paper with it. Most people never go back once they do. \n\n-Overdoing it on service and committee work in your early years gives you minimal career gains and virtually no credit towards tenure. Protect your time. Learn how to say no gently. \n\nGood luck!!!",

And of course ask one's chair as well. As a long-time chair, I spend about an hour with any tenure-track job candidate we bring to campus carefully explaining what it takes to earn tenure, including sharing our official document that articulates departmental standards and expectations. On our campus the T&P process is supposed to be clear, fair, and applied equally across all disciplines...I've heard enough horror stories from other places where it is not that I do what I can to make sure our junior faculty know exactly what is expected of them and when.\n\nOur faculty handbook specifically requires \"demonstrated excellence in teaching\" as a non-negotiable for tenure. The requirements for publication and service are both less stringent and more vague, so that's where the wiggle room is at the departmental level. But I've spent my career at SLACs and I know that's different from your R1/R2 world; one book and a couple of articles is plenty to earn tenure for us.  When someone is clearly not going to reach that modest bar they know it before going up for tenure and usually leave-- our provost even talks about chairs \"mentoring out\" colleagues who clearly aren't going to earn tenure with us, so we seldom see denials. Maybe three I can recall in the last 20+ years, though more are invited to leave at third year when it's clear they aren't going to cut it as teachers.",
