  "text": "My advisor doesn't like me using Excel to show figures. I don't have huge data files and Excel is pretty useful program to do a lot of different figures, in my eyes at least. I do tons of editing on the figure too. But my advisor likes to follow up the published papers in the field on this matter and if they are drawing it with Origin, we should draw with Origin too, they think.\n\nIs there a reasonable basis to this? Do journals reject the papers because the figures look basic?",

It's not just about \"the looks\" (though that arguably does matter \u2014 grab a copy of Tufte's _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ if you need to be convinced that the _looks_ and the _content_ are not so separate as they seem), it's about the experience, the standardization, the skills, etc. Frankly starting out with something simple enough that you could do it in Excel, but you're doing it in a more complicated program, will help you learn the complicated program better than if you start out trying to do something complicated. In my experience with software and visualization (not this specific problem).",
