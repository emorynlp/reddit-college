  "text": "Hello! I am a female engineer - currently a VAP and am loving it. I recently finished my master\u2019s and was planning to get a PhD. My career goal is to be a professor in engineering. I know the odds are slim, but this is what my job would be if I had my pick. \n\nBefore I get into this post, I just wanna say that I also posted a very similar post just now to another subreddit to get insight into the other career options I may have, but I\u2019d really like to hear from academia too which is why I\u2019m posting here as well.\n\nAs I was thinking about my PhD applications, I realized that academic jobs don\u2019t really seem to fit well with caregivers. In my case, I personally can\u2019t fathom the idea of having a kid and then sending them off to day care for the entire day at 3 months old. Same with kids who are in school but off for the summers - I can\u2019t imagine leaving them for their few months off and spending all of that working instead. A part-time arrangement would be fantastic in situations like these, but I\u2019ve never heard of that being a thing in academia. In fact, I\u2019ve usually heard of it being the opposite - you work more than a typical job. Academia does have a lot more flexibility time-wise, but that doesn\u2019t change the amount of hours you have to work, especially pre-tenure. If I took time off to spend with my kids their first few years, I\u2019m guessing it would be nearly impossible to get an academic job afterwards considering it\u2019s nearly impossible without a gap of a few years.\n\nIt just seems dumb now to do a PhD with the goal of being an academic (though if that doesn\u2019t work out, then doing research somewhere outside of academic) but then quit to raise my kids and not be able to get the job I\u2019m getting a PhD for afterwards. I have really disliked industry so far, so unless a research position drastically changes my industry experience, I probably wouldn\u2019t last long in industry before quitting to do something else. The alternative is giving into not taking care of my kids myself and sending them to day care, but that\u2019s something I really don\u2019t want to do. How do those of you that have children handle it? Am I totally wrong about what it\u2019s like to have children and be an academic, or is this pretty accurate and makes my PhD goals questionable? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned part-time academic jobs not being a thing. To clarify, I know adjuncting is part-time and very much a thing, but considering the pay and how much work teaching takes, it\u2019s not worth it for me to consider as a part-time job. I was referring to what one would normally think of when thinking of a part-time job in any other industry.",

      "text": "A PhD trains you in how to do research. I would not do a PhD unless I wanted a job in research (academia or otherwise.)\n\n\nAcademic jobs in engineering are hard to get, but not like a lot of the real horror stories you hear about in other fields. A good candidate can get a good job somewhere. The pay can range from ok to very good. And not every job is TT - I'm seeing a lot of ads for permanent non-TT jobs that come with stability, career progression, and varying work responsibilities.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to family stuff, sometimes geography is the biggest challenge. Do you have a significant other? Do they have a job? Would they be willing to move a couple of times to further your career?\n\n\nDaycare is the best. It sounds like you're not comfortable with it, and these decisions are always personal. Still, my kids loved going every day and seeing all their little friends. Having that time where the kids were happy and cared for not only let us work but kept us sane. It's expensive but so, so worth it.",

This is a where you live issue. This is not how it works in many other countries. Colleagues here, for example, can take ~12 months of maternity leave (6 months full pay, 6 months reduced pay). You would also be eligible for much more flexible work hours. And there's 6 months of paternity leave too. \n\nAcademia can offer a level of flexibility unheard of in other fields. The  bigger issues with academia are the job insecurity, the metrics of success, and the sometimes inhuman way those things can impinge on your life (highly dependent on field, country, career stage, employer, etc etc).\n\nHowever, the real hurdle for parents is the loss of momentum. The academic track requires that you have a growing and developing research portfolio. Research doesn't just happen - it has long timescales of development, writing, publication, and funding. Parenthood can really screw with that.",

          "text": "The sad truth about America. By law, people are allowed to get 12 weeks of unpaid leave lol. That's it. Then it's up to the individual employers to decide how much they will give and most won't exceed 4-5 weeks. That's why people always save their vacation and sick days to use or file for disability benefits in order to get paid during those unpaid leaves. \n\nThe problems described in OPs post will occur even in someone with a high school degree. As long as one has to work in America, then they will need to send their babies to daycare or with parents because the law doesn't permit them to take more time off.",

      "text": "I had my child in my fourth year of PhD training. I was fortunate to have some maternity leave but my child went to daycare at 5 weeks old and I went back to work. I worked in the lab normal hours so that I could pick up my daughter and then would do some work at home if needed. I could never afford to take any time off. I graduated \"on time\".\n\nFour years out from my PhD and I am the primary breadwinner. My husband works a part-time job and can do a lot of the running the little one around. I didn't want a highly competitive academic job, child or no child. It has worked out pretty well so far. \n\nYou can definitely have a child if you want one and get your PhD/career. My child doesn't remember going to daycare. I have a supportive spouse who loves being a Dad.",

      "text": "I\u2019d say this is hard to impossible if you\u2019re not comfortable with daycare or summer child care.\n\nI think people have a tendency to build up academia as this unique thing, but our jobs rely on drawing boundaries like any other. How much time we\u2019ll spend, how mired in students\u2019 emotional drama.\n\nFor me, during the pandemic, I started working 5-7:30a, getting the kids ready, taking 8-9:30 as personal time, then going to the office 10-4 so I could be on call for school and daycare pickup, since my spouse has a commute. We\u2019ve had some changes recently and my kids have their after school activities back, so my spouse and I are back trading off pickup by 5:15, so the end of my day is less rushed now.\n\n I can\u2019t rely on after hours work. My kids might refuse to sleep. Or get sick. I need to finish my work for the week in the 9-5 hours. That means being really disciplined in those hours. Staying on task, using lists to manage it all. But it worked out and I got tenure early. \n\nBut the majority of classes are M-F during normal working hours. My students and personnel all have lives outside work and mostly want to work M-F normal working hours. So if you can\u2019t be around those hours, it\u2019s a tricky proposition. Likewise, summer is often a research productivity season because students aren\u2019t in class, so being off most of the summer means taking a big hit in the outputs.\n\nIf being this degree of hands-on is the goal, an adjunct role might be the best option. They\u2019re pretty easy to pop in and out of.",
