  "title:": "An offer: resume review and reframing help for folks leaving academia/who want to transition into tech",
  "text": "One thing that academia is terrible about telling you (i.e. doesn't tell you) is that you've got transferrable skills that many employers would be thrilled to have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left academia after I didn't get a teaching job, and I wound up in tech (in a tech-adjacent role.) I was helped by the hiring manager who took a chance on me (7 years ago!) and I'd like to give back a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The offer:**  I've got bandwidth to help 3-4 people through one round of resume review, role/job search brainstorming, and cover letters. Total amount of time I can give each person is between 3 and 4 hours over the next month. I'd be most effective at helping folks from a humanities/qualitative social science background.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPriority to anyone who was a first-generation college student or who's been on the job market for more than 2 cycles, and who's open to moving to wherever in the country (or abroad) they can land a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit: changed a comma to an \"or\"\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd adding: this will be free of charge to you; what I'd love is for you to then (in whatever company/role you land) to advocate for their hiring people who came from academia.",

      "text": "Why made you decide to leave academia after not getting a teaching role? Instead of trying until you got one? Or some good reflection questions, to help one decide.\n\nI'm two and a bit years into a postdoc and can't decide if I want to try to stay or leave. I'm tired of working long hours when most people around me don't, getting comments on papers about my English yet I'm a native speaker and their comments are in poor English (yeah English average here but I'm not technical writing, so who cares), and being a female in engineering (which has been suggested why some of my work doesn't get considered at some journals), told I'm too direct (again probably because I'm female, seriously I'm not going to sing your praises for finally doing some experiments) and the really inconsistent feedback so you never know what to do. Then this could just be the place I'm working at. As I like to figure things out and have a challenge, partly why I work long hours as I enjoy it, but I find I get lumped with boring rubbish work too more and more where I am.\n\nEdit: stupid phone. Any insight would be great on how you came to the decision and things that are worth considering. Thank you!",

          "text": "It was probably mostly a timing thing. I filed in 2011, about 3 years after the academic job market tanked (if I'd taken less time to do my dissertation research and then written it up super-quickly, and ended up with a TT job _before_ 2008, my life would be very different than it is now.)\n\nI was offered a job teaching the big undergrad survey class in my department after I graduated. It paid less than $100 more a month than being a TA leading two sections of the class a week did, except the lecturer role didn't provide health insurance, required managing a handful of TAs, and was scoped as 30% time iirc, when I know it would have taken far more.\n\nThat, for me, was pretty much the moment when it sunk in that academia was selling a bill of goods that honor pays the bills. (Seriously: grad school colleagues told me it was an honor to have been selected and they were surprised when I didn't take the gig.)",
