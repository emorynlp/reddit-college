  "title:": "Can there be any consequences for using inappropriate nickname during \"competition\" during lecture?",
  "text": "During the lecture , lecturer had a 20-min competition for us to refresh our knowledge of the semester so far. We had to log-in to a web-app, use ref.code and choose a random nickname.\n\nI chose my nickname to be \"RollingWeed\", i got into leaderboard top 2 or top 3 i think, and on-screen monitor was showing top 10 people after each round.  The lecturer was pissed that there as this nickname, when everyone esle's was pretty normal nickname or something \" Mathias B.\".\n\nShe said she'll figure out who had this nickname and there will be consequences for that person.\n\nI am just thinking that there is nothing i did wrong, i mean yes , if i could go back in time i would use normal nickname, its just that its my nickname everywhere and i did not think twice before making it during the lecture..",

Theoretically, drug references could violate a student code of conduct/morality clause and jeopardize your standing at the university if you're at a super conservative/religious school, but that would be extreme/unlikely.\n\nThe biggest consequence is that you have killed your ability to use this person as a reference in the future. And if professors in your department are the type to agree with her that this was a gross display of immaturity, it could harm your reputation among other faculty as well. Or maybe no one will care.

I would say the right thing is to tell her it was you, apologize, and explain that you realized it was poor decision.\n\nBut... also I don't think she can realistically figure out it was you unless part of that login had something that could identify you. \n\nIt's up to you if you want to confess. I almost expect that the consequence would be points off an upcoming grade.",

It's bizarre for her to spend any effort at all playing detective on this.

I personally would not penalize a student for a joke like that, but something to keep in mind is that the consequences of being viewed as unprofessional, disruptive, or a \"goof\" in college often have nothing at all to do with the professor. \n\nOdds are extremely good that at some point in the not-too-distant future, some of your classmates will be in a position to influence whether you hear about, get a callback, or are hired for a job. The ones who are the most serious and professional in their education are, predictably, the ones most likely to go on to be in this position.\n\nImagine this scenario; in five years you are applying for a job that's a big step up from your current job. The division director (or whoever makes screening decisions) reads over your application, then strolls into the next office and says \"Hey Judy, didn't you graduate from Lijonardo233's program the same year? Do you know them?\"\n\nJudy says \"Oh, hahaha! Good old RollingWeed! Kind of a joker, but maybe they've gotten more serious since school\".\n\nYour application goes into the round file, you never get a call back, and you never know why.\n\nIt can 100% go the other way, too. I have received good job offers based on my college reputation of being a hard worker and easy to get along with. \n\nJust something to think about.",

If your school is a chill place, nothing much will come from that (ain't nobody have time for that). If things do blow up, say that you meant tumbling weed like the plant but confused tumbling with rolling, then got scared when saw that a) it could be taken as something offensive and b) that she did take offense to that. Reiterate that it was a stupid mistake, that you had no ill intent, that it was never your intention to cause any disturbance, especially given that you are on top of the material for that class, and that you apologize. \n\nThen actually learn the lesson. University is no longer high school and I find that the tolerance for inappropriate behavior is usually low. Same with idiotic email addresses.
