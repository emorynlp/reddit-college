The couple folks I've seen make this move found opportunities closer geographically to what was important to them -- family and setting, respectively. No committee knocks \"I'm close with my sister and it's important to be closer to my nephews\". (Then again, it stinks that \"I'd like to be closer to my ill parents\" may well be counted against one for a tenure-track position.)",

But if you're close to tenure I'd ride it out first-- this isn't a good time to be on the market in most fields and it will be easier to find a lateral transfer if you've already been tenured.\n\nNot all academic workplaces are unpleasant. I have my gripes but overall I have great colleagues and it would take a lot to get me to leave.",

My provost would just say \"congrats, enjoy the new job!\" if you tried to play another offer off her.",

A key piece of advice is to never bad-mouth your current position.  It just makes you look petty and hurts your chances at the next place. Nobody wants to hire a whiner.\n\nHaving said that, find a reference who will tell your story for you.  I had a senior colleague  write a letter for me that outlined all of the failings of our (now former) institution.  He said nice things about me and gave context for why someone would want to leave what, on paper, looked like a great job.\n\nTL;DR, do it, but be positive. let a colleague do your trash talking for you, if you must",
