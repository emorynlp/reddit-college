  "text": "I just finished undergrad in the U.S. and am starting a PhD program in the UK (first time living out of the country). My PI/adviser offered to meet for lunch once I arrive, and I don\u2019t know the first thing about any differences in cultural/academic etiquette in the UK, including what to wear, what to talk about, etc. that I should be aware of.\n\nI\u2019m feeling super nervous about this- Any tips/advice about what to talk about would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Things in the UK are substantially less formal than in the US. Dress codes aren't really a thing,  and most academics will happily rock up to work in a t-shirt. For first meeting maybe err on the side of smart casual, but I've never seen anyone get judgy about these things. Generally the shabbier the clothing the more senior an academic you're dealing with. The only people in suits and jackets are those with senior management roles where they ahve to meet with administrative staff and outside orgs.\n\nStudent-staff relations are on first name terms from the beginning of undergrad. \n\nDon't use the term \"professor\" unless they are an actual chaired professor. The academic title Dr is used when you want to be formal with someone you've not met or interacted with before (assuming they have a PhD - not *always* the case, as in some fields years of industry experience is enough to get into a lectureship - or at least it was in the past). Presumably you've exchanged emails, they are signing off with their first name, and that is how you should approach your first face to face meeting.\n\nThe conversation will vary depending on what has already been discussed, and the individual. For me that first meeting is all about getting to know each other a little better, and establishing a plan for what's going to happen over the first few weeks. An opportunnity for you to ask any questions about both the project, and the mechanics of the university and town you are moving to. Can they recommend any good bars / coffee shops? Is there any place to do thing X that you like doing, etc.\n\nIn the UK the baseline assumption with PhD projects is that students will need reasonably strong guidance in year 1, but by the end of year 1 they should have a strong grasp of their project and be capable of making the main project decisions themselves into year 2 and beyond. You will be expected to be drawing the project to a close by the end of year 3, so there is a rigorous pacing to things. You should absolutely discuss your project decisions with your supervisors, and listen to their advice,  but the PhD is training in how to run and manage a research project. Different supervisors will provide different amounts of oversight and supervision - that is a conversation worth having. How regularly do they tend to meet with their existing/previous students? The first task is almost always a lit review on the subject, usually due about 3 months after starting. see if that's the expectation here. If you want to start talking technical detail you could probably chat about what the scope of that review should be - what are the boundaries?",

              "text": "Totally agree with the above advice. Taking a student to lunch is pretty friendly but not unheard of. Academics pretty much all go by their first name in the UK but you can call them Dr (or Professor if they have a chair) if you feel more comfortable in the first meeting.\n\nIn addition to asking about supervision, you can also ask about how many people there are in the lab, what funding the lab is planning to apply for in the next year, whether students get to go to conferences, whether students are allowed to do additional activities like public engagement (if you're interested) and whether the team has lab meeting and what format it's in. I probably wouldn't ask all of that but depending on the direction of conversation those are some good topics. I imagine they may want to talk science with you as well, so you might be wise to have a notepad and pen in your bag just in case they go full project on you - then you can at least get some notes rather than a full on panic of trying to remember what they're saying. Hopefully they'll be more social than that though!",
