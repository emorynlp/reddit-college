  "text": "EDITED to include update on progress and links (see below).\n\nHi all,\n\nI hope this is OK to post.\n\nI am doing my PhD in evolutionary psychology and have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. It has made everything make SO MUCH MORE SENSE. It explains how even the tiniest normal life tasks feel so difficult, but I can still somehow manage to get accepted onto a PhD. I feel like an idiot all the time, probably because my only references are neurotypical people living in a system built for them.\n\nI want to find my people, and I want to do the same for others who are feeling as alienated as I do.\n\nI have made a discord server for neurodivergent academics in the UK, because I think it is quite a unique experience in terms of being so differently wired and trying to exist, let alone flourish, within the structure/expectations of UK academia.\n\nIf you're interested, the link is here: [https://discord.gg/69uennSq](https://discord.gg/69uennSq)\n\nTo clarify, I don't care about diagnoses. If you feel like you struggle with feeling like you're just 'wired differently' then that's good enough for me. Whether you think you have ADHD, ASD, plain ol' executive dysfunction related to other things, or something else... if you think this is probably your people, it probably is.\n\nI look forward to meeting you.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDITED: 27/02/21\n\nHello all,\n\nI have JUST seen all of these posts!!!!!! I am very sorry, I am not a regular reddit user! I will admit that although there was an influx when I first advertised it, with me being a discord noob, and of course, having ADHD, I don't think that I am facilitating its use sufficiently, so it hasn't really taken off at all. I am posting an updated link. I am happy for people to volunteer to join like a moderating team so we can share responsibilities to some degree. It would be particularly great if we could get some more diversity on board.\n\nUpdated link: [https://discord.gg/GFeczVAAPq](https://discord.gg/GFeczVAAPq)\n\nServer name: UK Neurodivergent Academics",

He explains that it's a *performance* disorder and so interventions need to be *at the point of performance*. Teaching skills doesn't work, because we already know the skills. It's *using* them that's the problem. So he says what you need is more deadlines, more accountability, more structure. You need tasks broken into tiny pieces and use timers as a deadline to work towards.\n\nedit. I forgot to add: give yourself instant rewards. They can't be delayed, they have to be *now*. I haven't got a good idea of how to do this to be honest.",

Timers are essential for me getting stuff done/not letting myself get (too) distracted. I'll set alarms and give myself set amounts of time to do a task. Like if I'm taking notes on an article, I'll set a timer for five minutes and write it all up within that time frame and then move on. Or when I read, I'll break it into pieces and set timers for each section. \n\nSometimes just setting multiple timers while I'm doing a \"long\" task is helpful because it reminds me to keep working (also it makes it easy for me to \"gamify\"). Plus, it's easy to build in little \"mini-breaks\" for me to \"decompress\" that way.",

Sometimes, I just use it to have some thing that keeps reminding me that I'm supposed to be doing something.\n\n-you might see how long it takes you to actively read a page (like without getting distracted). Use this as a guide. So if it takes you 1 minute per page, and you have an article that 35 pages. I'd probably set a timer for 7 minutes and try to read 7 pages in that time (which I probably won't but that's okay). I immediately hit repeat timer, and keep going. The timer is really just there as an external pressure.\n\nSo also, sometimes if I need to write, I'll just make up goals as I go. Like \"Can I write five really good sentences in ten minutes?\" Then I try to do that. Again, I don't measure my success by if I was actually able to do that, but if I was able to keep myself on task with minimal distraction. I'll basically just repeat that 3-4 times and take a ten minute break.\n\nIt's also important to set different levels of expectations and goals. If I set goals too high, then I just feel overwhelmed and can't focus, or I'll get really frustrated. Also, this is kind why I don't think giving double time is helpful for this work. Doubling my time just gives me more time to get distracted. I've found that shortening my time frames helps me avoid distraction the most because I don't give myself any slack time to do it.  \n\nFYI, I wrote all this with timer going because this is one of my writing breaks. I went over, but it's okay because it's just a guide for your time. Hope this helps even a little. Good luck and godspeed! :)",

              "text": "The biggest thing for me is to always try to do something, even if it's small and menial, and to make small motivation loops.\n\nWhen I was writing my dissertation and my brain sometimes felt like a deflated balloon, I would say just do SOMETHING. So I'd format citations, or organize the really menial stuff when my brain was overwhelmed. Good music helps a lot to get through that sort of task.\n\nSo for example, I might not want to tackle that big overwhelming project, so I'll answer a few emails, and then wash dishes or something. Then maybe lift some weights. Then go back to my email. Try to answer them all, and when my brain feels \"ready\", then I'll turn on a pomodoro timer, and say, ok, just grade for 15 minutes. By then hyperfocus usually kicks in and I can keep rolling. \n\nOn days when it's harder to keep myself at my desk, I'll do things like paint my nails and answer emails between coats. It forces me to stay at my desk when I don't want to. Another thing I do with emails sometimes is use diction on my ipad. I can get through more that way.\n\nAs long as I'm doing something, it can help with a positive feedback loop.",

They thought that I was being that way on purpose, and I kept explaining that my memory just kind of wipes stuff away sometimes and gets overwhelmed. It was definitely a process and I got really depressed realizing that I had this condition. I read everything I could and I really felt awful about myself having gone my whole life like this without ever knowing it wasn't normal. I kept thinking, what could I have accomplished if I had proper treatment/awareness? I went through a major self-loathing funk about it and was resentful nobody noticed for my whole life.\n\nI ended up forcing myself to a psychiatrist for their opinion and explained to her what was going on. She gave me an assessment, I was off the charts, and was given an rx immediately for adderall. The first time I took it, I had euphoria and was very emotional experiencing what a properly functioning brain felt like. I still tear up thinking about it. I have a love hate relationship with the drug, and sometimes the side effects are a bit jarring and I take breaks. If you're in the UK though I'm aware they don't prescribe adderall, but there are five other stimulants available that work similarly.\n\nI didn't get any pushback at all. I think being mid 30s without any history of controlled substance use helps in terms of the drug seeking thing. Don't worry too much about that. If you need medication, you need it. It's made such a difference for me overall. It's not a silver bullet though. The meds are like a fire hose - depending on where you put your attention is where you'll focus. I've definitely lost days totally focused and absorbed in things that weren't a priority.",

Would you be able to send another or tell me the servers name so I can join? \n\nI have yet to be officially diagnosed with ASD, but am very confident that I am neurodivergent. A lifetime of comments referring to me as 'odd', 'strange' and 'eccentric' have cemented my conclusions. I am therefore currently seeking a diagnosis but unless I want to fork out over 2k I will have to wait a good long while yet.    \n\nWhilst I have taken pride in being a bit different from the norm, the alienation I have felt has seriously taken its toll. This was especially felt during my undergrad and postgrad years. I was never able to develop any long term and especially close friendships or connections with other students. Even with those who I share common interests with. As much as I hate to say it, I have felt alone sometimes and have found myself worrying about things simply because I don't know how 'normal' students deal with them. \n\nUnfortunately, the ASD groups I have joined on FB have let me down a little bit. There are very few people on there who have done, are doing, or are looking into doing a PhD and going on into academia. They are therefore not really that helpful in offering support or advise relevant to myself. I am therefore very excited to see a group such as this. \n\nI hope to joint the community!",
