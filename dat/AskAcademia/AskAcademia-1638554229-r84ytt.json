  "title:": "Hearing back after TT Zoom interview?",
  "text": "I was recently invited to a zoom interview for a TT position. I was then told I would hear back in 7 days if I was recommended for a full interview. On day 10 - I sent a polite inquiry if there was any movement to which I have heard no response (this is day 14). I am planning not to bother the committee anymore. \n\nFor those of you in search committees - what might this radio silence mean? I assume this is a reject but they don't want to let me know in case they have to dip back into the pool due to a failed search (for reference this is STEM Mechanical Engineering).\n\nBeing ghosted is not fun :(",

      "text": "I went through this last year (genomics), sorry for the extra stress it is causing you. Some universities have rules that the committee can't tell you no until someone has accepted (like what you described), sometimes it is taking a long time to get approval from chair/dean for invites, especially at this point in semester. After a few years on the market I just assumed I was rejected from everywhere even after interviews until I heard back, I know that seems bleak but it can help keep you from obsessing over it when sometimes the waits between contact can be 4-6 weeks.",

I really wanted to reach out to them, but not enough to piss off the dean.",

HR could ask (and likely will) on statistics who was interviewed and may ask why some candidates were not invited. If the equity review is passed, then fly out invites are sent. Sometimes this goes quickly, sometimes not. You can\u2019t tell people they didn\u2019t make the fly out list until you have your list and alternates. Then if you are flying out three with two alternates, you might say \u201cno\u201d to the bottom 10\u2026or not if you fear a failed search. \n\nKeep working, focus on doing your research, and the process will play out. Nothing is final until there is a signed contract and even then sometimes not.",

However, if a candidate asks us, we will say we are still in the hiring process and will update them when we have an update. We wouldn't ever just \"ghost\" the candidate.\n\nAs far as what it means, it could mean anything.\n\n>I assume this is a reject but they don't want to let me know in case   \nthey have to dip back into the pool due to a failed search (for   \nreference this is STEM Mechanical Engineering).\n\nThis is a plausible explanation. Nobody is actually eliminated until the position is filled-- if we can't make a hire from among the finalists we can go back to the pool.\n\nOn the other hand, another possible explanation is that the process has been delayed (this happens all the time at universities) and the list of finalists hasn't been, well, finalized. For example, our list has to be \"blessed\" (not a technical term) by several different people in the dean's office and the diversity office, before candidates can be informed. That takes time. Not to mention, if the diversity office decides the list lacks sufficient diversity, they could ask the search committee to reconsider the list, which takes even more time (after which we have to do the approvals all over again).",
