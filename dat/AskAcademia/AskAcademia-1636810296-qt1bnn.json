In this case, the probability of being a first author for some papers might be close to zero since you don't assume a lead/head role in the research. Will you be at risk of losing your position if all you can maintain are just co authorships and not first authorship?",

If I\u2019m on a hiring committee looking at someone\u2019s cv and I see a first author pub, I\u2019d expect they did the most work. Where it can become unethical is some professors will do the most work but put their grad student first just so that student has more first author pubs and can get a job\u2026 even though they didn\u2019t deserve that position according to our norms. Now it\u2019s not so unethical as to warrant formal consequences, but it\u2019s a no-no in my field. Once a professor becomes known for doing that, people will look at their students work less favorably because we assume they didn\u2019t really do much work. \n\nSo if first and last author are most important in your field, the equivalent would be if someone who didn\u2019t do much got one of those positions just to make their CV look better.

In other places you have X years funding and unless another job comes up, either at the same grade or higher which you'll apply for, then you're out. \n\nI work at a research institute rather than a university and no one here is \"tenured\". Our junior role is 6 years and you're out unless a middle role opens up and you successfully apply. Our middle and senior roles are reviewed every 5 years although there's no limit on how long people can stay. Other institutes we work with have limits on how many senior staff they have or limits on how long you can work there, as examples.",

If you don\u2019t have guidelines, it\u2019s time to make them. \n\nMy university has general guidelines, and each department in the college has their own specific guidelines for what counts for what. We need department level standards because the fields are so different. Some departments value more creative output such as musical performances, some value publishing books, others scientific papers in peer reviewed journals.\n\nMy departments guidelines were clear as mud and it caused a lot of problems. I created a committee to rewrite them. We agreed on a points system that considers author rank, and got the new guidelines and mentoring plan approved. Works great now! Maybe have a good look at your departments guidelines, and if they don\u2019t exist then create them.\n\nOne other thing to consider is how to get first-author pubs from research projects on which you collaborate. I collaborate a lot and I am second or third authors on papers with those PIs. But I also often use the data to make my own first-author pub that focus on methodology, using data from various projects as case studies to illustrate the advancement in methods. Maybe you can do something like that.\n\nGood luck",
