  "text": "My former grad school has an opening for a new phd position (it\u2019s a pretty niche field). I thought about going into academia before even starting my masters. I finished in 2020 with a 3.9 GPA and high recommendations from my advisor and professors. \n\nI want to apply, but the main thing casting doubt in my mind is I don\u2019t have any completed research experience. I\u2019m currently doing a study with my director at my institute now, but I won\u2019t know if my thesis will be accepted to present at a conference for a couple more months. \n\nIs it naive to apply anyway? Should I wait until I have more experience under my belt? I\u2019m afraid of applying before being ready and looking daft. PhD is in speech and hearing sciences, btw.",

I was lucky to get a research assistant job between Masters and PhD. And I sold that research experience on my application despite the research I was doing being very preliminary and no paper has even been written based on that work.\nIf you have completed projects from your undergrad or masters you can use those too to show your research strengths.\nGood luck.",

It turns out, it's a factor of: character, recommendation, if you know someone already inside (I hate this, thought nepotism would tbe a factor but it's a strong one) and your abilities. I've never heard anyone refer to an applicants publication history.",

      "text": "S&HS? Just mention Bekesy and Helmholtz in your interviews and you'll be fine. Actually given your username you'd better cite Ken Stevens and/or Dennis Klatt. /s\n\nBtw, it's not as niche of a field as you might think. You're dealing with the entirety of human communication, so you can study anything from how concepts in our brains eventually turn into the vibrations of air molecules to how vibrations of air molecules eventually turn into concepts in someone else's brain. To really understand this process you need to know engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, psychology, medicine, and probably a bunch of fields I'm forgetting. If you develop expertise in any of those fields, much less more than one, you'll be well-positioned to prosper in a variety of fields.\n\nOne of my motivations for going into industry was attending a conference and realizing that there were fewer than 100 people in the entire world who cared about what I was doing, and I knew each of them on a first-name basis. It wasn't until I discovered the world outside my specialty that I realized how valuable my skills really were. \n\nGo ahead and apply! Having research experience is a plus, but having a reason for wanting to do research in that area is more important. In my experience having people who care about what they're doing is far more important than having people who already know how to do it well.",

I have a speech and hearing science bachelors and initially wanted to be an SLP who specialized in voice disorders. \n\nI went a different path and got a masters in deaf education. I feel its so niche because I\u2019m specialized in listening and spoken language (whereas the field can split into ASL, Total Communication, etc). I work with kids who have cochlear implants or other assistive hearing technology. That said, I do know that research in this area can be beneficial to more than just children who are deaf.",
