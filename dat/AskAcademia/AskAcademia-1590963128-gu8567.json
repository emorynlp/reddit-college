  "title:": "My boss wants me to start my postdoc without pay",
  "text": "I know this pandemic is a weird time, but there's somethings that's hitting a little weird about my situation. I just graduated my PhD, and my boss has me starting a postdoc after. The problem is the HR arm of the university is stalling applications, so it's going to be about a month before my new contract begins, and a little longer before I get paid.\n\nMy boss wants me to continue to do the weekly meetings, and several pop up meetings a week. All of this would be without pay until my contract begins. I've raised the possibility of an independent contractor position as a holdover, but that hasn't happened. \n\nSo I'm not sure what to do. I don't want my boss to jettison my new contract because I don't want to work in the meantime without pay, but also I don't want to work a lot without pay. My lab is the type to not really be concerned about people working without compensation for short periods, and I don't want the work to pile on just because I agree to a few meetings. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight about how I should handle this? Should I just bite the bullet and do the hours?",

We all know the universities won\u2019t touch their endowments. That\u2019s the last thing they will do. Plus their endowment is tied to the stock market which is also in shambles.\n\n2. HR can offer OP the option to work and volunteer and access to all the resources on campus (library, cafeteria, student discounts, ID, and building access) but it would be on pro bono or volunteer basis while they sort out the funding questions. This is what OP is debating right now.\n\n3. Lastly HR can drop OP. Plain and simple. It would suck but that\u2019s what any uni can do if they can\u2019t pay OP and OP doesn\u2019t want to volunteer or work for free. \n\nIt\u2019s such a bad position to be in.

In mine, each school has an HR officer in the dean's office who is the first line of institutional approval of these things. They tend to be extremely by-the-book, because they care about how they look to central HR. And central HR doesn't want to deal with school-level problems, because they have plenty else to do. In my dept's case, OP would go to the administrative officer (the dept's senior admin staffer) with their concerns. The A.O. is rewarded for going by the book, so they look for backup from the dean's HR officer, who in turn enforces the policy. In fact that's what everybody relies on that person for: to be the person everyone blames for not getting the questionable thing they want, instead of the heat falling on the employee, A.O., or dean.\n\nSo generally, yes, HR doesn't care to protect employees over their institution. But if there's an intermediary who HR can fire because they didn't stop wage theft, that's where there's some leverage.\n\nIf this reflects the structure of OP's school, OP could strategically tell the prof \"I'll consider this arrangement, but I'd be more comfortable if A.O. says it's okay. You know, just cc me when you ask.\" That said, it doesn't address OP's concern that the prof might just say \"Fine, come back next month.\"",

If this one month of work accelerates a project / publication, that's a good addition to your resume. I'm assuming this will impact your future job positions, as you may be applying for assistant professor jobs in the future. That is if you have nothing better to do in these few months. \n\nOr you could just ask for an \"unpaid vacation\" lol.",

A post-doc is not a normal employment situation: Post-docs stand in direct competition for a limited number of faculty jobs; so any decisions during the post-doc phase should be targeted at maximizing one's own career perspectives, instead of maximizing money-per-worked-hours. \n\nOf course, taking some time off (\"unpaid vacation\") can sometimes be beneficial to restore one's sanity.",

In academia you aren't really thought of as a worker.  Instead you are sort of an independent researcher who is in the lab because the research you want to perform lines up well with their goals and resources.  So, you don't really work for them, but rather with them.  The money is there so you don't starve to death.  From that perspective, I'd say that if you want to complete your research and can afford a month without pay, then go for it.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like universities often exploit grad. students, and postdocs.  You shouldn't need to starve yourself for the \"privilege\" of doing research at their institution.\n\nMaybe there's some sort of middle road? Like if you aren't getting paid anyways, maybe you could take the time off from the lab and focus on your research by yourself?  Or, if there's department responsibilities that you'd be expected to perform, then don't do them since you aren't getting paid by the department?",

There are reports due in June, for example, and course prep for fall. Not to mention research, which basically nobody can do much of while teaching full time and mentoring significant numbers of students. So while nobody would say \"Hey, Bob doesn't seem to work in the summer, let's deny him tenure!\" in my 20+ years I've never known anyone who earned tenure who *wasn't* doing unpaid work in the summers...it's simply not possible.\n\nI know it's different in R1s where people are on longer contracts, in places/fields where grant funding is common, and in places where a 3/3 teaching load isn't also paired with an \"expectation\" that you are also actively mentoring undergraduates and doing mountains of other service work. And of course there are also places where faculty do little/no research, don't mentor anyone, and aren't asked to develop new courses regularly.  But places like mine are not rare either, and a large percentage of my faculty friends around the US are in similar situations where simply refusing to do unpaid work is not going to be a viable strategy, at least pre-tenure.",

That's a bit on the high side as I'm a department chair, but anyone who isn't actively mentoring students is going to get called out (first by students, then by colleagues).

We have a great staff of professional advisors (all with counseling degrees) but faculty each have 25-30 direct advisees as well. (I have more, as chair, because I get the problem students.) But mentoring is more than advising; I spend a lot of time with my students talking about career plans, helping them network, discussing their intellectual development, etc. etc. in addition to their course work. Some are more needy than other of course; probably 50% of my mentoring time is spent working with seniors on thesis projects or grad school apps or the like. Some of this is formal (assigned advisees) and some is not-- most of us are in our office with the door open any time we're not in class/lab during working hours and students come by with all sorts of things on their minds.\n\nClass wise things are different for us too. The last time I'd counted I had taught ~25 different courses in three different departments/programs here, so I while I have a stable of courses that do repeat I almost never go a year without developing at least one new course or taking on a new topic for an existing thematic seminar.  Add to that the fact that we pretty much don't lecture...my 90 minute class periods are perhaps 20-30 minutes lecture at most. Nobody would get tenure here without demonstrating active learning pedagogies in all of their classes, so it's rare to have someone repeat the same courses or mostly lecture for a class.\n\nResearch is pretty individual-- I'm a historian so usually my summers are spent in archives or writing. We're not into collaboration, so other than a few undergraduate research assistants in the occasional summer it's all on me. My last book took about six years as a result.\n\nThanks for the info-- I'm always interested to hear how things are at other types of institutions.",

There are 4,500 colleges/universities in the US and there are dramatic differences between them, though they tend to cluster. I ended up doing four degrees, on both coasts and in between, public and private, large and small schools. Then taught in three places before taking my current position in the 90s. Have learned a lot more from talking with colleagues and visiting other campuses though, including some work as a consultant doing programs reviews (which gets you the inside scoop).  While we are all \"faculty\" and even the ranks carry the same names in most places, the actual work routines are strikingly different, as much so as the missions of the schools.  \n\nI spent a summer some years back at an NEH institute that was basically 40 historians living together for three months doing intensive seminar work half the day and archival work the other half. We all lived on campus so spent evenings sitting around bullshitting. There were people from places as diverse as a community college in Virginia, Harvard, some public flagships, a few SLAC types like me, some state comprehensives, an HBCU, and a tribal college. Though we were all professors-- and mostly tenured --our professional lives were radically different. About half way through I decided the grass was certainly not greener in most places...I had no interest in the pressure of Harvard (had that as a grad student) or the struggle for resources of a community college or the bureaucracy of a public comprehensive. For me the work live at a private SLAC is about as good as it's going to get-- but many of my friends in that summer program admitted that would have *hated* working in a place like mine where 90% of our professional time is spent with students or working on student issues. The only ones who didn't feel that way tended to be the CC faculty, and they mostly felt they'd prefer to serve the populations they were used to rather than the ones who could afford to attend a $$$ private college. Though over the weeks I got them to realize that a really substantial chunk of our students are coming from the same socio-economic backgrounds as many of theirs.",

When their new one starts, they will get paid for all the hours in between that they've worked.\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree with this process but it's so comon here that most students get scoffed at when they challenge it (even in the politest of ways).\n\nIf you know of any senior postdocs or other students, it might be worth it to ask if this is common or not. \n\nI also agree with the other commentors and tell your boss that you need to be paid for living expenses",
