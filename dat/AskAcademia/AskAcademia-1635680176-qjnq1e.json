      "text": "There are many things of course and everyone\u2019s experience will be different. I will just list below some of my own experiences.\n\nPersonally, I suffered from the great power imbalance between supervisor and student. Our PI would just berate us in front of the whole group if he thought we didn\u2019t do something well enough and there was not much one could do about this. Several other PIs saw how he behaved towards us and said nothing. I even complained to my second advisor who then offered to sit in for all our meetings together with my PI. This helped me a lot but it is not a proper fix. Personally I think my PI has too many personality issues to be allowed to supervise students. Universities in my experience won\u2019t fire such people and you also can\u2019t really afford to fight back because you will need professional references later on (I really hate this reference system).\n\nIn my field (computer vision) there is a lot of hype following, many people tend to jump on the bandwagon of the latest thing that is in fashion at the moment. There is also a sense of arrogance around this and people will look down on you if you are working on methods that are perceived as more classical or not choosing to implement the latest hyped method (which may even be very computationally expensive or not that much better performance-wise to what already exists).\n\nI also felt that I had to oversell my results and I couldn\u2019t be too honest about the limitations of my methodological contributions. This is because we are essentially expected to publish papers and in order to get a paper accepted by a reviewer I felt like I had to hide certain faults of the method. I feel this is a general problem of my field, most methods when replicated by others perform much much worse compared to what the paper stated. \n\nThe work-life balance can be pretty bad if you don\u2019t keep it in check and this is because there is basically no end to what you could achieve. You could always publish more, do more outreach, etc, so you have to be careful with how much work you sign up for.\n\nThe work itself can be pretty isolating as you tend to specialise in something very niche. After a point, nobody in the lab will be able to help you with the technical stuff, including your PI. This can be pretty dangerous if you happen to get stuck in a technical issue. Personally I would drop a project if I couldn\u2019t make progress after 3-4 months at most of getting stuck with it. This is because I would start to feel bad about my progress, which in turn would make me not want to work on it, which then would make me feel bad again. I would get into this weird psychological cycle and for me the most effective thing would be to just cut my losses and drop the project after a certain amount of time of being stuck with it.\n\nFinally, the issue that made me give up and leave for industry is that I felt like I had to squabble for credit a lot. I would have hoped to find a lab where I could collaborate on projects on equal footing with my colleagues. I never got to experience this, in all labs there was someone who wanted to put themselves above the rest and would try to take credit for other people\u2019s work. I felt like I constantly had to look over my shoulder to not get excluded from papers or projects that I worked on, which in the end became too much of a mental effort for me and I decided it was not worth it. \n\nI hope this all doesn\u2019t sound too daunting, I also wanted to say that I did get a lot out of the experience too: I got to work with highly specialised equipment that otherwise I would never get access to, I got to travel internationally for conferences and I also made many close friends, as most of your colleagues will be in a similar age group and life stage as you, so you easily bond over this experience. So I wish you all the best in your journey!",

All things I can definitely \\_not\\_ say about people I have worked with in industry.  \n\\- I very rarely have to deal with annoying management people telling me to do stuff because of hype/cost/efficiency/their ego.  \n\\- There is actually a sense of purpose, yes. We work on a relevant topic and try to further the knowledge in that field by collaborating with clever people.  \n\\- Working hours are \\_extremely\\_ flexible, which is a huge plus for me as someone with chronic health issues. If I have a bad day, I can turn up at work at 11am or leave really early, no questions asked.  \n\\- On the other hand, yes, people tend to work very long hours. But TBH that is up to personal organization. I had to learn the hard way that it is possible to be a (reasonably successful) PhD student without working long over-hours.  \n\n\nOf course this is a more rosy outlook on academia, and there are definitely negatives. But especially since you mentioned being anxious about the work environment, I thought it important to provide a positive counterpoint. I've been in academia for 6.5 years now, and I still enjoy it. TBH, \"work environment\" has actually been a huge plus for academia in my personal experience.",

A young biomedical PhD working in industry takes home a salary ([~$48K/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf) ) that is less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr ). Older biomedical PhDs make slightly more than college graduates: the median salary for all biology PhDs working in the private sector is $67-77,000/yr (female-male). The comparable figure for someone with a bachelors is $52-$78,000. Keep in mind two caveats: 1) the bachelors-only had a head start making money while the PhD was in school / post-doc, and 2) we only have data from middle aged biomedical PhDs who came up in a market where those degrees were rare. For people like me (<40 yrs old), there has been record high production of PhDs, so we can expect the market value to decline. A biomedical PhD can expect to make about the same as your typical bachelors degree holder.\n\nsources: Biomedical PhD median salary $77K/yr https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab48.htm\n\n31 yr old bachelors median salary $78K/yr https://www.sentierresearch.com/StatBriefs/Sentier_Income_Trends_WorkingClassWages_1996to2014_Brief_10_05_16.pdf",

At least as far as the PhD experience is concerned, there is a _lot_ of extremely hard negativity from a relatively small number of grad students. According to many highly-amplified voices on this sub (and IRL), if you do a PhD then you will spent the next 4+ years of your life in hell, working 80 hours per week and being continuously exploited by psychopathic PIs. Of course there are some very unfortuante students who find themselves in this position but this is _not_ the norm - most PhD students I know are stressed but content with their position. The most negative voices around PhD positions shout the loudest, and it's no wonder that people like OP are asking about this if that's what they're hearing. \n\nI think the main thing to be learned here is that your choice of supervisor is probably the single most important thing when deciding on a PhD, since they can make or break your PhD (and academic career). The mistake that so many prospective PhD students make is only thinking about the project and not realising the importance of making sure that their supervisor is a good person.",

Although it does, I think, tie in to the main point of being aware if you, say, have an informational handicap - it's possible for a student not to know who's going to be a good supervisor, and what \"good\" looks like, *even if* they're aware that it makes such an important difference in the first place.",

In school, the students that have these sorts of questions tend to fare the poorest in terms of outcomes and happiness. The ones that intuitively know all the right questions to ask and know exactly what they signed up for (usually their parents are academics) tend to do well. The seem to have an intuitive notion of the workings (hidden curriculum) of academia and are able to exploit its mechanisms accordingly. They also understand the traps that are set for students less well-versed e.g. falling for bad mentors that have interesting work, failing to network appropriately, not understanding the incentive structures in academia, not publishing early and often etc.\n\nI also took OPs question to be one about academia in general rather than specifically a PhD; can the two even be separated?",

      "text": "Not everyone is cut out for PhD. level graduate work, especially in STEM fields. Those that are not, typically flounder for an extended period of time before things reach a breaking point, and then rarely if ever exit gracefully. In my experience a lot of the horrible things I have heard about in academia come from people who were never going to exceed in this environment to begin with. \n\nRight or wrong, the reality is academia is crazy competitive. It's not enough to be smart, most people in your field will be well above average in that regard. You have to have a very strong work ethic and be willing to put in crazy long hours of actual work (not to be confused with the time you spend on campus or at your computer). To maintain this work rate long term, the science you do needs to be what energizes you. If you need an extended holiday to recover after hitting a deadline for a manuscript or after running an intensive experiment, you're either not going to be happy or not going to be successful. Successful academics who talk about \"work life balance\" are either incredibly lucky or full of shit, and I would assume the latter.\n\nYou have to be creative enough to come up with new ideas, and focused enough to see them through to the end. There are often existing protocols that meet 80% of your requirements but you have to be able to read between the lines and fill in the blanks. If you can't function with a degree of uncertainty and need cook book like instructions for everything you do, you're going to be perpetually frustrated. There are people who will help you, but if your going to get a PhD you can't expect someone to hold your hand throughout the majority of the process. \n\nSome amount of failure is fundamental required to do good Science. If everything is working the way you want you are either missing some critical detail or not pushing the envelope enough.  If you make a mistake, you need to be ready to get your ass back in the lab and do it again. If things go in an unexpected direction you need to be flexible enough to make lemonade. But if everything is going wrong for you all the time, the simplist explanation may be that you are not very good at what you're doing. There is for instance a certain attention to detail, foresight, and eye hand coordination required to complete complex assays, some of this can be learned, some of it cannot. \n\nIn short, \"Toxic Labs\" exist but are far less common than reddit, or other sources, would lead you to believe. A lot of the negativity comes from people who are simply not well suited to academia or science in general.",

          "text": "I would like respectfully to disagree fairly fundamentally and offer OP and alternative perspective.\n\n(1) Successfully completing a PhD is not essentially about being either \"cut out for it\" or not. A PhD is a degree of education\u2013it's a qualification more similar to earning a driver's licence than to qualifying for the Olympic 100 m dash, where certain (bodily) composition is essential for success. Put it extremely crudely, most of us don't have Usain Bolt's makeup and are not cut out for Olympic sprint competitions, but most of us have the capacity to learn to drive a car.\n\n(2) It is disingenuous to claim that the horrible stories you hear about academia are simply the result of disgruntled people who just didn't have it in them to succeed in academia. See point (1) about the notion about any essential ability required for success, and add the following: just like any area of modern industrialised societies (a frame of reference available to me, I do not speak for other kinds), academia is rife with bias, discrimination, structural injustice, and other human failings. Failing to succeed in academia can absolutely be about the environment failing the individual, and not the individual failing in the environment. (See here also my other comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/qjnq1e/comment/hirfhsn/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/qjnq1e/comment/hirfhsn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n\n(3) Academia \\*is\\* crazy competitive *and* it is not so out of any necessity. The unhealthy competitiveness is part of the toxicity of the environment that countless academics are fighting against in the name of better research and science. In this they are right.\n\n(4) Requiring time to recuperate after a prolonged period of stress is absolutely not a quality that disqualifies you from succeeding in academia in general and even less from succeeding in executing a PhD. Academia is not life, nor should life be academia: academia (or a PhD project) is a job. You can and will succeed if you take care of yourself and those around you.\n\n(5) Dealing with uncertainty is a skill that is absolutely helpful\u2013in academia and beyond. \\*And\\* the point of having a PhD supervisor and peers in your programme is that there is someone whose job it is literally to guide you, support you, direct you, and yes, even hold your hand some of the time. This is not the realised experience of some (many) doctoral candidates and that sucks (point (3) is here relevant) but it doesn't mean it shouldn't or couldn't be.\n\n(6) If everything is going wrong for you all the time while carrying out your PhD research, there are a multitude of reasons that could account for that. Reducing you and your situation to some mystical, innate \"PhD capacity\" is reductionist, simplistically individualist, and ultimately unhelpful. See point (2) about different factors that could contribute to your experience.\n\nIn short, there are no people who are \"simply not well suited to academia or science in general\". Science is a human project that benefits from the participation of a diverse set of people and institutions. Academia does not hold monopoly on science and there is no essential quality that makes one well or ill suited to either.\n\nOP: you are wise to seek advice on what negatives to be aware of when considering entering into a PhD programme. Be as wise in recognising the subjective nature of every piece of advice (including mine) you receive.",

Everyone can get a driver's license but not everyone can be a stunt car driver. Deep sea diving is also a qualification, but requires a person be comfortable with certain factors and to suggest someone who struggled learning to swim would be successful in pursuing this far more advanced qualification is silly.\n\n2) not all stories you hear are the result of a personal failing but its a hard thing to learn you're not cut out for something and people often look to blame others or \"The system\".  As with personal relationships, if every lab, department or school you work in is toxic,  you might just be the common denominator. \n\n3) Academia doesn't need to be crazy competitive, but is because there are far more PhD students than there are positions for. You can rail against this all you want but it is the past, current and likely future reality. \n\n4) Should people work 65 hrs a week, no, but some people both can and will do so. The people who can do this, without negative effects to their mental health or personal relationships, are something akin to Bolt or Phelps and will be more successfull.  They will publish more, win more scholarships and get more grants and as a result be more competitive when jobs do open.  All too often I have heard other people chalk this success up to Luck or Connections, but this is equally dissengenuous. \n\n5) there are people who both can and should help you, but unlike a masters student, a PhD is expected to become an independent researcher. This requires a certain comfort level that is not universal and while it can be learned those that learn it sooner are less likely to be found complaining about the lack of support. \n\n6) similar to response 2,  there may be other factors but a good Scientist will explore explanations which may be uncomfortable to them. Like the tone deaf people who used to audition for American idol, if you keep running into problems, a bit of honest self reflection might behoove you.",

Academia certainly has negative aspects, but there are a lot of positives as well.\nI think your success is mostly about your mindset going into it. If you are trying to decide whether to do a PhD or not, you should ask yourself whether you are willing to spend the next 4-5 years working your ass off on the same project, despite the mental rollercoaster that is grad studies. You have to be able to handle the extreme lows and highs, and still be excited about your work at the end of it all.

You have great intellectual freedom, you get paid for thinking about and working on exciting and fun stuff, you collaborate with incredibly intelligent people, you actually work on cutting-edge problems.

I have also collaborated with lots of great human beings.\n\nToxicity exists everywhere, but I personally don't feel like it's more prevalent in academia than in other places.\n\nOne thing I'd like to push back on is work-life balance: while you may not become the world's foremost expert on your topic that way, it definitely is possible to work as a successful mid-level researcher in academia and have a healthy work-life balance.

This flexibility allows for faculty to take advantage of students (whether they are aware of it or not), and so it is extremely important that you know your worth and stand up for yourself. Also, there are so many underlying \"rules\" that are present throughout academic institutions that are largely falsely constructed barriers that just exist to help ease administrative workload. If you receive pushback on something you feel important toward your growth and development, ask for the documentation that actually reflects those rules. For example, I was told that I couldn't work with my current advisor because of their department affiliation. At first I just agreed but later found there were actually zero guidelines stating this when, in fact, there was established documentation that allowed the specific inter-departmental mentoring I was seeking and just required a few signatures from my program admins. Fight for yourself, there's a good chance nobody else will.",
