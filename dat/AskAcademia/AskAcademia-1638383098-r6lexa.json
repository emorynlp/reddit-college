  "text": "I'm currently in the last year of my master's (zoology). My original plan was to complete this degree and get a post graduation biology teacher job or a tutor job.\n\n I already have a bachelor's in education and a bachelor's in biology with chemistry. Any job right now would get me at least 30k INR per month but a PhD from India will get me the same amount as stipend without any college fees.\nBut now I'm thinking to get a PhD from outside India and try to get a professor job there.\n\n Is it better than professor jobs than India? If yes, then which country should I go for where teaching opportunities for biology/zoology is good and would get me a scholarship too?",
