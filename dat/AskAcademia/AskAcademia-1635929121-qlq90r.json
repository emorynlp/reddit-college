Asking a general practitioner for a recommendation typically wastes time and money. Instead, OP ought to directly seek psychiatric care. \n\nWith suicidal ideation, time becomes of paramount importance. Immediate psychiatric care and de-escalation services like a [suicide crisis line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) are the preferred ways forward.\n\nIn any case, I agree that discussing your mental well-being with a general practitioner is a good practice, but the downvotes may indicate that this is not the optimal step for OP to take.",

If they aren\u2019t understanding/accommodating, either get out or go to your department chair. If they\u2019re not aware, they\u2019re going to keep pressuring you for results until you can\u2019t take it anymore. My colleague was in a similar situation and ended up leaving. Looking back, I wish I had encouraged him to talk to our PI. My PI had no idea and by the time he knew, it was too late for him to do anything.",
