  "text": "Hi All,\n\nI worked on my chapters separately, now needing to merge the documents into a single word document.  Easy enough.  However, I've run into an issue- How do I keep footnotes in consecutive order for each chapter? (I.E. Footnote 1 from Chapter 3 remains Footnote 1, not Footnote 367 in the merged document). \n\nFigured Ask Academia is the best place to start!",

Might mean you have an issue with page numbers though\u2026",

This should solve that problem.\n\nEDIT: I would also recommend using a citation program for future writing.",
