  "title:": "Dissertation and \"Self-Plagiarism\"",
  "text": "Hi everyone, sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm in the 4th year of my PhD program and about to begin writing my dissertation, after having spent the past 3 years working on research and publishing a couple papers. My dissertation is going to be mostly based on the papers I've written, basically stringing them all together and adding new research to them. Am I allowed to use the same wording and copy/paste paragraphs from my published papers if I cite them? Or is that technically considered to be plagiarism even though I'd be plagiarizing myself? I'm not sure what the rules on this are. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the responses everyone!",

Most places it is completely normal to base your dissertation on your published papers, including verbatim reuse, and it would not be considered self-plagiarism. You would cite your papers, but not in the same way as someone else\u2019s work, of course. Ask your advisor.",

The other way round, will really depend upon your institution.  \n\nI personally detest the term \"self plagiarism\" in this context.  Every definition of plagiarism I have seen include the concept of stealing from others.  In most academic situations (outside of term papers and the like), the real issue is copyright.  Thesis (at least where I work) are copyrighted by the University, and the publication may have some copyright.  Given how unclear all this is, and how people widely hold misconceptions regarding the idea of plagiarism, my advice would be \"better not\".  \n\nFinally, I do recall hearing about one case where a thesis got tanked because it included a final form figure that was in a publication, and the journal objected (on copyright grounds).  So, again, while most journals have no problem with thesis not being considered prior publication, some do.",

A PhD isn't 'published' and thus you're not plagiarising, though you may need to ensure you're fulfilling your department's requirements for original research leading to an award. Your own university's requirements for what's called 'PhD by Publication' will be the guidance you need to look at.",
