                      "text": "Yes, I agree completely.  My contention is that editorial at most professional journals (scientific journals, at least; i don't have any idea about the culture at humanities or social science journals) is sufficiently insulated to prevent this.  The people with the most direct influence on the paper are the reviewers, who are usually academics or other professionals with no ties to the financial success of the journal and an associate editor, who may or may not receive a modest stipend for doing work for the journal.  The editor or chief editor is usually a direct employee of the journal, and the chief editor certainly could theoretically intervene in the process to countermand a negative decision by reviewers and associate editor, but I think that in real life we'd be talking about at most a trifling number of cases, and in these days of 24 hour media coverage, I don't think a flagrant breach of ethics like that would remain secret too long.\n\nFurthermore, the type of ads in most journals would be very mundane.  \"Come to our conference.\"  \"Buy your lab chemicals from our company.\"  Do you see an editor rejecting my paper because I bought my sodium chloride from company Y and not company X or because I attended conference Z and not conference W?  I'm a cynic, but even I have more faith in my fellow scientists than that.\n\nBut, as a scientist I'm willing to look at new evidence in the future.  If I see an ad for Marlboro cigarettes in the New England Journal of Medicine and then suddenly a major study about lung cancer is rejected for publication, or if an ad for one company's covid-19 treatment appears in JAMA while another company's research study is rejected without explanation, then I'll be willing to reconsider.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I don't want ads in journals.  I was annoyed when ads started appearing in conference abstract books.  Nevertheless, I do not see a necessary logical connection between \"this journal accepts paid advertising\" and \"this journal's editorial decisions are tainted.\"  Such a connection is *possible*, but I don't see it as *inevitable*.",

                  "text": "What? Advertisers always have independent rational motivation to show their ads where the content fits their market and brand. It is natural and common for an advertiser to discontinue running an ad if the content they are running it alongside somehow contradicts their brand.\n\nGuess what that means? If a content creator or curator starts to rely on that advertiser to put food on the table, and they get to know the kind of content that motivates the advertiser to continue or discontinue support, it is in the content creator/curators interest to tailor the content to continue to eat.\n\nIt happens in every single medium with advertising. You know how I know? Peer-reviewed research directly criticizing advertising and it's influence is allowed to be published without threatening the livelihood of the journal, and thus I've had the privilege of reading it.",
