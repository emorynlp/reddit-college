  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI am a PhD candidate in neuroscience. \n\nI was wondering what your thoughts about a personal website are? Is it helpful in any way to promote my academic achievement? I have been thinking about it for a while, but I also feel that is not going to impress anyone: if people want to know my publications they can find them on scholar, if they want to see my code/programming skills I have a GitHub. So I don't see a direct and meaningful use of a personal page.\n\nIs having a website helpful in academia for early career researchers? If yes, why?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I think it's a good idea.\n\nI keep a pretty simple page that just links to my other profiles on e.g. github, describes my research interests and past works, and gives my CV.\n\nMy main motivation is just to control my online presence a bit more. My website is the first thing that comes up if you google my name. From there, people can learn who I am and what I do, they can check my github, they can check my publication list with ORCID (because these things are linked), and they can get a copy of my CV with my contact details.\n\nIf I didn't have my website then people would go to my github and read my code and I wouldn't have a chance to really explain that work or how it fits into my wider research profile. The documentation of my code doesn't explain the significance of the wider research project, they're just snippets to do rather general tasks. **And**, because my work is actually computational, I can't make my PhD code public until after I've published everything I want to using it. That won't happen until well after the PhD is done, so if I want my PhD work to have a presence right now, I can't rely on GitHub or my (non-existent) publications. \n\nAnd I can't easily track visitors through other pages. With my website, I get a breakdown of all visitors to the site. I know where my viewers are, down to the city. When I applied to my PhD, it was nice to see some random hits on the site from that city.\n\nEdit: if you'd like to see what I have, I'm happy to send you a link. It's very basic, non-busy. It's hosted by GitHub so easy to update. Hell, you could even take a copy of what I'm using and just change the name etc.",

      "text": "The main advantages of a personal academic website are:\n\n* As you move from place to place, you'll end up with a bunch of outdated institutional websites in your wake. Having one place that plainly indicates _which_ of those websites is the most up-to-date one (e.g., where you are _presently_) is useful and saves time. It is really annoying to try and sort out which .edu page is actually the most up-to-date one of the person you are trying to learn about or contact. \n\n* Institutional websites often do not let you easily showcase your newest work, provide links and citations to your published work, or have much more than your \"institutional identity.\" A personal website can allow you to do all of the above. Do not underestimate the value of making this stuff easier to find in any little way you can.\n\nThese are both very useful when it comes to having your work be easily accessible to other scholars (which can mean more citations and awareness, which are good for your career), and can make it easier for people on job search committees to get a more complete sense of you (not all will read it, but some will). \n\nAnything you can do that will make it easier for other scholars to find your work will \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 increase the possibility of them engaging with it. And yes, those other sites can be useful, but if you can make it so that they are using _one_ site to find all of your _other_ sites, that's positive. Even if your page is nothing more than a link to Google Scholar or the right Github page, associated with whatever university you are currently at, that is still a useful personal website.",

Are job committees considering this when assessing candidates?

I also made my preprints available through ArXiv links there so that everyone may access my research for free. If you google my name, my website comes first. \n\nSince then, I have added few sections such that a summary of my research topics, some useful links/tools for researcher, a link to my github, my other projects, some of my talks, etc. I am currently working on a blog addition where I am talking about what comes to my mind. It is not just simply a place to get my research, it is also a place to know who I really am.\n\nIt is quite useful, since it is independent of any institution and I am using an email address with this domain name which I put on all my articles, so that people can reach out for some questions and comments. I am also using Google Analytics to see if people come to visit my website and from where they connect. I can see that there is a decent frequentation, not crazy though, but good enough :) \n\nI am using Jemdoc as it is compatible with LaTeX.",

You can also use it to create a narrative about your professional branding as a whole and let people see how all your stuff fits together. You can even throw a blog on there. \n\nI know from being a department chair and participating in some hiring processes that I really liked being able to go to a person's website to see EVERYTHING (professionally) that they were up to. Gave me a sense of who they are and who they might be as a colleague. \n\nIt's also super easy to make these websites, using simple tools like Google Sites or GitHub Pages, so there's virtually no barrier to entry.",

I get to describe my intellectual trajectory and project more in detail than on my department website. Yes, it takes time to set up, but maintenance is not really an issue once you are done with that part. I just update whatever I do once a semester, and it really takes 30 minutes every six months.\n\nAnd it's worth it because people do regularly visit my website, often from googling my name or via my department website. Many of them click my CV, external links, and \"menus\" on my website, which shows that they actually want to know what I do in detail. Also, whenever I'm presenting at a conference or even ask a question at a conference, the number of daily visitors increases quite dramatically. When I meet other academics for other reasons, I also see a sharp rise in visitors. Lastly, I have been contacted by other academics via the website's contact form, so it's definitely something. So for me, this is a contemporary (and better) version of handing out business cards at a conference with low maintenance.\n\nJust find time and a way to start your website. You don't need special skills because there are quite a few great website-building platforms for beginners these days. Also, if you're shooting for academia, you don't need to catch attention with a fancy interface. A clean and organized description of what you do will do the job.",
