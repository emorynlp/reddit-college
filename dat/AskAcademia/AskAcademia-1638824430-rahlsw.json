  "text": "Hi all, I have been looking for a simple tool that will allow me to:\n1. Make annotations (highlights, comments) on PDFs and/or word docs\n2. Tag those annotations with custom categories\n3. Be able to bring up all my annotations for a certain category across files\n4. Allow keyword searching within PDFs\n5. Allow document relationship mapping (aka document A contains information connecting to document K)\n\n\nNot sure if this exist. I used to use Tagnotate but it only allowed for #1-4, and it is no longer available in the App Store.",

So \u201cI learned X from document A and C, but document A drew that information from document F.\u201d If that makes sense. Basically tracing information back through sources. \n\nIdeally I am hoping to find something that would allow me to type a note and be able to create a hyperlink to a specific page in another file. So for example I would make a note saying \u201cthe customer wants to add in a new dashboard display\u201d, then add a hyperlink for the source document where I found that information",
