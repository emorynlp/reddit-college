  "text": "Before the pandemic I was a postdoc on a project and worked with a tech. During the pandemic, the lab shut down and the tech moved on to a different position. We kept in touch and eventually started dating. Since then, I finished the project and now I'm writing up the manuscript.\n\nI think the tech meets authorship criteria, but it feels like a conflict of interest to be including my SO on a manuscript I'm writing. But it would also be unethical not to....help?",

The personal interest and the professional responsibility are potentially in conflict.  That's what people mean by conflict of interest.  It's a situation that presents a decision maker with a motivation for unethical behavior.  My comment above is that the fact of that motivation doesn't mean that OP is behaving unethically in recognizing the actual contribution of their SO.",

What you're proposing isn't handling a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest (perception of CoI must be addressed as much as an actual CoI). What you'd be doing is abusing your position of authority over someone to deny them an authorship to avoid dealing with the (possible) conflict of interest raised by your relationship.\n\nI'm not sure there really is a conflict of interest here, but the best way to deal with CoIs is transparency and openness. Particularly, conflicts of interest of this nature.  It's only right your partner is an author, if they did the work, but if you have concerns that other authors or people in your team have an issue with that you need to discuss it with them and also with your own boss. Not punish the person with the least power here, your partner.",
