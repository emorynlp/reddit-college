  "title:": "Input/Thoughts on Performing Undergraduate Research Post-Master's",
  "text": "As a preface, I have never visited this sub nor posted here, but a quick read of the sidebar says I should be good to ask this question here and generate a useful discussion. I previously graduated with a Bachelor's and then shortly after Master's (keeping the university and other potentially identifying info private to do my best to remain anonymous in case the professor peruses this subreddit). I am taking classes now at a community college as a \"visiting student\" to make up for some prerequisite courses for applying towards a profession in a different career path. A professor of an upcoming course I am taking offered me a paid undergraduate research position because of my educational background, if I have the time and interest in both the project and the transcript benefits.\n\nWhile I am always looking for ways to make more money and participate in projects that spark my academic curiosity, I had a funny feeling reading her email to me. Projecting out to being an undergraduate researcher again, this time after earning a Master's, felt strange, almost as if I was working \"below my qualifications,\" whatever that may mean. As an example/clarification, I imagined I should be doing research work more tailored/suited to someone with my educational achievement, rather than transcript-building work that undergraduates sans-degree perform, since I have demonstrated I am good for it/earned it through my years in post-baccalaureate education. On the other hand, I could see this belief as inappropriate and that I should instead see any research opportunity as valuable and worthwhile, no matter the apparent label of educational difficulty.\n\n**Is this feeling of mine misguided or misfounded, and I should see the work as worthwhile? Or am I justified in seeing this work as more or less \"below\" my level of education?** I have little time on my hands as is to pick up additional projects, since I already shrink my time investment into hobbies and other pleasures like video games and reading because of these classes among other adult obligations. Despite that lack of time though, I understand how valuable research can look to professional programs, as well as how useful money can be. I intend to ask about time commitment (in terms of hours/week, as well as expected project duration) and the pay but I wanted to get over this philosophical hurdle first before responding to my professor. Any constructive input is appreciated, and I apologize if I used the wrong flair. Thank you!",

      "text": "A few thoughts:\n\n* Does this professor know you have a master's degree?\n* It is possible that the funding is specifically for an undergraduate student. At my university, sometimes I have money for undergrads, sometimes I have money for grad students. I can't use money for one type for the other though. (It's based on what type of classes the student is taking.)\n* Regardless of the source of the funding, it's probably reasonable to list \"Research Assistant\" as the job title on a CV.\n* What type of work would you actually be doing? I know that I'd be really excited to be able to have basically a grad student with my undergrad money - I could involve them in more advanced projects right away, which would be nice. \n   * If the work is something that would use your skills and be reasonable for you, then evaluate it based on that - ignore the title. \n   * However, some undergrad research focuses on rote/repetitive parts of research when they don't have skills to help them get oriented to the process. If this is doing data entry or something similar that any undergrad could do, then evaluate it based on that (still ignoring the title).\n* At the end of the day, you get out of experiences what you put into them. If this experience would help you further your skills, great. Don't overthink the title/source of funds.",

I introduced myself previously with that information.\n\nI'll be sure to include asking if the money is bucketed for a specific type of student in my reply too. I'll also be sure to follow up on the nature/specifics of the work requested. \n\nYour takeaway is an important mindset for me to have with this project too, so I appreciate the reminder and refocusing of my view of this opportunity in this way. Great addition!",

              "text": "She might only have UG research funding. There probably isn't even a type of funding for someone in your position because your position is rare. Typically someone who is a student who has a master's would be doing a PhD and getting funding through PhD funding streams. There aren't many students with a master's doing UG classes. \n\nI think she's just offering you a job and you shouldn't read too much in to the title of it.",

There's likely just a lot of superfluous details that don't matter there. Focus on the nature of the work - that's the most professional way to handle this. (Different folks in academia have different ideas about 'status' and it's best to avoid trying to come off like you consider the work beneath you.)",
