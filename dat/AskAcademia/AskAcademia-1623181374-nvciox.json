  "text": "I know this topic has been all chewed up, but I'm interested in hearing from folks who've found an alternative both to Mendeley and Zotero for \\*organizing\\* their files. \n\nI've used Mendeley for ever, but the new lack of mobile access is the final straw - I need to be able to save articles via mobile devices. I've looked at Zotero, but honestly, it looks like a pain. (Is it worth it? I'm still happy to reconsider.) \n\nI'm just dying here for a solution that:\n\n\\- offers a folder nesting structure for files\n\n\\- that can sync (over iCloud, Dropbox, whatever)\n\n\\- and that you can add files to over mobile (iOS) devices.\n\nI've been using the Highlights app for highlights and notes, so don't necessarily need that to be part of the package. Exporting citations would be a nice benefit, but really, i'm open to workarounds. I just need a simple way to organize and add new files, across devices.",

      "text": "[Readcube Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/) might work for you? It's subscription-based, but the mobile app is quite good, allows mobile uploads, folder nesting (\"lists\" in Readcube's terminology), and (as of last year, anyway) unlimited storage with your subscription. It also syncs notes, highlights, and such, exports citations, and has tools to find new relevant papers based on your library and lists. It's not perfect, particularly for very large and diverse libraries unless you are very careful about organizing, but it seems to hit all the criteria you mention.",

You also can\u2019t cite in Word when you\u2019re offline for some reason. But mostly pretty good and intuitive coming from mendeley",

That way you can directly access the files on iOS using the dropbox app for that device.\n\nSorting out the different preferences between zotero and zotfile can be a problem though, it's a bit of a mess. TBH I don't know why they don't just fold zotfile (and better bibtex) into zotero.",

I finally found the solution that works for me: since my school gives us 5 TB of storage in OneDrive, I sync OneDrive on the adobe iPad app and when I make annotations, it saves across in OneDrive. Then I can access that in my mac through the mac adobe app or on OneDrive itself. Highly recommend!",

Any files I add on iOS go into a 'Transfer' folder, and every month or so I use Zotero and Zotfile to automagically rename the PDFs (and then *delete* the entries from Zotero).  \n\nGuide here:\n\nhttps://criticalscience.medium.com/how-to-automagically-rename-pdfs-4e84347014fb",
