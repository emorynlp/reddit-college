      "text": "YES. I think it's pretty normal, especially when you throw a pandemic in the mix.\n\nSome things that help me:\n\nI play white noise through my noise cancelling headphones to drown out most noise and help me concentrate. I've also started making a point of asking people not to interrupt me when working with headphones on.\n\nIf I can't concentrate or start getting overwhelmed, taking a short break sometimes helps. Just getting a cup of tea of a walk around the block.\n\nSometimes nothing I do helps, and I could spend literal days staring at my computer doing nothing. I've found now the best way to deal with this is to give myself permission to take a day or two off just to recharge my batteries. It's more efficient to do that and come back feeling 100% than sitting at my desk all week achieving nothing.\n\nDon't be too harsh on yourself, you're working under really difficult circumstances.",

      "text": "I totally get it! A few things from a fellow medication user who still frequently copes with focusing issues...\n\n(1) Exercise!\n\nI know there are studies out there to back it up, but I'm not going to go down a rabbit hole to find them since I only have a few minutes left on my Pomodoro timer. I find that I am ***so*** much more focused when I go for a run/bike ride in the morning. There are days when I convince myself I \"don't have time\" to exercise for 20 minutes and then spend the day kicking myself because I waste waaaay more than 20 minutes trying to find focus.\n\n(2) Pomodoro timer\n\n25 minutes of intense, focused studying/5 minute break. There are plenty of apps for this (I use Focus Keeper but also occasionally Seconds Pro which is actually a timer for HIIT exercise lol). Play around with the time intervals and see what works for you, then STICK TO IT and treat it like it's a law you can't break. The minute that break ends, get back to work.\n\n(3) Foam ear plugs underneath noise cancelling headphones\n\nIf you have over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones, invest in a large container of foam earplugs. This + noise cancelling + brown noise (personally find it way more tolerable than white noise...buy a track of your choice and play it on repeat) are a MUST. COVID has seriously screwed up my finely honed work habits, but this helped immensely.\n\n(4) Freedom App\n\nI found this really useful as well. There are days where no matter how much I tried, I could NOT get myself off time-wasting websites. There's a free version you can try, but it basically blocks whatever apps and websites you want on all your devices and there's an option you can choose so that there's no way to un-do it until the session is over. I have these set up for repeating sessions throughout the day, which helps keep me focused.\n\n(5) Positive talk\n\nOk, ok, this one might sound cheesy but it's real. Tell yourself over and over that you are good at working from home/with distraction/etc until you believe it. Take it from someone who had a few breakdowns early on in the pandemic... you have to acknowledge what you're  feeling and how crummy the situation is, but then decide that you're stronger than that, and get back to work.\n\n(6) Stick with a schedule\n\nThis one is another crucial one. Set boundaries for yourself. Working from home has made it difficult for everyone...now all of a sudden you're expected to be available via email/zoom/etc at all hours because they know you haven't gone anywhere. I stick with a schedule of when I'm going to work, and when I'm going to call it quits. There is ALWAYS more work to be done, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you have to work for just one more hour. You could work forever and you probably wouldn't be done/caught up.\n\n(7) Know when to take a break\n\nIf you set up a schedule and get into a rhythm, but then find that there are days when you **just can't focus** no matter what you do? Call it quits. Trying to force yourself to do work is going to make you miserable, and is just going to cause you to burn out more/be less efficient/repeat the cycle. Take the day off, do something you find truly relaxing and enjoyable, get some exercise, then start again the next day. It's probably a good practice to do this once a week or so....as you go, you'll start to figure out what time span you need between days off. For me, it's around the 9 day mark that I start to crack and know I need to take a day off, so I just build it into my schedule one day before that happens.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI hope that some of this is helpful. I apologize for writing a post a third the length of Moby Dick, but I totally know the feeling of being miserable because you so desperately want to work but can't. I sincerely hope you (and everyone else feeling this way!) can find some ways to work effectively in these crummy times, while simultaneously taking care of yourself. Wishing you good mental health and a good day.",

I was hoping that seeing my students face to face (due to the flex schedule) would make things real and then kick my ass in gear. \n\nThen the hurricane hit. And we haven\u2019t had class this entire time. I know it\u2019s shitty of me, but it was such a huge relief. \n\nNow, we\u2019ve been out of school longer than we\u2019ve been in it. Classes start up again this Friday even though most people back in our town have no electricity (and sometimes no water). I ended up moving two hours away. I feel even more disconnected from my duties. Then, on top of that, I\u2019m still trying to pack, move, clean, and setup the place while still dealing with the garbage-fire that was my previous home. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna do anything :| I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried yet about this in particular, but it\u2019s because the void inside me won\u2019t let me \ud83d\ude43\n\nBut yeah, I\u2019m so distracted by all the shit that needs to be done. And everything is compounded by not having a room of my own, so to speak. Maybe you need to focus on creating your own space? For example, my wife and I were originally living with my parents for a bit after grad school. Once we were kicked out of our officers for Covid, I was lost. We ended up deciding to change our bedroom closet into a mini office for me. It still had some of our clothes, but we squeezed in a desk, a lamp, and a powerstrip. Worth a shot!",

Decide in advance where you want to go: to the park and back, around the block, to the campus and back.  This will allow you to clear your head, realize that life goes on outside your academics, perhaps even allow you to have a creative moment.  I liked to take the dog for a walk, because he has his own agenda that you can't rush,  so your interests will have to take a back seat to his.",

      "text": "The average academic would be borderline emotionally disturbed if it didn't have the \"struggle in school\" characteristic. They cry constantly, but no one wants others to see it because the reality is that they'll take away opportunities or think you can't handle it. So mental health is talked about as if we all need to find solutions for people suffering so they can stay integrated with society, but reality is its actually quite hidden in academics. The equivalent would be a church where everyone espouses the dangers of drinking but you can smell gin on everyone's breath, even the preachers. Its the same story.",

You should break down your tasks into small steps and reward yourself with something you enjoy in a break after accomplishing each step. Also, things will get better. Try to look at the big picture, and don't dwell on what went wrong.",

There are times where I almost feel like procrastinating because of the workload, except I tell myself not to or it\u2019ll just pile up. More specifically, there\u2019s this one class where the professor kept changing the due dates for assignments, which made it difficult and concerning for everyone. I can say that that\u2019s the class that has caused me the most stress compared to previous semesters. Sometimes I feel like going to or am having a midlife crisis. And to cope with that I\u2019ve even found myself taking a lot of naps to \u201cforget about my problems.\u201d Despite that, I know that we\u2019ll get through it one way or another, even with the struggles.",
