  "title:": "IEEE reference style not showing page numbers in Mendeley",
  "text": "Hello all, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently in the process of writing my masters thesis. I observed that the IEEE reference style isn't showing page numbers in the word document while inserting the bibliography. I tried downloading the CSL from Mendeley and editing it. That didnt work too. The CSL file seems to show the page number for the journal articles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am using a MacBook Pro running Big Sur 11.5 and Mendeley desktop if that helps.\n\nThanks for the help and suggestions :)\n\nEdit: it looks like the page numbers don\u2019t appear on the references in mendeley as well which is causing the issue. Is there a way to change this?\n\nSecond edit: couldn\u2019t rest till I figured it out. I just had to right click and update the damn details. So happy I got it working at the end!",
