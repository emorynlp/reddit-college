  "title:": "How to turn down first authorship? PI contributed way more to this paper than I did",
  "text": "Field: Neuroscience, Year: mastered out of PhD program 4 years ago, USA\n\n(I apologize ahead of time if this has been answered before but I couldn't find anything for this specific situation)\n\nSo, I have been out of grad school for a while. A few weeks ago, my former PI/advisor reached out to me about submitting a paper based on data I collected which was part of my Master's thesis. She has apparently been analyzing and re-analyzing the data all this time and has put me as first author on this paper (which she has written \\~90% of). The thing is, my contribution was pretty much just data collection, plus analysis using various equations and programs that my PI created (I don't completely understand the math involved, but my PI seems to think otherwise). I also did not design the experiment. Collecting data in this case involved a fair amount of training and skill, but to me it was the easiest part of my thesis because I really struggle with writing and data analysis.\n\nIs data collection really all that's necessary to be first author? My PI is an extremely kind person and I don't feel that I've done enough to be first author. What's the right way to ask her to switch authorship order with me? (it's 3 authors total and she's 3rd). Or should I just take the first authorship and not say anything?\n\nEDIT: Wow, thanks everyone for clarifying this!! I didn't know about the PI taking last author (first gen in academia here). Since the second author contributed to some of the data analysis (but in comparison I did more of the work), I guess there's no issue! I just wanted to be sure I wasn't taking undue credit.",

For example, it could be that your professor or a colleague of theirs had a student who did something incorrect or unprofessional when they were corresponding author for their first paper.  In that case, they may decide that it's prudent for them to be the corresponding author on other students' first papers so they can vet communication and use this to train the students before letting them do it.",
