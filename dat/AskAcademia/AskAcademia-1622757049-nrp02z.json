This was even if I painted my field as in as broad and interdisciplinary colors as possible. Everything was visiting, adjunct-pool, or required multiple big specialities (read: the department wanted to fill two lines with one hire...or read: internal candidate). \n\nI don't see it getting better over the next decade, quite frankly.

This is a big social movement that has a lot of moving parts for various reasons.\n\nDo understand though, that for those of us that are doing history, philosophy, or abstract mathematics (and I have two specific anecdotal examples of this) that have no quantifiable financial value, since ancient times the academy was a place to house us. Nobody says that these subjects are not important, so we used to have a place to participate.\n\nSo now that we are being removed to make room for business, a practice that also had (and retains) its own vast sphere from ancient times. Now, again, this really has to do more with an abstract form of capitalist hegemony than it does with anybody personally.\n\nBut since we are at a place where everyone pretty much agrees that there is a crises in cultural and historical literacy; and a crises where societies we view as competitive are being more innovative; doesn\u2019t it make sense to open the academy back open to the fields it was supposed to house in the first place? Surely there\u2019s at least room for both.\n\nAnd, again, I\u2019m not blaming anyone in particular. Just that this pushing out of humanities and other abstract fields is leading to a brain drain (myself included) that\u2019s going to probably contribute to making things worse overall.\n\nEdit\n\nI also want to add that most people that go into business would probably be better served by a system that used an apprentice system.

I have tons of articles, tons of citations, book chapter, review articles, invited talks at big conferences, teaching experience of all sorts, etc. and I get nowhere for academic jobs.\n\nWhat I wonder about this decrease in applicant pool size is if the pool of people no longer applying consists almost entirely of people who would never have been considered for the jobs anyway. The number of applicants is often not a good measure of your chances of getting the job because most of the time the vast majority of people won't be considered anyway. It doesn't actually matter for a person's chances if these people stop applying since they were never competition to begin with.",

      "text": "As an applicant with a short-term position for next year, I think this goes both ways. The early season postdocs that I applied for had over 600 applicants, which is normal. The very few TT jobs in my humanities field had over 300 applicants (that's high for my area of specialization). With the dearth of TT jobs I wonder if everyone tried to squeeze themselves into these positions.\n\nLike others have mentioned, most ABDs that I know worked hard to figure out how to stay in their programs for another year, and the PhDs with short-term positions tried hard to extend. Many are very very discouraged about the possibility of landing a solid academic job, so I wonder if next year will have double the applicants or less than the normal amount of applicants as people find other avenues.",

We often get candidates for these visiting positions that defend at an odd time and are looking for teaching experience while they go through a standard search cycle, but we've got no takers this year.    Or maybe they're worried about the state of SLACs in general, although mine had record enrollment last year and we're in fairly good shape...  all I know is that we have no idea who is going to teach some classes next year.",
