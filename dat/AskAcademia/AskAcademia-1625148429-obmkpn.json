  "title:": "Is Stealing Ideas Common in Academia? Should I be Worried About Potential Theft?",
  "text": "I am attending my first conference this week, and yesterday I attended a poster session and stopped by one that belonged to an RA of a lab quite similar to mine. I was pretty excited to meet someone that's more of a \"colleague\" to me, since most attendees are professors/postdocs/PhD students and I was quite overwhelmed. Due to the nervousness/excitement I got swept away and I talked a bit about an idea I'm currently working on/am hoping to pursue (I didn't delve in TOO deep but I did mention the current question/a bit of the paradigm). I'm now super paranoid about the possibility of it being taken despite the fact that the person was very friendly (I know this does not matter that much though). I realize that what I did was not the smartest (it was very stupid actually), and I definitely won't be repeating the same mistake again. How should I go about \"protecting\" my idea, now that I let it out in the open? How wary should I be? I know that this situation might not end up being the biggest deal, but I'd also like to know the prevalence of \"idea stealing\" for future reference/caution.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot to mention the field! I do research in psychology.",

Usually other people have their own things they are thinking about and their own trajectory and it's not so easy to just jump into your idea. One insurance against idea theft is to tell everyone your idea as much as possible.",

PI has two postdocs work on the same project without telling the other, the one who makes the least progress gets fired.\n\n2. An obvious idea that's just low hanging fruit and a few people decided to work on all at once.\n\n3. Someone leaves a group thinking that they're taking a project with them, but the PI publishes without them. \n\n4. An editor rejects a manuscript because someone they're close to is about to submit a similar manuscript.\n\nI've never seen a case of someone taking an idea from a conference, running with it and publishing it, although I guess its possible. \n\nI think a lot of young researchers still need to learn the lesson that ideas are easy-- implementing them is hard. Lots of people have had the idea for a flying car, but no one has successfully brought one to market.",

Everybody who is current in the field already had the same ideas, it was more a question of how they executed them.\n\nIt's the  same in econ btw. Outside of big theoretical questions (which are only available to math geniuses anyway), there's not much in the way of ideas.

We have a collaboration with several pharma and somewhat counterintuitively they all release their data to an open platform very rapidly from generation. They feel that the competitive edge actually comes from knowledge of these complex datasets so even if researchers get their hands on them just a few weeks after they were generated it takes so long to get familiar with them that the collaboration have a massive headstart.",

She insisted we never share info about a project with anyone unless we 1. have direct control over hard to reproduce data (e.g. sampled 3000 animals over two years, nobody can just go out and do the same in a few weeks) or 2. are on the verge of submitting the paper. She also refused to do conference presentations unless she could have the paper out the door within two weeks of the conference presentation.\n\nHer stories about academic theft are pretty crazy. One of her first projects was with a large corporate collaborator. Together they submitted a proposal to the USDA and the external reviewers (other academics) rejected it. The corporate collaborator said that one day, one of the external reviewers called them up and told them point blank \"I rejected that proposal so we could work together instead, let's update the protocol and resubmit\". The corporate guy refused and told my adviser, but the prof actually had the gall to submit his proposal anyway without collaborators. He had plagiarized her work so badly he didn't even change the font of my advisers' proposal. So parts of his document were Times 12 and parts were Arial 11, all the Arial 11 parts were literally word for word CTRL+C CTRL+V of her proposal. He wrote maybe 30% of the new proposal with all the rest being stolen. The corporate collaborator had protested to USDA, and that inspired them to scrutinize his new proposal more carefully, upon which they discovered his chicanery. The guy got banned from submitting proposals or reviewing for them for 10 years. But faced zero repercussions at his university.  SMH.\n\nShe also said one of her colleagues at her last university was known for stealing ideas and would tell his peers directly \"*if you present something at a departmental seminar and don't publish in six months I consider it fair game*\". She also said he had a habit of going to conferences with the express purpose of stealing ideas and beating the conference presenters to publication (he'd look for stuff that was close enough to his work to reproduce with existing data). He had built his entire career off this and would defend this saying he was far from the only one. It was this guy that inspired her \"never present if you can't publish in two weeks\" policy.",

One way I think about it: If someone else mentioned one of their ideas to me, I would be very unlikely to have any interest in pursuing it myself, even if I didn't care about ethics. I don't even have time for all of my own ideas that I'm excited about, and wouldn't want to drop anything I'm currently working on. There's also intrinsic joy to working on your own ideas. People are usually too caught up in their own work to pay super close attention to yours. This is sort of like the [spotlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_effect).

Otherwise, you're kind of stuck with more unofficial means, such as keeping timestamps for notes, ideas, etc. Ultimately, whomever publishes first becomes the winner. \n\nIt might be that the other person was just very interested and wanted to know more, or they were thinking along similar lines and you've opened the door to collaboration. At worst, they'll do an eerily familiar project that you can replicate in your own niche.

There's not really such a thing as \"scooping culture\" unless one is in a particularly toxic department. \n\nCollaboration isn't \"always risky\" - that's a very pessimistic way to look at it, especially since collaboration is *necessary* at this stage in your career to build expertise and networks. People stealing ideas happens far less often than rumored in academia, and being suspicious of everyone you talk to about your research not only burns a lot of energy unnecessarily but also hinders your ability to make connections that will be useful in your career.",

That being said,  giving up ideas to mentors used to be part of paying your dues. This persists. Despite the fact funding agencies would rather mentors create independent investigators when the trajectory is to start new labs. The trick is to be thorough, have 'too many' ideas and collect large amounts of quality data that can test multiple hypotheses.",

It seems there even is one PI in their field that basically sees conferences as \"shopping mall\". His lab is huge and extremely well-equipped so even when he sees results from late in projects he often can reproduce that very quickly and often out-publishes the original creators.

Replication is pivotal to the success of research; at any given time, multiple people will be pursuing findings regarding the same or similar idea.

You don't want to get into priority disputes; they are ugly and usually counterproductive. If you have an idea that is REALLY amazing but not ready to publish, there are other ways to register it \u2014 e.g., have a copy of a paper about it notarized and sealed \u2014 and there are instances of that happening in the history of science (e.g., the inventor of the laser did this with the notebook he had where he first coined the term \"laser\" and described its principle of operation, and later that was used as evidence to win him priority on the patent), but again the idea has to be pretty huge (e.g., the laser) to be worth this kind of trouble. \n\nThis does not mean you shouldn't tell people things, but if you've got some HUGE idea that is worth stealing, then publish it before you talk to others about it. Keep in mind that you will have many ideas over the course of a career and most ideas are not worth stealing (or, to put it another way, if they are stolen, you'll be annoyed and perhaps slightly flattered, not destroyed). There are some amusing historical examples of scientists who found other ways to maintain their priority (Galileo and Robert Hooke both used encryption in this way \u2014 they would take a Latin phrase that summed up the idea and then scramble the letters and send the scrambled letters to people, and then later they would explain how to un-scramble them to prove they had the idea first), but these would be irregular today (and none of us are quite Galileo or Robert Hooke, either).",
