  "title:": "How do I tell my supervisor I want to quit?",
  "text": "I started grad school in 2019 and I feel stuck and inadequate.\nI am not the most systematic person, nor the smartest. Nonetheless, I'm in good terms with my advisor; she trusted me a pretty cool project that aligned with my interests, and she is expecting me to redo and re-submit a grant next April. \n\nThe issue is I've been struggling with everything lately: my proposal is shit, I can't manage my time to get my experiments on a timely manner, I've had a manuscript on hold for a year, my first MS student had a VERY bad experience, and my current MS student is just not getting things done. Furthermore, two years ago I thought getting involved in extracurricular activities would be fun, and now I'm pretty much responsible of a super disorganized student chapter.\n\nI've thought about it and I realized I'm not a good fit for academia at all. I don't have the skills, and I don't have the drive, so I want out.\n\nWhen do I tell my professor about this? She gave me a bunch of responsabilities and I don't know how to hand them over. Should I tell her about this the day I'm ready to leave? She's paying for my stipend, so I guess the day I tell her will be the last day for my stipend. I'm also going to take vacations in December, so I don't know if I should tell her before leaving, so I don't have to come back.\n\nAnd probably the most important question: should I tell her on April (right after we submit the grant)? I don't want her to struggle with no one available to write it.",

      "text": "Talk about it sooner rather than later. Give your supervisor plenty of time to prepare, to transition your projects and responsibilities over to other people while you're still there to help. Tell them you are willing to stay until after the grant is submitted, if they'd like. The absolute worst thing to do is wait until your last day to tell them, giving them no time to prepare.",

      "text": "I have seen a couple of times this situation and the professors have always stayed super cool about the leaving. Just say it the soonest possible and be clear about how much and how long are you willing to help before quitting. For you might be the first time under this dilemma, but for a someone to reach a professorship has had to deal with people struggling about leaving academia several times, from friends to herself.",

      "text": "> Should I tell her about this the day I'm ready to leave?\n\nOnly if you *really* want to burn that bridge bhind you (not very smart, really).\n\n> I'm not a good fit for academia at all.  I don't have the skills, and I don't have the drive, so I want out.\n\nUm... I hate to tell you this, but academia is the *low* spot for requring drive, skills, etc. I mean, I love being an academic, but having been in industry for a few decades first, I realize how lucky I am (we are). Be careful not to burn any bridges behind you...\n\n> Should I tell her about this the day I'm ready to leave? \n\nNo! Tell her asap. Do not leave her hanging. Your next job, and maybe the one after that, will depend at least in part on there recommendation your current supervisor gives you!",

You then could also just try to reach out to her and tell her that you can't cope with the current workload.",

      "text": "Well I recently transitioned from student to supervisor just last year. So I can understand what are you going through. I'd recommend you to go and talk to your supervisor and share your issues with her. Supervisors are generally great at resolving such issues (I did it 3 weeks ago for one of my brightest student who wanted to quite her MPhil degree, and now she's working on omicron variant). I'd suggest seek her guidance. I'm sure she can help you find best solution for both of you.",
