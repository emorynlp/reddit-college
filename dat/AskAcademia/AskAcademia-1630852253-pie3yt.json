  "text": "I'm applying for junior lecturer positions (Literature) and don't have any previous experience. I was wondering what I should put in the 'About' or 'Objectives' section (or if I should include it at all).\n\nAlso, as a student, I had two short stories in an anthology. Recently, I've had a research article accepted in an online peer-reviewed journal (it hasn't been published yet). Do these go into the publications section in a CV? If so, how do they go, since it seems weird lumping in short stories in with more 'serious' publications.\n\nIf I could have some advice about this stuff, and possibly a solid CV sample, it would be super helpful.",

Your program and/or advisor should help you write up your CV.\n\nMost people have different subsections in \"Publications,\" but you have to do what makes sense for your situation. I guess I'd do something like \"Creative/applied\" and \"academic\" for this situation. Forthcoming articles definitely go on CVs.",

Depending on what your research is, and if it varies in focus, you could put research under Peer Reviewed Publications.",

You can also add filetype:pdf if you want to focus on types of formatting. For the academic CVs, I didn't really see many bios. If it's something you're worried about, it might be good to reach out to your previous mentors and professors to get their opinion.",
