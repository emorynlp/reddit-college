  "text": "Hi there. Environmental Science program director at a SLAC in a big city in the US. Every year we get placed next to the engineers at our college's open house and they come with their fancy lasers and student-built senior design projects.\n\nLooking for suggestions on what would make a good open house table. Know that we have limited power (1 outlet) and poor Wifi.\n\nI am thinking just bringing some air sampling instruments and maybe a student poster, but we don't even have a budget this year for printouts. \n\nAny and all thoughts welcome. Mostly looking to bring people to the table and I can take it from there.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Is this a public event?\n\nDo you have any areas of Environmental Sciences you concentrate on? Climate change? Wildlife/nature conservation? Soil Sciences? Sustainability? And so on and so on! \n\nI've worked in the private sector off the back of a MSc in Environmental Conservation Management and one thing I've discovered is how much people like to engage with tangible things;  living things such as insects of all shapes and sizes. Feed Thier curiousity and then you can inform them! They like to pick things up in general! So have things they can play around with. Games like 'what can be recycled?' where they take a 'clean' piece of trash and have to decide which bin to put it in. Or if anyone's got something solar powered borrow it and use it to introduce renewable engergy.\n\nOh, so many things. Just takes a little though!",
