  "title:": "How to deal with a difficult Teaching Assistant Coordinator?",
  "text": "I am an international student, working as a TA for a course that employs 10 TAs. So, our department librarian has been made the  Teaching Assistant coordinator. She conducts weekly meeting and demonstrates us the labs that will be performed in the following week. I have been TA for this course for two semester now, so I basically know all those experiments and I don't ask for help from the coordinator. So, now she has started to come to my class unannounced. While I am conducting the lab, she sometime comes directly into the lab and dictates to me what to do in front of all my students. And that is causing some serious damage in my teaching performance. And she sometimes stealthily observes my class from outside, that I had happen to notice once. I know that she basically wants that I go to her before each lab and ask for guidance from her.  I can do that and have tried that in the past but whenever I go to talk to her before the class, she goes above and beyond and starts treating me like she is my boss in front of other people as well. And pretends like I have problems with teaching and I am asking for help from her. My peers who are American do not take such abuse from her, so they keep their distance from her and ignore her outside the group meeting. I also tried to do that and now she has started to visit my class unannounced. She has become such a difficult person to deal with. What should I do? Please help. My Teaching assistantship status also kind of depends on her.",
