  "text": "I have a job offer for a science communication- outreach position. I am thinking of taking it because I want to see if that career path would make me happier. The position involves grant writing and fieldwork, but no opportunities for publishing. I am on my first postdoc. If I leave my postdoc for this position and then decide that I miss research, would I be able to get another postdoc and get back in the game? Or am I really shutting the door on the academic career track? I do have some trailing papers from my PhD so I will probably still have publications coming out for the next year or two.",

      "text": "The vast majority of postdocs in most fields have no realistic academic career prospects, so likely you can't actually decrease your chances very much. But yes, it will be difficult to get back into the game. When applying for jobs, you will likely be judged by people who have never known anything but the very linear career paths that academics are meant to follow and will look down on any deviation from that path. Many will think that you went into a non-academic position because you were not good enough to get a tenure track position, though many will think that if you do more than one or two postdocs anyway. Academia is very social status oriented and non-academic jobs are for many academics low-status. It is not impossible though. Ones chances are never zero.",

Apply early is almost always useful, but it can be hard to overcome the mental and ego barriers.\n\nIt can also be helpful (although not always great for mental health) to look at the CVs of recent hires in your field and of other postdocs who you think are good but don't have a job yet.

I know for engineering and I think accounting, there's a bit more demand for professors since PhDs in those fields can usually make buttloads more money in industry. I know that in my engineering dept, many profs had a lot of industry experience before becoming one.\n\nBut for the vast majority of fields, I think yes, it locks your out of TT jobs from what I hear. But also on the flipside, I think the fear of this is also what keeps people in the \"academia cult\" and keeps them strung along for *years* in essential poverty while in perma-postdoc life. As others in this thread have mentioned, many people who have left academia have gone on to be extremely satisfied and haven't really looked back.",

It's about finding what's right **for you** and that will be different for different people with different goals and life situations.\n\nPersonally, my spouse took three years off after their PhD and is now tenured. I took a couple and am as well. We are, just now, making as much as we did when we left industry, but are much happier with our lives as well. *That's us*, doesn't mean it's right for others.\n\nIt can be hard and it can take time to rebuild your momentum, but the idea that no one would *want* to possibly move back or forth is just absurd.",

Luckily a few papers trickled out from collaborations through that time, including a high impact one, and after the 3 years out I managed to secure another research position - in a less prominent institution, in a lower wage country. The first couple of years back in research were tough as my backlog of publishable work needed to build again, but I'm on my feet again now 4 years into the position. I do feel 'behind' and my publication record / h-index shows it too. I would say I was lucky to manage it (and I'm extremely happy that I did because although the pay is less, the facilities in the department I work in are an order of magnitude better than I've had before, despite the prominence downgrade). Anyone thinking to do such a thing, I would warn away from assuming you'll walk back into an another research position without a lot of luck and possibly some sacrifices.",
