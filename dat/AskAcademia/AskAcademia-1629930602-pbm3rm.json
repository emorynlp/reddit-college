  "text": "Once again, the perennial question of grad school.\n\nI am considering going back to grad school after getting a BA in International Relations and what is basically ethnic studies as my minor. I went into the program almost certain that I wanted to do some sort of NGO work or potentially law school, but both of those options feel really unappealing to me right now and I miss the rigour of school. I feel stuck, and felt that when I was in school, working on academic projects I was really a lot more tuned-in and less ambivalent. However, I don't want to get stuck in doing more research where I'm learning theory but no way to apply it. I realized I didn't get a lot of was research experience or methodologies training in my undergraduate degree. If my interests are in contributing to research in critical human geography, is grad school right for me if I don't necessarily know if I have ambitions to pursue a PhD? I would love to hear if other people who have a Masters in Geography are doing for work and if it is research-based, how they feel about the research-based work that they are doing? None of my close family members have pursued any sort of liberal art, social sciences, or humanities degrees, so I feel like I don't have many family whose brains I can pick for advice.\n\nAny advice would be helpful! Sorry if this post is all over the place.",
