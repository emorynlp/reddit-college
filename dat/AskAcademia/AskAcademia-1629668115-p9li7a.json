A surreal British black comedy that showed the effect of Thatcher's reforms as the university becomes more commercial and the admins slowly gain more power than the faculty. Eventually (spoilers) the university is turned into a private research facility for a defence contractor.\n\nSet in a British university's health centre, the young idealistic doctor Stephen Daker (Peter Davison aka the fifth Doctor Who) struggles to do his job in a health center run by  Jock McCannon who has essentially retired in post; the bisexual radical feminist Rose Marie who is not above using her sexuality to get ahead; and the young Bob Buzzard who is gung-ho for the modern thinking on how a university should be run like a business, and even thinks the health center should get a computer.\n\nThere was also a TV movie sequel, A Very Polish Practice (1992) that caught up with the characters 4 years later, with Stephen now working for an underfunded hospital in Poland as it transitions from being a member of the USSR to a capitalist country.",

Mostly movies are either still stuck in the 80s where there is one old dude in a lab coat talking technobabble or we get some overly condescending depictions that they are just antisocial nerds like in the Big Bang Theory.\n\n\nOne of the few guys how get's this somehow right in my opinion is Alex Garland. Oscar Isaac in \"Ex Machina\" resembles more PIs I met in person than the stereotypical lab coat scientists. Garland also created a show named \"Devs\" where a lot of plot happens at a research facility for quantum computing and other stuff. While the plot of the show is still Science Fiction, the general vibe of the institute and the people who are working there appeared to be much more realistic. It was nice that for a change physicists were not depicted as being star wars shirt wearing super geeks.",
