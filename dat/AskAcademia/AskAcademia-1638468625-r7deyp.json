I guess it could have been, of course, that your preferred candidates simply accepted other jobs.\n\nThat is what happens in 95% of the cases in my experience. We'll cut the pool to 20, then do Zoom/skype/phone interviews with 10, and cut to a short list of five. We'll invite top three to campus. In any given search one of those might be rejected for some reason and the other two could either turn us down or get hired someplace better before we can even make an offer. Do we go back to the remaining two on the short list?  Sometimes yes, but since they were near the top of a pool they almost always have already taken other offers. Now it's March and the best candidates have all been hired elsewhere. So the search is failed and we try again the next year.\n\nSometimes, though, a search goes off the rails and the committee cannot agree on a final candidate. Or everyone invited to campus is unacceptable for some reason. That's a real mess but it does happen occasionally-- usually they will fail it and try again the next year, perhaps with a different position description or a different committee makeup.",

                      "text": "I'd say typically of the ten we do a preliminary interview with we'd have 5-6 that would be considered viable candidates by the committee. So yes, *sometimes* we could go back to the pool...when the first round of a search falters that's usually the next conversation for the committee: \"Do we go back to the pool or fail the search?\" If enough agree that the next tier of candidates on the also-ran list is acceptable we would probably invite them to campus one at a time. In my experience, though, that's often not the case; there can be enough objection to #6 or #7 that the committee votes to fail the search. Or more likely, by the time we are ready to call up #4 or #5 to invite them to campus they've already received an offer elsewhere.\n\nThe politics of this have become more complicated in recent years though, at least at tuition-driven schools like mine. Now failing a search could well mean your department will lose the tenure line, as admins may want to reallocate it somewhere else. So there's more pressure to go back to the pool than there would have been a decade or more ago in my experience. I've seen a few searches bring in six or even seven candidates before declaring a fail in recent years...it remains a competitive market for the best candidates despite the overall surplus of Ph.D.s in most fields. All too often it seems the top candidates are getting offers from more prestigious institutions or closer to their families or in better climates or whatever so committees are facing these tough decisions weighing the option of going deeper into a pool against the risks of a failed search.",

                              "text": "In my (now too long) experience from a pool of say 250 applicants we'll immediately reject 50 who are simply unqualified-- lack the required degree, have no experience, are shotgunning applications from abroad to any opening in the US, are in another semi-adjacent field, or are just absolute whack jobs. Of the remaining 200 we pretty quickly cull those who aren't cut out for our type of institution; I'm at an SLAC so we require teaching experience, demonstrated knowledge of pedagogy, and at least the pretense of wanting to teach more than focus on research. That might get us to 100.\n\nFrom those 100 we'll cut to 20 that are actually gone through in detail (pros/cons of each) by the entire working committee together. That subset of 20 is actually produced by all the committee members working in isolation first; then everyone will make their case for their personal top 20, there's some give and take, and we ultimately vote on a list that goes forward in the process. What never fails to surprise me is that there's often near total agreement on those top 20 from the outset-- before anyone has discussed them --which suggests committee members are looking for the same qualities and are following the process appropriately (i.e. using the job description and qualification rubrics to evaluate the full pool).\n\nUltimately, of course, the cuts that come after the basic qualifications are applied are mostly about experience and fit. When you have a job description targeting specific skills, courses, and areas of research it's fairly simple to look at 100 candidates and determine which have the experience to step right into that role vs. those who have only (at best) tangentially-related experience. But I'd say that it's usually likely that anyone in the top 20 or so *could* do the job-- but we want the *best* person we can get, not just someone who is adequate. And as with most (all?) academic hires, we also want someone we think we will like having around-- a TT hire is likely to outlast everyone on the hiring committee, could become chair some day, and will need to work with the entire department. So even someone who looks really good on paper might be cut because they turned out to be unpleasant in person or revealed that they really hated college students or some other immediately disqualifying thing.",

              "text": "Few different reasons:\n1) folks seem to be applying in greater numbers, partially bc its easier to do so if its a zoom-only application process (though that is beginning to change where I\u2019m at) and also bc the larger turnover trends we\u2019re seeing in the workforce more broadly. \n\n2) some of those applicants are non-academia folks applying to staff positions, which I\u2019m def seeing more of than pre-covid times. \n\n3) folks are making it through, interviewing well, and then backing out. When this occurs, I see two possibilities: \nA) maybe they are leveraging an external offer for more pay, or\nB) they are seeing that the grass is not in fact greener organizationally and/or professionally.\n\n4) I have heard from some applicants explicitly, but not sure re magnitude, that a lot of adult workers don\u2019t want to work with college students bc of the various stereotypes and narratives in the media - in the others, college students are either too woke/left/illiberal, or they\u2019re too Trumpy/MAGA/white supremacist.  \n\n5) I am not seeing bidding wars happen over a candidate with multiple offers. Not sure what to make of that yet, if anything. \n\n6) there has been a lot of folks leaving where I am, so lots of searches have been underway. Given that public opinion of higher ed, at least in the US, is continuing to wane, I am not surprised folks are not exactly flocking to this sector\u2026.",

I\u2019ve heard a number of institutions, including my own, also beginning to conduct dark searches, which I am not all a fan of. I get the pros of the move, but to me the cons far outweigh them. Transparency people. We need more of it.\n\nWrt to non-academia folks - not frowned upon at all, just seeing more folks from industry and the non-profit sector. I like the fresh perspective, though the folks that treat others like their some big wig and initiate a lot of change in a short amount of time tend not to last too long\u2026. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
