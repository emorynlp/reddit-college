          "text": "I'm always interested when people mention failed searches.  Can you comment on why the search failed?  I guess it could have been, of course, that your preferred candidates simply accepted other jobs.  But when faculty positions receive dozens or hundreds of applications, it's hard for me to imagine how there could not have been a single suitable candidate anywhere in the mix, so I like to hear what people say who have been on a failed search.  I've never experienced it before.",

              "text": "Sure.  We are allowed to invite three candidates to campus after the initial screens; for that search apparently two of the candidates weren't recommended for hire and we made an offer to the third but they turned us down because they decided they didn't want to live in our geographical area.  Our searches ran late last year, so it wasn't practical to go back to the larger pool and invite additional candidates to campus at that point.",

I guess it could have been, of course, that your preferred candidates simply accepted other jobs.\n\nThat is what happens in 95% of the cases in my experience. We'll cut the pool to 20, then do Zoom/skype/phone interviews with 10, and cut to a short list of five. We'll invite top three to campus. In any given search one of those might be rejected for some reason and the other two could either turn us down or get hired someplace better before we can even make an offer. Do we go back to the remaining two on the short list?  Sometimes yes, but since they were near the top of a pool they almost always have already taken other offers. Now it's March and the best candidates have all been hired elsewhere. So the search is failed and we try again the next year.\n\nSometimes, though, a search goes off the rails and the committee cannot agree on a final candidate. Or everyone invited to campus is unacceptable for some reason. That's a real mess but it does happen occasionally-- usually they will fail it and try again the next year, perhaps with a different position description or a different committee makeup.",
