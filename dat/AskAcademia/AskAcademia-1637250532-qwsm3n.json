  "text": "This is a throwaway because I don't want to be identified by this post.\n\nHi yall! \nI graduate in the spring with a poli sci degree and I am applying for a recent grad program with my city govt and I needed a letter of recommendation. I asked a poli sci professor who is very familiar with me and she agreed.\n\nHowever, in addition to being a professor she also works full time with the city govt as a political consultant, so she said that I would have to write my own letter of recommendation and send it to her to tweak and sign.  \n\nIm fine qith this, but I have no idea what a letter of recommendation should say? Without sounding like I'm blowing smoke up my own ass??  While also writing from the perspective of my professor.\n\nThe program is one that teaches recent grad how to analyze policy for a legislative office, so I'm trying to include relevant keywords/skills, but I am not sure what skills a policy analyst would need.\n\nI've already included that we know each other from the two pols courses I took of hers, both of which I revieved an A in, but after that I am at a loss.\n\nAdditional info: \nI'm graduating with honors with two accredited honor societies under my belt and a 3.8 gpa. \n \n\nIm a good writer, but I have no frame of reference for something like this. Do yall have any sugestions?",
