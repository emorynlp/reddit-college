  "text": "Outside of looking at uni websites for specific grants or contacting supervisors directly, what advice do you have for someone looking for a postdoc?\n\nThe two organizations I\u2019m familiar with are NSERC and Mitacs. Are there any other similar orgs? Or other resources that would be helpful? \n\nMany thanks!",

You could also try other geological societies in Canada/wherever. In Europe, you can check out the EURAXESS website for post-doc positions. \n\nScholarshipDb.net also has lots of international academic/research jobs, but it kind of sucks to use because expired jobs seem to stick around for a while so check the deadline before getting excited by any postings.",

      "text": "[Earthworks jobs](https://www.earthworks-jobs.com/) internationally.  Are you specifically looking to stay in Canada?  \n\nMany uni websites have a jobs page where positions are advertised; you should always check those out before contacting a supervisor in case they already have an advertised position up.\n\nMany countries have national lab type organisations doing geology/environmental studies so you'll have to look them up and check out their job sites.  You've probably already come across many of them in the authorship of papers you've been reading.  You could look through wikipedia's lists of [national geological agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:National_geological_agencies), [environmental research institutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_research_institutes), and [oceanographic institutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oceanographic_institutions_and_programs).  Some countries have a country-specific website where all the academic jobs are posted, like [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/) for the UK and [academictransfer](https://www.academictransfer.com/en/) for the Netherlands.",
