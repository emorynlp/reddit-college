  "title:": "My unpublished data was used in a grant proposal without my knowledge and without citing me.",
  "text": "I'm currently working as a research assistant working on Project A. Two of my team members (both senior research staff but not academic faculty) who also work on Project A have been working on a grant proposal for the past few weeks and did not include me in the process for reasons I do not know why. I found out today that they had been working on this grant and, as the document is on a shared cloud server, I looked at the proposal and was shocked to see the data I had collected, analysed and the figures that I had drawn up were used within the proposal without citing or acknowledging my work. They also used fairly old data as well. While I had done the research as part of Project A, I independently worked on it (i.e. I did the data collection and preliminary analysis) without the supervision or guidance of the other two.\n\nWould this be considered plagiarism? My name is not on the grant and I will not be participating on the project if the application is successful as I will (hopefully) be leaving for grad school next year.\n\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for the comments. I now understand what a research grant essentially is and how they are conducted. I was not sure what is was and panicked as I felt very left out of the conversation despite our very small team of three. I have recently been very stressed out due to many things and mostly upset due to the lack of interest and comments for the manuscript that I had wrote from my team. I had given a lot of my time reading, commenting and doing the citations for one of my senior researcher's manuscripts and they had not returned the same amount of effort for what would essentially be our first research output from the project. Just feels like there is an imbalance of power dynamic.",

      "text": "Grants are different from papers. It's not unusual to use unpublished/preliminary data from the group like this. Generally only the PI's name goes on it, which is usually the professor/head of lab. This funding is awarded to them and no one sees the app outside of the grant review panel. It also doesn't really matter that you won't be there if they get the grant - presumably the actual proposed experiments aren't your idea that you want to do later and you were probably funded by a grant that used work from someone else in the lab. Contributing now is how you pay it forward.  It would've been nice if they told you, but as long as you're on the manuscript, I wouldn't worry about it.",

      "text": "This is a thorny situation for sure, but based on what you've written my opinion is that nothing overtly unethical is going on.  Rather, they're just exhibiting less-than-stellar collegiality.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n* They should have let you know that the data you generated while working on Project A are going into the grant application.  In my mind, that's just common lab courtesy.  I suspect that they likely didn't consult you about the grant for two reasons, (i) you're a junior member of the lab, and grant applications are typically done primarily by more senior personnel, and (ii) you will be departing the lab in the near future, possibly before the grant is even submitted, and almost certainly before the grant funds will kick in if the grant gets funded.  These are not excuses, mind you, but rather my idea of what they could be thinking in not having informed you that they were writing a new grant.\n* However, the data you generated for Project A belong to the project and the lab, not to you specifically, so I find it completely appropriate that data from Project A are being used in the next grant application to continue Project A.  There isn't really such a thing as \"authorship\" for the purpose of a grant application; grants don't really have authors, but rather investigators and co-investigators, who are generally the most senior personnel responsible for designing and overseeing the project.  Data are included to support the proposal, and it's assumed that these data were generated by the lab of the principle investigator or the lab of co-investigators on the grant.  But specifically who in the PI's lab generated the data presented in a PI's grant application isn't particularly relevant from a grant application point of view.  In a grant application, it isn't necessary to say \"these data were generated by Tom\" and \"these data were generated by Jennifer\" and so forth.  It's more of a collective \"these data were generated by our lab in support of our grant application for the proposed project.\"\n* What *would* be a major ethics violation would be for these senior personnel to leave you off an article containing the data you generated that gets submitted for publication in a scientific journal.  In the sense of an official scientific publication, you *do* have a claim to the credit resulting from your intellectual contribution, and so you must be a co-author on any manuscript in which your data are published.  But a grant application isn't quite the same as a journal article.\n\nMy honest advice is to let this matter go, if you can, because from what you have written I don't see any concrete benefit you stand to gain by pursuing this issue any further.  If you can't let it go, however, then I'd just start with a casual inquiry with the senior researchers, something like \"Hey, I saw the grant application on the server and noticed my data and figures are in it.  I hadn't heard they were being used.\"  And then stop speaking, at which point they will likely feel obligated to provide some kind of explanation or reasoning.\n\nAll in all, though, what you have described seems pretty standard to me, although I think the senior researchers could have managed the situation better by informing you of what was happening before they availed themselves of your figures.",

And honestly, it's in your best interest for this grant to be as high-quality and likely to win as possible, because having this lab on your CV/resume looks much better a few years down the line if that lab becomes very successful by then. Getting grants now will help make that happen.\n\nPointing out that an update is available might also teach your labmates *why* they would have been better served by communicating to you that they're using your figures for the grant. Letting people know gives them a chance to make small improvements, let you know if any issues with that figure, or give you an updated version of the figure. You mentioned in another comment that they're rather new to research, so a teaching moment like this might actually be really helpful for them.",

Given what you've described as your contribution to this project, I think your concern is completely legitimate. Understand that people will use you. This is a good learning lesson for you going forward. At the start of any new research collaboration, have a conversation about your own aspirations and inquire about how work will be credited on projects and grants. The leadership may fall off their chair with such conversation being broached, but those who are ethical shouldn't be moved by it, whereas the snakes might scoff at you for being too forward. As a small team, you should have been informed of what was going on. I would have felt betrayed as you did about the lack of communication. Good luck going forward.",

They've asked me to collaborate with them, where I am familiar with the technique and I had done majority of the work and came up with the research question, but they stated that they would take first author as they needed it for their PhD. I told them we could do joint first but I would take the lead name as I've done most of the work.\n\nAnother thing is that my team lead talked to a new professor about the new methodology that we were developing despite telling me to keep this to myself. They then proceed to pressure me to write the manuscript as quickly as possible so no one steals our idea.... Doesn't bother reading the manuscript and now, after several months after publication, starts reading and criticizes the work - tells me it's too difficult to understand and I need to refine it. Had they done this prior to publication, I would have been happy for any critical assessment of the method.\n\nAlso, the team lead has been spending far too much time on their own PhD rather than this project. We've fallen far behind but they lie to the PI about how far ahead we are. We only have a few months left and have barely finished the first deliverable out of the three.",

Your PI should provide you with an opportunity to review the grant if data you generated is ultimately included, but this doesn't always extend to Research Assistants. Most Research Assistants work on someone else's project and have no claim to the project or data.  It is not always black and white. There is some Grey on rather the Research Assistant is generating data for someone else in the lab. Lab Assistants/ Research Assistants do not get included as Co-PIs on grants. No one else's name \"appears\" on the grant in any meaningful way. Additionally, unpublished data is often included uncited in the application as preliminary data. Instead of asking about the grant, you need to ask if you will be included as an author on the resulting manuscripts, instead of merely showing up in the acknowledgements. The criteria for authorship should already be established in your lab. I know several labs where techs never get authorship. The publications are what matters. Tell your PI that you were excited to see the data being used in the grant proposal and ask if you will get authorship on any resulting manuscripts. Be prepared to talk about the unique contributions you made and specifics on your role in the experiments that generated the data.",

Someone suggested you could bring it up casually. I think that if you bring it up at all if should be in reference to publishing the work. \"Hey, I checked out the grant application amd was excited to see the data from project x was included.
