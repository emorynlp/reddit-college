  "text": "Hello!\n\nIs it ever acceptable to quote someone quoting someone else, and, if so, does the citation needs to change? There is a direct quote I want to use because the author states my point perfectly, but they also briefly quote someone else in their sentence. Can I still use it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! My field of research is theology and I am a grad student in the United States of America.",
