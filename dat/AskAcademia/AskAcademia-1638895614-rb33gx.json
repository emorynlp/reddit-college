  "text": "This is long. Sorry for that :)\n\nI\u2019m a master student and student research assistant. I\u2019m working in a lab I really like and where I also did my bachelor thesis. I\u2019ve been working there for close to 6 years but doing interesting stuff for maybe 2-3 years. \n\nI\u2019m applying for master thesis positions and I got a reply form a PI asking me for school reports and a letter of recommendation. So I went to my Prof and asked for the letter. And now comes the part where I don\u2019t know what to think. \n\nHe wants me to stay. He thinks I should do the master thesis in his lab and make it really good and get a publication out of it. Yesterday my lab supervisor (Postdoc) told me that I can be first author on the paper about the project I was involved in all that time since my bachelor project. If I stay and continue working on it which can then also be my master project. I\u2019ll likely be on the paper anyway, even if I leave, just not as first author. \n\nSo I guess my choices are either to stay in my lab, be first author and graduate with a paper. I most likely won\u2019t learn any new methods. Or I go to the other lab, where I don\u2019t know the group, the topic and everything and just do a thesis there. This way I\u2019d have another set of experience with probably different methods. \n\nThing is. I\u2019m not good at leaving. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll stay in my lab because it\u2019s comfortable; not because of the science. This is really stressing me out because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll make a wrong choice. I also don\u2019t know yet if I want to do a PhD after the master or enter industry. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I\u2019d appreciate any insight :)",

      "text": "Do both.  You can keep working on publishing your undergrad thesis after you leave the lab.  Let the PI know you would like to write it up, and submit it.  Usually if a student takes the lead on writing a paper, they are the first author.  Make sure you have a discussion with the PI about your contribution and author order before you do anything else. Then go to your new lab, start a new masters project and then publish that as well.",
