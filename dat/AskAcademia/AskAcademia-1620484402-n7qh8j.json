  "title:": "When did you start publicly calling yourself an -ologist or whatever someone in your profession / field is called?",
  "text": "Maybe because I've always taken advice to \"keep your identity small and don't pigeonhole yourself\" to heart (I am large, I contain multitudes), or maybe because I've spent literal decades as a student, or maybe because I've engaged in lots of desultory, interdisciplinary dilettantism, but I've never really identified as a \"paleontologist\" or \"anthropologist\" or \"computational biologist\" or whatever field I've studied. When someone asks what I do I usually tell them that I'm *studying biology* or *working in biomedical informatics* or whatever, rather than telling them I'm a *scientist* or *biologist* or what have you (though I was pretty comfortable calling myself a *student*. But working as a postdoc now I don't think that descriptor's as appropriate).\n\nConversely, I've taught lots of students who will claim to be biologists etc. despite at the time doing only so-so in my intro biology class. And in grad school lots of peers would self-identify as the \"-ist\" or \"-eer\" variant of their field of study over, say, as \"grad students\". Armchair psychologizing further, I've heard this can stem from impostor syndrome, but in my case I don't think it's so much that as maybe me \"[dying to performatively divest myself of easily won authority](https://i.imgur.com/J6pq3Xp.png)\", and counter-signal casualness, since people have often told me I project a decently strong aura of competence and respect?\n\nWhat do you call yourself when asked what you do? What about internally, or in social media bios? At what milestones did you make the switch from your previous term of self-ID / description? Was it when you published your first paper(s) in that field? When you graduated with the relevant degree (terminal or otherwise?)? When you were first hired for a position with that term in the job description? After a few years of work experience? When? And can there be disputes in this matter of taste -- are people who opt for an earlier or later milestones pretentious blowhards and humblebraggers, respectively?\n\n(question is asked maybe from the perspective of the social and natural sciences, but those in the humanities are free to reply too, though I'm not really sure what the field-specific terms there would be outside e.g. \"English Literature Professor\" or w/e)",

They\u2019re being paid to do research and teach science at that point, so I think it\u2019s an accurate description of what their occupation is, even if they\u2019re still considered rather junior trainees. Definitely a postdoc in the sciences is a scientist, for similar reasons but more so.\n\nTrainee status in biomedicine often lasts until your 30s; my perspective is that it\u2019s a little silly to keep tap-dancing around what you do for a living unless/until you become a professor or go into industry. This is especially true since most people don\u2019t understand that a fourth-year PhD in synthetic organic chemistry is probably working (much more than) full-time for a living, not paying to take classes.\n\nThat said if you\u2019re trying to use your credentials to back up an argument, then I think you need to be precise about what exactly those qualifications are. Also, some places have \u201cscientist\u201d as a formal job title and if that\u2019s the case you need to make sure you\u2019re not being misleading. Finally I\u2019d also say it usually makes more sense to be specific about your career stage on a \u201cwork Twitter\u201d account bio, since you\u2019re typically talking to people within your field.",

That plus the fact that I feel I'm in a bit of a tenuous spot in my career makes me nervous and feel it's not worth the risk or the significant energy it'd take for me to do a good job at it.\n\nI'll admit I'm a bit torn on it, as it seems like it could be a good way to improve one's personal brand and engage with the community (and my \"brand\" is basically nonexistent right now), but it just feels like I'd be better served by putting that effort into improving my research-related abilities and productivity at the moment.

White guys can waltz into a classroom and be granted that authority unquestioningly. You get a PhD,  people treat you as such, and not as a probable secretary, assistant, grad student, sex object, etc. Others though have to remind people that there is in fact a hierarchy in the classroom, and that we did indeed earn our credentials. \n\nWhen white guys do this whole performative (what the poem is referencing here) \"I don't care about titles, i care about ideas. Titles are for blowhards and self-important assholes\", it creates a culture that makes it one thousand times more difficult for non-white guy professors. I don't care what other colleagues ask to be called, but the performative sort of \"call me by my first name\" shit is actively harmful. That's what the poem is referencing with \"dying to *performatively* divest himself of easily-won authority\" means here. The implication here is that, should a white guy need to regain the authority ceded, it wouldn't actually be a struggle. Meanwhile, it makes people for whom gaining authority is a struggle into apparent assholes. \n\nLook, I get it. I'm first gen and from a working class background too. I know there's a fuckton of classism in academia, and a lack of acknowledgment of the barriers that working class student face. But not all bigotries are equivalent here, and this isn't actually a situation faced by white guys regardless of class background.",

I feel like a graduate degree in the field or a professional certification (e.g., state license) qualifies you for the distinction.\n\nOf course, at that point I was still a PhD student, but I definitely felt like a geologist.",

      "text": "Sophomore year biology class (in a 300 level course with mostly juniors and seniors). My biology professor basically chastised us for not calling ourselves biologists. She made a point about the kinds of research we were doing, the ideas we were discussing and debating, and the amount of work and education we have had in biology and that it was more than 99.9% of the population. We were biologists, she said. She told us to say it and own it (but said we already acted like it). She was an amazing professor. (And still is, i just don't have the privilege if being at thst school anymore).",
