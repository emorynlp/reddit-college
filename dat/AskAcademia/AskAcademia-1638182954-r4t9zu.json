      "text": "You can submit and write many documents including personal or intent statements, but you cannot generally submit a letter of recommendation or serve as a reference for yourself that is written by you. (And definitely don\u2019t sign someone else\u2019s name to a letter you write without their knowledge as though they had written it.)\n\nAs a previous commenter mentioned, some professors will ask you to list out some important things to highlight which they then use in their letter and sign off on, but if they have told you they don\u2019t have time, I wouldn\u2019t push that. If someone can write a strong and positive letter on your behalf, they will make time to help with this. \n\nConsider which other professors you believe can write in on your behalf. Email or tell them about your new endeavor and how you believe you are well suited for it and how your work, knowledge, or behavior in their class has prepared you for this next step. Then ask if they can write for you.\n\nIf you have to ask \u201chow do they verify the letter\u201d, then whatever you have in mind is probably not a good idea. Your integrity (and the integrity of your work) should be of great importance to you even when you aren\u2019t immediately called out on things. Also, keep in mind that it\u2019s a small word and people know people.\n\nIt sounds like you need to continue to ask around or think of some other options. (Does it need to be from a professor or can it be a college staff member, boss, high school teacher, personal reference, etc.?) \n\nYour college career center or student services offices may have some insight for you to consider.",

Likewise, it would be very unusual for you to directly submit the letter.  These are almost always submitted anonymously (I.e., you don\u2019t know what they say).  This is by design.  What is almost always the case these days is that you submit an application electronically which includes contact information for your letter writers.  They then receive a request to submit their letters electronically through a similar portal to yours.  I suppose it might happen but I cannot imagine any circumstances under which a professor would allow you to actually upload and submit the document.  Even if I asked you to write it for whatever reason, I would still want to see it.  Regardless of who wrote it, the letter reflects (either poorly or well) on me.  Reputation is a rare and precious commodity that is usually closely guarded for good reason. It\u2019s hard to earn and easy to lose.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it is more along the lines of what others are suggesting (which honestly is how your post reads) then you should find alternative letter writers.",
