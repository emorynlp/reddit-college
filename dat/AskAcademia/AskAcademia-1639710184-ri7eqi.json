  "text": "Hi, I am an international student in UK and I am given a choice of proposing an external examiner. I don't know anyone in UK, but proposed a professor in Canada (not my home country). My UK advisor thinks that we need to suggest someone based in UK.\n\nIs it an issue if the external examiner is from non-UK country? Any thoughts? Viva will be online. \n\nAlso, any other suggestions if I have to choose an alternate external examiner?",

      "text": "I'm also a North American who did a Ph.D. in the UK.  While my external was American and it went great, it is often considered a bad idea. The differences in Ph.D. requirements and even just the length of time you have to research in North America vs UK universities could mean that a non-UK examiner may expect your work to a higher standard. Because of this, a few of my friends were explicitly told to only look in the UK, but my supervisor did not think it was an issue.",

      "text": "I may be misinterpreting you here (we've bumped into one of the vagaries of the English language) but you don't need to know the person to have them as an examiner. They can be anyone with suitable experience even if you've never met them. \n\nAs for the Canadian person, I'd press your PI a little more about why he wants someone from the UK. Is there an issue with this particular person he's trying not to say? Is he envisaging the viva in person and therefore is worried about paying travel for this person? Does he want the viva to be in person so only wants UK people. Is it because traditionally Vivas are in person so it tends to only be UK examiners and he just hasn't adapted to the idea you can do anything worldwide with zoom? People sometimes react to something out of the norm without thinking about why they're reacting.",

      "text": "I think having a non-UK examiner could be beneficial as a way of building your international networks.\n\nI work elsewhere (in the EU). Since the pandemic, we have started having virtual vivas with more external examiners from outside the region. This is seen by the university as a good thing: it helps to build our brand internationally, etc. The university tracks the percentages of external examiners sourced from within our own country annually and want those numbers to decrease. So I find the opposite (i.e. UK locals only) attitude fairly puzzling.",
