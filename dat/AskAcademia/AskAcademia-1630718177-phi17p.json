  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been working with my phd advisor for about 2.75 years now. I started my phd about 4 years ago with another advisor. That advisor lost funding and basically kicked me and 3 other student out of his lab. There wasn't anyone else in my subfield and I was forced to basically switch to a subfield which is substantially more mathematical than my own. I not only lost 1.25 years of my time (the courses I took were useless in this new subfield), but now I was at a basically in a new field for all intents and purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current advisor is a very generous person and took me on without me having taken any of his courses or even talked to him before. After getting rejected by several other professors (mostly on the grounds that they did not want bad blood with my previous advisor), this new advisor took me on without so much as having talked to me before I basically burst into his office with a resume, he even apologized to me for not being able to immediately fund me (I just TA'd instead). So far, I feel like I have failed him horribly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the first year, I basically produced nothing on a joint project with another student while I took classes. I've been working on my own project for over a year now (but I'm basically advised by another student and meet with him perhaps once every 2 months) and I just realized that basically I have no results because of a change I made to the code which isn't a bug, but wasn't properly accounted for and might as well be a bug. This is despite my advisors insistence for the last few months that something like this was likely in my code. I will be presenting the outcome of this to him in a week or so and I'm really worried about his reaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on my interactions, I feel like my advisor thinks I'm a dunce. He has become dismissive of most of the things I say and I feel like he treats me differently when compared to my lab-mate. I recently saw some emails my lab-mate forwarded me which were just noticeably warmer than the interactions I've had with him. Additionally, my advisor wanted to know whether I would use research funding or be teaching this coming quarter and rather than email me, he included the question of what I would be doing at the end of an email to my lab-mate (who I do work closely with, but still...). After my lab-mate told me that our advisor wasn't sure about which form of funding I would need, I emailed him and he didn't even bother responding (after I asked him if it would be okay to use research funding).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like this situation is mostly my fault. I have worked really quite slowly and been lazily during this pandemic. But I also had a sick family member, phd quals (which were delayed 6 months and forced me to spend more time on them), and just the issues that came with the pandemic in general. I feel like my advisor likely doesn't trust the quality of my work (and he probably has that right given that his intuition was right in the most recent case that took months to uncover and that I will likely present to him this week). I'm not sure what to do and I'm deathly afraid he'll just get fed up with me and kick me out of his lab. I should obviously work harder, particularly as everyone goes back to lab this quarter, but I don't know what else to do and if the situation is even redeemable. Any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only hope I have is the thought that he could have told the committee to fail me in quals (but didn't) and the fact that he has been generous with his funding so far, but from interacting (via Zoom and email), I feel like he is becoming more and more dismissive.",

      "text": "My advice would be to meet with him one on one, tell him about your error, take responsibility for anything you genuinely feel you need to take responsibility for, describe your concerns about progress, ask for honest feedback, and make a concrete plan to turn things around. Ask your advisor to help you set mini deadlines maybe, or for more frequent meetings to hold you accountable if that's likely to be helpful (might not apply, ignore if not), and stick to them. \n\nDon't wallow in past mistakes, if you want it to work out you really have to be the one to make it happen. \n\nThese mid-candidature realizations about lack of progress aren't at all uncommon, so you're not alone there, and they can absolutely be harnessed to turn things around when they're sincere. Really lean in to your project, and commit to tackling your limitations. Harness any support available to you (including counseling if you feel there are things within you holding you back) and give it everything you've got. \n\nBest of luck, you can do it.",

          "text": "Thanks for your advice and comments. A couple concerns...\n\nI tried something similar to what you described earlier on, perhaps a year ago in when I saw I wasn't contributing much. My advisor at first didn't even respond to two emails, several days apart, and I basically just walked into his office. When, at the time, I proposed things pretty similar to what you proposed he was again pretty dismissive. I just got the feeling he didn't want to spend more time on me than necessary. I proposed submitting a weekly research update and getting his advice via email, but although he didn't straight-forwardly say no, he basically said that instead I should collaborate more closely with my lab-mate.\n\nHis mentoring style seems to be to stick the more junior students with a more advanced graduate student and then only meet when there is progress. My lab-mate has been quite generous so far, but I feel like even he is losing hope in me.\n\nMy advisor is a very professional person, we never talk about anything outside research (although in the emails my lab-mate sent me, there are some more personal comments which again make me feel like crap because he is always strictly professional with me). I am not sure what to do when there is zero personal connection, no desire to meet more than is necessary (and always in the presence of my lab-mate), and basically the fact that I've been riding by on his generosity thus-far.",

              "text": "Speak to your committee or your graduate student coordinator. This seems like it's very complex, there are a lot of relationship dynamics and history here related to you, your project, your past  performance, your advisor, and the supervision structure of your lab. Apologies, but I really don't know where to start, I feel like someone needs to really get into the weeds of it with you to be able to offer advice.",

      "text": "While I don't love his management style, he's made it clear that he doesn't manage projects and performance and has quite explicitly pointed you in the direction of a more senior student. I think you need to speak to them and get some feedback from them on things they think you could improve on or if they have any advice for you. \n\nYou mentioned weekly progress reports but the issue with that is it creates work for whoever receives them. Perhaps instead you could ask the student if you could sit down together once a week and discuss the previous week and the week ahead.",

          "text": "Thanks, I appreciate the advice.\n\nDo you think there is anything I can do to change my advisor's opinion of me at this point? The senior student is graduating in about 9 months or so and at that point my advisor will have to take a more hands-on role because there will be no one left in the lab who is senior to me.\n\nDo you think I should bother talking to my professor about everything that has transpired so far or should I just work hard and hope I can prove to him that I can do good work over the next 9 months? Its his dismissive attitude that has really bugged me lately and has me worried about my future in the lab.\n\nI should add that this is a quite small lab (less than 5 students), its not some lab with 20+ students where the advisor definitely would not have time to monitor each student closely. Hence why the lack of any personal connection bothers me.",

I\u2019ve communicated with him, asked for comments, I get nothing in general... last 9 months have been difficult .. \nI am at a point where I think I better leave because my mental health is so bad , I can\u2019t sleep, I have nothing but reading to do during the day ... it\u2019s been rough.
