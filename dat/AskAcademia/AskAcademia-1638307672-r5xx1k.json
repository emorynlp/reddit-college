  "text": "Hi everyone. I'm applying for Masters in Computer Science in US Universities for Fall 2022. I was wondering whether it would be a better idea to get a letter of recommendation from the head of my department under whom I have studied one subject or from an assistant professor who has since moved to another university under whom I\u2019ve done significant projects and research, other than getting the highest marks in the class in his subject. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I should get it from the latter, would it be okay that he is not affiliated to my university anymore? And would I have to mention his old email address pertaining to our university or the new email address from his new university?",
