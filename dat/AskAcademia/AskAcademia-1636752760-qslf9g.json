  "title:": "Has anyone else read Dark Academia: How Universities Die by Peter Fleming?",
  "text": "I'm currently in a humanities masters programme and I just finished this book. Oh boy is it a depressing read. Fleming seems to argue that neoliberal capitalism has turned the university into some kind of hellscape, and that there isn't much hope for academic life getting any better without enormous changes outside the university system. In my limited experience, I have noticed some of the problems he talks about already within my university. \n\nI wondered if anyone else in graduate school/ academia had read it, and if so what your thoughts are on Fleming's arguments?",

      "text": "While I haven't read this specific book, from looking into its contents I can almost certainly assure you that it covers nothing new under the sun.\n\nThe key thing here is to interrogate the premise:\n\n> Fleming seems to argue that neoliberal capitalism has turned the university into some kind of hellscape, and that there isn't much hope for academic life getting any better without enormous changes outside the university system.\n\nThis presumes a few things: (1) that the university, prior to the influence of neoliberal capitalism, was an idyllic place where learning was sacred and advancement of human knowledge was the impetus for the university; (2) that the university is presently an utterly horrific place unlike any other, in other words a \"hellscape\"; (3) it is the responsibility of someone \"outside the university system\" to somehow correct this.\n\nLet me state to be clear: academia and universities do indeed have numerous and serious problems. Adjunctification, administrative bloat, student loan crises (at least in the US), technological illiteracy, aggressive anti-union practices, and so on. No one with any real awareness of academia can dispute this. However, this is not the same as claiming that academia or the university is fundamentally broken to the point of \"dying\" as the book title claims.\n\nBriefly addressing the specific points:\n\n1. The university has not, by and large, been an idyllic, sacred temple of human learning and knowledge; rather, they have always been established to serve some purpose beyond the university and have nevertheless produced great advancements in human knowledge as a byproduct (arguably, inevitably so). For example, colleges and universities in much of human history have been places for the wealthy elite to send their children (sons) to receive a classical, liberal arts education and of course to network with their wealthy, elite peers. I would hardly consider such an explicitly classist system as \"idyllic\", but at the same time the natural concentration of leading scholars at such institutions has undeniably enabled advances in scholarship. Similarly, the land grant universities of the 19th-century United States were established to educate a new generation in agricultural, military, and engineering fields as a response to the Industrial Revolution, in other words with a clearly *economic* motivation rather than an altruistic motivation focused solely on learning and intellectualism. And in the same vein, the modern administration-heavy university has come about in large part (though not exclusively) due to the massive expansion of availability and accessibility of post-secondary education - a good thing, I would say! but with complex ramifications for the university. The point is: universities always need to serve a purpose beyond being an ivory tower of refuge for the intellectual elite of the world, and a failure to perform as the latter is not an indictment of the university.\n\n2. Without going into great detail, I would simply note that most of the problems in modern academia are not extremely different from those seen in any other career field. Most people working in industry or government can tell you many stories about terrible bosses/administration, awful and abusive coworkers, insane job requirements, underpayment, shitty labor practices, and so on. There is no reason to expect academia to be fundamentally different just because the people working in academia have PhDs. A PhD is not a badge that says you are a better person than everybody else, or somehow a more selfless, altruistic person than Dave Programmer making $200k at Microsoft. It means you're an expert in some niche field like twelve people care about - I exaggerate slightly. So again - does academia have myriad problems, some quite serious and troubling? Yes, and no one could deny this. Is academia a uniquely untenable hellscape compared to literally any other career field in the world. No.\n\n3. Given (2) above, I think it is safe to extrapolate that there is not some unique prerogative for some outside entity to intervene to fix academia. By \"unique\" I mean this in comparison to any other field of work - of course as a society we should always advocate for better working positions,  sensible wages, the ending of exploitative labor practices, and so forth, but this applies across all of society and not uniquely to academia.\n\nSo what is my point? Once again, the university is not without serious problems which do demand solutions. However, this is not a unique state to universities only, in fact one could argue it is yet another expression of the human condition as much as anything. Given this, my conclusion is - do not give too much weight to voices that raise only alarm and depression. You should certainly be cautious - particularly in the humanities where the academic career path in this day and age is rough to say the least - but don't let disillusionment lead to despondency. Hopelessness and pining for the \"good ol' days\" feels tempting but frankly will not get you nor anyone else anywhere good. Ideally, one should take a measured look at academia and ask if they are still willing to get into it given the problems they are aware of (an important question, since many come into academia with this idealized view) - and if one remains resolute, ideally look for the people who not only raise the alarm, but come up with viable, constructive solutions to these problems.",

          "text": "I have to admit, I'm always kind of puzzled by people who seem to think academia has somehow *uniquely* low pay and workplace problems - maybe because I've had plenty of crappy non-ac jobs (oh boy, don't get me started on publishing, but I'll still take it over angry retail customers or law firm hours or the physical damage of mail delivery for decades or...) and I know people in many careers that have all kinds of systemic problems, ranging from chronic underpayment and discrimination to incredibly high rates of sexual assault.\n\nLOTS of places have terrible pay, lots of places have workplace problems, lots have both! I doubt there is any field that has nothing but well-compensated, functional workplaces, and there has been increasing pressure to put up with all kinds of unreasonable expectations because you're \"lucky\" to be employed (although that differs from country to country and the pandemic has given workers a little more leverage).\n\nDoes academia have unique problems? Sure. But every industry/field has unique problems. Should we work on both the unique and nonunique problems? Yep. But there are always going to be systemic problems no matter where one goes, so it's more about picking which problems one is willing and able to deal with for the salary you're paid rather than about finding the field that has no systemic problems. I definitely do not buy, as a woman, that academia had some halcyon golden years in the past, when higher education was primarily for well-off white men.\n\nThere are tons and tons of improvements that could be made now, and there are certainly negative trends like overreliance on adjunct and grad student labor in some countries, but there are also many positive changes and all kinds of really exciting research and collaborations that would not have happened 50 years ago.
