  "text": "The interviews involved only people who would supervise my work and while I got the impression the atmosphere in the team is good I would like to talk to someone whose perspective would be closer to mine. This is going to be the next 3 years of my life so I want to be as sure as possible I'm not being lured into an unhealthy environment. I already know there are 2 other PhD students working on the project so they would become my colleagues and I would get to know them anyway.",

The department is almost certainly going to send the ones who are most enthusiastic about the program, so if you want a more objective view, try to get perspectives from several others, too.",

People in the same department. You are going to eat, wake, and sleep if any with this for a long time. The pay is very unmotivating so you need to make sure that the work environment and the work itself is motivating enough.\nIt's OK to turn down if your gut feels so. You don't want to cry at 2 AM in the morning wanting to quit or feel cheated on or over some ridiculous conflicts with some unethical issues.",
