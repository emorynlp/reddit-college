  "text": "On one hand I would assume sending a quick \"thank you\" or a one-sentence appreciation would be polite. On the other hand I wonder if this would be annoying as it just clutters up your email more.\n\nSo are there any guidelines on how I should respond to a professor's reply when only a simple appreciation/thank you is warranted?",

When in doubt, send the thank you. \n\nIf it is a professor with whom you communicate very frequently and the thank you relates to a small matter, you might just incorporate the thank you into your next email response, rather than a separate thank you email.",

After Museum decided that my services are not in demand anymore (beside the fact that they promised me a full job, but instead it went to another one who had power and connections), I wanted to see director, main chief of department for which I worked and other museum staff. Since I wasn't able to see them all, I wrote a huge email to all of them in which I stated that this was a best period of my life, that I learn a lot for them and that I wish them all the best in their professional life. At the end, I wrote a separate sentence with only a little note: Thank you for everything. Based on received replies, they were positively surprised.   \n\n\nIn the end, you should definitely wrote a thank you email to somebody you think that help you a lot. I only use an email if I can't meet face to face with that person. Don't forget to add why you think that they helped you.",
