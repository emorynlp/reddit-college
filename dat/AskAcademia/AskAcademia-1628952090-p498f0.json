The best match I could find was [this](https://www.amazon.com/1860-U-S-Navy-Cutlass-Sword/dp/B00FDTMBVY/) for $65 and to be honest a) it's really ugly and b) the blade looks like it's made out of tin foil.\n\nIn contrast, the sword of University of Helsinki looks like [this](https://au-holmberg.mycashflow.fi/product/44/helsingin-yliopiston--tohtorinmiekka). It is quite a bit more expensive (313\u20ac) but at least to me it looks much better. It's also been designed by [Akseli Gallen-Kallela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akseli_Gallen-Kallela), one of the most famous Finnish painters.",

I guess one thing I'm concerned about in the language department is that in Germany I've heard almost all documents are strictly in German, but in Finland I know it's possible to have certain official documents sent to you in English as well (e.g. bank documents). And I've also read about instances where people in Germany refuse to provide service if you don't speak German and they can't speak English (I know this won't always be the case, correct me if I'm wrong) but in Finland I know people at least try to help, usually by finding someone else who can speak in English.",

But in Germany, nobody will refuse service if you can't speak German. They will make an effort to get things sorted.\nIf you live in a larger city, either one of the metropoles or a typical student city, the likelihood of someone speaking at least some English when you're interacting with them isn't too low I'd guess. And in what types of situations do you really need it when speaking?  Maybe when searching for a place or doing some document runs. In these cases you'll be fine.\nI currently work in a research groups with a majority of foreigners as PhD students and Post-Docs. They get by. Of course, they learn German (and I think even have to reach a certain level at some point in time). But for all bureaucracy, either the city office had English speaking personell or someone just went with them. When they get sent documents, we just help them fill it out.\n\nWhen it comes to learning the respective language (I have zero experience in Finnish), I'd guess as an English speaker, German will be easier for you than Finnish, since they have similar origins and a lot of words can be derived from English after a while.",

The starting salary is 2200 (all Finnish universities use the same pay scale), but you're guaranteed two raises that are partly based on your progress and partly performance. The last year of my PhD in Finland, my salary was 3700.\n\nThe coursework in Finland is typically minimal, as you need a master's to get into a PhD program, and can be covered by things like presenting at international conferences (but this could vary slightly between different departments). Compared to Sweden where you're required to teach 20%, in Finland you're required to teach 5% (if youre salaried. Project-funded typically have 0 teaching requirements, but many choose to teach anyway). In Germany though you can't get any official teaching experience until after your habilitation which is like a docent / second PhD, and therefore will be at a disadvantage when applying for academic jobs in other countries who expect you to have at least some experience. Speaking as a member of recruitment committees, this has been a real problem for many otherwise excellent German candidates.\n\nAlso, if you want to stay in academia, based on what my German colleagues say, it seems the job prospects are better pretty much anywhere outside Germany.\n\nIn the end though, I would choose based on who your supervisor would be and the topics you could work on there.",
