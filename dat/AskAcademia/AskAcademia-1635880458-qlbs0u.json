  "title:": "Are few publications after completing a PhD a serious problem?",
  "text": "I just completed my PhD in History and I am looking for postdocs in IR. But I am worried that I am not competitive due to lack of serious publications. I did my PhD in Europe and I presented my research in two international and one national conferences. I published a collective chapter in a collective volume (peer- reviewed from a major publisher in the US) and two other chapters in collective volumes in my home country (and native language). But I haven't published any papers at peer-reviewed journals.So, I was wondering if publications are the most important part in order to be employed for a postdoc. Thank you!",

      "text": "This depends on the criteria funding bodies use to fund post-docs, I would guess, and on the 'value' of book chapters in this system. My experience as outsider (archaeologist) is that the field of History tends to attach more importance to books and book chapters, compared to articles, than other disciplines. But I do not know whether this is widely applicable.",
