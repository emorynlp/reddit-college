  "text": "I'm a biochemistry graduate student and single parent. I find it quite rare to meet fellow single parents who are in academia and when I do, we're too busy to really communicate about our unique experiences. There's also more of us than people think! \n\nThat is why I started a sub\u00a0[r/SingleParentAcademics](https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleParentAcademics)\u00a0for graduate students, post-doctoral students, professors or work in higher education positions while managing single parenthood. I'm optimistic that this sub will eventually grow into a support network for those who are in this particular niche. \n\nIf anyone has any interest, feel free to post related topics there. Thank you for reading! ",
