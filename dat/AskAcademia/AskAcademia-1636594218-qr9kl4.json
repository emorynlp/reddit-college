Is a Humanities PhD necessary? I love doing research and I\u2019ve considered getting a DPhil from a European University. I\u2019d rather finish in 3-4 years vs. 7-10 in the US. Has any recent Humanities Professors taken this route? Is it feasible to obtain employment in the US, or any country for that matter, with a PhD from a foreign University?",

      "text": ">  Is it feasible to obtain employment in the US, *or any country for that matter*, with a PhD from a foreign University?\n\nI am not in your field, but are you asking if employers in foreign countries accept non-US degrees...? If so, yes. US degrees are not seen as better/higher quality than others. The reason why PhDs are shorter outside the US is because you need a master to apply and only under exceptional circumstances they will consider someone without one, which is not the case in the US. Thus, in the US, they put hidden master requirements inside their PhD programs. All that to say; the longer length of US PhDs does not mean they are more robust than EU/AU/CAN PhDs.  It simply means they are compensating for the fact that masters are not required.\n \nNow of course, if we are talking about Ivy league schools, that's another deal. But then again, it's about the school's reputation, not the country's reputation. Also, remember, there are some top schools outside the US such as Oxford, Cambridge, McGill, etc. If an employer outside the US judges the quality of your PhD based on something unrelated to your research, it's more likely going to be because of the school's name, not the country. And then again, they rarely do so outside of academia. What matters to employers outside of academia at the PhD level is what your research is about, who your supervisors are and the work they do, the quality of your research, etc.\n\nedit: made a separate comment instead to keep the main answer short",

From personal experience, I recommend just using PhD going forward (\"I considered doing a PhD in the EU\") to avoid confusion if you speak to people outside the UK who are not familiar with the term (more than you know..) or that are not academics or familiar with higher studies. Especially if you are going to use Phd and Dphil in the same convo some can think it means 2 different things.. Happened to me a few times",

I have peers that are partially funded or self funded because most unis except oxbridge won't fully cover international student fees.",

                      "text": "A humanities Ph.D. in the US should come with full funding (tuition waiver, small stipend of maybe 20-30k). If you cannot get into a program with funding, you will have a VERY hard time getting a job at a SLAC. But are you thinking of a Humanities-adjacent field? There things might be different.\n\nWhich brings me to the other issue. As others have pointed out, Ph.D.'s from Oxford, McGill, etc. can be prestigious. While nobody would scoff at you for having a such a degree, the SLAC is something that doesn't really exist in Europe, including the UK, and I suspect that US programs can be better at preparing you for that, basically, because they will usually have you do more teaching than in a 3 year dissertation only program. Oh, I see that someone said that.",

You will have a very hard time getting such a job with a European PhD because you will likely not have enough teaching experience. Teaching is heavily weighted by SLACs, and  European PhD students finish so quickly because they rarely have to teach. Your CV needs to list as many courses as instructor of record as possible (not just a TA or discussion leader) if you want to be competitive.",
