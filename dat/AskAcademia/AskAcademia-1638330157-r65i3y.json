  "title:": "How can one be more productive academically by spending less time \"researching\" choices?",
  "text": "Consider two professors from a rural university. Two assistant professors of sociology. Both former neighbors of mine with bad knees. Both quite overweight.\n\nWhen one wanted knee surgery, he asked his Bishop. The religious leader suggested a local surgeon and the prof. went to that surgeon, had his surgery and went back home. His leg didn't heal, so he had a second surgery. Then a third. Then he made tenure.\n\nThe other professor asked me and dozens others. He \"researched\" his options very thoroughly. He read medical articles I gave him to read. He asked me several questions on a paper about sham knee surgery and the placebo effect. He corresponded with the authors of the paper on the sham knee surgery.  He spent months \"researching\" knee surgery options, then he even changed his health insurance to get a prominent surgeon to give him an opinion on his knee and possibly operate his knee. He sought a second medical opinion. And a third. Finally, he strategically lost weight and never had knee surgery. His knee healed without the surgery, But he didn't make tenure because he said he was too busy with his bad knee.\n\nIronically, the first sociology professor had three surgeries by a local surgeon with a very limited skill set. But he made tenure despite making sub-optimal choices when it came to his knee surgery.\n\nI am more like the second professor. I spent so much time agonizing whether to study Python or R that I could have learned both during that time. \n\nNow consider the following sample time-intensive activities -\n\n- Figuring out which state to relocate to.\n\n- Deciding on where to rent an apartment in Los Angeles.\n\n- Deciding on which breeder to buy a racehorse from.\n\n- Picking a good dentist in Chicago.\n\n- Deciding which home to buy in Carbondale, IL.\n\n\nEach of these activities - and similar activities - are way too time intensive and effort intensive. At least for me because I seem to spend too much time on various options available to me. This time comes at a cost of publishing papers of course.\n\nThere must be easier ways. How can one spend less time \"researching\" such options? It would also greatly simplify life. \n\nPlus you can be more productive if you don't have to focus on such tasks. Like the first sociology professor who made tenure despite making a sub-optimal choice with his knee surgery.\n\nThere is academic guidance on such matters - see https://www.americanscientist.org/article/knowing-when-to-stop - but they aren't very practical for the most part.\n\nPractically, when is it wise to strategically make sub-optimal, less-informed choices in life decisions in the interest of being more productive on the academic front and thus gaining more traction in the long run? When is it foolish to strategically make such sub-optimal choices? How about you - when do you stop \"researching\" choices?",

      "text": "I'd say when your research is actually preventing you from being productive. Delaying a decision has a cost to it and research just to get to the start line rapidly loses value once you've covered the basics. \n\nAlso I think you need to realise that very few decisions in life a truly solely based on evidence. Most decisions we make are a mixture of knowledge, values, emotions and compromise. Once you can understand there is no perfect rational decision and that all decisions are imperfect but that doesn't mean a negative consequences are bad or insurmountable than it gets easier. \n\nLastly, you have it the wrong way around. What you call sub-optimal is not sub-optimal if it gets you going and cracking on. Fannying about making a decision is sub-optimal, not the lack of perfect research. Sometimes you just have to JFDI.",
