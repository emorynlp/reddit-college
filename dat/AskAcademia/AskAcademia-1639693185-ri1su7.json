  "text": "I would like to join Georgia Tech's Online MSc CS program + a full-time job, however it's only course based in most cases (from what I can read on the internet). Would the lack of a thesis hinder my chances for a PhD if I decide to go for one afterwards?",

      "text": "I applied to that Georgia Tech OMSCS program, but ended up going with another school because of the same concern. My first master's didn't have a thesis, and I'd like to have done a graduate thesis in case I do want to finish a PhD some day. Consider the University of York's (UK) online program. They have a 6-month research project at the end (idk if they throw out the word thesis, but I'm pretty sure it qualifies). It's a little more expensive than GT, but it's also only 2 years compared to the Georgia Tech program which is 3 years. Plus, there's a general MSc CS option as well as specialized options like cyber security and data analytics. Worth looking into, especially if you want to do research.",

      "text": "Imho, no, but as always it depends. If you can get some practical experience one way or another, PhD programs will love it, but having some more classes (and good grades and recommendations) under your belt won't hurt either.",
