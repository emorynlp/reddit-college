As a frequent search committee chair, I instruct my colleagues to have *all* complete applications read before the first committee meeting, which is typically 48 hours after the deadline (we usually close searches on a Monday and meet on Wednesday).  I don't think getting it in *early* is going to make any difference, but you certainly do not want to be late.\n\nThat first meeting is the initial cut, so if your file isn't in (and complete) by the deadline it probably won't be read by anyone but the search committee chair and it's rare that on gets added to the short list late. When there are 200+ applicants for every opening (and 500+ in some fields) nobody is looking to draw the process out.",

Treating them differently based on submission of course makes no sense, but what difference does it make when they are read? I've been on search committees in academia, private industry, and government over the last 30 years and never once had anyone suggest there was a reason no to read them as they came in, or the weekend before the closing date, or whatever.  Our HR system releases applications to committee members as soon as they are submitted, be that for a janitorial position or for the provost. (The only difference would be for executive positions-- i.e. presidents --that are handled confidentially using a consultant.)",

You should contact HR at those schools and ask.  Some schools just don't have close dates and always accept until the position is filled.",

      "text": "(I'm not an academic, but I do employment compliance and AA/EO for a university)\n\nI do the training on stuff like this at my university. I counsel departments to have a support staff person (Office Manager, etc.) to receive the applications, send a \"thanks for your app\" email, and prep them for committee review. After the deadline date, the committee has access to the applications. They can review them together at a meeting, or review them individually and discuss them at the meeting.\n\nAs for advantages to the timing of your application, early is good in my experience. The most impartial ways to organize applications for review is by order received or alphabetically. Most of my committees go in order received. You want to be in the first 10-20 apps reviewed, not 90 or 100.",

              "text": "Our faculty hiring process is really decentralized. Each College, and most of the Schools/Departments, have at least a front office person to handle their day-to-day operations. That includes phones, calendars, meeting schedules, etc. but they also handle vacancy communications when necessary. I am under no illusions that they all do it perfectly, but I hope they are at least meeting the minimum requirements! If not, it's going to show up in some compliance audit or IA investigation and we can correct it from there.",

Yet, it still doesn't lead to standardization in any meaningful sense, save for ways which ends up being counter-productive.  Like, all the job calls are standardized, but totally unhelpful.  We can't solicit sealed letters of recommendation.  Search chairs can't be given permissions (beyond view) in the candidate management system.  Ugh.",
