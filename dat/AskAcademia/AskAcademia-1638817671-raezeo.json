      "text": "Generally speaking, it is difficult to do a masters in physics after a bachelor in engineering unless you have completed substantial physics coursework in physics during your bachelor degree. In particular, you need to have done well in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electricity and magnetism because these form the foundation of all physics subfields. At the graduate level classes tend to be significantly more involved than their undergrad counterparts and most engineering programs don\u2019t cover these topics in the depth necessary to do well at the masters level. Some electrical engineering subfields share enough overlap that there can be some exceptions, but I think this is rare. Usually what you see are people who have done \u201cengineering physics\u201d degrees, but these blend significant coursework from both fields to make the person capable of going into either.\n\nThe same idea applies in going from physics to math. It is possible if you have a strong foundation in math, but this would require you to go above and beyond what is typically studied in the usual physics curriculum.",

      "text": "I guess it depends on the program and then it depends on the system.  At least for bachelor -> masters. \n\nIm a physics engineer currently studying a masters in astrophysics. I know in the us you need a masters to be an engineer (Ithink) but not in my country. \n\nFor the phd\u2026 I would say it depends highly on what topic would you be working on, but I don\u2019t see a lot of sense in that. It\u2019s not like you choose a different undergrad program. I\u2019m just extending my masters work to my phd. If I\u2019m not mistaken a phd is you working on research, and I do know some people who did their masters in physics and then went to get a phd in astrophysics, but those two are not so far apart. What would you like to do with a phd in math after a masters in physics?",

      "text": "Theoretically, there's no reason why you couldn't do this. Math and physics are closely related and presumably you are going to take a lot of math classes to get a BEng so you should have at least some of the preparation.\n\nBut why would you want to?\n\nPractically, most people who have a goal of getting a PhD in subject X would try to focus their studies toward that goal. Many PhD students get a master's \"along the way\" (it's even possible to get a master's in another subject, though it's a lot of work).",
