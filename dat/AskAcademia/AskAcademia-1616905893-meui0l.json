  "title:": "PhD Revisions - Left for industry without completing revisions",
  "text": "All,\n\nEven as I'm typing this the shame and embarrassment are nearly unbearable. Even thinking about the my thesis sends waves of nausea through me.  I'm going to keep this both long, but fairly vague for anonymity.\n\nI completed a everything required STEM PhD course of study except for the final edits of a dissertation.  When I say that I completed everything, I mean all of the oral examinations, and my entire committee approved the thesis.  Essentially, I was able to apply to positions saying that I had graduate experience and was attempting to finish a PhD, even going so far as to submitting the signed committee forms.  The research is all completed, the thesis is written and only needs revisions.\n\nI could sit here and make excuses.  I had thought that I would have a little more input about what edits were needed.  I was then across the country for work, setting up a new life there, etc.  I figured I could take some time get settled and then get to work.  Well, days turned to weeks, weeks to months, months to a few years.\n\nPart of the issue with me finishing was that I failed to get the input I needed to know what edits to make before leaving.  That caused some severe anxiety and depression when I thought about it.  All of my email addresses, including my long-time personal email that were being used while I was a student were removed sooner than I thought, the personal email due to the email host being changed  by my undergraduate institution.  I didn't realize this was the situation for a month or two, during which there should have been correspondence with my advisor.   Well, this led to some more embarrassment and I just didn't send new contact information.\n\nThen I started thinking that it was too long, and getting in my head that way.  Well, it turns out that I really want to finish if that is even still possible.  My current job contacted me about not finishing, but my management vouched for me completing my responsibilities and had nothing but good to say about me, and the original posting didn't require a completed degree.  Since I've never claimed the degree to customers, just that I did \"graduate work\" (no PhD in my email signature, no Dr. honorific, etc.) they are saying that I don't need to worry and that the case is closed.  Either way, the shame keeps me up at night, its something I have to actively ignore or I start to have an anxiety attack.  It's starting to really effect me.  It's already gone on too long.\n\nI had a great relationship with my advisor, but I have essentially completely ghosted them.  I feel like I would get in touch with my advisor and see if there is any way to work something out (and of course apologize profusely), but I have absolutely no clue how to even try and explain myself.  There's a fear that I can't even explain that wells up when I think about it.  It's mostly shame and embarrassment, fear of rejection, I don't know.  Any advice is much appreciated.  Has anyone heard of a situation even remotely similar?\n\n**TLDR:  Ghosted my advisor feet from the finish line of a PhD.  Work, life, moving far away, and crippling anxiety with the revisions led to an extended period of no contact.  I would like to finish if at all possible, for future prospects or just to validate all of the time and effort I spent doing all of the hard parts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*  **Thank you** everyone for the encouragement and support.  Just checking in here with an edit to say that I've hit that \"**send**\" button on a very sheepish email.  I'm still not sure how I feel abotu it yet.  As u/GoldenBrahms said, it really did feel like ripping off a band-aid.  I don't know what the results will be, but I will update this post going forward, if not as a success story, at least as a cautionary tale.",

Once you write him/her, you're locked in to communication... but just writing that first email is going to be really *tough* (I know from my own experience), so just do it.   NOW.  \n\nStart writing the email the minute after you read this post, in fact.   (no more Reddit until you write the email!) \n\nKeep it short, be very apologetic, say what you would like to have happen, acknowledge that it might be more difficult now for everyone--apologize again for that--but be firm that you want to finish, and that you want to do it in stated (2 months? 1 month? ) time frame. \n\nThen hit \"send\", and enjoy a bit of peace-of-mind... it's out of your hands. \n\nThen, if the advisor replies that it's do-able... just do it.  The embarrassment of the situation will *definitely* motivate you to get it done this time. \n\nGood luck!

My favorite of those was a guy who failed one my my elective classes because he simply didn't turn in the major semester research paper during spring of his senior year. He called me up *six years later* and revealed that he didn't graduate because of failing that class...and was now up for promotion at work and they were wanting to see proof of the degree he said he earned when he had first applied six years prior. So basically he got a job and then didn't bother to finish my class, didn't graduate, never told anyone, and now the chickens were coming home to roost.\n\nI was happy to help him earn credit for the class-- in fact, he wrote an excellent paper over about two months. I had to get the dean to approve waiving the lost-passed deadline for grade changes, but he got his degree and his promotion. I'd assume anyone who had mentored a grad student clear through the defense would also want to see them finish. If for nothing else, simply to bump up the completion rate for their program.",

The best thing that can happen is that you can, in fact, finish your degree.\n\nIf you feel like you can send off that email, great. If not, consider talking about this with a therapist. More broadly, I hope that you are getting support for your mental health.\n\nFinally, I recognize that there is a stigma to leaving so close to being done.

      "text": "Do it as soon as possible! One of the professors at my undergrad university had a similar issue, only after about a decade they realized that he DID need to finish the diss to keep his job. So he contacted his old institution, but because it had been so long they required him to redo the dissertation (same topic but updated data and literature, since the field had changed in a decade). He decided he\u2019d rather not so he just quit. No idea what he did after that.\n\nReach out to your old advisor ASAP to see if you can finish it as is. The longer you wait, the greater the chance that you have to do more than just minor revisions.",

If they let you get to the point of \"Revise and Resubmit\" with your dissertation, they're passing you - they really just want you to change a few minor things. Like someone else said, fix a few typos and add a reference or two that one of your committee members wanted. \n\nAs long as you're within the time limit of however many years your institution gives you to complete the degree, it shouldn't be an issue other than paying for another semester of dissertation credits.\n\nYou should finish, and you'll likely feel better if you do. You say you had a good relationship with your advisor, I'm sure they were likely very confused as to what happened. They probably want you to finish, too.",

In parallel, you can check your institution's PhD graduation policy on maybe the registrar's site, or maybe on a graduate student handbook, etc. Most universities will have something in place that states, e.g., the PhD candidate must finish within 10 years of completing their qualifying exams. This would increase your situational awareness here, and as we all know, knowledge is power :-) Best of luck!!",

We have kept in touch during that time so it's not out of the blue, but just about everyone has dropped balls here and there and understands that life happens.)",

Contacted the professor about it and he offered really helpful advice on revisions and was excited to see something from his seminar get published. It had been over 15 years since I took the class, so most of the revision was updating references and case law. We too had been in casual contact over the years, mostly emails about books by a few authors we both admired.",

The university and your advisor has an interest in people graduating. Tip: don't make this seem like its a big deal. Substitute \"crying under a desk for a month\" with \"working my ass ass off making in a new position and <insert something interesting from field of study here>\". I remember a student who took months (6+) to make revisions as they started a new job and someone in the office was complaining about them when I was completing mine.  Good luck!",
