You connect it to your computer and use the pen as a mouse and to hand write. Most people use it to draw but since COVID, this particular brand has been making their devices cheaper, simpler, and more accessible for strictly classroom use. So there\u2019s a bunch of tutorials for classroom use. There\u2019s bigger ones too\n\nIf this isn\u2019t your style, and digital stylus and pad would do something similar.\n\nOn the flip side. The 2019 iPad has a pencil. Completely different but maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for",
