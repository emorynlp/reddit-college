  "title:": "When you get positive feedback from students, is it okay to let them know they can also tell it to your superiors?",
  "text": "This is in North America. I'm a TA and I got an extremely sweet email from a student of mine. I was wondering if it was acceptable to let them know they can let my department coordinator and the other person in charge of hiring TAs know about their appreciation for my work. My reasoning for this is that not only is it nice for me to know that students value the way I teach, but it would also make the people above me know that I do good work and that they should hire me again. I was thinking of telling the student, \"If you feel like it, you should let X and Z know about this so that they are also aware of your feedback.\" Is that okay and socially acceptable? Does this kind of thing have to come from students or does it look desperate (or sneaky) if the TA asks for this kind of gesture.\n\nThis is something I was thinking about also because I'm sort of upset about the hiring process where I work. I keep getting hired for courses with the less amount of teaching required even though I'm good at teaching and I get a lot of positive feedback from students. I do my best to let the admins know I have the skills for it, and somehow I get the lesser important classes. It bothers me a lot, especially since I love teaching.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice everyone! You convinced me not to do it :) Thank you!",

I just did that a few times though.\n\nI think the best thing to do is to direct your superior to any anonymous surveys filled by the students.",

Even if there is a course eval, I don't get to see it so I wouldn't know.\n\nThe student's feedback was by email, they wrote to me specifically. Unfortunately they kind of shoot down the professor I work for, so I couldn't send this to the prof either lol.\n\nWhat makes this uncomfortable? Just so I fully understand the opposite perspective, because I think you're right but I don't fully understand why.",

I have done this in the past, using the template of the \u201cnormal\u201d feedback forms, and have then sent this in to co-ordinaries and to referees for other jobs etc.\n\nETA: I would definitely not ask the student to also send the feedback to your line manager. If there is an open text form in the overall course evaluation they may well write it in there, but you shouldn\u2019t solicit it.",

I begged them to give me an easier one next semester by explaining how many hours I've been working (more than I get paid for), how my research and grades have been affected. They could not care less about the fact I skipped my own birthday this year or the fact I've been sleeping 5 hours on average.. be careful what you wish for. Once they know you're good, they'll suck you dry. \n\nOn a more serious note, if you really wanna teach, why don't you ask to teach a class rather than TAing? Is that not allowed at your school?",
