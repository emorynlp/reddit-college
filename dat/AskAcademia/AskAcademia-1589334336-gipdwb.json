  "text": "First year doctoral student here. I find that when I'm reading research papers on topics that interest me, I'm compiling a never-ending list of other studies referenced within the original paper that also pique my interest and seem related to my topic of study.\n\nWhat methods do you all employ to ensure that you can be surgical about what you spend your time reading/studying?\n\nOr am I being naive and this is now my life for the next few years? I have a feeling that is the case :)\n\nAny advice you have would be awesome. I appreciate your time!\n\nEdit: you all are amazing. I truly appreciate the responses and positivity. Great ideas all throughout.",

              "text": "Overwatch, although I don't think it would be great for relaxation. But, it you want a game you can play while working, OSRS is a great pick. \n\nOSRS is a reboot of a classic version of RuneScape, the only issue is that they have a paid membership system to access alot of content. You can play it for free, but you won't be able to do anything much. \n\nBest thing about it though is the Grand exchange, basically imagine it as a sort of player run market for gear and resources. But, you can use it like a stock market and make quite a bit of money in-game. \n\nThe worst thing is that free to play servers are overrun with bots that farm resources, and they compete with real players for pretty much everything. And if it's not bots, it's Venezuelans. They make more than some doctors in their country just by selling in-game currency for real money. \n\nI mean, if you're into RPG sorta games, I'd give it a shot. Even if you don't pay for membership, you can at least get a taste of a small portion of the game.\n\n(Or play Titanfall 2, one of the best games I've ever played. Fun campaign, still somewhat active multiplayer.)",

But in the end the only really important thing is that whatever you do with your free time is genuinely relaxing :) hobbies are supposed to be fun, not another source of stress (\"I haven't read a book this month\"/\"I haven't gone to the gym this week yet\"/etc). But it is true that certain hobbies do require a bit of effort to feel rewarding. Just try to find a balance that works for you.",

I find your method very interesting, and am wondering if I have been doing it wrong. \n\nFor a section I just plan the points that I want to cover, and that becomes my outline. As I elaborate on these points I go hunting for sources...I guess this isn't the right way to go about it. I was also considering first writing it all out then going for sources but I feel like I won't have enough material/will need to revise as I find what the source says.\n\nSo you first find whatever sources you need to write a section, and then you even outline which sources to use for the different paragraphs of that section?",

                              "text": "I made a conscious style decision early on to flow my thesis as smith did, smith wrote, smith discusses.  This way I could sequence sources.  It helped a lot to narrow my focus and stay on point.  \n\nI also used pretty intense leveling of my subsections so each subsection dealt with a single issue, and yeah I laid out everything I would need to make the point I wanted to in that subsection.  My thesis was 200ish pages, so the section unit could be several pages themselves.  But once you have the sources ready to review and lay out what sources you will discuss where the paper starts to write itself.  Also allows you to adjust the layout of arguments easier.\n\nAgain this method was created after a year of working on this and not getting a lot done so clearly I needed order.  Some may not need it.  I also heard of people using spreadsheets to organize their thesis that I wish I had done, but this worked just as well.  But for larger works over 20 pages the way you write as an undergrad starts to break down.  This method also allows you to work on different parts of the paper so if you are getting frustrated with the literature review can jump to methods for a bit, or parts of the introduction.  Or if you get sick of writing, can outlines sections that still need to be outlined or review a section that needs some editing.  Was designed originally to prevent writer's block motivation issues.",

My 4GB of RAM doesn't like it either. \n\nSpeaking of this, was your computer powerful enough for you to switch between games and open sources seamlessly?

Sometimes a section works as one paragraph, sometimes need several.  \n\nSo my outline for a section would be something like (sources will not be totally accurate):\n\nSRL Aptitude Measures:\n\nOverview (greene and azevedo 2010) \nMSLQ (Pintrich 1993)\nLASSI (weinstein and palmer, 2002)\nRRSRL (zimmerman and pons, 1986)\nSimilarities and strengths (greene and azevedo 2010, pintrich 1996, zimmerman and pons 1990)\nConclusions\n\nWhen I write up the sections I will use the results of the survey of methods from Greene and Azevedo to frame the section, then review the three methods.  So Pintrich's measurement model focused on ect.  I focus on what the authors said, not my opinions on it.  My opinions are left for the discussion.\n\nI am not outlining paragraphs, because those four lines will be 5 pages of text.  I would use as many paragraphs as needed to make it flow right.  Not outlining more than the sources for these, as I will be referencing the papers directly as this was a deep look at the measurement used (my thesis was a measurement paper), and the first source already tabled the highlights for me.  \n\n\nAs for my computer I build my own for around $500 following the old Potato Masher PC guide.  I ran 16 gigs of ram and an i5 and mostly played modded Xcom, which was aging by then, while thesis writing so tabbing between the two was not hard.  Really encourage you to build your own PC if you game on PC as it allow you to get more power and costs less.  Not very hard as before I made this one I knew nothing about the insides of a PC.\n\nI would shut down the Xcom program though while writing so I would not actually open it while moving between stuff.  Generally would not have chrome open either while writing.  Just my PDF reader, mendeley in case I need to snag a source I forgot, word (one document for the outline and one for the thesis draft) and for the results SPSS, R-Studio and a third document of the results, tables and figures.  No non-academic stuff opened as it could be distracting.\n\nIf you are moving into grad school, def get some materials on academic writing as it is a different beast.  Particularly get a book early on thesis or dissertation writing as they require a special way of writing.  Do not have suggestions here as my advisor gave me a lot of links and DETAILED feedback but if you make a thread people will have some recs I am sure.  The APA manual you will be expected to know inside and out most likely.  I swear my advisor had that damn thing memorized.",

In my field it's not uncommon to cite almost every other line you write. When you said \"Not outlining more than the sources for these, as I will be referencing the papers directly as this was a deep look at the measurement used (my thesis was a measurement paper), and the first source already tabled the highlights for me.\" did you mean you would use the references inside of this main reference of Pintrich 1993? \n\nYou could have the outline for each section in the thesis draft itself, you could remove it once you filled it in below, right?

I would also note what  sources I was discussing and what I was just citing as support in the outline.

The outline document also was a fast way to look at the general overview of the larger text to make sure I was not missing anything.  Also formatting got to be picky as hell as to auto generate a table contents properly you needed to use the style feature of word and temp text sometimes messed with that leaving empty sections that would show up in the table of contents and required you to fish out and delete.  Doing a thesis will really force you to learn word in and out.",

It is an opportunity for the student to familarize themselves with what has already been done in the field. So, they don't have to note everything that has ever been done, but they should have build a foundation in their lit review which will support what they plan to do in their research. \n\nDon't be surprised if you restart your lit review research when you get to your results and discussion. This is the next period in your thesis where you'll need to find what others have done to support your findings.",

That last consideration is not a criteria--I wouldn't necessarily limit yourself to essential reading! I mean instead that it is good to think about how related things are to help develop that sense of boundaries around related subtopics (the breadth of each; where there is overlap). Maybe give yourself a timeframe for this type of reading vs. reading that is for synthesis and digging in deeper. \n\nI guess I am suggesting you give yourself time for breadth, and time for depth. You can be surgical in how you spend your time and in the articles you read for depth, while still letting this freedom to learn about the breadth of research \"be your life\" for a while.",

And whenever I come across an interesting reference, or someone recommends I read something, I just put it in the sheet. It's saved so I don't have to read it now. But I can come back to it when I need it; when I'm writing a paper that I need to reference it for.\n\nThese are the columns of my spreadsheet;\n- Title, \n- author\n- type of material (monograph, edited volume, article, book chapter etc)\n- year of publication\n- who recommended it to me (if it was a situation where a supervisor or colleague said hey you should read this - if I just find it in another research paper then I'll leave this blank)\n- and then I have three columns called keyword 1, keyword 2 and keyword 3*. \n\nThis really helps me prevent that problem of 1000 PDF tabs open, distracted from my current paper, too excited about my field to focus on my work.\n\n*Using data validation, I make sure that each of these columns have drop down lists of keywords which I define on another sheet in the same document so that the key words don't get out of hand. For instance that means that if I do end up writing a paper on \"landscape\" rather than \"music\", I can easily sort those columns alphabetically so that all of the references that write about the same topic are grouped together.

My list is currently nearly 200 items long and I've only been doing this for a few months. \n\nBut the driving mental mechanism of the system isn't \"Ah yes, I'll go back and read this at some point\". Surely the fact that I've come across so many things in less than half a year demonstrates that we could NEVER read all the things that we have the \"Oooh I should/would like to read that\" thought about. Because time, but also because video games, sex and the outdoors are things that exist. \n\nSo I wouldn't say things going to die is a flaw in the system, since the goal of the system isn't to \"keep them alive\". The goal of the system is to turn that aimless \"Ooh\" moment I mentioned above into something useful that actually serves your research.\n\nThat's where the keyword part of it all is so important. For example, I'm in the middle of writing a literature review of the anthropology of Mongolia. Using my system, I've been easily able to identify a couple of dozen monographs and articles about the anthropology of Mongolia that have caught my eye recently. It's made this essay unfathomably easier to write.\n\nA monolithic reading list alone isn't something worth returning to. What I'm describing is more of a self-defined reading list generator. Imagine getting a reading list for a seminar and being excited to read every single item on that list. That's what this is like.\n\nScreenshot of my list: https://imgur.com/RnwiYQu",

I still have a lot of references that I haven't completely read. You have to learn to fast read papers. After a while you get used to how paper structures work and you can jump to the relevant part of a discourse.\n\nUse a reference manager it will be your friend. Make it a habit to source your references with abstracts, this will help you immensely! I use Zotero and when it can't extract the abstract I go in and fill that in. On the same note, if using a reference manager keep an eye on the tags that are populated and make your own; little tip, make sure you have a READ tag for the ones you're done with and READING. I also have a folder in Zotero called 'On my Desk' so I know what to get back to. Also set up specific searches so you can pull out relevant references.\n\nTo be honest, if it weren't for Zotero I'd be in shambles! All you need is a system that works for you.\n\nWhen working with physical references like books, I've made it a habit to keep a record in Zotero as well, and though it might seem overkill to some I've been typing in all my notes including verbatim text from books I've referenced into Zotero. Do this so I can search through all my references with ease so I know which ones to look at. And it helps to quickly cross reference. Also by typing it in I've started retaining information more which is a plus! On the same note, don't know if this works for you but I have an Atom+Zotero+Pandoc setup so I can quickly make references and type without having to jump around alot. You don't need to have this kind of a setup but I feel you don't want to be spending alot of your time gathering your references to write.\n\nAlot of the time I am scanning the pages I will be honest. But once I realize this is something of relevance I'll take the time to read the whole thing. I've read entire chapters this way, and skipped entire chapters this way as well.\n\nFinally, I think it's necessary to find the time for yourself. The best times I've had have been reflecting on my work while making artefacts in the workshop (I'm a design researcher so half my time is spent making physical artefacts as well). But take some time out to give yourself a break in some way. My work has alot of game design so I end up playing games as 'research' that also helps with stepping away from the desk.\n\nPoint is, find something that works and stick to it. Don't fret over the details of how much knowledge you have in front of you. There's always going to be another bend in the rabbit hole. It is important to stop and reflect. Give yourself a day in the week or an hour in the day to do that and gather everything you read till then.",

          "text": "Also, and this is something my supervisor agreed with me later, I've realised there comes a point when you see the same references bouncing back at you. This is an indicator that you have saturated an area of the topic at hand enough. So it's probably time to focus on bringing it all together. Of course, every paper will have multiple references that are in their own unique areas of interest. You have to be focused though, and this isn't something that comes around in the first year. Find your place in your research.\n\nMy PhD proposal was about design, human memory, and IoT. At the end of my first year it was game design and object-oriented philosophy. Everything I started with my proposal was still there, albeit in a different form. This form was more focused, you have to allow that to happen and if that means running blind down a few rabbit holes, that's what you need to do :)",

When my supervisor wants something to show, it usually isn't possible for me to read 10 different papers (at least *effectively* read 10 different papers).  I will read a couple papers, and then I will only read more papers the next time I have something come up in my research that requires me to read more papers, which will probably be in a couple days.",

      "text": "Lots of good advice in this thread. Just to add on, I've found it helpful to only open 5-10 papers at a time. Once I hit that limit, I pause and look over the papers that I've opened up and go through the abstracts. I'll usually find that most of them either, (1) aren't as related to my topic as I previously thought, or (2) aren't as interesting as I thought. My hit ratio is about 1-2 out of every 10 papers is actually worth sitting down and reading. Definitely follow the rabbit hole, but setting a limit on open papers allows it to be a productive journey. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "All the responses on here kind of prove Academic culture is completely oblivious to unhealthy behavior. If OP experiences time blindness and obsessive link-following along with the inability to stay on topic and organize their thoughts, it could be indicative of disorders that interfere with executive function or mood. (This is not an uncommon problem to post about on r/ADHD). These issues are exacerbated by sleep deprivation, caffeine intake, and high stress, all of which Academia normalizes.\n\nOP, how long do these rabbit hole sessions last? That you\u2019re looking for advice on how to regulate your own behavior and disengage from research is a bit worrying. Are you having trouble picking a topic or not falling down rabbit holes?",
