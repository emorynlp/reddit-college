  "title:": "Taking an \"academic\" break between Master's and PhD?",
  "text": "Hey everyone! \n\nI'm in the life sciences field and now faced with the decision what I want to do after getting my masters. I would have the opportunity to start a PhD right away, however, I feel like I want to see a few institutes & countries before \"settling down\" for a PhD. I have seen quite a few labs during my undergrad studies and have always been a good student, I'm a bit worried that it might be seen as an unnecessary break in my CV later-on if I take 6-12 months before starting. What are your views on this? \n\nThank you for any insides!",

Do you just mean \u201cget a tech job working in a lab\u201d because that is completely normal.\n\nETA: Don\u2019t forget the application process is almost a year long so if you do not apply in the next few months you probably won\u2019t start next fall anyway.",

              "text": "You won\u2019t be penalized for taking time off, but 3 months is too short to really get much done in a lab. People will probably be hesitant to hire you (especially if you need a visa or something given that you referenced multiple countries) for such a short time. You\u2019d be better off staying in one place for a year.",

Everything can be taken the wrong way, and a break in studies always leads to questions. \n\nBut, if its for post grad research and you get to be included on a paper, that is a different story.\n\nAlso, do what's best for you.",

      "text": "Start the PhD, in my opinion. You're in the school momentum, keep it up. After the first year or so of a life science PhD you also have a bit more free time to do work that interests you. I also did an internship while writing the dissertation. In just a few short years you can be done with your education and have all the freedom in the world.",
