  "text": "I am currently in the process of applying for a job (assistant prof/lecturer) for the next academic year. It goes without saying that one must apply for as many positions as possible and as early as possible. However, this year I found myself in the position of being offered a job relatively early while still being in the middle of the interview process for another position. Moreover, the year is still long ahead and several countries in western Europe advertise new positions throughout the whole year and not in a seasonal manner like north America, the UK or Australia. \n\nMy question is the following: how do you handle these early offers throughout the year while still being on the lookout for \"better\" ones? In my case, I felt that it would be really dumb to turn down the offer while having no other options (+ the deadlines for answering are never in the order of months). With the HR already dealing with the paperwork, I feel it is extremely cruel to announce, six months later and after they turned down all other candidates, that you are not coming. Moreover, the interview processes are long enough to make you bond at some level with the members of the department, which does not help either.",

      "text": "It depends on exactly where in the process you are (assuming you\u2019re not a rockstar). \n\nIn general, if you have get an offer and you think you will get a second offer within the next week (or maybe two weeks) because you\u2019ve completed the interview process at a second school a few weeks ago and think it went really well, you ask for time to consider and ask when you need to give a final answer. Most places will let you have a week, some two, few will let you go past that. \n\nThen you contact the other school(s), let them know you have an offer but are still very interested in their position and ask when you think they may make a decision. \n\nIf the second school can get back to you before your deadline, great! If they say they can\u2019t, there\u2019s nothing you can do to change their mind. You can\u2019t speed up their process.\n\nNow, this assumes that you\u2019ve completed all of the interviews at the second school. If you haven\u2019t, you can still contact them and ask if it\u2019s possible to speed up the interview process, but it only makes sense to do that if you have at least two weeks to consider the first offer, and the only step left is the final interview. \n\nIt can take days of planning to arrange an on-campus interview, the search committee may not all be available to meet at the same time this week, the dean may be out of town, and then it takes at least another full day after that for them to take it to the provost/chancellor/whatever, get approval for the hire, draft the official offer, etc., so if you need to make a decision within a week, the answer will be \u201cno\u201d. \n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s all about how comfortable with risk you are. Based on your field, how many interviews you\u2019ve gotten, how many applications you\u2019ve sent out, how good of a candidate you think you are, what backup plans you may have, how confidant are you in getting another offer that\u2019s about as good?",

          "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write an elaborate answer. It is indeed tricky to time everything to perfection. As others said, the best strategy is to apply only to those positions one is willing to accept. In my opinion,  one can be more selective only once tenure is achieved or when one is a rockstar (which is not my case :) ).",

People do it all the time, but you definitely get a reputation. \n\nIf you\u2019re still thinking about it, then there are a few things to consider. Do you have/have you had other interviews? If you\u2019re waiting to hear back from one or to go on one, then you may be able to squeeze a bit more time out of the offer. Or to negotiate something more. \n\nIs this a job you\u2019d be willing to take? Generally, the advice is not to apply for a job you wouldn\u2019t take. But it\u2019s hard to know what that means when you just want *anything.* But if this job is good enough, I\u2019d say go for it. You don\u2019t want to turn down that first offer and end up with nothing in hand later this year.",

It did help (a lot) in this regard but I decided not to do it this year because once you get an offer, it just messes up with your head. I guess also that once you have a permanent or a TT position, it is easier to cherry pick and apply only for the \"better\" ones. At a postdoc level, this is less easy, especially if you are on a work permit conditional to always being employed.",
