I was reading www.bls.gov for the \"mathematical sciences\" post-secondary teachers, and almost half of them are employed by junior colleges, and their wage is comparable to their college/university counterpart, but I assume that you are teaching almost exclusively, and only lower level undergraduate classes.",

Job security and a livable salary trump faux-prestige all day, everyday. Adjunct life is not fun. \n\nThat said, comparing TT jobs at R1s and CCs, neither is \u201csuperior\u201d to the other. They are completely different jobs with different priorities. People who love the pressure of research and publishing will thrive at R1 schools. Those who love to teach and work with undergraduate students will find life at a CC more rewarding. \n\nIf you want TT at an R1, neither of these options have a high probability of getting you there.",
