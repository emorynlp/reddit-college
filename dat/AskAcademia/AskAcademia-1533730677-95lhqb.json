  "text": "Hi! \n\nI'm a grad student, planning on doing a PhD. Whenever I tallk to my friends who do/have done PhDs they often tell me the experience made them miserable. Most of them abandoned the project of an academic career afterwards. Likewise, my Facebook feed is saturated with with those \"Shit Academics Say\" types of pages, rife with self-deprecating humor and grim jokes about depression and burn-outs.\n\nI guess my question is: Is it really all there is? I think I need to hear more positive experiences as well so that I can have a more balanced view of what academia entails, especially during the precarious PhD years.",

      "text": "I graduated from my PhD in the UK recently. I don't want an academic job (not sure I ever did) but my PhD was the best thing I have ever done. I met wonderful people, undertook some challenging research and I gained skills and experience I never expected all while being paid for the privilege. I also never burnt out or had to work crazy hours, so it's certainly not always like that. That said, plenty of my friends did work long hours and didn't enjoy their work. \n\nIt depends what's driving you to want to do it, I think. If you still want to do a PhD knowing you might not be able to get an academic job after (or might not want one) then you should go for it. But if you're unsure maybe take some time out and work for a year or two - you can always come back once you're sure. Equally you can always quit your PhD if you start it and you're not enjoying it.

I asked this sub last month if I should get the PhD and then leave academia after graduation to pursue a more fulfilling career (firefighting) and I was mocked and instructed not to. It was implied that what I was doing was unethical because my thesis advisors would be banking on me landing good postdocs and jobs after grad and not work with them for 4+ years before riding off into the sunset. \n\nWith that said, do you think there's anything unethical or potentially misleading about leaving academia after graduation? \n",

She gave me lots of advice and suggestions for avenues I could consider for a career outside academia because I'm still working out where I want to go.\n\nAcademia is like any other job - you can do your PhD and decide to move to a new role after you've got what you want out of it. Considering how few academic jobs there are anyway most people aren't going to get a job even if they want one! The funding body who funded my work put on lots of events supporting PhDs into roles outside the academy throughout my doctoral studies and it was assumed from day 1 that we'll all take different paths afterwards. Remember that the people in this group are all still in academia so you're getting one side of the coin - there aren't lots of people here who got the PhD and then left (but there are a lot of those people out there!). \n\nSo if you want to do a PhD and then move on to firefighting then you should go for it. Don't let strangers on reddit stop you from pursuing your dreams! :) ",

                      "text": "I managed my time using a passion planner - having all my targets for the week written out and ticking things off each week really helped me. I also did a lot of other stuff, which was useful to see timetabled in - teaching, organising conferences, going to conferences, sitting on committees, research assistant work etc. Timetabling these activities into my week meant I could see what time I had left for research and not overestimate how much work I'd get done.\n\nFor avoiding burn out: I kept 9-5 hours and was very strict about it; so much research shows you don't get more done for working 60 hours a week! I worked in the shared office I was given access to almost all the time instead of working at home (which is an option for humanities PhDs - we don't need to be in a lab). Though in the last year those hours increased to 9-6. Being with other people really helped me, though its not for everyone. \n\nI think working those hours made me think of it more like a job, which helped me keep my emotional distance from work. And being in the office meant I left my work in the office when I went home. I also prioritised sleep and social time to keep me sane - I saw friends at least twice a week and slept 8 hours every night.\n\nFinally I think it's so important to be kind to yourself. So much of a PhD is psychological and keeping yourself feeling like you're making progress and feeling good about yourself and your work. Having a bad week? Accept it and go home and relax. Try again tomorrow. Don't try to push through - you'll get nothing done and you'll feel like a failure. Got less done than you wanted? Well you probably did more than nothing - all progress is progress! Got lots of conferences or other non-thesis work on? Accept you won't make progress on your thesis that month and plan accordingly. \n\n(Sorry didn't mean to prattle on but I hope this helps someone!) ",

      "text": "Your mileage may vary, but my sense of it from having done it and seen many others do it (this is for the humanities/social sciences, in the USA): \n\nPhD: The first few years are GREAT, because you're getting paid (not much, but enough to scrape by) to learn new things, and the people you're surrounded by and hanging out with are also doing the same thing, and your job is just learn learn learn. It's awesome. The last few years are TERRIBLE because you're sick of being poor, sick of being marginal, sick of being taken advantage of, sick of scraping at the boot heels of professors, and you're just _trying_ to finish the thing, but the world is generally _not_ cooperating in that endeavor, and the job market is _looming_ over you, and your friends have all gotten super stressed out (or have left town), and you're surrounded by these new PhD students who are having a great time, and you start to feel _ancient_, and you have _so much uncertainty_ about the future. So it's unpleasant and stressful and sucks. The tipping point between awesome and terrible can vary by person (in my experience, people who go \"straight through\" to the PhD after undergrad feel it earlier, and people who worked in a \"regular\" job for awhile feel it later, although that can vary if they were used to earning more money).\n\nAcademia: If you get an academic job (big if), and if you get a tenure-track job (huge if), your happiness depends on a lot of factors, including but not limited to the specifics of the institution you're at (are you valued? are you paid well enough to live how you want to as an adult? are your colleagues enjoyable or toxic? do you like living where you've ended up? are you being encouraged to do what you wanted to do in the first place, or are senior scholars forcing you to do work you don't want to do? are you going to likely get tenure or is this all just a 7 year postdoc?), as well as your own headspace (you're probably in your 30s or 40s by now \u2014 did the decisions you made in your 20s pan out the way you wanted? do you gaze upon your friends who did other things with envy? do you _have_ any close friends anymore, after spending the last decade and chance moving around the country as the PhD and postdocs required? did that race for a tenure-track job leave you with a midlife crisis? are you totally burned out on the job?). It's the sort of thing that is very hard to predict in advance, since your likely first tenure-track job position will probably be started at least a decade after you start your PhD, and the decade of your 20s to 30s involves huge life changes for most people.\n\nWhat I'll say is this: I like what I do and I have a hard time imagining doing anything else I'd like to do more. Are there things I might tweak if I had omnipotent powers? Sure. Do I think academia can be super frustrating and stressful at times? Of course. Do I wish I had taken a different path? Not really. On my best days, I'm paid to research and teach exactly what I like thinking about, and it's tremendously rewarding, and it's super fun. On my worst days, I am stuck in service meetings and filling out forms and dealing with the occasional nutty colleague and (gasp) grading midterms. The latter still strike me as acceptable, and probably some form of that exists in every job. It's a good gig. \n\nBut you should be aware that it is not by any means a path of least resistance, or an easy way of life. It is full of things that people in other professions consider insane, and rightly so. It is a strange career in the modern world, in ways both positive and negative. I do not encourage many people to pursue it at all, and do not encourage anyone to pursue it lightly. It's not quite on par with taking a monk's vows, thank goodness, but it's also closer to that than many other types of careers.",

He put a healthy amount of energy and attention into it (less than 40 hours/week, for sure), which was far less than most of his friends and peers, but still had a decent CV when he graduated.

You can move jobs if you hate your boss, you can move if you don\u2019t like your project, you can tailor your career around your personal/family life. \n\nI use the military comparison because in a PhD you have about as much influence over your experience (of course the consequences are much less severe). If you luck out and get a really nice advisor and lab mates, you\u2019ll have a wonderful time, if you get a bunch of assholes you\u2019ll have a terrible time and you are still basically locked in to working for them or you will have to start your PhD all over again somewhere else. \n\nAlso, like the military, those that stick around long term and excel at Academia are usually the people who would really struggle in a mainstream environment. Others do their 7ish years, get a bunch of awesome skills (leadership, discipline, strategic planning etc.) and then apply them outside of the military (usually for better pay). Sounds like academia to me. \n\nBasically my point is: \n\nWhether you have a good or bad time in academia has very little to do with your own choices. It\u2019s a lottery. ",

If you're willing to grow as an academic and have the opportunity to build upon everything you've learned so far, it is definitely worth it. It's a lot of work, so it really takes determination. If you're uncertain, maybe take some time off to decide. For me, the most important thing to remember is that I'm doing this for myself most of all and not for others. ",

      "text": "This is such a complicated question because there are SO many variables; institutional culture, your field, your advisor, your classmates, your financial and personal situation, your personality  etc.  I have to say that for me, all the stars aligned when I was getting my PhD. I was living with a partner who had a \"real job\", so we were able to afford rent, food and even vacations.  I went to a school that was slightly competitive, but not to the point where my colleagues were assholes.  My advisor wasn't the greatest, he was pretty hands off and unmotivated, but sometimes that's better than working for a slave driver.  My school also guaranteed 5 years of funding, as long as I taught 2 classes a semester, which I gladly did.  As soon as I finished my degree, I was lucky enough to land a one-year visiting assistant position at a liberal arts school and then lucky enough to get a tenure track position at a public institution right year after that (again, big element of luck here, in my opinion!). \n\nThe biggest thing for me was taking almost 10 years off between undergrad and grad school, which gave me some perspective (IMO) about what it means to be \"stressed\" and \"overworked\". The other thing, is that being grounded in the world outside of academia always made me feel like if academia didn't work out, then there are a million other jobs out there.  I don't really know how to express this without sounding like a jerk, but I just think we need to keep some perspectives.  Is our job difficult and demanding at times? Sure, but most competitive and specialized jobs are.  Are we underpaid? Maybe. But, we get nice benefits and don't have to teach for almost 3 months out of the year.  Do we have to deal with annoying students? Yes, but again, I'd rather have to do that than be somebody's boss.  At the end of the day, you can either sit around and only talk about the negatives, or you can focus on the positive aspects of your daily life. I choose to do the latter, which I believe has helped me tremendously. ",

      "text": "I'm starting my third year as an Assistant professor at a small liberal arts college. I know you asked about grad work but I think the job search was the most stressful and depressing part of my grad / postdoc time. During my search for the elusive tenure track position I felt like all I read was negative comments about how so many folks spent several cycles looking for positions without success. Further, I have the two body problem with a spouse in a very similar field. So finding TWO jobs in the same area (according to the internet) was just impossible and one of us should just accept being an adjunct or stay-at-home parent the rest of our lives. The reality... I don't think the happy people post much online. Most of the long winded blogs and posts are frustrated people looking to vent their frustration. The folks happy in their graduate work, or in the job search are doing those things and probably don't have time to write about it. Like me, right now... I should be doing actual work.\n\nThis is obviously one very specific situation, but I found a tenure track position and my spouse found a visiting that has now turned tenure track and both are within reasonable commuting distances at two separate institutions. I think what helped was that we were reasonable in our expectations - that is, we identified what we wanted to do (teach and research) and we didn't limit ourselves when applying. We took advice from others but paid attention to where it was coming from. For example a PI at an R1 institution is going to frown at heavier teaching loads and tell you not to waste time with teaching because it detracts from research. But I had a TA and I trained undergrads and it helped me land this position.. which is an undergrad only institution with a major focus on undergraduate research. So if you're looking for happy people, count me as one. I won't say that I haven't worked hard and had many moments of \"why the hell am I doing this!?!\" during grad school, but in the end I find that if it wasn't difficult then it probably wasn't worth doing. Hope this helps.",

Mark Humphries recently published an interesting article that Academia actually is the *alternative* career, since most people end up somewhere else.  \nIt's somehow still treated as failure to leave Academia, but it's actually more likely to leave than being able to stay.\n\n[Academia Is the Alternative Career Path - Why pretend otherwise?](https://medium.com/@drmdhumphries/academia-is-the-alternative-career-path-106c89fc3412)",

              "text": "A lot of people decide to not even try, since it's such a problem.  \nChances to get a Postdoc are usually somewhat ok, but even there are less positions than PhDs. The further up you go, the worse it gets. In many fields the chances of becoming a Professor are extremely small. Even of you decide to try, you will have to move every few years, your contracts will be limited in time and the pay is a lot worse than in industry.  \n\nA job in industry on the other hand usually pays more, has a better chance of being permanent and therefore does not require moving that much.\n\nTherefore many people who are passionate about science choose to rather go with that kind of stability.",

But in this case, I was talking about people I know really well and who've talked to me at lengh of their decision not to continue: they were clearly put off by how nightmarish their PhDs had been and job prospects in academia were not the main problem (not to say that it isn't a problem in general, just that it was not their main reason). Even for one who hadn't even planned to continue after the PhD in the first place, her mental healh had suffered, hence my question. \n\nThank you for the article, by the way, which is very illuminating and sobering.",

      "text": "If you do a PhD in the US in a lab-based field, be very cautious about what lab you go into. Lab culture here tends to be very exploitative, which is why you see so many PhDs taking five or six years, or even more. Talk to previous students from that lab, both those who graduated and those who left academia, about the culture and lab environment. Try to find a lab where the PI treats grad students as students, and not as employees.\n\nI didn't know to do this, and had a very bad experience doing an MS in Biology. I only talked to previous lab members after things started going grimly, but took solace in the fact that I am but one in a long string of graduate students my PI has made miserable. I'm not quite discouraged enough to quit academia, but I am burned out enough on lab work that I am changing fields and pursuing my PhD in Epidemiology instead. This time, I've done a LOT of legwork, and my interviews were much less about getting into a program and much more about making sure it was a good fit for me, and a match with my lifestyle, values, and career goals.\n\nI think that I am probably not the only prospective grad student who forgot that graduate work is supposed to be a *mutually* beneficial arrangement. You aren't just working for your advisor, your advisor is working for you. If you keep that in mind when you are looking for a program and an advisor, you will be OK. And try to stay away from labs where graduate students take a little too long to graduate.",

      "text": "I submitted my PhD thesis (law) in January. I loved it. Three years and three months of being totally free to read about, write about, and talk about whatever I wanted. I had a good supervisor who recognised that I was capable and left me to get on with it (which was what I wanted and explicitly asked for), but was there for advice when I needed it and kept me pointed in the right direction. I didn't find it stressful or difficult at all, despite having several deeply difficult things happening in my personal life at the same time (such as major surgery and the death of a sibling). Even the viva was no bother, really. Just a chat for a couple of hours with people who had read my work and had some thoughts on it. \n\nI honestly had a great time doing my PhD, and would happily do another one given the opportunity. \n\nI'm now 6 months in to an Oxbridge postdoc, which again is supposed to be difficult and stressful if you listen to other people, and so far so good. I'm busy. There's a workload, but I can handle it without eating into my non-work time too much. There's pressure, but it's good pressure. My supervisor and colleagues are intelligent, supportive, kind people. I haven't met anyone yet who hasn't been. I've begun to sketch out a long-term research agenda, people think my work is good, and all in all things are going well. I'm enjoying it.\n\nedit: except for the expenses system. That's bullshit.",

      "text": "For what it's worth to have one more positive voice in here, I've had a great experience in my PhD program. Currently working on my dissertation, R1 in the social sciences. Certainly luck factors into how I feel (I ended up with a great advisor, am studying what I want to study, am in a supportive department with great funding, and am in school somewhere cost of living is low). I can't question that.\n\nThat said, though, having a realistic outlook helps. I worked a 9 to 5 for a few years before starting my PhD, which is different than a lot of other students in my field it seems. I have an idea what the private sector life and my future would have been like without this degree. And I'm just a lot happier now. Sure, I may not get the job I'm hoping for when I'm done, but it's not like I won't ever get a job in general. If I don't get to be a professor after all, I'll still have good skills to dedicate to finding another job (better than what I could get before grad school). And chances are, there's something else out there I'll like well enough, too. Meanwhile, I'm getting paid to do something I enjoy right now. With a flexible schedule! So, I don't quite understand the doom and gloom that some folks I know assign to the possibility that they won't get an academic job. That's just life... You plan what you can, and adapt to what comes.\n\nI think some people are miserable in grad school because they're forcing themselves to do something they like \"in theory\" but don't enjoy in practice. And unfortunately, that's probably not going to get better when they become professors. What I'm told, is that being a grad student doesn't feel that different from moving up to the next level. Personally, I found working as an accountant much more stressful than what I'm doing now.",

I'm able to get some financial support to travel for conferences and study opportunities (in my case, language immersion), and I get to meet like-minded people while doing so.\n\nPut another way; a lot of us complain about academia and grad school, but there are reasons why we haven't all quit.",
