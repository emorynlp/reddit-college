When do I submit my letter of resignation, to give the department enough time to adjust? What do I say in my letter of resignation? \n\nTruth is, I hate my job. I hate being a professor. I hate working as hard as I do, and still I'm begging federal institutions for grants and money. I hate making exams, and grading papers. I hate my life. I'm planning to leave whether or not I have a job lined up because I'm just that miserable. But I want to do it in a way that doesn't sabotage my reputation. \n\nAdvice please.",

You can avoid most long term commitments if you just tell people that your plate is too full to take on new projects. You don't owe the department anything beyond professional courtesy - that means do your best to ensure a smooth transition of your responsibilities. But the will be loose ends, and that's just the nature of leaving a job.\n\nRegarding your resignation, all you need to do is give them the amount of notice your contract specifies, and your resignation letter just needs to say that you're leaving to pursue other opportunities. It's a formality, not a chance to express your feelings.",

No hard feelings, but I'd personally *absolutely* prefer to have a private heads-up as far in advance as possible because if someone leaves without warning in late spring I'd have to scramble to cover their classes for fall, or even risk losing the line. It wouldn't be a problem to keep that info confidential, but even better if the dean knew too so we could start conversations about a term hire to cover the classes.\n\nNobody I know has resigned from a tenure-track position *without* telling the chair in advance at my school. It's a courtesy to do so. I've had no problems providing positive references for people who have left of their own accord that way. If someone simply bailed in May and left us hanging, though, I'd consider that unprofessional and would be much less willing to provide more than a basic \"yes, she worked here\" sort of reference.\n\nPeople leave academia all the time. Two friends of my did so one year after earning tenure. It's not uncommon, but doing it professionally will make it easier for everyone.",

There's always negotiating going on between deans, chairs, and colleagues that you're not privy to, and a TT line is a big card, especially during a recession.\n\nBut in informing yourself about timing, see if you can dig up the posting date of your position and other faculty postings from the past few years. At my school, I'd mentally backdate the posting date by two months; that's the lead time a chair needed to get approvals, have a couple faculty meetings with the job on the agenda, etc. before they were ready to post the job. For us that meant jobs were posted in mid-fall, job talks in December or early January.\n\nI'll also mention that anecdotally we get more and better-qualified non-white non-binary candidates when there's more lead time. When there's a time crunch to fill a slot, the listing is seen mostly by people faculty already know, which may be a less diverse pool that your dept would like to see.",

Those requests are due in April for fall hires to start a year later. So we're talking 18 months, more or less, between the initial request and the new hiring getting an ID card.\n\nAs a chair I'd simply want to know as soon as possible.

We have a ladder system so each year of service nets you another $1,000 or so. Promotions in rank vary; it's about $2K for promotion to associate but 12-13% for promotion to full. I hit full around age 45 so am topped out; all I can get now are the step raises. But the gap between a new hire (zero experience,  assistant professor) and myself (\\~25 years experience, full professor) is only about $25K annually. We do have some dead weight on the faculty but none of them make it to full, so they are all making less than those who were promoted to full...almost all of whom are quite productive or are carrying serious service loads or both.",
