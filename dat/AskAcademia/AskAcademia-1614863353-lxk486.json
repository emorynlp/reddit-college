  "title:": "Best practices for promoting your research after journal acceptance?",
  "text": "Longtime r/AskAcademia lurker posting here for the first time! I'm anticipating hearing good news about a submission I recently got a minor-revision decision for. It's a meta-analysis my coauthors and I are really excited about, and we think (hope) it's particularly newsworthy. We plan to promote on social media (maybe even on r/science) and reach out to our universities' media relations folks, but I would really appreciate it if others could share their experiences executing successful marketing campaigns for their research. Would it be feasible to start promoting upon acceptance, or would you advise waiting to announce until the journal posts a typeset version of the paper online ahead of print? For context, I do social science research (hence the tag), and the journal has an anticipated 2020 IF above 4.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much for the silver, /u/D3ADSH0T6581!\n\nEdit 2: The paper was officially accepted today! Thank you for the congratulations and invaluable insight, everyone!",

To my understanding publishers (including OA) often like that there is no public discussion of the results after acceptance until the embargo is lifted. I am not entirely sure why but I encountered this every time I get an acceptance. The embargo is usually clearly stated in the acceptance email.\n\nEdit: Usually this time is used to prepare the press release. On the day the embargo ends you can release all your advertisement on all your channels and overwhelm humanity with the news of\nyour results.\n\nEdits 2:\nHere is a link to the embargo policy of Nature Communications (a fairly expensive OA publisher)\nhttps://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/press-and-embargo-policies",

We've done that a couple of times over the years. Yesterday I sent some data to a co-author to write another one.

Engage with relevant conference hashtags when appropriate. Is their an organization that is relevant to similar work? If so, offer to write a blog post about it in their platform. If there are follow ups to the work and folks who may be engaged in that type of work, send it to them directly or say what your thoughts are for follow ups and whether they\u2019d be interested in collaborating or know who would.",

I\u2019d also go via LinkedIn over FB if you want to do social media promotion.",
