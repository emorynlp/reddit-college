  "text": "Apologies if this is gonna sound like seeking for a career advice or counselling but I really do hope to get some insights especially from those who have experience in the academe. \n\nSo I graduated with a bachelor's degree in European Languages (French, Italian) and have been working in various multilingual customer service jobs which are VERY high-paying in my country, using my skills in different languages (French, Spanish & Portuguese). While the pay is definitely satisfying (I'm a breadwinner too), you would imagine how demotivated and unfulfilled I have grown in a job that doesn't have the intellectual satisfaction that an academic person (by that I mean who loves studying and doing research) looks for. I'm now at a point in my life that I'm determined to start changing careers as I don't want to be stucked in this forever. \n\nI've always wanted to enter the academe and secure a teaching position. And now, I'm in the process of choosing a Master's program that fits my interests as well as my existing skills and experience. Now, I know you would bring up the necessity of getting a Ph.D. to become a professor (I assume most of you here are from North America or Europe). In my country though (third-world), you can be a lecturer/professor with just an MA/MSc to teach undergrad  level (and even grad level) subjects (probably due to the lack of Ph.D. holders). I've narrowed down my options to the first two below but I still included the other ones I'd considered (who knows): \n\n1. MA in European Studies - This is so far the most straightforward path given my undergrad. My current interests are in IR and IPE and this program just combines IR, economics, history and sociology. I also think I can be confident in this program and I can make this my niche. However, I'm wondering why no professor from this department has an MA on this at all. I noticed that they would rather MA in Political Science or International Relations (maybe perhaps EU studies is too narrow?), so I tell myself, why don't I follow suit? \n\n2. Masters in Political Economy - In relation to my previous sentence, I think this program might be better as it doesn't focus on a specific region and offers courses in IR, IPE, International Economics, Public Policy, Development Studies which are all my interests. My only conflicting thought is it's too broad (shouldn't I just pick the EU studies and specialize in it?). I hate my conflicting thoughts! \n\nOthers I've crossed out (not entirely): \n\n3. MA Economics - This used to be my priority as I'm interested in Macroeconomics, International Econ, Trade and Dev't Econ. Besides, it opens more job opportunities in the event I realize the academe is not for me. I've decided though to disconsider this path as I have no background in Math and Statistics. I can take units to prepare but that would be very tedious and impractical at this point. The school told me they offer summer bridging courses but I don't think that's enough for me to survive the rigors of Econometrics and Mathematical Economics. (I regret not choosing this as my undergrad!) \n\n4. MA Psychology (Personality Psychology) - If I were free to choose a field I want to do research in, I would choose this! But for some reason, I think the field is not very socially relevant and feels like more of a hobby. Although doing research and publications in Personality Psychology is something I'm very willing and glad to do (I have doubts on whether I'm able to publish in the fields I mentioned above although I guess it's more of a self-confidence problem). \n\nNote: Fall-back career opportunities might not be a problem as I can always go back to the high-paying multilingual customer service positions although I'd prefer not to. \n\nThat's pretty much it. I know in the end it's my choice but perhaps you can offer insights that may help me in my decision-making process. (How about you? What factors did you consider when choosing your specialization? Did you choose it out of pure passion?) If you have ideas not included in my options above, feel free to bring it up. \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "You have similar interests as me. My background is in development/political economy and I also have a regional specialization in Asia. With this combination (but with a traditional discipline PhD), I landed an area studies postdoc, disciplinary TT job1 and an applied TT job2. My advice is never to pursue a PhD in area studies. Go for a discipline-based training. It will be harder and more work, but that will payoff later. For your case, that would be something like political science or economics (over departments that confer PhDs in political economy, development, or regional studies). Academic job market is very limited in all these fields but you will have more options with a PhD from a discipline. If your dissertation focuses on Europe, you can easily crossover to an area studies department and teach/publish with the framework and expertise you acquired from a more rigorous disciplinary training. The reverse unfortunately is almost impossible.",

Doubly so since you have a skill set that makes you very employable.\n\nI\u2019ll add that you can be a professor, even TT, in the U.S. with just a master\u2019s degree in your area. It happens at small universities and community colleges and is not uncommon.",
