  "title:": "Rejected from all PhD applications, feeling directionless. Where to go from here?",
  "text": "Here's the deal. I applied to 12 grad schools for political science studying contemporary China in the 2018 cycle and did not get into any of them. I don't know why I was rejected completely - I was told by my advisors and grad school admissions staff that my application made me a strong candidate, I have internships and a great GRE, and I had great personal recommendations - but just that there weren't enough spaces and very vague advice about 'fit'.\n\nI'm not completely helpless though. I had my masters in public policy and I have a job (just under $20/hr and with great health insurance) in university administration where I'm using my Chinese language skills. So I could be worse off. But I'm just coming out of a nasty cycle of high-functioning depression and now that my mental health is getting better I'm looking for ways to boost my application for next time - I don't know if it'll be this cycle, but maybe the next one.\n\nI've talked to several professors of mine and they've suggested working on a study-abroad research fellowship in Taiwan to give my language skills that further boost, and I'm working with a former thesis supervisor of mine on an essay on stages of US foreign policy that might be published soon. Not in a peer-review journal, though, but more likely a regional affairs website and a public affairs magazine.\n\nI've also entertained the idea of teaching as an adjunct for a semester at a local community college to at least see if I'm suited for teaching and to see if I can contribute in some way.\n\nI do have my MPP already. I've thought about working in government but a few applications I have fell through there as well. So I'm really not sure where to go. I've felt stagnant over the last few months and I want to get out of this rut.\n\nI know this is a really long post, but I'd appreciate any advice you all would have.\n\nEdit: Seems like my issue was not having done enough to build up connections with potential advisors. I'll work on that ahead of the next application cycle as a priority. Thank you all for the feedback.",

If there's no overlap (or if you can't explain how you would draw on multiple professors' interests for your newer/less common field, which sometimes works for strong students) then even an outstanding student can be turned away.",

      "text": "I feel pretty complicated about a slew of messages coming in about \"keep trying\",  not because the OP couldn't get into grad school, but because advising someone to go into a PhD in this job market (even though at the moment PoliSci is doing okay compared to other fields) is, arguably, negligent. \n\nThe criteria to get into a Ph.D. gets more competitive, and this only gets worse the higher up one goes. We know that the expectations of one's CV have changed radically in the last decade in terms of publish or perish. Even adjunctships from Ph.D.s are competitive.  \n\nI think in this case, really mediate on what you want out of a PhD. If it is an academic job, then look at the placement rates for graduate students in your field. How many get academic jobs after their degree? What was the average number of years spent in postdocs before that? What was  the average salary when they attained a tenure-track job? Academia encourages a sense of virtuous self-sacrifice for the art, but considerations about health insurance, geographic stability, and job security are real issues. \n\nIf the thing that you want at the end of a PhD is a government job, keep applying to government. jobs. Same for NGOs. Yes, a Ph.D. might get you paid more at a government job later, but discounting the opportunity cost of 4-10 years in not moving up in one's position as a government worker (or other field for that matter) is bad math. \n\nAdjuncting is one way to get  sense of your love of the teaching vs. research skills, but the most important thing about such an experiment might be: how little money  am I willing to live off of with no benefits?  This is what happens to an increasing percentage of humanities and social sciences Ph.D.s after graduation. Similarly, if you do any of the working abroad experience, this advice might better serve you if you think of it as both a chance to make you more competitive to get into grad school, but also for other careers paths. \n\nAlso, before I write a letter of reference for anyone wanting to go to grad school I ask them to consult a few articles on mental illness (especially depression and anxiety) as a grad-school work related hazard. Examples [1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1995.76.1.345) & [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733317300422) & [3](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Leyton/publication/13938815_Stress_and_depressed_mood_in_medical_students_law_students_and_graduate_students_at_McGill_University/links/59e48fab0f7e9b97fbf0625a/Stress-and-depressed-mood-in-medical-students-law-students-and-graduate-students-at-McGill-University.pdf). This is not to say that people with mental illness or who have had mental illness should not go to grad school, but to ignore the risk that grad school is correlated with onset of depression and exasperation of pre-existing depression is also irresponsible.",

Therapists aren't life coaches, but a part of their job includes helping a client/patient come to better know themselves, directions for one's future included. \n\nRemember that language skills are an amazing asset in career pursuits (and also in life more generally).",

In my school, if I have the money to hire a new PhD student and have advertised and interviewed for the position, I get to make the finial decision on admissions (provided that they meet the school's minimum entry requirements). \n\nI often see students submit PhD applications saying they're interested in my topics and hope I would supervise their research, but I've never talked to or seen them nor have they made contact with me.

          "text": "TL;DR: Work on the paper and study-abroad fellowship for sure; only try the adjunct if it will pay better than your current position. Find ways to interact in-person with potential PhD advisors such as attending a conference they're going to and/or arranging a campus visit. Other things you can work on is making it easier to search information about your academic experience by creating ResearchGate and Google Scholar accounts. Details are below.\n\nWork on the paper and maybe try to cite a few of the potential PhD committee chairs (particularly the ones in your top 3 programs) if you can/makes sense to do so in the paper. It will keep your name on their radar (my PhD chair has alerts set up with his ResearchGate and Google accounts to get notified whenever any of his papers is cited by someone else and he's probably not the only one who does this) and so they'll be familiar with your name/work when you apply or reach out. Continue to read their current publications and reach out via email to maintain those connections. If there's a national or international conference you can attend (plan ahead and save up for it), see if any potential program members/people you'd want to chair or be on your committee are attending and try to meet up with them, even if it's for coffee/quick word between sessions.\n\nI would work on the fellowship, it could be a good back-up plan (hopefully leading to additional connections for another application round), or if you do get accepted, your program would probably work with you so you can attend both (arrange some independent study or transfer credits). \n\nIf you can't do the conference (or want to show further interest), try to arrange a campus visit to at least your top 2 programs (do more if they'll cover the full transportation costs/you can afford to do so or happen to be in the area). Be sure to arrange these before the application deadlines for better chances of getting accepted. Contact the person you want to work with and say you're very interested in the program and would like to arrange a physical visit. Universities/departments often have some funds set aside for recruitment that can be used to cover (partially or full) getting students there for a visit. Other universities might have a \"open house\" where they'll try and arrange all interested graduate student visits into a single 2-3 day period, just make sure the faculty you'd like to interact with will be there. Departments have to keep track of campus visits for university statistics/budgeting reports, so it's likely that admissions committees will know whether a student visited or not (which shows great interest over some \"nobody\" who didn't, it matters when they're ranking competitive applications and have a tie among other aspects like GRE, GPA, C.V., etc.). If a student didn't visit and there's no one on the committee to speak up for them, they'll get bumped based on the assumption that they're just not as interested in this program and have applied to it as a back-up. \n\nI might advise against taking the adjunct position if it pays less than your current job. It might look \"good\" on an application, but most PhD programs will allow you to gain that kind of experience through their own teaching assistantships. Your goals right now should be saving up for relocating to a PhD program and building better connections to the programs you want to get accepted to. The thing about adjunct positions, is that they may not allow you the time and flexibility to arrange campus visits and revise applications. Many PhD graduates take on these positions and end up in an endless loop of them because they don't have the time to apply for tenure-track positions, travel to campus interviews, and continue to maintain a strong publication and grant record (top two things needed for making the short-list of tenure-track interviews). It might be different for someone trying to get into a graduate program, but you might also be up against PhD graduates who didn't get a tenure-track position or post-doc and are applying to adjuncts as a court of last resort. \n\nOther things you should try to do is create a ResearchGate account (it's free) and maybe a Google Scholar account (also free), so that you become \"findable\" when/if someone from a admissions committee searches for your name. Be sure to include a photo of yourself (professional head-shot, or one from doing fieldwork, or if you don't have any of those, a candid one taken by the university while working at your current job; preferably get a professional head-shot taken). It will also help them to place a face to the name and react with \"oh yeah, he/she came for a campus visit, I've forgotten their name, but I do remember them sitting in my seminar during their visit\". See if your potential advisors/departments/labs have links to their current students' research websites and try to make one for yourself using those as a model (wordpress is free and what many of my chair's previous students use). Mine has a basic introduction page, a page about my research/research interests, a page listing my current and forthcoming publications (you could adapt this to be something like \"Projects and Publications\", including your planned paper and any conference presentations you might have done/have planned for the upcoming year), awards and scholarships page (you could include undergraduate awards/scholarships if need be), a page highlighting lab and fieldwork I've done (I'm in archaeology, so it's expected you have done field and lab projects), and a link to view/download a pdf version of my CV. I also link my ResearchGate and Google Scholar pages (with those profiles including links to the wordpress website).",

By the way I\u2019m in the same boat but have been lucky enough to have a professor who supervises the positions tell me just how many stellar applicants they are forced to turn down and how hard to choose it can be.",

      "text": "I'm doing a poli sci phd atm and admission statistics are really frightening - It's tight and people on the admissions committee look for any part of your application that is weak to be able to cull an applicant. Who gets admitted ends up being pretty much based on luck in the end. So there's definitely no shame in trying again for the next application cycle. If you're not 95% percentile or above on the GRE, definitely give it another go since that's a very easy, tangible part to improve. \n\nAnd as other posters have noted, reach out to faculty that you could be interested in working with. Take a look at their working papers and see whether there's something they are doing you find intriguing and could apply to your own research interest. Being genuinely interested in faculty research and demonstrating that is the way forward. Don't send a generic \"hi, I want to do a phd, would you let me\"-email since faculty get a lot of those and they seem to harm applicants more than they help them. That being said, I was admitted without reaching out to faculty so it's not a necessary step. But if you do it right, it probably won't harm you. \n\nAlso, don't go into just any phd program. The Poli Sci job market is super competitive so I'd advise you against trying lower tier schools if you want a job in academia afterwards. Even with a phd from a top tier school you are by no means guaranteed a job. And you can have solo-authored papers in the top journals and not get a single interview for a job even coming from a decent program. So don't compromise on program quality just to get an acceptance if your aim is to go into academia. \n\nAnd a note. You are competing with extremely bright, motivated students from China if you state that your research interest is Chinese politics. So it might be a good idea to think about what your strengths are vis-a-vis that type of student and why an admittance committee would ever pick you if they have one spot for a Chinese politics PhD in a given cycle. Definitely don't change your academic interest on the basis of what you can get admitted for, but it might be worth it to think very critically about what your specific strengths are and what you can offer a department that other students cannot.",

This gels with some of the advice my masters' thesis advisor gave me recently - not to lower my standards for the programs too much, to get more connections, and so on. \n\nMy GRE was 164/164/4.5 and I was thinking of retaking it to boost the essay score at least. \n\nThe market is worrying. I've reached out to some of my peers and people a few years ahead of me. People in top public schools are still having trouble with postdoc positions. It does look worrying but I really don't have any other strong career preferences. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'specific strengths' - do I emphasize languages, programming, working on technology policy, my limited experience in government...? What would stand out here?",

              "text": "Re. specific strengths, this is something you should talk to an advisor about since I don't know you.\n\nUnless you're a native Chinese language speaker (writing, reading, and speaking at university level), your language skills are not really going to stand out (although do mention them of course - they show dedication and interest). Many departments are getting amazing applications from native Chinese speakers so unless you think your language skills or on par with them, the language skills are not in themselves that attractive. Although, again, they show something about how seriously you've devoted yourself to your area of focus so do mention them. \n\nIt will most likely be your unique combination of skills and real life experience that's going to sell you to a department so make a plan together with someone who knows the application circus well and preferably also someone who knows the different departments you are applying to.\n\nAlso a note on you public policy background: Make sure you show that you know there's a difference between public policy and political science. Read articles focused on China published in the top political science journals (APSR and AJPS) to get a taste of the kind of questions that are usually tackled and are considered important for the discipline. Maybe even some of the more comparative politics focused journals (CP, CPS, World Politics, etc.) and China specific journals (I have no idea...) if you have the time. \n\nYour GRE scores are about average for the top departments. So not something that will disqualify you, but they're definitely not selling you either. If you think improving them would be relatively easy and pain free, I'd say go for it. If not, they're not disqualifying you, so don't waste too much time and energy on them.",

I review PhD apps regularly and reject most of them. \n\nThere are hundreds of reasons why you may not have been accepted to one school but getting rejected from 12 seems like a problem in your application or a disconnect between your application and the field/schools you are applying. Maybe the schools are too high quality given your GPA? Maybe there are serious flaws in your writing? Maybe there are problems in your letters? \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to say. Contacting professors in advance is important but that can\u2019t be the only reason in my view. Unless you applied to programs without Chinese politics specialists with a proposal focused on Chinese politics or only applied to Ivy schools where contacting the professors in advance is basically required, I can\u2019t see that as the primary reason.\n\nThe only other thing based on what you wrote is that you want to study something in 2018. It might be that your project is just not feasible methodologically or that it doesn\u2019t have any broader theoretical consideration. A PhD is not a masters.",

      "text": "I ran into this post this morning and it's really stuck with me so I wanted to comment even though the sub has probably moved on. I was in the exact same boat as you almost 10 years ago -- rejected by every Comparative Politics program I applied to despite what I thought was a decently strong application, felt directionless, and ultimately went into a depression for a few months.\n\nIt wound up being one of the best things that ever happened to me. I started dating my wife (who I never would have dated if I'd gone into a PhD program), started a career in University administration, got a professional master's with my employee benefits, and realized that a PhD program would be a bad fit after half of my wife's cohort in her PoliSci program dropped the program before completing their PhDs. I enjoyed my 20s a lot more than any PhD student I met, got my career off to a good start, and now I make more money than I would if I'd gone to grad school (this is more an indictment of how junior faculty are paid; I'll probably never make Full Professor money but I've still got ~10 years before that's a factor). I still get to work on campus and be involved with campus life, but my job market is a lot less competitive and I have some benefits (paid vacation time! no expectation that I'm answering my email after 5 PM! more career flexibility without having to move across the country!) that I'm sure most faculty members would love. (edit: I'm also physically a lot closer to both my family and my in-laws than I'd probably be otherwise, since I can focus on a given city/state/region when I go on the job market; this has been extremely helpful for starting a family.)\n\nIt absolutely sucks not being able to go to grad school when that's all you wanted to do and I'm not going to tell you otherwise. But not getting in was great for me in the long term and if you decide to not pursue academia as a career, then it will be for you too.\n\n(Also if you're at all interested, consider looking at student-facing staff roles like Student Life, Residence Life, Student Conduct, Counseling, Advising, etc. A lot of institutions have steadily increasing enrollments of foreign students and are starting to emphasize hiring staff with Chinese language skills to meet the students where they are.)\n\nIf you do wind up applying in another cycle and get accepted, then the time off will be good for you too. I find (from my wife's PhD program, my Master's program, and various graduate programs I've supported on the staff side) that the students who come in straight from undergraduate struggle to balance research, teaching, and service such as they are in grad school. Students who took some time off, especially those who worked demanding jobs, tended to be able to compartmentalize better and had better time management skills.\n\nGood luck, OP!",
