  "text": "I'm (24f) going to local college for phlebotomy and blood banking. I've been doing really good in school and have kept up to date with all my debt. \n\nThe worry thay I'm having is that I went to sign up for the spring semester and they said there was a hold on my account until they got my hs transcript.... I didn't do good in hs at all. I was in a really bad home situation and it showed. \n\nI'm scared even though I have no debt with them and I've been getting A's and B's there that they wont allow me to continue my education. \n\nIts really stressing me out and I'm worried about it. Any insight would really help. \n\nThanks",
