  "title:": "USA PhD students getting FICA tax - is this normal?",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I am a biology PhD in the USA. I am here looking for some advice. I have found out recently that quite a few graduate students in our department have FICA Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from their paychecks (aka more money being taken out of our paychecks). The IRS states that students are exempt from FICA taxes. Typically FICA taxes are withheld from paychecks for professional employees - The IRS defines the criteria for what makes professional employee in this link: [https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/student-fica-exception](https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/student-fica-exception)\n\nGraduate students (at least at our institution) do not meet this criteria. For some reason though, we are told to not register for summer credit hours which results in us losing our student status and having these FICA taxes withheld in the summer. This occurs when students are listed as Research Assistants for the summer.\n\nMost other universities in the US seem to have clear FICA policies clearly defining when/how graduate students are exempt (enrolling for half- or full-time credit hours). Our University does not have any FICA policy listed online for graduate students. I am curious how many PhD students out there with yearly stipends have encountered FICA tax and if your university clearly defines when and if you will have these taxes withheld from your pay. Even if it is correct for us to have these taxes, I think our students at least deserve to know when these taxes will be taken out as it lowers our pay significantly (about $100 per paycheck). I am working with higher ups to try to get this issue resolved.\n\nAny help/advice is appreciated! My tax knowledge is limited so I am trying to make sure I am well researched as I approach the university about it.",

      "text": "It's pretty standard to pay FICA in the summer when you're not taking courses and be exempt in the fall/spring.\n\nI'm guessing you're told not to enroll in summer hours because the funding only cover X hours a year or it's mixed sources and the grant that covers summer funding can't cover summer courses.",

          "text": "Yeah it just seems inconsistent - see my above comment but there are some summers we are told to enroll in credits and others we are told not to enroll. But the stipend amount doesn't really change so we end up taking a hard hit in the summer if we do have to pay FICA taxes. One summer I was actually awarded summer credit hours by the university but my department told me not to enroll - this was actually a mistake on their part. I was supposed to enroll but I didn't. Meaning I had no credits which resulted in the FICA tax. Our department just doesn't seem to have correct information. I just want to see clear policies.",

              "text": "I guess I'm not sure where the tax issue is. I'm in the same situation and it sucks, but if you're not enrolled at least half time during a given semester, you aren't eligible for the exemption. There might be a work hour limit too. Most grad students don't qualify in summer semester and owe FICA. \n\nIt sounds like there's some sort of department or institutional policy or funding source thing that is stopping you from enrolling in summer certain years.",

      "text": "When I was in graduate school, my university did a weird thing. For student employees (including graduate students) not enrolled in the minimum number of credit hours needed to avoid FICA taxes, they had a mandatory 7.5% contribution to a TIAA retirement account.  3 credits was the minimum for avoiding FICA (and I think that's not university-specific, but a government policy.)\n\nWe were not funded for summer coursework unless there was some very good reason for it (example: intensive language course relevant to research and only offered in summer.) So, when we worked as instructors or RAs in the summer, we had the 7.5% deduction for the retirement account instead of the FICA tax. I think we still had to pay into Medicare.\n\nThe bad: this contribution works out to be a bit higher than normal FICA (6.2%, though 4.2% for a few years during the Recession), so even less take-home pay. The good: I was able to take the money out - with penalty, of course - during one of those tough summers after grad school when I was expected to front the money for a cross-country move while having no source of income.",

          "text": "Huh that sounds really odd. I've never seen that situation. I am fairly confident ours is not going into a retirement account that we can access. It's just not fair because taxing us for retirement or FICA is not worth it for graduate students, we barely make anything. There's a reason the IRS made graduate students exempt",
