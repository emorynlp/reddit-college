My handwriting and note-taking skills are on a steady decline and are now at the point of being basically useless.\n\nAs an undergraduate, I did a couple of months of research in an archive where computers or cameras were forbidden. Everything had to be \"copied\" with paper and pen, and then be transcribed to a computer when I got home. I developed some serious callouses from that pen work and the notes were pieces of art compared to the stuff I produce today.",

I can type faster than I can think properly, so hand writing forces me to slow down and be considerate when note taking (from primary evidence and from scholarship).\n\nETA; though now I hand write on an iPad rather than a note book, I only made this switch because I lost a notebook before I had typed up the notes (though I did find it again, it was enough of a shock!)",

The only other time I'll refer to a hard copy is when doing revisions of my work and I might make some annotations in pen before editing later.",

I know several poets who write exclusively with fountain or even dip ink pens. At least one of my recently retired colleagues was still in the habit of drafting all their work in pencil on yellow legal pads. Others keep field notes in manuscript form. So sure, *some* people do.\n\nAs an historian I've worked extensively over the years in archives that don't allow patrons to bring in *anything*; they provide blank sheets of paper and pencils. So I've taken a lot of notes that way when forced to. But it's mostly going to be by choice in almost every other circumstance.",
