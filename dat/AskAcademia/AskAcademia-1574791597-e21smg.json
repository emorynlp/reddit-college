  "text": "My boyfriend is in the first year in ON, Canada and his prof has canceled 8 classes this semester...that's four weeks of content that is still going to be on the exam still...is this allowed? I've looked at by-laws but the focus is on students and their academic procedures.  \n\nSome of the classes she was in a conference, some she was sick and I understand shit happens, but all of them were canceled with less than 24hrs notice. 2 of the classes, the students were in class and she just never showed up. I'm an upper-year and I have never had a prof cancel more than twice. I just don't think this is professional or okay at all, but he doesn't know what to do.",

I try never to plan to cancel more than 3/36hrs per semester (as much as I aim for zero, sometimes it's just not possible with conferences, field work, etc), and replace those with optional workshops so students don't lose out on classroom time.\n\nThat said, most institutions don't have strict rules on this... for tenured professors. They do tend to have rules for adjunct/contract faculty.\n\nThe easiest recourse here is to express it on the class evaluation. You'll stay 100% anonymous, it will go on their record as a professor, and it's low effort. But, a single evaluation also doesn't have much in the way of odds of changing this.\n\nAnother option would be to email your department or program chair. The email should be polite, short, 100% accurate (facts, not feelings/reactions), and to-the-point (e.g., Prof. X canceled 8 classes this semester. They simply no-showed for 2. While I understand things happen, I feel like this interfered with learning goal X and Y. Sorry for having to email you about this, but wanted to let you know.). There's a little more risk here (e.g., you could be 'outed' as the one who did this) so you might choose to do this after the course is over. You could also consider doing this through an anonymous email account if you were concerned about your identity being exposed. Again, though: professional, accurate, and concise.\n\nFinally, you could see what university-wide options exist in terms of an Ombudsman or student advocate. Your student government could help you figure out who to contact. This might allow for an anonymous option.\n\nI'm sorry. That's a really shitty situation and it's not fair of the professor/department. I appreciate your desire to share this so that it's handled appropriately.",

Canceling for any reason should only happen once or twice per semester. \n\nI would agree that he should contact someone like a department head or dean of students.

Simply not showing up is unprofessional-- I would never accept that sort of behavior from my faculty. At the very least they can text one of our department staff who will send out emails and post notices on the door if someone is sick.

In my experience, labour disruptions are hardly spontaneous - when TAs went on strike (and twice when we voted not to) at UofT, we clearly communicated the possible outcomes to students well ahead of time, as did instructors and the university. I believe that most unionized universities would have similar procedures. So I doubt that a strike would spontaneously cause a class to be cancelled 24 hours beforehand.
