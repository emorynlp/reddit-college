  "title:": "Research assistant Interview",
  "text": "I recently graduated with a masters in chemistry and was lucky enough to apply for a research assistant position at a university working on a project closely related to my final year project (electrochemistry). \n\nI have now been invited for an interview at which I\u2019ll have to give a short presentation on my career history and an analytical technique. Unfortunately all I have is my degree, some part time jobs in hospitality/retail, and some odd bits of extracurricular activities at uni (mentoring, societies).\n\nI guess I\u2019m just asking if anyone has any tips for a recent graduate at their first research position interview?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Assuming you did a capstone project/dissertation/some kind of final year project, you can refer to that heavily from undergrad; from your masters, use your dissertation knowledge as well. If you ever did a group project, that's an example of teamwork, as is working with coworkers. Researching and writing your dissertation is an example of organisation, time management, independent learning and working. Mentoring is an example of leadership, working with others, taking responsibility, and communicating university level subjects to others in accessible language. Societies too. Working in hospitality and retail was an example of communication skills, tailoring your approach to a diverse range of customers, problem solving, etc. etc.\n\nThink of what skills they're looking for and how the activities you have completed relate to those. Remember STAR - Situation, Task, Action, Result. Try to apply this to every example skill you think might be useful (they're all useful).\n\nThey don't expect you to already know everything, but will expect you to show how you've improved at things throughout your university career and what skills you can bring to the table. Don't be afraid to make it sound \"better\" than you think it was - no such thing as \"bad\" experience, so long as you can demonstrate that you've learnt from it.",
