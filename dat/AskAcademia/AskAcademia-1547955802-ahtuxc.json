  "text": "Fifth year Ph.D. student in physics. Got through my quals, my candidacy, and I'm supposed to defend this semester. The problem?\n\nI published a paper last year. Got a result that I (and my collaborators) thought was good. Now, a whole bunch of new data just got released and it completely trashes the procedure I used in my paper and that I was using for my next paper. These two papers plus a third I'm second author on were going to be the bulk of my thesis.\n\nI'm really freaking out now. I can't write a thesis with a bad procedure, and I can't publish bad science. I have no idea what I'm going to do. Two weeks ago I was at a conference feeling good, and now the rug's been totally yanked out from under me.\n\nI have no idea what to do. My advisor seems less freaked out than I am, but not happy, and I'm seriously terrified that everything will fall apart yards from the finish line.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do now?",

You can brainstorm a small side project or reanalysis or something that will help you find some strengths in your approach, or quantify the errors from it, or build upon this new data with something unique that you have.  \n\nMost PhD theses don't change the world.  Many get proven wrong, or end up being kind of pointless, or are sloppy.  Negative results and intermediate procedures that get improved upon are one of the foundations of scientific progress.
