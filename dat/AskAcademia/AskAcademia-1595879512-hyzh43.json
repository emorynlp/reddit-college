  "title:": "Why Don't Other Disciplines do Open Access?",
  "text": "Disciplines like physics, math, and computer science post virtually all their preprints (and thus papers) to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org).\n\nWhy don't other disciplines (e.g. psychology) do likewise?\n\nNature, for example, says that posting preprints online [is fine](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/preprints-and-conference-proceedings).\n\nContext: I'm not an academic, but like to read research papers. I don't have subscriptions to all these journals because I'm not a member of a university. [ArXiv.org](https://Arxiv.org) allows me to read about the latest developments in computer science, but I'd like to do that for other disciplines like psychology.",

      "text": "Linguistics is an interesting case. Most of the older journals (Language, Linguistic Inquiry, Natural Language and Linguistic Theory) aren't open access, though authors can pay a few hundred dollars to make their works open access (many institutions subsidize this, especially in Europe, but most in the US don't). There is an important new journal that's taking the field by storm though. It's called Glossa, and it was formed after a rift between Elsevier and the editorial board, largely over open access issues. The entire editorial board left and were funding by the Dutch government to start Glossa, which is totally open access and online. The are also famous for a very quick turn around and excellent editorial oversight - whereas most journals take \\~6-12 months for reviews, Glossa does it in days. I think most people agree that the field is moving towards a model like Glossa, with other journals, notably Linguistic Inquiry published by MIT Press, slowly moving towards more open models.  \n\n\nEdit: The editorial board that founded Glossa were previously with a journal called Lingua. The journal is still in operation, but the editorial board is very lax and now only publishes work of highly questionable scientific rigor, as more serious, scientific authors have boycotted them. Its current manifestation is called \"Zombie Lingua.\"",

In physics data is (correct me if I'm wrong) more straight forward and it's less likely that it's just correlation, irrelevant or wrong. In Medicine there's like 1000+ different factors that influence a study because every set up is insanely complicated and we practically don't know shit about anything. For example, you can test a new drug in mice and everything seems to go perfect, then you put it in a human and that person almost dies. And nobody would blame you for that person almost dying, because even when you do a study to the absolute best of your abilities, there's still a big chance stuff turns out completely different.

The margin on those is often razor-thin, and while some are open-access, support has to come from somewhere for the necessary work to handle the pub.  In some disciplines, grant money and institutional support are strong enough that they can charge a fee to the author, but that's not the case in a lot of disciplines.  \n\nIt's a problem because we'd naturally like our work to be read as widely as possible, but very few journals in my subfield offer the option to make articles open-access.  Those that do charge more than anyone not well-established can afford, and even more still if you intend to make it available globally and not just in one market. That's maddening because it furthers inequity, so a lot of us circulate our PDFs quietly.  The most that we get is freedom to distribute the last non-typeset version of the manuscript, and a URL that allows the person to download a PDF 'offprint.'  Those, sometimes, get spread more widely, but there's nothing systematic.\n\nThen, of course, there are two other problems.  The first is the fact that we're a book discipline--and that's a whole 'nother problem with accessibility.  The second is connected to the human factor, in that work available on open-access platforms is automatically seen as 'lesser' when we're up for promotion or the like.  That's changing, along with the bias against online platforms and non-traditional expressions of scholarship, but only glacially.\n\n(edit: Yes, of course, we do have open-access journals, but they struggle mightily for these reasons.)",

We don't have access to anywhere near the level of funding that the hard sciences get, so author fees are generally paid out of pocket, and we're a predominantly single-author field. Open access publishing is very expensive, especially for grad students and early career people, while those who can afford it, by and large, don't see the point.\n\nMy discipline is more backwards than most though; a lot of our major journals aren't digitized at all. The up side of this is that there is a healthy black market of illicit PDFs, and younger authors are generally willing to share their material if you ask.",

The individual journals, however, struggle to survive and obtain access to readers outside the big packages, so most surrender to life within the broken structure that depends on our free labor [as editors, reviewers, staff, and authors alike].  However, journals in the humanities have always been poorer relations in terms of the big for-profit companies' holdings [edit on those two words there].  \n\nThis whole structure is one I hope the rise of open access will change; if I'm doing labor for free (or on my public uni salary) why am I in legal jeopardy for sharing the results?  It must change, I think, because most academic institutions no longer have the funds to subscribe to everything.  Interlibrary loan is already cheaper a lot of the time now.  Elsevier isn't that important to us, but we're saddled with Taylor & Francis and that sort, who do *exactly* the same sorts of things, probably with similar financial results.",

To a journal, pre-prints might as well not exist at all as part of the literature.\n\nIf person A posts a pre-print on arXiv, person B can go right ahead and submit a paper on essentially the identical topic and get that paper published in essentially any journal in the chemical sciences (my field, presumably the same for biological sciences) provided the study passes peer-review. However, if person A's pre-print is previously accepted in a peer-reviewed journal, person B now has lost all novelty claims. Now, the burden is on person B to make a case for why their work is distinct, often resulting in what is perceived to be \"less impactful\" work (and therefore less likely to be accepted at a fancy-pants journal). This is what matters most to the community when we talk about priority claims.\n\nFew people actually care about the first date someone put the idea online. It's nice and all to be first, but it's infinitely nicer (for an academic) to have the published paper.\n\nFor what it's worth, this exact scenario just happened to me. We put an article online as a pre-print, which later got published in a peer-reviewed journal. While our manuscript was under review, someone submitted an extremely similar paper for review at a different journal (no pre-print), pretended as if our pre-print never existed (i.e. didn't cite our work), and successfully got their article accepted and published a few months after ours went online in the peer-reviewed journal.",

I would say it's becoming more common to post to preprint servers as time goes by, but things move slowly.\n\nIn various discussions, I have heard of several notions that disincline people to post to preprint servers:\n\n* One reason I know that some people don't like to post preprints is that, in many cases, the preprint article is noticeably inferior to the final article.  Peer review, for all the criticism it receives, is actually helpful to at least some degree more often than not.  Articles revised after peer review are often a lot better than the original submission.  By submitting to a preprint server, some people fear the possibility that an article with flaws or mistakes will become part of the official record and conceivably haunt them in the future.  Sure, there's no guarantee that the article after peer review is free of flaws and mistakes, but still, that's the thinking for some people.  If flaws are going to be caught, they'd rather the flaws to be pointed out during the confidential process of peer review than on a wide open internet server for all to see.\n* Another aspect is simply laziness or ignorance.  Person X as University Y has access to any and every journal he cares about through the University of Y library, and so it doesn't occur to him that somebody else out there might not have access to all the journals he can access.\n* Disinterest.  Some academics don't care whether their articles are readily available to the public at large because they judge the public to be unqualified to opine on the quality of the article or discuss the subject matter in any substantial way, so they simply see no reason to bother.",

          "text": "I access papers exclusively by pre-print because near 100% of papers in astronomy are uploaded through arxiv, even historical papers written before the advent of computers and the internet have been scanned and uploaded, and I think the earliest entry is from the 1400s. So it's an expansive, reliable resource that I don't have to log in to every single time like I do with journals.\n\nAlso, it's very rare to find an interesting pre-print that hasn't also been published in a journal. You *can* upload them prior to submission anywhere, but it's far more common to upload on submission or acceptance. Papers submitted in the last 3-4 months are more likely to still be in the submission stage, but that's not much compared to the hundreds of years' worth of published papers that are also on the site. You can also upload revisions if the paper changes before publication (it's very common).\n\nAlso, it's not taboo in astronomy to cite a pre-print. Even the big name review articles cite pre-prints, some that were old and not even submitted to any journal when the piece was written, so they were definite, permanent pre-prints and nothing more. That's fine for us. There is some degree of moderation on arxiv still and those pieces are cited because they're relevant pieces from relevant *authors* usually. \n\nWe all know the limitations of pre-prints. We know things can change in them. We know that they need to be read carefully and hold slightly less weight than a pre-print that has already been accepted/published. We're fully capable of managing some shades of grey between \"pseudo-science hack piece that a junkie thought up\" and \"indisputable truth published by God in Science\". Journal papers often end up being wrong or insufficient in some way. Pre-prints that never make it to a journal desk may be wrong slightly more often. Doesn't mean we can't trust them at all.",

Besides, without an education in law or even international law most of my work isn't exactly accessible (and no i don't have time to explain the VCLT to a non-specialist in every paper I write).\n\nFortuantely we managed to moderate the OA policy, because here comes the big issue I have with OA, my promotion criteria requires that I publish a certain number of 'high impact' articles a year, and, well, for starters there are no 'high impact' OA journals in my field and secondly the OA fees would make it impossible for me to publish the required number of articles.

Some major conferences in CS have even gone fully open and severed ties even with the ACM, like the Symposium on Computational Geometry. Something similar may be going on in mathematics, where there tends to be a lot of non-conformity as a general rule. I don't think these lend themselves to following what publishers want for their bottom lines. I'm published in both CS and math journals and I've never paid an author fee and I've posted most of my work (if not all) to the ArXiV. I always check the requirements of where I want to send the paper first, but it's always been acceptable to have preprints out there. I think its so prevalent you wouldn't have anything to publish if you were a publisher that didn't allow ArXiV preprints in CS or math.\n\nAlso, there is a difference between Open Access where the final journal version is made available for free (this usually requires a hefty author fee) and preprints on the ArXiV (which are not the official record of the publication and are posted in a form before the final edits based on the review process are made).",
