  "text": "A few questions here.  I am an MA holder, with a solid hobbyist science background.  Don't write me off just yet :)\n\nI have a couple of areas I would like to study, and little to no published research exists on the topics.  I would need to partner with a college for this work.  One of the two topics is definitely grant-worthy, but I have no experience with the academic grant process, although I have experience with other federal grants.\n\nHow can I best approach colleges/people I have identified as experts who may have an interest in this research?  Would also like to avoid having these ideas stolen - I would quit my job to work on these, and would like to remain involved.\n\nPardon the dodgy language.  Trying not to blast my ideas across the whole internet.\n\nStudy 1: Have spoken with a very accomplished guy who considered doing this in the past.  He was unable to find research in this area.  Would need rodent and insect subjects.  Biology and medicine applications, with global warming aspects.  High chance of being recognized or at least newsworthy.  Existing research is on one generation, but with multiple generations of subjects, very interesting results are likely to be found.\n\n2. Aerospace industry.  Only one group that I could find has tested my pretty damn cool idea, they did it in 2017.  It worked.  Want to test with other models and eventually with a supersonic wind tunnel.  I found the perfect guy but haven't approached him yet.",

      "text": "What is your MA in?\n\nHow do you validate that you have a \"solid science background\"\n\nIs there a commercially viable product at the end of the research, or is this essentially an academic project?\n\n\nGenerally, professors don't want to work on other peoples ideas or projects.  They want to get funding to work on their own...so if they are really interested in your idea, they are probably pursuing funding for it already. If they aren't pursuing funding, they are likely not interested in your idea enough to drop what they are doing.\n\n\nOne thing that will NOT happen, is that you will write a proposal as a hobbyist and get funded then work with university in collaboration.\n\n\nAlso what will likely NOT happen, is that you go to a professor with your idea and they like it enough write a proposal and hire you on to do the work\n\n\nWhat 'might' happen, is that you go to a professor who is doing similar work and talk to them about pursuing an advanced degree as a grad student in their lab.  Then get the undergraduate work completed that you don't have, and then apply as a grad student to work in their lab.  Then you can work on their project and eventually suggest your project as a possibility for funding.  If that doesn't work, then you can graduate with a Ph.D. and try to get an academic position to do your work....or possibly hire on as a post-doc or research scientist where you have more leeway in writing your own proposals.  By that time, you will have the needed scientific chops to be competitive.",

Scope may need to be narrowed to fit a niche, but the experiment itself is simple and would need about 6-12 months of mice and insects in carefully controlled environments.\n\n2 would result in a technology that may or may not have civilian Aerospace applications.

But you will need to be a student or an official employee....even then, they won't want to hire you to do the work that you want to to; they want to do the work they want to do.\n\nOne long shot is to 'sponsor research' to the lab, where you pay them to do the work, or you pay them for access to resources.  Sponsored research is typically big money of greater then $100K to make it worth the proffs time and attention.  Also note that if you want $100K worth of work, you will have to also cough up at least that amount again for 'indirect costs'.  University indirect rates are usually over 50% of the cost of the project funding.",

They do require the people doing the work have recognized scientific background in the topic area.  You can websearch for SBIRs and various agencies, as well as find state resources here: https://www.sbir.gov/local-resources/AL\n\nIt still, to me, seems a long shot but you would have to start a company with a team that is qualified to do the work.  Importantly, it would be more then just \"cool as hell\" it will need to potentially result is a real product.\n\nHonestly, I think your best tack is to get the needed undergraduate education if you don't have it already, then apply for grad school and go through a Ph.D. program where you can eventually manage your own research project.  It will be a multi year and maybe decade long process.   \n\nNo one will offer you resources to do your work....they spent so much time on the things they are interested in doing.  They might be happy to take your money to do the work in collaboration or as sponsored research, but that means they have to be interested enough in it and it has to be enough money to entice them",

      "text": "I mean, you have to look at this objectively;\n\n1) You're not offering anything beyond an idea. No funding, no ability to help process the results, nothing.\n\n2) Your first idea apparently involves animal research; you're not going to be allowed to involve yourself because of massive ethical concerns, and no reputable lab is going to take the word of a hobbyist when their own ethical reputation is on the line.\n\n3) Your second idea involves time on a device that is extremely expensive to own and operate, and your \"models\" are going to be seen as a tremendous liability. Why should a university or research group let you test something in their multi-million dollar supersonic test stand when you present them with zero indication that you know what your doing?\n\n4) You mention elsewhere that you don't have patents for lack of data...but that itself shows that you don't know how patents work. Patents are absolutely *not* proof of a functioning concept, hence why so many perpetual motion devices get patented. Patents do nothing beyond proving **ownership** over an idea.\n\n5) We get approached by \"hobbyists\" like you ever day. One in a thousand are on to something; the rest are kooks. The onus is on *you* to prove that your idea has merit.\n\nOf note; I've actually worked with a \"hobbyist\"-derived project, in that a guy did precisely what you seem to be wanting to do. It took him years of his own testing and *thorough* documentation before we'd even let him attach his rig to our test stand, and it was only about a decade later that his idea actually came to fruition.",

      "text": "I think I see too much pessimist attitudes in here. I know my lab would welcome someone with open arms if they are willing to do the work with passion, especially if they work as a volunteer until they are trained. We would gladly hire someone like this if they turned out to be legit after a few months of training.\n\nHonestly though, it does depend on funding. If the project is boku bucks, you need a PI who has Xtra boku bucks to spend and even then your work needs to be similar so the PI can help guide you. In order to secure funding you need pilot data, and even if it's a good feasible idea you cannot submit grants to most institutions unless you are in the necessary position, usually as a faculty member. This means that the faculty needs to take at least some credit for your work by submitting the grants in their name.\n\nKeep in mind that from idea to funding can take upwards of two years or more. The first year, collect preliminary data and write grant, the second year, wait on the slow ass government to tell you if it's fundable. Then usually collect more data and resubmit. Wait another 4 months, get money, work for 3 years before starting the grant writing again.\n\nBy the time the work is even close to complete, you could be graduating with a PhD, where you got paid to go to school and have better prospects to continue in science at a higher level after.",
