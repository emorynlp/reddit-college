  "title:": "I'm conflicted about recommending -again- rejection for a paper about an extremely accurate experiment",
  "text": "So, three months ago I was a reviewer for a paper about something in a sub-sub-niche where I think I'm one of the most qualified people around (because I think that like 10 people worldwide worked on this extremely specific subproblem). The paper involved super careful simulations to try to solve one of the longest running issues of this very specific sub-field. \n\n I recommended rejection because I thought that such simulations, while technically incredibly accurate, are not addressing the issue at hand. I've later found out that also the other reviewer agreed. The editor went for a reject with option to resubmit (in a high IF journal that has also the major revision option).\n\nNow the paper is back. They've expanded a lot the already long paper. They've tripled the amount of simulations, accounting for yet other factors. But I still think it's irrelevant because the question they're asking does not relate to the issue we're trying to solve, not because there's any issue with the practical implementation. \n\nSo I'd want to recommend again a rejection... But I feel bad for this large team that did a huge and accurate work. Also, I wouldn't know what to write in the review. It would be like two lines \"You did a great job, but it still doesn't address anything of the two pages I wrote last time\". It's true... but I feel super bad in saying something this dismissive to someone that worked this much...\n\nSo... what should I do?\n\nOut of curiosity, it's an issue for which 3 years ago we internally also produced lots of data and... decided not to even write anything because we couldn't find a method that would allow any reasonable way to validate results",

      "text": "Putting in a lot of work doesn't make a paper suited for a high impact journal. You can pay compliments to their simulations and the amount of work they put into them, but say that it belongs in a more specialized journal for the reasons you mentioned in the previous review, which are still not resolved.\n\nTheir paper will get published somewhere. They're adults in academia, they can handle a rejection.\n\nEdit: One caveat. You wrote \n\n> The paper involved super careful simulations to try to solve one of the longest running issues of this very specific sub-field.

Sometimes reviewers' judgment can be clouded by what question they wish the paper answered instead of what the paper was actually meant to answer. \n\nIs the paper still valuable and worthy of publication in this particular journal even if it doesn't solve the problem you mention? You can always suggest that they clarify in their  intro and discussion that they haven't completely solved that problem, but still recommend it's accepted if you think the paper is sufficiently valuable anyways",

By their own description, this does. It should be published.\n\nI will caveat that there's some discussion downthread about the piece making too sweeping claims in its conclusion - that's something that can and should be addressed, but not with an outright rejection. If the article's title, abstract, and substance are about X, the fact that the reviewer ***wishes*** they were about Y isn't a valid reason for rejection.",

For an analogy from my discipline, it's unclear if what's going on here is:\n\n(1) Researchers are asking a question that really needs to be answered through a randomized, representative, large-scale survey... but are using small n qualitative interviews instead.\n\n(2) Researchers are asking a question that needs interviews, using interviews, but OP thinks that a subtly different question (the one that needs a survey) is more valuable.\n\nIf OP is identifying accurately that the research question really needs a large-scale, representative survey, it should be rejected if it uses small-n interviews.

You want them to have done thing Y, when they have actually done thing X.\n\nIf their title, and the remaining content all address X, then it is your job to review whether they have done thing X, not whether they have done the thing you wanted them to do.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they have done thing X while claiming to have done thing Y then it's your job to explain how X =/= Y, and what they can do to re-frame their paper in terms of X.\n\nAs someone who has had a reviewer criticise a paper for not doing something we never claimed we were trying to do (literally, \"this paper is an outstanding proof of X, but they have completely failed to solve Y so I see no merit in publishing this work\"), please don't be that person.",

In your previous post you were throwing around a lot of \"I claim\" and \"In my opinion\".

There has been an open problem for 20 years about the fact that when estimating a certain parameter we cannot estimate a global calibration constant and we need to use some relative scaling that reduces precision.  Because the object that we put under the measuring device internally varies from measure to measure (it's a living object!!). *not because of the imaging device*. *it's a biological issue*. \n\nPaper authors claims they have proven that the best surrogate for this scaling constant is X. After not simulating at all the biological process, instead assuming what happens is X itself, but simulating very accurately the imaging device. Why on earth would I care about the  imaging process, if imaging has never been the issue?",

If the point of this paper is to solve this particular problem and they haven't done it (is it a matter that their simulations suggest a practical solution but they don't implement the solution to prove it's valid?) then it's fair enough to recommend rejection at this stage. It would be most helpful if you could provide a brief, concrete, reason for rejection. As an editor it's my nightmare that a reviewer weigh in on a revision with a dismissive statement that their central concerns over the paper in the first round were not adequately addressed. This is how this plays out in most cases:\n\nThe author writes me back, angry and frustrated at the rejection and accusing the reviewer of being conflicted. Writes a long winded explanation of the importance of the work and how their revisions address exactly the concerns raised. Without any actionable points there is nothing more to address but they insist on appealing the decision and having their response evaluated by an arbitrating reviewer. Authors always have the right to appeal. Because the authors talk a good talk and I, the editor, am not a master of the niche under investigation, I will now process the manuscript as an appeal and begin the search for one of the other 10 masters of the field who have the background to grasp the paper and both points of view raised during the review process. If I am lucky enough to secure such a reviewer they will now weigh in on both points of view and help me try to find a way forward. It can go either way.\n\nProviding a concrete reason why their approach does not address the issue and does not move the field forward even though it's a really impressive thought experiment, both gives me as an editor something to latch onto when defending my decision, and gives the authors the peace of mind that their revisions were given due consideration, and were not summarily dismissed.\n\nGood luck!",

I haven't heard this term before so here it is: If your paper gets rejected with the option to resubmit, you can add a lot of pages* to that paper and resubmit. This will then go to the same reviewers who will eventually give up and choose accept hence \"reviewers fatigue\". I think this is what you're going through right now. \n\nWe came to this subject when I was explaining how a few papers I reviewed and suggested reject got published by the editor. My boss believes that when an editor decides to send the paper for review, that's almost decision made as accept unless a reviewer points out serious flaws about the paper. This is a completely new way to think about the entire publishing process for me. This means that the reviewer's job is to make sure the paper is sound and scientifically accurate rather than deciding to accept or not.\n\nHope this helps as another point of view.\n\n*The content in these new pages is often shitty, you'd have accepted it if the added content was good anyway.

      "text": "Generally speaking, I think the only reasons for rejection are that a paper does not add valuable information to the relevant community- such as questions that are not actually being addressed correctly or fatal flaws in design. \n\nThis does NOT mean that difficult to interpret results are not valuable. And especially be cautious about rejecting null results that are informative. Based on what you\u2019re describing, it sounds like you\u2019re rejecting for the correct reasons. Don\u2019t be swayed by the authors doing more of the misdirected actions. But also look very closely at your reasons for rejecting in the first place. If the simulations are useful, but are being misinterpreted and are actually answering a different (maybe less important) question, then say that and ask for revision. \n\nTry not to let IF affect your decision. It distorts the merit of the data.",

If they did decent research (and it sounds like they did), then I don't see a reason to reject it. If you don't think the research answers anything in your sub-sub niche, maybe consider if it could be applied in some other sub field and make that suggestion. Otherwise, I really don't see why you would reject it.",
