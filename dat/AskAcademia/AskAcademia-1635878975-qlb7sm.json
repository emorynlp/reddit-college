  "title:": "Is getting a PhD in Immunology worth it?",
  "text": "I'm torn on what to do here. I have a strong desire to go for a PhD in Immunology, and do research for a rare disease afterwards. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm contemplating just taking my Bachelors degree and working in State or Federal government for good benefits, good pay and all that jazz. \n\n* Can anyone help enlighten me on what the reality is if I choose to go for a PhD? \n\n* Will I be overqualified for a bunch of jobs and therefore unable to get a good job? Is there any benefit in pay for getting a PhD, should I choose to abandon research for a government position after getting the PhD? \n\n* Is research all that its cracked up to be? I have an idea to solve a rare disease, but my concern is running from one grant to another and being broke. Though Im okay with a bit of risk tbh. Would a good balance be to become a professor, and do research on the side?\n\n* Any other thoughts/comments/concerns about getting a PhD? Things you wish you knew before you started?",

      "text": ">On the other hand, I'm contemplating just taking my Bachelors degree and  working in State or Federal government for **good benefits, good pay and all that jazz**.\n\nYour question is about academia, but I wonder if you have a realistic view of what life in government with a Bachelor's degree entails. If you manage to get a job at your State health authorities, do you have a realistic picture of how your working life would look like years ahead? Let's say you land such a job, do you have a picture of what your actual workday may look like 5, 10, 15 years down the line? \n\nI don't know anything about immunology job opportunities, but in some fields, you would have to worry that the degree may only be a ticket to get a job that you are basically overqualified for even with a Bachelor's. (At my workplace, the economy people with economy degrees run spreadsheets the way you could learn in a couple of weeks of job training. Their 3-year degrees were a way to get the job, but they are all dumbing down lightyears below what they could do, for the rest of their careers.)\n\nAlso, you have to consider that you are competing with people with MSc and PhDs even if you want to for State or Federal Government outside of academia.\n\nSorry for being so negative, but on this forum, we mainly scrutinize the pros and cons of academic work and ambitions, but less so the alternatives.",

          "text": "No need to be sorry, I prefer cold hard reality than anything else!! \n\nI honestly don't know what life in government with a Bachelors degree entails. I do know that I wouldn't be pursuing my passion, in exchange I would (likely?) have cushy benefits and all that.\n\nThat's one of my concerns, is being overqualified; as well as being severely underpaid for what a PhD is. I perused this subreddit a bit, and was appalled to see people being paid $30-$50k yearly for a PhD in life sciences. Is that standard? \n\nAlso I'm curious about if I decide to go full-ham and do my dream -- get a PhD, and research how to cure a rare disease. Would the only stable way to perform such research be working as a professor while simultaneously running a lab on campus?",

              "text": "When considering a career in academia also consider how the research you want to do will be funded. In academia you will most likely need to apply for NIH grant funding. Not all projects or research areas, especially those for rare diseases, can easily get funded. Look for academic programs that already do research in that area. You always have the option to do research at non academic research institutions, the private sector, or for the government. I firmly did research in academia and now currently conduct my research for the government within public health! Hope that helps!",

                      "text": "I have liked and disliked things in private sector, academia, and government. In private sector, funding is more easily available but bottom line is often making money which didn\u2019t always feel right to me. Projects that don\u2019t meet the company\u2019s goals won\u2019t go through. Obviously this very much depends on who you work for. I worked within autoimmune diagnostics which can be competitive. When in academia I liked that I got a lot of freedom to peruse different research ideas. Granted the institution I was at had programs already in my field of interest, molecular epidemiology, so it was easy to obtain project funding. I have had friends at other institutions that struggled to get funding because the institution didn\u2019t have proper resources or expertise in that particular area. Keep mind as a new researcher a good amount, if not most, of your salary will come from your grants.  Government work is nice as there\u2019s a lot of security and great benefits. I feel like my work there has a direct impact on public health. The major con is politics. Especially now as public health epi is highly politicized.  \nAny graduate degrees, masters or PhD, would serve you well in all three.",

It's a tiny bit easier to get \"mostly teaching with a little research\" jobs at smaller colleges, but those are still hard to get, and small colleges are often not as stable. Many small colleges are struggling to stay open, and it's only going to get worse. \n\nThere are more jobs at pharmaceutical companies, and they pay more, but you'd have to do whatever research they tell you to do. You don't get to pick which disease you study, and these companies don't tend to do a lot of research on rare diseases (there' not much money to be made curing rare diseases).",

My theory of curing this rare disease would involve using a modified virus, but I would want to do what Salk did and make it very low cost because I have a massive hatred of pharmaceutical companies. But thats a rant for another day lol\n\nThank you for the info on how competitive it is. Ill be keeping that in mind as I continue looking into this :)",

If your passion is research you could go on and simply exist from post doc to post doc but actual jobs in academia are near impossible to get.  Again if your passion is research then this won't matter.  But don't expect to be paid well for it.... Or to have much job security.  \n\nThe *best* advice I can give you is to build and cultivate your own opportunities.",
