  "text": "I am an international PhD student studying in the US, so my official identification is my passport+visa.\n\nI want to change my name from John Smith to John Peter-Smith. Right now my name is John Smith in every single official record. I will be making the official change in about an year or two when I am able to travel to my home country.\n\nCan I submit papers to conferences with the name John Peter-Smith before I can get an official name change? Would this cause problems of any kind? \n\nThis will be my first paper submission and I want to keep things uniform.",
