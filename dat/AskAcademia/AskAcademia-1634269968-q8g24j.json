  "title:": "Is someone piggybacking off of my research, or am I the issue? Dealing with \"unchosen\" co-authors",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI need an honest opinion from someone far removed from this context.\n\nMy colleague, another PhD student, has had trouble with each of his papers as he apparently got into things he didn't know how to do. These are his words. Yesterday he told me he is just a social learner, therefore he gets into things he doesn't know how to do and that's how he learns, and then the problem is he needs lots of help and people's time, as he makes mistakes (this is verbatim what he told me). Complains that people would help without expecting anything in return in his culture, and that this country is individualistic.\n\nTo me it seems like everyone is helping him, the department gave him a statistician to work with, my supervisor does help him most of his time... so I do believe he lacks some self-awareness, and tends to blame other people.\nMy supervisor spends most of his time revising what he does, helping him write as his English is quite basic, etc. This PhD student has been in the project for 3 years.\n\nAfter just getting started when I joined the research project a year ago, I quickly had a folder on my desktop called \"Helping + Name\". He needed a lot of help, writing, with reviews of papers... I was glad to. But slowly, I have come to the realization that this person doesn't have a limit, so to speak. And I would like to be less and less involved as time goes by. He has made promises in the past that looked like he was giving me an opportunity, and then he leaves it all to me. \n\nNow, I do have trouble saying no. I can be slow, sometimes it takes me an extra day or extra hours to deliver which can be unreliable to my supervisor. I am not faultless or perfect. Everyday I try to be better, that I can say.\n\nYesterday, again, after one year, my colleague remembers about this paper when my supervisor comes to celebrate I am going to a conference. He says can I tag along? My supervisor god bless his heart says yes...\n\nAt the end of the work day, he suddenly comes again, asks how he can really help for this paper. I tell him a bit about my reservations (that months ago I discussed with my supervisor if we should remove him as a coauthor, there's no time to put him up to speed), but he really seems apologetic and I believe him somewhat when he says it is time for him to help, and please, to tell him to help with anything. I tell him well, let's give it a thought, maybe I could do with some help to check validity (with me having to put him up to speed first but anyhow).\n\nThe next day? My colleague suddenly calls during one of my lectures and startles me with something about a presentation tomorrow, and informs me that he wants to use this paper as one of his core papers for reporting. He tells me he needs to present it tomorrow because his model for his paper is not working. \n\nI am uncomfortable. It is like I have been set up as he knew this presentation with the funding org. was happening way before. I say oh.. well I can send my slides, maybe you can put something vague together as findings are not definitive yet and you don't know much about this? Just speak about your project more and about this briefly?\n\nThe reason I am not rejecting this outright is because of my supervisor, and his good relationship with this person. I am also in good terms outside of work with him, he is alright... \n\nBut that's not where it ends. After some time today, he tells me maybe I can be the one presenting. On whose time!Surely not mine, I don't have it! This was also after work hours, presentation happening tomorrow.\n\nLet me stress, he has done nothing. Literally 0. When I've discussed with him my ideas about structure, findings, topic... he listened and then brings up totally unrelated ideas that he thinks could be fashionable to include.\n\nThere's 2 months before I need to submit. He doesn't know qualitative analysis, he doesn't know how to use the software, his English is not great, his knowledge on the topic is only what he's heard from me... \n\nNow, my supervisor likes him. From the outside he has worked with other people, no problem. Well, sometimes there's been conflicts but nothing crazy. Am I the problem? \n\nI was forced to have him as a coauthor as this was a decision supervisors made almost before I joined - the premise was, his literature review identified my topic in relation to something else (2 lines) therefore could speed up the process giving me grounds for my paper (which it didn't but that's beside the point, I guess they thought it was a good idea and reported that to the funding body).\n\nRemoving him from the paper causes some extra reporting and when I raised it months ago my supervisor mentioned that it's such a hassle... He wouldn't like it. I also don't want to ruin the ambiance at work as I know this guy takes things personal from how he speaks of others.\n\nBut the truth is - I am afraid helping him is going to be simply a lot of time. I am also afraid to appear needlessly disagreeable....  Maybe the best decision career-wise might be to swallow it up and keep going, try for this not to slow me down.\n\nI had not had a panic attack in 3 years, today I had one. I also don't know if my emotions are just getting the best of me. I don't have anyone I can go to at university without revealing his identity and don't want to badmouth in the university or anything... I don't think he is a bad person, but he can be reckless and just somehow takes people for granted? I don't know how to explain this, but chances are you've met someone like this.\n\nIf you've made it here... From the bottom of my heart, thanks.",

This person seems far more capable and competent in the business world than most PhD students who just sit and try to do everything themselves. \n\nThe whole process of a PhD is pretty absurd in the first place imo, why is a biologist/chemist/psychologist doing poor quality statistics and coding when they have no training in it what so ever? \n\nReality is what comes out is a person, and institution wasting a load of time and money, they don't learn it to any reasonable level, they don't do it well, and it takes 3 times the time and is often done if not inefficiently, then just wrong. \n\nThe real world works in the senior management/biologist/data analysis/statistician get together at a team meeting, make a plan that will actually produce an valid outcome if it gets to the statistician, and then the biologist does the wet work, the data analysis turns the output into data, and the statistician analyses that result, if anyone of those individuals tried to do they other jobs, or all the jobs like a PhD student, the result is null, it is nothing of value as they couldn't one or more of the step, not just well, but good enough to get a valid results.",

Academic science can be very collaborative ( though not always, just like businesses), and majority of PIs act as a manager rather than a lone wolf like you are presenting here.

Granted they are not experts in statistics, they should have a very good foundation in the statistics that are relevant to the work they do. I've talked with statisticians and data scientists who have no clue about the type of statistics I do at my job (no longer in academia, but government), as they have no training in my field, ecology.\n\nEdit: to add, just because you work in a team does not mean that you don't have to be independent. You need to be independent, a master of your skill, and highly motivated to benefit a team of diverse skill sets. Of course you should ask questions and ask for help, but that shouldn't be all you are doing.",

                      "text": "> majority of PIs act as a manager rather than a lone wolf like you are presenting here.\n\nI never said PI's do anything at all, they delegate to people in their team who have no experience to carry out the task, while they themselves also have little experience in the task either. You once again have a specific area of expertise, maybe in a system, or process, drifting into another, and often not getting any support, and just delegating stuff they don't understand to someone who understands it even less, because they are student and there to learn! \n\nIt is farcical. You see it all the time in these environments, normally 6 months after someone should have brought you in to consult on the task, all while their results will be meaningless, because junk in, means junk out. \n\n> I highly doubt most PhD students just sit and try to do everything themselves. That's not what getting a PhD is at all. \n\nYes it is? That is the whole point in it to get expertise in the area, and do it yourself. You are right though, they might eventually reach out to someone who has a clue about it after they have screwed it up 2 or 3 times. \n\n> If someone gets a PhD, or even a master's, in any form of science, and has \"no training whatsoever\" in statistics, then their university failed them.\n\nHa, the fact you say this amuses me one module of stats and some hours of data analysis just sums up why you haven't even recognised what I has said. There is a reason businesses hire people with Master's in statistics, not a module, multiple degrees, and that is because it is a subject in itself and turning up and winging it, like academics like to do, ends up where you would expect. \n\n>  I've talked with statisticians and data scientists who have no clue about the type of statistics I do at my job (no longer in academia, but government), as they have no training in my field, ecology.\n\nGreat? What was your point, the fundamentals will be picked up far quicker one way than the other, because it is all just data, I also never suggested a statistician should work on their own so once again am not surprised you have completely missed the point.",

One module of biology a biologist, your whole thought process, exactly the one implemented by academia, is just incompetent, and was exactly my point. \n\nThere is no surprise here that it gets downvoted in this sub either.\n\n>The whole point of getting a PhD is to do it yourself?\n\nYes, it is independent research done by you.

It doesn't really cost you anything to have an additional co-author (assuming you'll still be first author) so if it keeps the supervisor happy then so be it.\n\nThe other issue is the \"helping\". Sometimes there's a fine line between helping somebody and just doing their work for them. Getting you to do his presentation is waaaaaay beyond what's reasonable. \n\n>Now, I do have trouble saying no.\n\nSaying \"no\" is a skill! You don't need to say no in a confrontational way if you're not comfortable with that. But you might find that you start being \"too busy\" to be able to help out. And then the trick is to try not feeling guilty about it (on the basis that you don't actually have anything worth feeling guilty about). It may sound strange, but practice does help :-)\n\nPerhaps you're still happy to do little things like explain some concepts over a coffee from time to time (for the sake of harmony within the group) but certainly it's important to resist the ridiculous stuff.\n\nCollaboration and peer assistance/advice within a research group is really important. But it should never devolve into the leech-type behaviour that this person is engaged in. Helping people is nice, but at the end of the day your work is more important for you than his is.

I'm the same way and I also had a similar fellow PhD student in my program, although not nearly as bad. I noticed early on that he was the type to take an arm when you give a hand. So, instead of showing him or doing things for him, I simply referred him to where he can learn the info himself. For example, being from another country, he needed help with English and APA. So, I lent him my APA manual (which was never returned..) and referred him to the purdue website. I also told him to let me know if he had questions afterwards. Maybe you could approach helping him in this way so as not to create a hostile work environment. \n\nSorry you are dealing with this. Good luck!",

By being very passive and just agreeing to do everything, the message OP has sent out is that everything's fine and what few concerns are expressed aren't listened to because OP undermines themselves by not following through, further reinforcing the message \"it's all fine\". \n\nOP is going to have to do it the hard way now and really enforce the boundary. Counselling is a good idea.",

              "text": "TL;DR - ACatGod, thank you for bringing this up. This is all true. I have asked to meet my supervisor next week, and I will be raising everything in detail with him.\n\nThings got even worse after I had posted this. My supervisor told me to send him the slides. I did, but explicitly told my colleague he should be brief, vague, and use for instance only one slide for my project out of the presentation.\n\nHe ended up using all my slides without asking for my permission. Perhaps he assumed it, but he didn't even have slides of his own. It's offensive. I couldn't attend the presentation due to a lecture. I had to ask someone I am close to how he painted things like. He only talked about my paper, nothing about his, and explained well that I am the main author... but at no time did he clarify his limited (nonexistent) role.\n\nSo it really ends here. I will push to have him removed as co- author before actual submission. If not possible, I will give my supervisor the non-negotiable conditions that this person cannot use this for reporting any more and above all, not for his PhD, in any way, under no circumstances. So he better start working on that broken model.",

      "text": "Oof. This is not okay, but I can see why you feel like you're in a bind between your supervisor liking this person and having this person ask you for \"help\" frequently as if it's normal. The level of help he's getting from you is not normal. It seems to me like he's going to keep asking as long as he's getting something out of it, so you will have to be the one to draw boundaries. It's unclear from your post if your supervisor has heard complaints about him before and is choosing to disregard them or if you are one of many that are silently putting up with this behavior to avoid creating drama. Regardless, I think you should float your concerns mildly to your supervisor and feel out what kind of response you get. It's possible no one has said anything about it.\n\nOther than that, if I were in your shoes, I would minimize contact with this person. To the extent that you can, try using [the grey rock method.](https://www.healthline.com/health/grey-rock) You can't get this person out of your life, and you can't force them to become more responsible about their own work, but you can disengage and maybe they'll go looking elsewhere for someone to leach off of.\n\nI also really hope you have a therapist or other mental health support. I have never had a panic attack but therapy is one of the reasons I've gotten to my 4th year. With this kind of person in the mix, you'll surely find the support helpful. Best of luck.",

Lol? ) um I test apps and my brother is autistic so I thought it would be great to have better accessability services(or any as they had a number system but automated by dial up service I'm assuming was just as outdated as the other services) of course when you offer to assist for community as non profit suddenly there's all kind's of documents coming through your printer and things you're suppose to know and be well versed in which(I never claimed to be qualified! ) but i tried to keep my word and work on the projects and until one day in i believe it was march there was live streaming of data for which i didn't have the permitted licenses yet,so then I'm rushing to learn everything possible about the licence and how to apply them (keep in mind having only brief coding experience of a vary limited variety) mostly i was just learning as i went along with some lomg term goal's that some of the people from my first project might remember....any way there's a lot to be said about this kind of situation,but really it's problems that might have been avoided if either part y would simply have discussed their individual cercomstances and what there expectations where,when know one communicates their bound to be problems and mistakes that even you're boss could be at fault,my whole lone soldier thing is more because quite frankly people seem to be either scared or intimidated by me, or hate ,minipulating or trying to take advantage of me,I care about people and the biusness I do , though if you're  under the kind of stress that induced a panic attack,I believe it's best that you either reach out to human resources or employer,therapy, maybe even just getting you're issues out in a way that's comfortable and appropriate. I wish you all the best ,don't feel bad if you need to take care of yourself and you've tried talking to this person or whomever and tried to mitigate the problems...you can atleast rest easy knowing you did the best that could be expected,good on you for sharing this and I pray that it all work's out I can sense you really seem to care about these individuals I'm sure they could be more inclined to help if their given specific instructions(some people actually crave structure,other's rebel,the thing is you actually can't usually tell what's within one's ability until the peramaters are given)",

      "text": "Just going to comment from my experience with co-author issues.\n\nOne paper in my PhD involved field data from 4 other different institutions, one govt/open-access (+ my advisor's and my data). When asking for data, we were upfront that they could be author given that they read/comment on the final draft, answer any questions about the data, etc.\n\nSubmission time: one was super helpful during and with revisions and was happy to be included; another same level of effort and gave the best feedback, but ended his email with final revisions with 'Great paper, but I should not be co-author as I do not feel I did enough'; third (head of that research group) pulls the last minute 'we need to also include postdoc x since he did all the field work, and staff y for his role [in doing nothing]'.\n\nI could not care less about having additional authors, especially if there are already more than two or three, but having three from one institution for just sharing data was absurd. Solution was to send an email to everyone and say 'if you feel you contributed intellectually let me know and you will be included when I submit'. PI for data 3 at least got the message and said to pull him off, but the non post doc who did nothing getting the data stayed on. Data PI 2 was convinced by us to stay on since everyone else was.",
