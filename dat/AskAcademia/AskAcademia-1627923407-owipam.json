  "text": " \n\nHey,\n\nI already posted this in another subreddit but feel I could further benefit from posting it here. \n\nI recently turned in my masters thesis and have been so depressed every since. I made the mistake of checking my master thesis after submitting it. And even despite proofreading, there are so many  mistakes (formal  and spelling/grammatical errors) left. I feel so so so mortified. \n\nMy thesis has approx. 23.000 words and I have found one error on at least every second page: In my table of contents a title vanished while converting into pdf (submitting thesis via e-mail). Aside from that, it's mostly a word missing, a word too much or a sentence that sounds a bit weird. Some of these erros are noticable others less. Aside from two weird sentences, the errors don't impact the readability of my thesis.  \n\nI just cannot understand how this happend. I had people proofread it, I did it myself and I put in so much work only to have it ruined by these avoidable mistakes. I'm a caregiver to my grandfather, work fulltime  and lost my aunt and grandmother one month before submitting my thesis. So I understand I wasn't all there because so much was going on. But I was trying so hard and I think the content of my   thesis is interesting and solid.\n\nI just feel embarrassed for submitting my work with so many mistakes.  What is my professor going to think? I have googled around a bit and found  that up to a third or even a whole grade can be deducted for mistakes like that  (I'm  german and study in germany).\n\nI even had plans to get my PhD. I think my allover grade will still be good enough but surely they will be asking what went wrong with my thesis? \n\nI just don't know what to do. I just can't get this out my head and instead of applying for jobs all I can think about is my thesis and checking every two hours if my grade has already been entered. \n\nHas anyon ever been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice for getting into another headspace? Thank you :).",

Never, ever, ever re-read something after submitting, if there's no opportunity to fix mistakes.\n\nI'm mostly kidding, but I'm guessing most of us have been in a similar situation. The copy of my thesis that I sent to my advisor had this typo in the first page:\n\n\"We resent two techniques ...\"\n\ninstead of\n\n\"We **p**resent two techniques ...\"\n\n(Freudian slip maybe??)\n\nProofreading is also a skill and you (and I) should definitely work harder at it, but it's unlikely that this little bump in the road will have a significant impact on your career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: My most \"liked\" comment! I'm glad so many of you found it funny! :)",

      "text": "First things first: upon rereading the draft of my PhD which I sent to my jury before my defence, I picked up several typos and weird spellings after I'd submitted it. In the contents page, I'd labelled one section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, showing them how well I could count. The real stinker of the lot: I misspelled one of my two examiner's names in the acknowledgements. Gut gemacht! \n\nFor a PhD, you typically have time after your defence to make these minor corrections (and sometimes more serious ones if your jury demands it). You likely won't get the chance for a master's thesis, but that's mostly because your master's is mostly about you learning the process. Your markers may well point out to you that you should proofread better in the future. I would really not expect a reduction in mark unless the mistakes make it difficult to understand. Even if you do get some reduction, if your grade is still good you have no reason to worry any further. It's a little embarrassing, sure, but try facing your jury knowing you misspelled the name of the guy sat in front of you!\n\nIt's honestly not a big deal. Typos like that are fairly normal. Any large document will have at least a few. Your jury/markers will notice, they might think you've been a bit sloppy, but a lot of people write their theses in the last possible moment before submission which increases the amount of these things. You say it's still readable and doesn't really affect the contents, so you'll be fine. Relax! Another truth to learn about your thesis (master or PhD!) is that no one cares about it as much as you do, and even your examiners will not pay as much attention to it as you might wish/fear!",

I ended up messing all my references. My supervisor was horrified :). He told me I should have checked etc etc. But in the end the research was solid so I got a decent grade, got offered a postdoc and now I am happy in industry. So long story short.. I know it sucks. All the time and effort invested, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Your skills and having your name on published papers are worth much more when applying for phds. Especially if you apply abroad where you\u2019ll have to convert your grade/gpa and it will become a meaningless number anyway, since every country uses a different system.",

I just submitted something with the name of a major award in my field misspelled and I'm wondering how I could have been misspelling it for oh, two decades or so.\n\nBut I want to add in one more thing, about getting into a different headspace.  One of the worst things we as academics do to ourselves is to let perfectionism color our own reflections on our work.  You've submitted a thesis - a huge undertaking - and there are more errors than you'd like.  The idea that those errors (that don't materially impact the readability of the thesis, you've said) ***ruin*** your thesis is not a statement of fact but a frame of mind.  \n\nAs you progress farther in academia, the undertakings become more complex, and to expect yourself to be error-free is unrealistic.  The process of proofreading and revision will catch many, but not all, of those errors.  If you allow yourself to think that minor errors define your work, then you're going to continually judge yourself as unworthy - even right now, you're considering whether this means you'd be suitable as a Ph.D. candidate.  You can judge yourself out of the field even if you have important contributions to make, all for the crime of not being perfect.\n\nLong ago, my advisor said to me, \"No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail.\"  That's particularly true when you're judging yourself by minor details and not by the entirety of your accomplishment.\n\nAs for this thesis - maybe your professor will make a big deal about it, maybe they won't.  But even if they do, accept the lesson and the criticism and make it about *this* iteration of you as researcher - not about who you are for all time.  You'll have a better process next time.  Even that won't be perfect; it never is.  But don't let it affect your sense of yourself if your process of scholarship and analysis was sound.",

You can even submit to their professional proofreaders for a few bucks. Grammarly spotted three errors in this comment alone that I corrected. No, I am not paid to evangelise the service but it truly is excellent.

I\u2019m so glad that there are so many people here who can make you feel better about this having a sense of normalcy. Are there professional proofreaders out there who focus only on dissertations?  It\u2019s practically impossible to read your own work and having friends in the same field is difficult because their brains will simply substitute the proper spelling for a misspelling in most cases. CLEARLY this is not any comparison of impact, but in 15 years of owning my own restaurant I don\u2019t think I printed a changed menu correctly once. Even with employees proofreading. It was incredibly frustrating and it never got caught until they were all printed out and stuffed into 100 new menu covers. Also, I am absolutely top-notch at spelling but for some unbeknownst to reason at my Italian restaurant I utterly failed incorrectly spelling prosciutto mayonnaise and broccolini without spellcheck. I quite literally couldn\u2019t believe it. We are all human, this Simone Biles this has shed a light on that. Your professors are not even Olympian\u2019s, one would hope that they not only see this quite frequently but went through it themselves and can be empathetic. I also believe that it bears mentioning your home life situation, that\u2019s heavy duty and takes a very big toll on ones health. Mentally and physically.

          "text": "\nThank you for your reply. I don't have any experience with the academic systems in other countries but here in Germany it's generally more strict: no resubmission, deadline is DEADline (professors have no authority over extending deadlines) and so on. The grading of written assignments is usually based on a set of fixed criteria (importance of research topic, clarity of research question, quality of literature review, fulfillment of formal criteria etc.). \n\nBut the actual grading differs from professor/advisor to professor/advisor. I had friends submitting incomplete work and still scoring 80% while others barely passed because the professor/advisor had really high expectations. Some professors/advisors focus more on the content while others treat formal criteria equally important.\n\nSo unless you already know the professor/advisor you really don't know what to expect. That's why I was so mortified. I'm better now though, thanks to all your supporting comments. I just hope my advisor puts more weight on content and has a good day when reading my thesis. I just can't make myself sick over a single grade, even if its my master thesis.",

We have both Turkish and German professors. Needless to say, we worry more about passing the classes which the German professors attend. I wish your thesis is approved and all your dreams that you ever wanted in life become a reality. Learning about your family problems and responsibilities I'm convinced that you deserve it alot. \n\nOne last thing: as much as I love Germany (I've been there and lived for almost 6 months) and would want to live there again one day, I know that it's country depressive as hell.\n\nI wish you best of luck bro",

      "text": "Deutsche hier, wenn ich mich richtig erinnere kann Rechtschreibung und Zeichensetzung zwar die Note negativ beeinflussen, aber es gibt Vorgaben ab wann und der ein oder andere Fehler wird da geduldet. Es geht eher darum wenn die Arbeit schwer leserlich wird und man \u00f6fter \u00fcber Dinge stolpert. Zumindest so weit ich das wei\u00df, kommt wahrscheinlich auch auf den Pr\u00fcfenden an wie gutm\u00fctig der ist.\nUnd realistisch, wenn du die Arbeit mehreren Leuten zum Korrektur lesen gegeben hast und denen die Fehler nicht aufgefallen sind, dann sind die Chancen recht hoch, dass die beim Pr\u00fcfen nicht auffallen werden. Vor allem Kleinigkeiten.\nDas ist ja auch wahnsinnig viel Text und da passiert es mal dass ein Wort zu viel ist oder zu wenig und beim korrektur lesen verliert man irgendwann den Blick daf\u00fcr. Passiert jedem mal und ich denke nicht dass das schlimm sein wird. Der pr\u00fcfende hat ja auch so so viel zu lesen, irgendwann wird der auch den genauen Blick f\u00fcr alle Fehler verlieren.\nMach dir keine Sorgen, das wird alles gut verlaufen. Ich hab schon so oft auf Arbeiten weit im Nachhinein geschaut und so viele eigentlich offensichtliche Fehler gefunden die nie jemandem aufgefallen sind. Das wird alles gut.\n\nDie Abz\u00fcge der Note sind ja auch das H\u00f6chstma\u00df. Klar kann dir bis eine Note abgezogen werden, aber nicht f\u00fcr Kleinigkeiten. Vielleicht wenn jeder dritte Satz ein Fehler hat und klar ist, dass du das nicht mal ein zweites Mal gelesen hast.\n\nDas wird schon gut gehen! Alles Gute, ich dr\u00fcck dir die Daumen! Versuch dich auf das was noch kommt zu fokussieren und auf das was du geleistet hast. Die Masterarbeit ist ja nicht das einzige, du hast den Bachelor geschafft, Veranstaltungen besucht, geforscht, Pr\u00fcfungen geschrieben und hart gearbeitet. Da kannst du stolz drauf sein. Und die Masterarbeit ist nicht alles was du vorweisen kannst. In meiner Ausbildung hab ich auf Grund von Krankheit schreckliche Abschlusspr\u00fcfungen geschrieben und ich dachte so stellt mich niemals jemand ein. Das war mir jedes Mal peinlich bei Bewerbungen. Was werden die nur von mir denken wenn die meine Pr\u00fcfungsergebnisse sehen? Am Ende hat das nie etwas ge\u00e4ndert und ich hab mich immer zu viel drum gesorgt. Niemand hat blo\u00df die Ergebnisse angeschaut und mich ausgeschlossen",

          "text": "\nHallo! Vielen Dank f\u00fcr deinen ausf\u00fchrlichen Kommentar. :) Ich hatte bereits versucht in deutschen Foren ein bisschen zu zu suchen und lesen aber da waren viele 'Besserwisser' und Leute von der Fraktion 'Wie kann man blo\u00df Rechtschreibfehler in einer Abschlussarbeit haben' unterwegs. Das war nicht sehr motivierend, deswegen habe ich das gelassen. \n\nIm Gutachten meiner Bachelorarbeit (gleicher Erstkorrektor/ Betreuer wie bei meiner Masterarbeit) gab es einen Punkt 'Sprachliche Kompetenz, Stil und Pr\u00e4sentation'. Ich denke Mal darunter f\u00e4llt die Rechtschreibung, Grammatik und Formalien (Seitenanzahl usw.). Dieser Punkt war halt einer von insgesamt zehn.\n\nAlso meine Arbeit ist bis auf zwei S\u00e4tze die man wahrscheinlich zwei Mal lesen muss, gut zu lesen. Ich hoffe irgendwie das mein Betreuer evtl. gar nicht so genau liest bzw. gutm\u00fctig ist. Aber ich kann auch damit leben wenn mir 0,3 Punkte abgezogen werden. Nur habe ich Angst das es einen schlechten Gesamteindruck macht. Aber wie viele hier auch schreiben kommt das wohl \u00f6fters vor und das beruhigt mich schon. \n\nVielen Dank f\u00fcr deine lieben Worte. Sowas hilft wirklich sehr. Ich muss dran arbeiten zu realisieren das ich mehr bin als mein Studium/Ausbildung. Wenn du magst kann ich dir ja Mal schreiben wie es ausgegangen ist. :)",
