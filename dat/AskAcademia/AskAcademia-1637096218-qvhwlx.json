  "text": "Background: I\u2019m in my sixth year total of grad school, having completed a two-year funded MA before beginning my current program, which is five years guaranteed funding in a History of Medicine PhD program (my geographic focus is Latin America). I\u2019m currently on the fourth year of my guaranteed funding, though I\u2019ve been assured that there will always be some sort of a TAship/PAship/RAship available for me after the fifth year. I don\u2019t expect to be able to finish before 2025 (having started in 2016, my MA credits didn\u2019t carry over to my PhD, except for my MA thesis).\n\nI did my comprehensive examinations throughout the COVID year (started Aug 2020 and wrote the exams in May 2021) and passed my dissertation proposal in August of 2021. I am now in-field on a department fellowship, and holy shit I\u2019m so lonely.  My Spanish was C1-level by EU standards last time I took classes (2019), but has deteriorated slightly during COVID (though it is still adequate enough to make friends and do archival work and translating academic articles). I\u2019ve had to leave my partner and our dog behind because her funding is in-person TAing. To be honest, I don\u2019t know why I expected this fieldwork trip to be any different from the previous six-week archival trips I did in 2017 and 2019, when I was also miserable and lonely.\n\nMoreover, I feel like academia has sapped my joy for history, and that the parts of academia I have enjoyed the most are possibly the least valued for professional advancement. I quite like teaching, but most R1 faculty see it as a chore rather than a fun thing to do (not all, and I have TAed for Profs who genuinely enjoy it). I *really* enjoyed coursework because it gave me the opportunity to be exposed to new ideas, new themes, new periods, all while working with a new group of people every 4-6 months. I really enjoyed that kind of collaboration and exploration. Focusing so intently, by myself, on my specific topic is kind of joyless. I could be doing any project and be happy with the content, but the actual work experience of isolated archival work and writing would be the same (Republican/Imperial Rome, colonial South Asia, Ming-era China, Gilded Age/Progressive-era US, Italian unification, Ottoman expansion, any one of these periods/themes and myriad others would interest me as much as my current project). I got to do a bit of historiographical research for my advisor on something completely outside of both our wheelhouses and I loved it (histories of quantification in Grecian, Egyptian, and Roman slavery), but that kind of dabbling is discouraged, especially in History. It\u2019s really only possible once you have already made a name for yourself.\n\nIn contrast, the parts that are most valued\u2014working alone for years, first in the archives and then on your dissertation, and then on your book\u2014sounds dreadful to me. Forcing oneself to suffer through the isolation and under-appreciation and to stick with the same thing for, on average, 7-8 years just to get the dissertation done, and then another 5-10 years to get the book out, is nuts. Assuming that I can stick it out and do another 8-9 months of fieldwork (which COVID is making very difficult because of severely reduced archival access) and not become even lonelier and more depressed, it seems batshit crazy that I\u2019ll still have another 3ish years to go just to finish (I write in quick short bursts, takes me weeks to build up the motivation). Also, as a Canadian doing my PhD in the United States I have come to realize that I\u2019ll probably never get home if I stay in academia, as Latin American history barely exists at Canadian universities. U of T\u2019s Latin American history faculty is the largest in the country and there\u2019s only four of them there, *and* they\u2019re spread across the three campuses. History of medicine is slightly better represented in Canada but still quite small.\n\nI look at the lives of the faculty around me here (R1 school) and they\u2019re not living lives that I would want for myself. Living apart from your spouse for 5 or more years because you both got professorships in different cities? Putting in 12 hour work days in your 70s? Moving to the middle of nowhere in the hopes that you\u2019ll somehow get enough published while you\u2019re doing a heavy teaching load so that you might one day get a better job in a real city? These sacrifices just don\u2019t seem worth it to me.\n\nI look at my friends outside academia, and the only ones who seem to be as miserable as my academic friends are lawyers, and they make more than enough to make up for it. They\u2019ve got money saved to be able to quit and not be concerned about rent and groceries (that is in fact what my two most miserable lawyer friends have done, and moved to lower paying but happier industries). Our (grad students) compensation is\u2026 ego boosts?\n\nDoes it get better? Or is this basically just what it\u2019s going to be like forever? Is it possible for History to become enjoyable once again rather than soul-crushing work?\n\nEdit: added info on time-to-degree and my impressions of people I know outside of academia",

The field for academia in history of medicine, and more narrowly within a given specialty, are low as you indicate, but I am not sure how they are different from what you expected when you entered this field. While job prospects are small, working at an R01 as a tenure-track prof is not the only option. There are other types of professorships at teaching-focused colleges and community college. You might explore these options as well. You may get lucky and find an opening that matches your interest in a place of the country you like. You might even find you like living in a different area. I am sorry you are having this experience. Does your advisor know your situation? Good luck.",

I don\u2019t expect to be able to finish before the end of 2025 (started in 2016), and that\u2019s being optimistic. Average history time-to-degree is 7-8 years. I\u2019m expecting a bit longer because none of my MA credits (except for my thesis) counted for my PhD.\n\nMy advisor, while a very nice man, seems to have ignored every time I\u2019ve mentioned \u201cI would be more than happy to work outside academia\u201d and just keeps pushing the path he thinks will get me his life (tenure-track R1, wife at a different school in a different state).

A friend of mine recently left our program (COVID fucked her timeline way more than mine) and my advisor was one of her co-advisors. When she told him she was Mastering out, he told her that she was \u201cabandoning\u201d history. He became a bit more supportive after, providing her with a RAship to help tide her over until she found a new job, but his initial reaction was very discouraging.",

He literally has to ignore it unless you are utterly certain, because 99% of the things that he may have to do for you professionally in the future are predicated upon him believing that you are pursuing an academic career in that field. Is he going to write you a dissertation completion recommendation that says \"It is imperative that PhDDoubts receive one of these limited, extremely competitive fellowships so that s/he may leave the field and the academy immediately thereafter\"? \n\nIf you indicate to your PhD advisor that you are having strong doubts about a future career as an academic, he has two choices: assume that you are saying this to him because you are doubting yourself or your abilities and want reassurance, or assume that you saying this because you are looking for his blessing or validation to drop the program. Prisoner's Dilemma says to choose the first one, every time. \n\nThe truth is that it's your life and your decision, and it doesn't really make any sense to bring it up with him in the first place. It sounds like you are miserable, and like the things that make you miserable are going to be a significant chunk of the job. There's nothing magical about academia -- lots of smart people are leading happy and fulfilling lives outside it.",

Not long after I finished it was [11 years on average per the OAH](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2006/how-long-to-the-phd).  AAAS report showed the [median was eight years](https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/higher-education/years-attainment-humanities-doctorate) from 2003-2012.  So that 7-8 year average is significantly better.\n\nI'd wager that part of this is the reduction in size of many history grad programs and better funding for those who were admitted. Back in the 1990s even good programs often admitted unfunded students in large numbers, or as in my case, limited funding to X years (where X was always well less than the time to degree). So lots of people didn't finish, or didn't finish in a reasonable time. There were grads in my program who had been there 15 years when I started out, which I thought was crazy...not long after they put a hard cap of seven years on course credits, which started once you advanced to candidacy.",

      "text": "I'm a historian and when I was in grad school (1990s) it was typical for people to take \\~10 years to do an MA/Ph.D. in the US. Often without funding for large parts of it; in my program funding wasn't guaranteed at all and was limited to five years total. So those of us who finished almost always ended up teaching to pay the bills...which worked fine for me, as I taught as an adjunct while in residence for two years, then spent my final two years of writing teaching full-time 1,000 miles away from my grad school. I managed to finish in eight years, making me first of my cohort. The only part of your timeline that sounds odd to me is the extra 5-6 years to get a book out; if your diss is well conceived and your committee is doing its job right you shouldn't need more than 2-3 years tops to revise it into book form. More than five is *too much* as if you landed a TT position right away you'd need that book to earn tenure.\n\nFaculty lives are pretty much like you describe, though there are differences among types of schools. I've spent the last 20+ years at an SLAC and obviously spend a lot more time teaching than researching...but 10-12 hour days are certainly not unheard of. Summers are nicer for us, post tenure at least, as I have more than once just said \"screw it\" and literally done nothing all summer. The sacrifices of moving around are very really too; my partner (also an academic) and I ended up lucky by living in the same place, but we've now spent 40% of our lives living 1,500 miles away from our families and we're stuck here until retirement.  The money stuff is real too: our lawyer and doctor friends are as stressed, if not more, but they make 3x the money. Meanwhile, we have friends who have already retired at 50 because they went into tech or business or some other field out of college (while we spent a decade in grad school). Even people who went to work for the government at 22-25 are far better off financially because they were earning (and saving) in before their 30s. I have former students who are 15+ years younger than me that earn more than I do as a senior full professor in their government jobs.\n\nBut sometimes history is fun. I like teaching. I like reading history. I enjoy talking with colleagues. I do a lot of public talks, am on a couple of museum boards, do some media occasionally, even get into high schools to talk about history now and then...when I'm actually doing history it's still fun, now \\~30+ years since I was an undergrad just thinking about becoming an historian. The rest of it? Not always fun. Mostly bearable.\n\nWould I do it over again knowing what I do now? Probably not; I'd have gone to law school (I took law courses during my Ph.D. and really enjoyed them.) But the academic \"lifestyle\" has some real positives. I'm just not sure they outweigh the possibility of retiring at 60 from a solidly middle-class lifestyle, which is what my lawyer friends are doing while all my academic friends are hoping they can afford to retire by 70.",

              "text": "Stuck: yes, in the US once you are tenured it's very hard to move unless you are willing to lose tenure, take a pay cut, and start over. Unless you are also willing to trade down in \"prestige\" by going to a smaller, less well regarded, more remote location. Of course, none of that applies if you are someone with $$$ grants or cranking out influential publications...but neither of those apply to the great majority of American faculty.\n\nRetirement: hard not to laugh. In general US university basically have very little (if any) retirement benefits. For the large percentage of faculty who are adjunct/term hires it's often literally nothing other than a voluntary savings plan. For those on the tenure track it varies wildly, but usually it's some sort of match (on a percentage basis) for contributions to a tax-sheltered investment portfolio managed by a private (i.e. non-government) entity. It's pretty common to see that benefit as a 1-for-1 match up to 5% of salary or something in that range.  24% is like some magical myth from \"socialist\" countries...the best I've ever heard of for a US academic is 10%.\n\nPlus our Social Security (government retirement benefit) is a joke and even when we're retired health insurance will cost $400-600+ per month *with* the government program for the elderly.\n\nSalaries vary wildly between institutions. At my private liberal arts college new assistant professors start around $60K and senior full professors make about $90K. That's low compared to some types of schools, but still in the ~65th percentile for four-year (undergraduate) schools.",

      "text": "MOST history jobs these days are at small liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and similar institutions where teaching is a way higher priority than research. It definitely sounds lonely to be in a department that doesn\u2019t value the same things you do, but you\u2019re going to be a lot better poised for the job market than any of your peers who have internalized your department\u2019s values and will find very few, if any, TT jobs at a research university. And your focus on Latin America helps broaden the positions you\u2019re a good fit for a TON compared to other history of medicine candidates. Talk honestly and sincerely in interviews about how much you love teaching, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly large part of the profession. \n\nOf course, there are few full-time positions in general and if you find a good alt-ac job before graduation that you could see yourself turning into a career, I\u2019d probably take it and not look back. But I\u2019d keep working on the PhD while you keep an eye out, at least as long as the funding stays in place.",

      "text": "I'm sorry for responding without reading all the other responses. But one thing that strikes me is that you enjoy teaching and collaborative work. If you do stay in graduate school, try to prepare yourself as well as possible while in graduate school for a teaching oriented position. Try to teach a couple of your own classes (where you are or at local colleges). R1 universities typically don't know how to prepare people for teaching positions because of course their faculty mostly only ever had R1 positions. Of course, I don't mean giving up on research. The best teaching oriented positions will be at places that also want some strong research, but not as much as at an R1. Also, you might look into doing a couple of not too demanding courses on pedagogy, maybe even online courses, so you learn how to sell yourself as a good teacher, and trying to make contacts with people at departments where you might like to work eventually. Finally, once you apply for jobs of course you need to make sure you don't look like a typical Ph.D. hoping for an R1 job (in some of your applications). But that's another story.",

I think you've answered your own question--I love doing all the things (isolated research) that make you miserable, and I'm very happy, on balance, to be an academic. And even though I'm at a SLAC I don't love teaching (I like it, mostly) and I would never have gotten tenure without my strong research profile. If you don't love the research, you do need to find an alternative to a traditional faculty position. It could still be in academia, though; look around and find people in staff/admin positions that look like fun to you. In some cases a Ph.D. will be an asset so you may as well finish while you are so close. Alternately, you might look for schools where research is not a main tenure requirement.  My teaching/collab loving friends have found jobs in running digital education programs, for instance, in library work, in teaching/learning centers (as staff), and at military institutions (more teaching focused than traditional colleges & universities).\n\nFor me, what's kept me going is the love I have for the process of research. Find the thing you love that much and the career that rewards you for it. Also, I work 9-5, M-F on the reg and I have a very strong publishing record in addition to teaching full time. So it is possible--you don't need to have a miserable, time-starved life to make it happen. But given your current unhappiness with research, I don't think a traditional faculty position is for you.",
