  "title:": "Non-academic professional pathways for a social science PhD?",
  "text": "As a recent graduate who's been thinking a bit about academia, it's definitely been sobering to read through some threads on this sub.  From my understanding, the job market is incredibly difficult, work/life balance is often a struggle, and the long-term financial outlook for all but tenure track positions can be extremely tenuous.  \n\nI graduated Phi Betta Kappa + with departmental honors from an Ivy and am about to attend a masters program in the social sciences at a top 5 global university.  The factors mentioned previously seem to mitigate against getting a PhD, but I really love my area of focus and would love to pursue further study in information sciences, sociology, or political science. \n\nAssuming securing an academic position is not an option or likelihood, are there any reasons to still pursue a PhD in these fields? Would I be able to secure well-paying jobs in industry related to my area of study? Does a PhD provide a leg up when applying to work in public service? \n\nIf I were to decide that I was really passionate about trying to pursue academia, what are things that I should be doing during my masters to set me up for that trajectory?",

I am friends with some sociology PhDs who now work in tech/data science because they wrote their dissertations on social networks, are excellent at quantitative analysis, and developed serious programming chops during their degree.  They are very well compensated for their labor.",

Whether or not a PhD is worth it depends on how well funded it is and what you research & how. \n\nBut a general direction you might be interested in as a social scientist would be policy and/or lobbying work. Perhaps also data science and analytics depending on what your research skills are. But broadly, think tanks, tech companies, policy research and analysis in the bureaucracy. It all depends.",

These skills are at the intersection of computer science and statistics, but unless you plan on researching how to analyze data, most of the private sector accepts PhDs from fields who use data extensively. So quantitative, data-driven approaches to any of these fields will be fine.\n\nBe sure to work with programs that are used in industry, though. At the moment, Python and R are the two biggest programs for data analysis. SQL and its variants are the biggest for data collection and storage.\n\nSource: poli sci PhD who had much better success on the private sector market than he ever did on the academic market.",

On the one hand, it can mean quantitative and formal-theoretic work on the various places where government and economy meet.  On the other hand, in some places it seems to be almost a branch of political philosophy focused on similar issues.  Only the first kind has any reasonable off-ramp.\n\nThere's very little point in going for an MA or PhD in any kind of political philosophy if you intend to live in the US.  The academic job market for that field is an atrocity before God and you're probably not going to get as much methodological training as someone doing \"normal\" political science.",
