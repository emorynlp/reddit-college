  "text": "I suppose that many of you will also be in the similar situation to the one I find myself in, starting to see the finish line on my PhD but begrudgingly coming to the conclusion that a career in academia is now so unappealing that I'll need to come up with some other career path.\n\nI'm not driven by money so it's not a problem to me if I never earn more than what an average lecturer makes, but all the same it's still pretty low given that it: (a) to get these positions typically requires ~6-10 years of studying, multiple degrees, significant research experience, and a track record of publications; and (b) student numbers, student fees, and university profits all seem to be rising (at least where I am, in the UK.\n\nWhat's even worse is that postdoctoral and junior lecturer positions - if you're able to fight off all the competition to get one - are even more poorly paid and insecure. From the conversations I've had with people in those roles, there seems to be very high workload, and a lot of the key aspects of being an academic (e.g. writing papers, acting as a reviewer) have to be done in spare time.\n\nSo is there any other industry which requires so much training for so little reward and so little job security? For those who are a little longer in the tooth and know these sorts of things, has it always been like this or did the nature of the industry change more recently?",

I found it out after I had already interacted with C a couple times, and asked him about it. He told me that even though his brother's fame always overshadowed his own, his brother had an extremely difficult time making do with his choice of livelihood.

Each of these might last a few months if you're lucky -- or maybe just a week if ticket sales are poor. Then it's back to job interviews (they're called \"auditions\"). You can get tossed out on someone's whim for just about any reason. Any injury can mean weeks or months without pay. And your career is over by the time you're 30.\n\nAnd -- particularly if you're a woman -- the field is ridiculously oversaturated with top-notch talent. Those 15-18 years of training more than likely end with no jobs at all.\n\nOf course there is teaching. You can even combine academia and dance, and become a professor of dance.

None of my classmates are working actors. (With the exception of Bryce Howard and she kind of had a leg up. She worked hard as hell though and is great. And: Two are comedy writers, two spent a few years with a ny dance company.)\n\nOtherwise none of us even work in anything close to the arts. Or remotely that community. I ended up doing data entry and management for a law office, my friend works for planned parenthood, another friend opened a vintage/used clothing store, and everyone else just got married and pregnant,  posts about toddler macrobiotic recipes and stuff. They will likely commit suicide within 10 yrs as I know these women to be crazily brilliant writers/directors/designers, etc. They are surely dying to work.\n\nAnother thought: Juilliard (I did not get in it is impossible) also has a new class every year of aspiring actors. And...Here is a list of successfully employed actors I can think of who trained at Juilliard: Kevin Spacey; Wes Bentley. List over.",

The politics and stupid competition unrelated to teaching the students. \n\nMy sister recently got tenure. She has always worked long and hard hours and all the extras-papers published, on lots of committees, top quality work always. Cool. She makes a 6 figure salary, more than anyone in our family ever. I am proud of her, but no more than I am proud of less \"notable\" friends and family.\n\nEveryone who has to have a job/jobs to support themselves works really hard. Like my sister but without fulfillment or promotion or accolades. Not saying academics is not stressful but at least it is interesting. I would love to have a *career* doing anything that was remotely a topic of interest to me. That put me in the category \"intellectual class.\" Most people rotate through low paying jobs all their life, long hours, no retirement no savings, paying off loans if we were lucky enough to afford college...\n\nI guess my advice is stay on the path you are on. Career wise. Every profession has very few jobs for many many qualified grads in the field. You picked academia stay with it.",

I've been at my SLAC for 20+ years and recently had dinner with a classmate from my Ph.D. cohort from the 1990s. We both agreed that we were lucky, demographics were in our favor back then (more high school grads, lots of faculty retirements, many schools were expanding) vs today and of course the cancer of the neoliberal university business model had not yet settled in everywhere. Today even when senior faculty retire they are not replaced with new tenure-track faculty, but with term hires so the institution can remain \"nimble\" in the face of changing cost structures and demos. The pool of high school grads is climbing again but will peak c. 2025 and then fall off in most of the US outside the Sun Belt, leaving a lot of school perched on the precipice of failure if they cannot dramatically cut costs and downsize.\n\nThe last halcyon days for high ed in the US ended in the 1960s. There have been a few bumps since (late 1980s, late 1990s) but the market has really never recovered. Nor have wages increased meaningfully in 40 years, so while a tenure-track faculty career is still secure it is at best a middle-class lifestyle today, vs. something very different prior to 1970.",

When I came out of grad school in 1997, the job market was pretty dismal -- not as bad as it was in 1994, which rivaled 2008 for sheer suckage. Higher ed is in a different place now, for sure, but it was still bad then in different ways. However having a good portfolio of experiences --- I taught a lot in grad school, including a side job adjuncting at a community college that I wasn't supposed to be doing --- trumps a lot of the poor quality of the market itself.\n\nThird, you have to look in places that your PhD advisor might not ever recommend or even know exist. My #1 choice coming out of grad school was that small Christian liberal arts college, and while I left after 4 years for a better position, it was a good starter job and I could have stuck with it for a long time had I wanted to -- and it was absolutely not on the radar screen of my advisor. PhD advisors tend to focus myopically on research institutions or, if they are willing to let you slum, mid-tier large public universities. But it turns out there are actually a lot of different academic pathways in the US and a lot of them are hiring more or less every year. For example my department's been hiring TT positions in mathematics for 4 out of the last 5 years and honestly, some of those years we've struggled to get people to notice, because although we are the #2 academically ranked institution in Michigan the candidates are focused laser-like on schools they've heard of (read: their advisors have heard of) and we are just not a well-known institution. \n\nThe job market's not the greatest and higher ed is in a precarious position these days, but there's still plenty of reason to hope.",

Are the jobs very competitive?\n\nYou can find the salary data for the US easily; it's [reported every year by the AAUP](https://www.insidehighered.com/aaup-compensation-survey) and broken down into a useful range of categories. Generally speaking, starting salaries for new assistant professors at PUIs (teaching-oriented schools) are going to be in the $50K range while senior faculty (full professors with tenure) are closing in on double that if they are lucky. There's a huge range though; religious-based schools tend to be lower, regional differences are significant, union/non-union faculty makes a difference, etc. etc. My liberal arts college fits into that range perfectly though, with new assistants starting at $57K this year and tenured full professors with 20 years experience right at $90K.\n\nAre these jobs competitive? Of course. We get 150-300 applicants for every job in a typical field (English, biology, political science) and many more in some fields (business will draw 500+). Only small specialties or esoteric subfields will yield <50 applicants. In my (now long) experience about 75% of the applicant in any search are fully qualified on paper, but we only bring three to campus and only hire one.\n\nThere are legions of underemployed Ph.D.s in the US. No full-time academic jobs, even contingent ones, are hurting for competitive applicants with very few exceptions (there's a shortage of nursing Ph.D.s willing to teach when they can get 2-5X the salary as practitioners). Same is true in a few other fields.",

Wouldn't that be an easier profession for some of these academics to go into, if they enjoy teaching?\n\nPublic school salaries vary a lot in the US because the schools are locally controlled. In recent months we've seen a range of strikes from teachers, many of whom aren't making enough to cover their basic living costs. In other places public school teachers are unionized and relatively well paid. In my area a high school teacher with 20 years of experience and a masters degree makes about the same as a professor with a Ph.D. would with 10 years experience-- the two big differences being that 1) the high school teacher doesn't have to work in the summer without pay (as many academic researchers do) while 2) the college professor doesn't have to deal with high school students or their parents.\n\nI considered teaching high school until I student taught for a semester. There was no way I was going to spend 35+ years dealing with 15-18 year olds and their parents. Teaching at a selective private college is actually fun most of the time-- my students are great. The salary is a bit better, at least in my area, but the working conditions are dramatically better. Plus there's support for research; I couldn't be publishing as a high school teacher as I'd have no access to libraries, labs, research assistants, travel funds, etc.",

As a general rule, Baccalaureate schools will be more teaching focused and less research focused, master's schools will still be more teaching, but more of a balance with research, \"other doctoral\" will have a stronger research emphasis, and research, of course, will be very heavy in research focus (there are, of course, exceptions in all categories).  \n\nI am at a master's university.  Jobs typically have 50-100 applicants in my general field.  The liberal arts jobs are very competitive from what I am told.  Though I was also part of a search committee where we had 2 qualified applicants for 2 positions (we hired both, both mistakes).  So it all depends on the type position as to the competitiveness of the position. \n\nYou asked someone else how this compares to school teachers.  At my university, starting salaries for faculty in liberal arts, social sciences, or education would generally be around $55-65k, sciences around $65-75k, and business around $110-120k (and we have a few select sub-disciplines that are outliers).  My school uses CUPA as our benchmark so we are fairly close to the data I linked to.  \n\nStarting salaries for school teachers in my area is around $45-50k with overall average salaries around $50-55k, and those with over 20 years experience averaging over $60k.  So unless you are in business or engineering, you are not making a killing over school teaching, but overall we do make more and seem to have a higher ceiling. ",

The difference, however, is that training in the arts isn't widely promoted as a path towards upward mobility. \n\nIn the U.S., anyway, academia IS.

Our social policy does not encourage every american to learn how to sing and / or play basketball. \n\nIn fact, the very existence of these shows demonstrates the degree to which success via the entertainment industry is seen as an outlier, rather than the norm. \n\nThere are no shows wherein the best teacher, or occupational therapist, or college professor, is selected amongst tens of thousands of applications for their one and a million shot in front of a live audience to earn a living wage.
