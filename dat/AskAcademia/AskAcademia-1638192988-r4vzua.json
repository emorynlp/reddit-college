  "text": "Question for German academics: what is the \"Promotionssemester\" good for? Is it required at all German universities? I have been writing my dissertation at a German university for 6 years as a fully funded and employed research scientist. I have never been officially registered as a Ph.D. student, and it was never required. Now to hand in my thesis I need to register (\"immatrikulieren\") as a Promotionsstudent (PhD student), produce a heap of documentation about my Bachelor's (!) and Master's degree, and pay a (small) registration sum. Essentially, I need to register as a normal student at the university. This is \\*on top\\* of the normal formal requirements for handing in a Ph.D. thesis, which already include a \"polizeiliches F\u00fchrungszeugnis\", documentation of my Master's degree and other stuff. I personally cannot see any benefit for requiring people to register formally as a Ph.D. student for handing in their theses, so what is this good for? Why does it exist? It just seems to pointlessly add to the already huge amount of administrative hoops you need to jump through to hand in a thesis.",
