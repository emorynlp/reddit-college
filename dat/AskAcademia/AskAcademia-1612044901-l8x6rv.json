  "text": "I was not getting any luck in getting an answer in r/NoStupidQuestions so I thought this would be relevant here\n\nI'm currently both a science and arts student and I have noticed this to be quite true in most cases. Arts student will complain about struggling through a math or science requirement, while science students in arts classes tend to fair better\n\nI noticed that institutions think this is the case as well as I also noticed that universities will have courses such as \"calculus for the social sciences\" or \"biology for the arts\" which is known to be less rigorous than the main calculus/biology class. On the other hand, I don't commonly see them offer \"philosophy for the sciences\" or \"sociology for engineers\". If science students wish to take arts classes, they are expected to enroll in the main class",

For even a remedial math class, you need all of the above plus all the math you\u2019ve learned up to that point. Someone who is good at math already has the skills to do well in other fields. They just have to learn domain-specific information. \n\nRegardless of your major, everyone will show up to an intro philosophy class with almost no philosophy background. You can\u2019t show up to a calculus class with good critical thinking skills and no math knowledge expecting it to go well. \n\nThe cumulative nature of math also explains the existence of courses like \u201ccalculus for social sciences\u201d. A standard calculus track is teaching you some math you\u2019ll use in your field but also preparing you for more math which is usually the hardest part. If someone doesn\u2019t need more math, they\u2019re better off just learning what they\u2019ll actually need.",

      "text": "I'm going to be a dissenting voice and say that this has not been my experience, and I have to wonder how many of the people who are saying this is the case have experience teaching and grading in the arts.\n\nMy students from STEM fields have typically struggled more than those from arts and humanities backgrounds when it comes to communicating themselves clearly, engaging with and critiquing an argument rather than paraphrasing it, identifying and finding sources independently, and understanding subtext and irony. STEM students also are generally frustrated with the fact that there are multiple, but not infinite, correct answers to the problems posed in humanities courses.\n\nI think there are two things that might lead to the perception that STEM students have an easier time in the arts than vice versa. First, some people are good at both, and such people generally pursue careers in STEM fields, because such careers offer more social and financial capital than the arts. Second, most first-year courses on arts subjects are generalist courses, which has an impact on the difficulty of the course: e.e. most people taking Calculus I are in majors that will require them to take further calculus courses, whereas Introduction to English Literature will have a lot of students who will never take another literature course in their academic career.\n\nAs for your point about courses like \"calculus for the social sciences\" or \"biology for the arts\", often such courses are focused on the practical applications of the math or science for a particular discipline: calculus for the social sciences teaches you the specific methods and techniques you need to know in order to do quantitative research in the social sciences, and biology for the arts might be a course that focuses on anatomy. I don't know about your institution, but the schools I've attended and worked at have offered the reverse: introduction to history and philosophy of science, Greek and Latin in scientific terminology, and so on...",

Some of the things that work pretty much like STEM fields are things like defining your concepts and using a thesis statement and proving it methodologically. These fields can also use scientific methods in statistical analysis (really not that uncommon).\n\nETA: Creative fields also integrate methods and research into the creative process, and it definitely does involve new approaches and creative thinking... that\u2019s the heart of creation. No creation can be truly original and interesting without a healthy dose of reflection and deliberate planning out of the evolution of the work.",

I can say \u201cthe narrator uses the first person a lot less in this book than in this book\u201d or \u201cthe narrator is much more confident in what they are saying in this book than in this book\u201d, but without statistical proof, they are nothing more than vague assertions. Similarly, someone in cinematic studies may use statistical analysis of some specific kind of cuts or framing being used in a movie to support a comparison. In poetry, it can allow you to compare the occurrence of richer and poorer rhymes, or of vocabulary pertaining to specific themes or concepts. Statistical analysis is just another way of collecting data on top of quotes and examples, for fields like literature, art history and cinema studies.",

      "text": "Lots of interesting comments here, but how about this: I've had a number of STEM majors flunk my social sciences classes over a 40 year career. In my experience, those STEM that flunk come floating into class assuming it will be easy and don't seem to own the textbook. They flunk their first exam and assume it was a fluke. They then flunk their second exam and after that come to my office to tell me that there's a problem because they get A's and B's in their STEM classes so there's something wrong with my teaching. I talk with them about the studying that they're doing and it turns out that they're not studying. They do better on the third exam because they have now actually bought the book and read the chapter summaries as they were walking toward the exam. But my exams are developmental and so the third exam requires a greater depth of understanding than does the first one and they're really doing the equivalent of C level work for a first exam. Their paper is due before the final and the grammar/composition of it is pretty awful. The content is ok but doesn't show a great ability to actually synthesize the information that they accumulated into a greater understanding. They get that grade right before the final and come and talk with me about how important it is that they get at least a B in the class so they don't lose their scholarship. Since they're a STEM major I ask them what their current average is and what it would take to earn an average of 80; they can calculate that pretty quickly (usually close to correctly) and determine that they'd need a grade of 166 (out of 100) to earn that B. Some kick butt on the final and squeeze out a C; others do not.\n\nI've also had a number of humanities majors flunk my classes, of course, but it's less common in my experience for them to show the sense of outrage about poor grades than do the STEM majors.\n\nBut, as most of us know, my anecdotal experiences mean squat to the reality of if and why STEM majors do better in humanities classes while humanities majors do not do better in STEM classes. It is fun for me to reminisce, however!",

When you say \"arts\", are you referring to the humanities or to specifically fine arts or art history students?\n  \nAt the college I went to, the case was rather the opposite. Music students tended to be much stronger students than science majors. This was because the music school was significantly more selective, and the science programs were limited and not generally the main draw. Of course there was a wide range of student achievement levels across all majors. Also, I think there were \"philosophy for biology majors\" type courses, though I could be misremembering. \n  \nSo it could be just a matter of selectivity: at a lot of universities, the science programs tend to be highly in demand and are therefore more selective, resulting in an overall higher caliber of student. Alternatively, it might be that courses in the humanities are fairly subjective in terms of assessment, so that it's possible to pass without fully grasping the material, whereas in quantitative disciplines there are clear numerical indicators (i.e. getting the right answer) that can be strictly assessed.",

      "text": "Not sure I agree with the premise and what do you include in \"art subjects\"...?\n\nBut if you are talking about the difference between \"sociology for engineers\" performance vs \"calculus for sociology\" honestly I'm from social sciences and been on a lot of course planing (committees, etc.) and this is due to the different NATURE of these classes. For example, ethics of biology is taught as \"introduction\" or \"option\" class while calculus for sociology is actually seen as a basic course that you will use again, so the requirements to reach are higher than in an option class. Considering this, professors ADAPT the class when there is a strong proportion of people from \"hard sciences\" in \"humanities and social sciences class\" or in classes reserved to them because they don't have the basic training to properly address concept and analysis of ideas/ social issues etc. Therefore, the level is lower than what is taught in our field classes tbh... Also, a lot of requirements from previous years are FAR away, so if you need to remember something you haven't touched in years, people have to re-learn some things they already learned to \"speak the language\" of math/ physics/ chemistry because you need those like a second language to master the classes.  So you are comparing apples and oranges is my point...\n\n* Fun fact: a friend teaches philosophy to engineers and ,oh my she wants to scream sometimes because they very often approach ethical dilemmas like a formula to solve, something that has precise factors that will have a precise answer and well... ethics is basically THINK for yourself, no equation here. It's kind of hilarious to hear the answers she gets on some exams :p\n\nIf you mean in a more general matter, like interest and hobbies well:\n\n\\- \"arts\"  is not ONE thing, like social sciences, music, philosophy etc are WIDELY different fields with subfields so not to bind all together in a \"interested in all\" basket. The reason why so many educated people, no matter their background, go and study \"arts subjects\" outside their field is that...educated people are curious, creative, know how to learn and access knowledge and if we are talking about arts arts like painting, music, dance, etc, well art is universal! Everyone is attracted to arts in some ways, educated people just have better personal resources to pursue it and also have personnal traits that push them toward learning more and more!\n\nWhy people keep out of \"hard sciences\":\n\nIMAGE: \"hard sciences\" have a very strong tradition of keeping people OUT with a elite-only image + some people see \"hard sciences\" as not very creative and very square where colorful people will be shut down. Tbh I've met people of all types (creative vs square, etc) in these disciplines at higher levels but most at lower levels (undergrad or market oriented master) do kinda tend to fit the profile :p\n\n\\-For educated people outside hard sciences, a lot consider it of low interest to understand the world, which we usually crave. We often hear people say it is too \"limited\" of an understanding and so a lot of people pick data they need and use it for their \"understand social issues\" research for example. It's not that it's not useful, it's more that people see it like \"why would I ask the grocery store how they made this bread if I just need this bread to make my sandwich??\". So people will dabble in it, read and go to conferences but it's more to find a fact to use for other stuff. We like that you provide these facts keep going!  But we see it as something to be treated with tools we have or feed it and not as an end in itself.\n\n\\-I meet people or see in the public discourse that a lot of people with a background in \"hard\" sciences seem to THINK they master very well EVERYTHING and put down humanities and \"soft\" sciences as easy and something they mastered as a hobby while people of similar levels of studies but specialized in the \"art\" field concerned find their understanding very...superficial at best and problematic at worst. Of course it varies a LOT depending on the person and their education level but CRITICAL THINKING and knowledge (whatever the field) also takes years of work in the humanities and social sciences... It's not just I read this book on a social issue and understand it, therefore humanities are easy\". Sadly the most problematic comments I've heard in university were from engineers / \"hard sciences\" phds who seemed to believe that social phenomenons and politics all had ONE simple answer to solve the problem like \"oh yeah you can save world hunger with X\" or \"I think we should know more about this social issue but oh no I don't trust qualitative research...\" while quanti and quali both can be useful but some things just NEED one and not the other XD  Like one professor once said: \"we won't find a cure for cancer with interviews but we also won't find the best way to support those patients with objective questionnaires...in sciences we need complementary approaches\". So what I'm saying is please don't go into the discourse that says \"one is better and harder than the other\" because sciences need each other to get better...",

This might be due to the different validity verification process if you are using physical sources of data (cells, tissues, etc.) or numbers vs using discourse, self-assessment.  \n\nIt's also different between the \"arts', for example people in history, language, sociology, psychology, philosophy will have have widely different take on the same issue and about what makes science or \"fact\". If you then open it to people in \"hard sciences' you get another view. For example, people in economics, management and some psychology work (mental efforts, problem solving, organizational psycho) tend to have a similar approach to problems than hard sciences while sociology, anthropology and education will tend to think in \"concepts, perceptions, systems\" etc. This is of course a tendency and will vary a lot but it affects WHAT you will look for.\n\nI don't know it you are familiar with epistemology (what is science) and ontology (what is real) but it may interest you :) A good example happened in a class I took about teaching a class as a phd student that included students from all fields. The 1st exercise was, in little groups at random, define teaching. The hard sciences students came up with something like: \"giving information to people and showing them how to apply it\" while social science student said \"sharing knowledge to a person who is open to acquire such information\" and the philosophy one said \"co-constructing knowledge in a common work to discover the subjective truth on a given matter\". Just then you can see, no one is wrong but they all took it in a VERY different way :p \n\nhaha well the bread analogy could be seen in for example a person who studies something like \"what makes people adopt environmental protection habits in their consumption\". The study will use hard science as a reference to show what is polluting, what isn't, support climate change with data, etc. Then, the person will analyse what makes people chose. In the end the person probably won't feel the need to read many articles to understand why product A is better than B but just being able to assess the quality of the research review that supports it you know? People who are fields \"in-between\" must be a bit of both, like epidemiologists!",

It's certainly possible to understand the basic concepts and procedures for solving a math problem, yet transpose a number somewhere, resulting in a wrong answer. As someone who routinely made that type of mistake, I did much better in grad school social science math compared to high school precalc precisely because the former was all about understanding concepts (while the computer crunches the numbers). Also, applied quantitative methods have significant subjective elements because so much depends on conceptualization and measurement. For instance, your results for a research project examining the relationship between democracy and some other variable (e.g. propensity to start wars or economic performance) might change dramatically depending on how you define and measure \"democracy.\"",

Completing so many problems allows one to understand the feeling of failure quite personally, in addition to teaching perseverance. \n\nAs a science student who also likes the arts, I will say that society generally has this idea that people who excel in the arts are particularly talented, and their field just \"clicks\" with them. This concept of born talent is present in the sciences, but so many STEM people have to struggle through their field that the majority of the STEM population adopts a growth mindset.",

I can remember going back to how Galileo developed heliocentrism with what he had. I can also remember Gregor Mendel, with his peas. Science was always presented as something that was constantly being built upon. You always got a sense of \"This is what we know, So Far.\"\n\nHumanities for me never had that same theme of progressing. I know it does, but it doesn't tie together as cleanly. Like every work of literature was taken as this timeless work, created in the context of some environment. 1984, Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby. It always feels like a great stand out, and not so much as a progess. \n\nIt didn't feel like one leads to the other, or the next was built upon what came before. Does that make sense?",

So they focus on one book at a time and try to cover as much of the traditional canon as they can. But once you get to higher education literature courses, you start learning about the ways in which who writes literature, what they write about, who they write for, what forms that literature takes, etc etc etc changes over time. And alongside it, the theoretical frameworks that we use to find meaning in these texts has progressed over time, with different theoretical frameworks splitting, melding, and evolving over time.\n\nWhen you talk about \u201cprogress,\u201d I think you are likely presupposing a progress \u201ctowards\u201d something. In the case of STEM fields, I think we could define that \u201csomething\u201d as \u201ca more accurate and fine-grain theoretical framework for understanding the world around us.\u201d And the same can be said for the developments of fields and sub fields in the humanities.

The problem is that in primary school, there isn't really enough time to develop these ideas and also get through reading the whole book, especially since the narratives surrounding literary movements are often less neat than scientific narratives (wherein a single scientific discovery is validated empirically).\n  \nAlso, it might just be that science teachers are hoping to use narratives to engage students with otherwise dry subjects (evolution in the abstract is harder to understand than Mendel's peas).

The skills that will help you in a first science class include the ones that will help you in a first philosophy class, plus some specialist knowledge that someone who hasn't taken all the sciences and maths wouldn't come across.\n\nAt higher levels I think that the question no longer applies.  As soon as humanities education does require some kind of specialist knowledge (e.g. if you're expected to understand what Kant or Hegel thought, or what a Marxist theory of history would entail), it usually, often quite publicly, is something that scientifically-minded people are very bad at (e.g. Sokal, Dawkins, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and James Lindsay for instance are all STEM people who have gotten famous for doing the humanities very badly).",

The exception was a university lecturer who taught a few high school classes and when I was in university, I found out that I have a lot of interests in those subjects, but I need to read the right authors and be taught by good teachers.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always the teachers, I think it\u2019s the education system. Hear me out, testing has taught students that there is always a right or wrong answer so that\u2019s how things are taught in school. Math and science at the secondary level often mimic that concept, there\u2019s a formula but they have to figure it out and there is a specific process they have to remember and use. It\u2019s also that math, (sometimes) science, and English are all typically part of standardized texting and social sciences are not. I teach history, students need to look at evidence, make a connection, come to a conclusion and support their argument. In my mind it\u2019s similar to the scientific method but for students they see it as an opinion. They get caught up on the fact that primary sources contain bias. There is a lot of pushback from students and parents when you challenge them (even AP classes!) so I can understand why some give up and resort to memorization. Which defeats the purpose of studying history and makes it boring. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever required students to know an exact date but they do understand the sequence of events.\n\nAdmittedly, I may be the exception since I have a graduate degree in history and have experience teaching (gen eds) at a 4 year institution so the expectations were different.",

A student with masters in journalism mentioned that there were Greeks were never able to conquer India - and that's when another engineering student joined and started talking about allied kingdoms likes taxila and mixed kingdoms like bactria. It was then when an arts student mentioned the fact that most of the time non arts students have at least she knowledge to share an opinion about arts subject niye it is rarely the opposite.\n\nI feel a primary reason is that at least in middle class in India, people who are above average in studies, inquisitive are suggested to pick up engineering, medicine or applied science and a safe career stream. It is (usually, not always) the remaining students who take up art class. This is the trend that shows up out of my country as well.\n\nI spend weekends reading random stuff about history, economics, psychology etc but I've never seen any of my cousins even trying to Google the composition of three medicine they take, it try to code just to make a one pager personal webpage.

I disagree with the writer part just being easy. You have some ridiculously shitty writers who need bucketloads of practice and criticism before they can be even slightly taken seriously. To make the most basic product in that you still need to have some kind of formal structure.\n\n\nFor me personally, I love reading mathematics and physics textbooks and working slowly through them, and I also love reading novels. But I DREAD reading and trying to parse long articles written in such a way that is tailored to another field of study. You need too much background information to even get anything out of it. Like I had to read this article on blockchaining in English class last week. Every 12 pages of it, from the tiny text and super dense pages to the plethora of references everywhere in the article made it not only hard to read but also gave it a feeling of not being self contained in the slightest, which isn\u2019t good for someone without the background information. \n\n\nBack to math though, it takes more than just the ability to count to get THROUGH mathematics. The person who wrote this comment talks about \u201centry barriers.\u201d That\u2019s a real thing. You can most likely jump into a second year arts course for arts majors without any background at all and still understand the content and do well. You can\u2019t do that with the equivalent level math course for math-centric majors. \n\nAnd when we talk about non-computational proof based math, while counting is the foundation of nonmodern elementary algebra, you need to also be able to understand and write proofs of things, which required the ability to read and process reading. Every educated person can count but not every educated person can just jump into that.",

I am saying that if you grab someone and tell them to write a story, they can do it. It's probably going to be a shitty story and not worth reading, the mastery ceiling for writing is really high, but the basic requirements to start doing it are not high.\n\nLet me use carpentry as another example. If I am given wood and tools, and I am told to make a chair. I can make something that looks like a chair. Will it be a good chair? Not at all. Carpentry requires a lifetime of dedication to crafting stuff. A good carpenter has spent years training and refining his skills. But I can still  produce some frankenstein looking chair that at minimum evokes the idea of a better product.\n\nThat's what I mean by barrier of entry. What is the minimum amount of effort you need to put in to start making stuff that can be recognized as a minimum representation of that field of knowledge / talent.",

I\u2019m a science student but they seemed to be much more sophisticated in terms of ability to break down art. When we looked at a photographic piece of art, people always saw so much more than I did.

Not to mention that these technical subjects often are assumed to have one right answer in our assessments. Compare this to humanities which are, by design, meant to elicit your particular opinion, so there are always multiple answers.  \nI'll also add that technical subjects have a long history of marginalizing women and people of color that plays out differently in the arts - correct me if I am wrong, but problems of retention of women and people of color are much worse in technical fields (and the evidence points to this being because of discriminatory culture or \"chilly climate\"). \n \nSo ultimately, while the premise implies that technically minded students have something that arts and humanities students don't have, I think it's more that any given person has a higher chance of being rejected or marginalized in a technical subject compared to a non technical subject. And if that's true, it's a cultural problem, but one that can be fixed.",

I did well in my science classes but was convinced as I progressed through high school that a talent for the humanities meant I would never really be able to develop high level science skills. Luckily, my parents pushed me to take anything I wanted and expand my views\u2014I ended up working in a research lab my senior summer during high school. I loved the creative nature of bench science. I realized that the two broad areas of the sciences and the humanities were not opposed, as I once thought, but just separate sides of the same coin. I am now an MD-PhD who double majored in a science and a humanities field in while I was an undergrad.\n\nStudy whatever interests you.

      "text": "I think is mainly how we portrait both worlds. Education systems tend to marginalize arts and to attribute worth to STEM fields, both money- and intelectual-wise. Also, this idea that people are following their \u201ctrue calling\u201d is quite reductionist and allows for people not to explore other interests. After all, a well-round human being will not necessarily be an artist or a scientist, but a combination of all the things learned in his/her life. Also, let\u2019s not forget that \u201cscience\u201d is just a trade that we learned to work with it and operate, just as any other career. This idea that we are born scientists is cute, but not a reality in the system we live in. People that were exposed to science per their scientist and/or professor parents, likely have a better chance to be \u201cbetter\u201d scientists and the same to people who grew up with artistic parents, but that just means they were exposed more. All of the traits learned to become one or the other, were learned and our system does not work for everyone, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are no capable, they just didn\u2019t learn how yet. Some individuals might have an easier time, but I think that says more about their environment than their individual abilities.\n\nEdit: a very smart mathematics professor told me once that \u201cno person likes to be \u201cstupid\u201d or does not like to learn, humans are inherently curious and  they just need to find a learning medium that suits them\u201d. \n\nTl;dr: institutions of education try to compensate for their own teaching flaws and end up creating humans with self confidence issues and learning phobias",

      "text": "I'd argue 1) subjectivity, 2) \"skill floor/ceiling,\" & 3) university commercialisation.\n\nThe first & major reason is that humanities & arts can be more subjective in grading than STEM. 2+2 must equal 4 but \"why did Rome fall\" is a bit more open ended. I'm American & I've done most of my studies and all of my teaching (so far!) in America; meaning I've taught four field anthropology (the STEMiest humanity & the humanist STEM). There is legitimately less wiggle room to give students good marks in bioanth than in ethnography. Your opinion on Radcliff Brown might be wildly out of synch with the past century of theory & methods buuuuuttttttt if you cite the course readings and justify it with consistency, I'll give you a passing grade in an intro class. On the other hand, an australopithecus skull is an australopithecus skull - either you correctly identify it or you don't, no amount of personal conviction will make it a homo sapien. Also worth noting, this isn't true of all non-STEM fields; law, public policy, & foriegn languages all have strict, objective grading criteria and I'm not sure STEM majors tend to do better than SocSci majors in German class. Tbc I do not **know** in either direction - never seen any data on this, anyone who has please share :)\n\nFor the second reason, and you probably won't see this in undergrad just yet, I'll have to borrow a term from eSports (shockingly an academic is a nerd). Humanities & social sciences tend to have a lower skill-floor than STEM, particularly when it comes to undergrad courses; meaning it's easier for anyone to get into them b/c they're likely stuff you've experienced before. Intro History courses, for example, tend to be world history surveys (hitting the major civilizations/eras everyone knows) or the national history of the country/region where the course is taught (which most students would be familiar with from primary education/living there). SS/Humanities courses at lower levels tend to spread wide rather than tall as well; once you learn how to, say, analyze/interpret 18th century AngloAmerican lit it's a lateral move not a cumulative one to do the same with 19th century British lit. Meanwhile in STEM, most courses are cumulative - you need to return to what you learned in the prerecs. I could never keep Japanese names straight in my East Asian courses as an undergrad...but that didn't hurt me in my European courses; if you don't understand algebra, God help you with calculus or stats. In terms of skill-ceiling, to dip into pop-Science(tm) for an easy example, have you ever heard Neil deGrasse Tyson talk about anything beyond astrophysics or Jordan Peterson try to tackle historic theology? I'm sure these men are brilliant in their fields, but clearly that doesn't automatically translate to the \"softer\" sciences/humanities. Hell, just look at how many in STEM write - no shade brothers/sisters - it's not exactly the polished prose of someone taking PR or journalism; there's a reason \"writing for STEM\" is a growing field in terms of courses & the job market. My undergrad actually did offer \"Philosophy,\" \"Citizenship,\" & \"Art Appreciation\" as part of their \"For the Informed Citizen\" line of courses; which also included their versions of what you mentioned (bio/math for non-majors).\n\nSpeaking of the job market, let's be frank for my third point; it's far easier to earn a well-paying & rewarding career in STEM than in the arts, humanities, or even social sciences. A BS is terminal for many STEM fields; most arts/humanities BAs are next-to-useless for anything in their fields. STEM & a few social sciences (e.g. PoliSci depts when one graduate lucks out & gets into a major office) get by far the most donations & more funding b/c they make more for the university; meanwhile the humanities have gone from something intended for only the societal elite, the sons (& occasional daughters) of planters & aristocrats, to the bare minimum to sate that hunger of the mob under neoliberal capitalism. Humanities are forced to be \"easy\" b/c (American) universities advertise themselves on the basis of their sports, parties, & non-academic facilities; those students need majors they can flake off while paying hundreds of thousands to the university admin. Remember what I said about subjectivity in grading? Here's where commercialization perverts what should be intellectual dynamism into the uninspired gears of post-industrial debt-slavery. The System knows it needs STEM to run & any citizen or ideological concerns are secondary to materialism; therefore STEM is upheld with more rigor. It's easy to see when a bridge collapses or a webhost fails; it's harder to put your finger on moral decay or social ennui.",

They knew how to code and that gave them an edge. What was actually quite simple to code was very impressive and many arts people felt intimidated. Also, the engineering guys were quite confident of their abilities, further eroding arts people confidence. However, people with that engineering background, while good in executing a thing, could not argue well why they were doing something. Example: one guy built an automated drummer. It could play 16 sticks at a time so it would be able to create complex rhythms. However, when he demonstrated it, it was just a bogstandard 4/4 beat. The guy had absolutely no creative musical thought but because of his programming/building skills, he awed a lot of people. The University later bought one of those drums. We used it 1 tie and now it is collecting dust.",

My students complained about it being hard and useless and most students are quite frankly terrible at writing and drawing. As a TA, I graded SO generously with writing, and writing is often a deficiency with CS students that has to be brought up over time. \n\nThere's also the problem that math anxiety is much more prominent than the corresponding \"art anxiety\" - so many students will select out of math-based fields. The survivor bias would therefore make it look like science students are \"better\" at art than art students are \"better\" at science.",

More successful students tend to put in a lot of time and be disciplined, but there are *plenty* of students just skating by and dedicating most of their time to partying/whatever.

It was extremely difficult to earn an A, and if you did the work it was hard to get a C.  I can personally attest that the engineering professors didn't feel the same way.  \n\nHowever, I will also say that at my institution, all the serious engineering specialties kind of looked down at the design path as a route for people who didn't like math.  I took intro to design, and it was one of the hardest courses I took, just in a different way.  Every week, we had to bring the professor something different, and the instructions were things like, \"Bring me something that conveys the concept of 'ritual'\".  I'd rather solve a differential equation, thank you very much.  Before I took that class I would tell myself that I had some natural talent at drawing ... after that class I realized I am orders of magnitude worse at art than people who just spend all their time doing art.   Anyway, I think I got a B, but the people who got an A ... they were doing things I could never, in a million years, have done.  (I still remember turning in something and the professor looks at it, at me, then says \"Are you happy with this?\", which I now realize is code for 'THIS IS TERRIBLE')",

At our institute, we are required to complete 4 courses in humanities so that also had something to get me interested. I did well in those courses because I was genuinely interested and thought of it as part of my responsibility towards the community.",

So, if you have a student who is talented in both, the set up of universities makes it more possible to be a scientist who dabbles in the humanities than a major in the humanities who dabbles in the sciences.\n\nAlso, as a teacher of 200-level social sciences classes, I see plenty of hard sciences students who can't write worth a damn, complain if they're asked to comprehend what they read, and just generally assume that everything outside of their department is opinions and guesswork. (I've also had very lovely hard science majors, too!) So, I wouldn't be so confident that hard science students are actually generally talented in the social sciences and humanities.",

The point of a philosophy course is to make you think like a philosopher and so on.\n\nThe thing about subjects like physics or mathematics and so on is that you are either good at it or you're not. You can't really fake it till you make it. Anyone trained can look at your output and tell immediately if you're full of shit.\n\nThe thing about humanities and \"soft\" sciences is that they are full of people faking it. People that have absolutely no understanding what the fuck they are doing and they just circle jerk with other equally blind and the cycle continues.\n\nI've worked in both \"hard\" faculties and \"soft\" faculties and I can tell you that while at the faculty of science perhaps 10% were incompetent baboons, at the faculty of social sciences I'd say 90%+ were incompetent baboons.\n\nWe're not talking about the differences in how you do science and that you can't study how people learn or how ethics work the same way you'd study frogs. I'm talking about \"researchers\" that don't even understand what the word research means and \"professors\" that don't even understand their own field.\n\nDid you know you can be a professor in humanities/social sciences without having ever published a peer reviewed article? Or having produced any scientific output whatsoever? That's right, you can be a professor having only published a non-scientific popular book and some opinion columns or blog posts.\n\nA lot of those people aren't doing science at all and there isn't anyone to stop them because the professors/department leads/deans are also equally clueless about how the whole science thing works.\n\nOur research group that actually published peer-reviewed articles ended up escaping to the faculty of science. And as far as I know it's a pretty common occurrence for the competent researchers to leave because the environment is tailored to reward blogging and organizing a seminar rather than publishing peer-reviewed research papers.\n\nEven lurking this sub I can usually tell right away who's done some proper peer reviewed research and understands what's going on and who is basically clueless and has no idea what science even means.\n\nI used to think humanities/social sciences suck and are pseudosciences. Turns out it's just that most of them are incompetent. Having met people that have respectable publication records and rigorous research, turns out they also hate their peers and their fields.\n\nEver wondered why parallel fields that are basically the same thing pop up in the nearby faculty?\n\n\nI think the reason is that the people teaching those courses and supervising those PhD students don't know what they're doing. So the circle of incompetence continues. It's teaching people to make shit up and bullshit their way though their assignments instead of actually learning.",
