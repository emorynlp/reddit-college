Can you not try auditing some undergrad chemistry courses (if that option is available to you) or some other post grad taught course that would give you a grounding in the topic?",

I spent quite some time studying biology and some biochem and overall would wanna do PhD in computational sciences but bioinformatics didn't interest me as much as some chemistry areas but there aren't as many labs working on comp chemistry unlike comp bio(maybe I couldn't find them).\n\nI was hoping to to do my PhD in CS and work in a chemistry lab that does some kind of computational work as well but all the labs I've found so far are pure chemistry department. I thought maybe there's a system that I could get a PhD in another field IDK.",

      "text": "You\u2019ll need at least SOME chemistry background to not be booted out of most PhD programs during the fist year.  For instance, our cohort had to take qualifying exams in quantum, organic, and inorganic chem first day of class.  Folks who failed one or two had to take classes equivalent to upper division college course and those who failed all three were booted immediately. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you need a BS in chem but you\u2019d need to at least take some courses.  And, as you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019ll be exposed to professors who could point you in the right direction.  Taking the chem GRE is also a good idea since it could show that you have a strong background even though you\u2019re technically not a chemist.  \n\nThat being said, maybe there\u2019s some sort of interdisciplinary PhD you could go for?  Or a masters in chem since the requirements are less stringent?  \n\nI would also recommend looking up chemistry and interdisciplinary science departments at national labs.  Folks there aren\u2019t professors so they might even answer and email.  They\u2019re also a lot more likely to accept a student with a non-standard background as long as they\u2019re talented and have demonstrated ability to work hard.  There are many groups with some people doing lab chem and some people people writing code/running simulations.",

              "text": "I don\u2019t know if every school does it.  But, there\u2019s got to be a way to separate wheat from the chaff, as it were.  Other schools might just require really good grades in chem classes and high overall GRE scores.  Given your unique situation, you\u2019d have to have some PIs specifically wanting you in the program.  \n\nLook up Mateusz Marianski at hunter college in NYC; his lab does computational chemistry (mostly biochem these days).  He was my grad school room mate and he might be interested in having some computer savvy people in the group.  Please don\u2019t mention where you got this info but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a website.  \n\nAnother thought:  have you thought about going into a CS or CE program and doing a joint project with a chem research lab?  That might be harder to nail down but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s doable.  This is the sort of thing you\u2019d likely find at a big university or a national lab. Then, your admission is not judged against chemists and your strengths will come out as strengths.",

I guess I'm looking at it all wrong or like you said the middle ground is a combined program.\n\nYeah, that's probably what I should do. Also looked up Marianski lab and will definitely contact them.",

      "text": "I saw you mentioned in a comment that you're familiar with biology/biochemistry courses. So I assumed that you have taken general chemistry and organic chemistry. In that case, you probably only need to review thermodynamics and introductions to quantum mechanics. \n\nMy school had some computer science/non-traditional students (B.S.) accepted for pure computational work in grad school for chemistry. I think it would help if you know what you want to study computationally. Two major computational areas in chemistry will be from Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD). The former is more quantum mechanics focused and the latter is for bigger macromolecules treated with Newtonian forces. In addition, their interface (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics or QM/MM) is also a big area. \n\nSo, I would recommend the following. Try downloading Orca 5.0 and NAMD for free DFT and MD software, respectively. Play around with the tutorials online and see if you enjoy that first. If so, then begin looking through topics in the literature. Orca isn't too hard to learn but I have less experience with NAMD. \n\nLast comment - there are also people working in chemistry/similar fields on things more relevant to CS like machine learning, and your background in that area is probably better than most fresh chemistry graduate students anyway.",
