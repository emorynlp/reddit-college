  "title:": "As a grad student, can I ask a professor (in another department) out?",
  "text": "Okay, I need guidance from professors on if this would be very inappropriate. I'm a professional school student, a couple of years out of college. I'm taking a class in the college, in another department. This department has 0 overlap with mine, and will never have any impact on my professional or academic career. I actually really like the professor, and I *think* he may be interested, although we've both been careful to stay on the \"plausible deniability\" line. Next semester, I will not be in his class, and I intend to keep auditing classes in this department but not taking any more for a grade (it's far, far too much work and too stressful for a grade). Would it be completely out of line for me to ask him out once final grades are in? Is there some angle I'm missing where this would still be really inappropriate?",

                      "text": "I'll add another anecdote: when we met my now-husband was a grad student in a professional program, and I was a professor in another department. On our first date we realized how \"close\" we were professionally, and just sort of went for it. That said, I knew I was very likely to leave that department so if people talked I wasn't going to be around to care. I think there was one pearl-clutcher and no one else seemed to think anything of it.\n\nI've seen a couple of these sorts of relationships, and if I'm honest age and type of program makes a huge difference. If there is a big age gap such that the professor is now dating someone within the approximate age of their students who are much younger, it will look bad. Dating a young grad student or an undergrad is likely to make other students mildly uncomfortable, even unintentionally, and colleagues will probably side-eye the professor. Grad students are often friends cross-department, professors are too. It can get weird. Alternatively, if you're dating someone your own age who happens to be in another program where there isn't a big grad student social component, I don't think it's a huge deal.",

Which should be doable because as a graduate student you developing collegial relationships and will be elevating to \"equal status\" with your professors upon your graduation.  And sense you've completed your work with this department, I don't see why not move forward.\n\nOne last caveat.

My department chair gave my boyfriend a recommendation for his current job and gave me one for graduate school. We disclosed our relationship as soon as we started dating and I went through an academic board where all of my work for the two classes I took with him was reviewed for favoritism. There was none. We got a stamp of approval. \n\nI do have to say that this is the best relationship I have ever had. Sure, we have our regular issues, but we can also sit and talk about our related academic subject for hours. We have traveled Europe together. Gone to museums and archives. Poured over books and articles. We watch baseball and discuss the CBA. All in all, we are very alike. \n\nThere has never been a weird power dynamic and most of the time, we forget how we met.",
