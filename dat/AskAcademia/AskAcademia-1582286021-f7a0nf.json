  "title:": "What are faith/religious based universities in the US actually like?",
  "text": "Before I landed my current position here in the UK I was investigating Tenure track jobs (biology/neuroscience) in the US and I was suprised that some seemed like very hardcore religious institutes. Applications requiring written recommendations from local pastors and other religious figureheads, personal statements on faith. This just seems absolutely wild to someone from a country that doesn't really take religion seriously, particularly as these are biology-based positions.\n\nDoes anyone here work there? Is it like any other uni and the religious stuff is just tradition nobody takes seriously or keeps in the background/personal? Do you get atheists that just blag their way in? Are there things you can and can't teach?",

The university I attended might have been like that in the 1950s (required going to church on Sundays) but now only has loose ties with the church and had chaplains for Christian, Jewish, and Muslim students available.  Definitely didn't require letters from anyone like that.  I guess I'm saying that if the only thing you see is that they are affiliated with a church, it very well might be a negligible or historical religious affiliation.  If letters of rec are required it is probably a different story.",

It would be unheard of for a university to hire someone based on faith which is why it was a culture shock seeing it in the US.",

However, I have never been told that I can't teach anything.  I teach science.  We talk about evolution, homosexuality, gender identity, and other controversial issues.  A couple of times students have complained to my dean that I'm teaching heresy.  He told them to get over it.  I know that other Christian universities aren't as open, but mine is committed to giving faculty academic freedom.\n\nETA: I can't imagine an atheist faking it, at least not for long.  In addition to weekly chapel, church membership is required and church involvement comes up on the annual performance review.",

I went to a religious grade school, but they certainly didn't require anything like this from our secular teachers, and I think we were better for it, because we had exposure to people from other backgrounds. I don't know if they required any declaration of faith for the teachers of religious classes, but most of them were clergy anyway. I'm not sure anyone would spend enough time learning the Talmud to allow them to teach it, but would choose not to become a rabbi.",

No matter what reason the school claims, I really can't see any justification for why a position for a layperson (non-clergy) should required a declaration of faith, even if you included the mentoring a professor does. Can only a Christian professor mentor a Christian student?\n\nIt's the discrimination against minority religious groups (Jews, Muslims, etc.) that really bothers me.

There are some overbearing rules which seem unreasonable to me to place on people, especially adults.\n\nI am not a religious person in any capacity, and am here for a specific program.

              "text": "It's alright, just focusing on academics and careful to have community outside of the institution. They actually do a pretty good job overall with sciences because of a huge focus on healthcare, and I have a lot of respect for my bio teacher as an academic and professional based on her work and methods. However, things like having bible verses in tests are extremely normalized here and it can be interesting, to say the least. In healthcare and science focused courses, the extent is usually a prayer and devotional and maybe discussion based on religious values or a question here or there in course work. The praying at the beginning of class I find sweet - the teachers are literally asking their higher power to help their students be successful and encouraged and find their paths well.\n\nReligious beliefs overtaking a course is most prevalent at the school I attend in classes with any amount of religion, or humanities courses which give room for the teacher to guide by their own opinion constantly without deviating from the material. I took a world religion class here and had to adapt almost every single assignment because of constant analysis of ones own belief in god and faith and how it compares to other religions. There was an assigned essay on exploring your own religious beliefs. I talked to the teacher about it because I was like I don't....have that. At all. Can I have a different prompt? And the answer for adaptations was always just to answer it as closely as possible. ??? How do you answer \"Consider your own belief in God. How can you relate to a Daoist, given the differences between your faith and their belief system?\" closely when it is contingent on faith in the Abrahamic god? \n\nI also had a lit class where the teacher would regularly go on tangents based on his personal beliefs and were entirely unrelated to course material. He spent an entire class period on why he felt the \"sexual revolution was the worst thing to happen in America.\" We were supposed to be reviewing Russian lit. He was also big on statements that started with \"obviously all of us here in this classroom believe \\[such and such\\].\"\n\nSo honestly, those are the frustrating/invalidating ones and the bio example is pretty mild in comparison to other experiences I've had here.",

Making people sign a statement of faith may be more in your face about it, but it's rare for schools to not end up specializing in a couple of things. People know their field, so when they hear a research pitch from a potential hire, they're going to lean towards their field for the simple reason that they actually understand the proposal and think it's viable. Plus, when funding opens up to poach somebody, the first names that are going to come up are people in the field because they know who does good work that's better than their institution.\n\nLike, just look at MIT's physical chemistry department.  You have people doing genomics flavored biophysical chemistry, theoretical excited state work, experimental excited state work, bioflavored nmr, and about 4 lone wolves (out of 15). That's not even remotely close to a representative cross section of physical chemistry research, and that's literally MIT.",

A student could go there for four years and barely know it\u2019s church-affiliated. There are no belief requirements to work or study there. \n\nBut then there are other colleges that are more evangelical, and those more often will have faith statements you would have to sign to work there. As a general rule I don\u2019t try to work at those places because I just don\u2019t feel at home in that kind of culture. I know some folks who\u2019ve worked at places like that and it seems at least some faculty and students just sign it and keep their heads down. And I assume their mouths shut. Not all, but many of those colleges try to control student and employee conduct with purity rules (no sex out of marriage, no drinking, and don\u2019t even THINK about same sex relationships). I don\u2019t know for sure, but I would imagine this would have a big impact on academic freedom. (Maybe someone from one of these colleges could speak to that.) \n\nLook to see if the website says anything about faith statements. If they do, read it over and see if you can work at a place where most people at least say they believe the statement. If not, it might be a huge culture clash for you. Also look into whatever religious organization they\u2019re affiliated with. If it\u2019s a more conservative or evangelical religious group, there\u2019s a good chance the culture there will be more explicitly religious.",

          "text": "I attended a small Midwestern evangelical college for undergrad, and there was one major academic freedom incident during my time there, with a theology professor who was first denied tenure in favor of a rolling contract and was eventually let go. In this case, it wasn't the college itself that was the main problem, it was a few of the pastors in the affiliated denomination whose churches supplied a large number of the students  to the school. They had no *official* power, but they basically could hold the school hostage by threatening to discourage families in their congregations from sending their kids to the school. Ultimately, the decision to let the professor go came down to finances.\n\nSomewhat importantly, though, faculty in other departments (like philosophy) who shared this professor's controversial theological position weren't given the same treatment. Because the theology department taught religion courses that were required for students in the denomination going into youth ministry and similar fields, his presence in the department became a problem, especially since he was a leading figurehead of a theological movement that was hugely controversial in evangelicalism as a whole at that time.\n\nAll this is to say that I think there are special challenges if you're teaching on religion, especially in a school where the department is bound up with ministerial training. On the whole, faculty were pretty free to publish anything that didn't contradict the fairly generic statement of faith or mission of the school, so there were never any conflicts over, say, science faculty teaching and publishing on topics like evolution.",

Jesuit universities are generally quite proud of their Catholic heritage, have a mission shaped by Jesuit educational principles, have large theology departments and include a fair bit of religion in the core curriculum, house and educate Jesuits, and have tons of opportunities for religious life and education, but they don't force dogma on anyone and don't require students or faculty to be Catholic (and might even actively recruit non-Catholics). In my Jesuit university, I (a non-Catholic) help run (with other non-Catholics) a research center focused on a non-Catholic religious tradition, and the work we do is very highly regarded by our Jesuit president.\n\nEvangelical colleges, like you say, vary tremendously. The particular evangelical tradition they grew out of can often be a decent clue about their potential quality. A place like Liberty, which grew out of the more fundamentalist wing of evangelicalism and started by one of the founders of the American Religious Right, obviously has more baggage than some of the small evangelical colleges that were founded 100+ years ago before the fundamentalist movement had even taken off.",

      "text": "There is no clear answer as the field is incredibly heterogeneous. Some of the globally renowned schools (e.g. Duke, most Ivys) were founded by reliigous orders, but indistinguisahb from any modern institution. Schools like Notre Dame or Georgetown are a bit more religious, but certainly still produce amazing work. Then you get to schools like BYU (Mormon), TCU or the smaller Jesuit schools, and you have religious views intruding onto campus life. You may also find politics playing a role on \"controversial\" work, but certainly they are still legit universities.\n\nEventually you come to extremely faith-driven schools like Liberty or Bob Jones. Here you'll find that faith supersedes evidence when the two conflict. Many of these schools teach young-earth creationism, reject evolution and modern geology. Liberty has a museum where dinosaur bones are labeled \"circa 3000 BC\". I can't imagine you'd be able to do any remotely controversial research there (e.g. public health prof studying access to birth control). They also have very strange and strict rules for students on campus. Years ago Liberty used to ban students from seeing R-rated movies and would send spies to the local movie theater to report any students they saw attending. Their honor policy encouraged students to report their roommates for suspected masturbation. The environment is rather hostile to anyone who doesn't obviously fit in (e.g. they shut the young democrats club down pretty quickly, and penalized students for criticizing Trump). \n\nMost schools like Liberty require you to sign a declaration of faith as part of your employment contract. Anecdotally I've also heard they were incredibly hostile work environments and did not provide any support for faculty in trouble. Most of the horror stories I've heard of mistreated academia in my state came from that one school (Liberty).\n\nI'd avoid such institutes like the pague if I were you. Side note, one of the most interesting books I've ever read was by a guy from Brown who spent a year at Liberty \"undercover\". Truly fascinating, and strangely I was left with a positive impression of the students. Overall I'd guess they are just normal kids +extra religion, not the hateful fanatics I imagined. The organization itself however, is very alien to someone who went to a secular school. Worth checking out: The Unlikely Disciple by Kevin Roose.",

      "text": "I've had good experiences. I don't think I could teach at a school where faith = politics which is the case in some institutions. With that said, I'm probably not a typical conservative Christian. At my school, we have a mix of political ideologies which leads to great conversations and even school-sponsored events to give groups opportunities for discourse about hot topics on which they might disagree (for example: we did two different ones on the take-a-knee protests).\n\nI did my doctoral work at a faith based institution that is more conservative than we are but I was really honest about my perspectives coming in. For example, the writing sample I submitted included a discussion of YikYak with direct quotations from there that contained a lot of cuss words and a discussion of LGBTQ students feeling suicidal as a result of how they were treated by other students. I do a lot of feminist research and I was pretty open about it.  If that was going to be an issue, it wasn't going to work for either of us so I wanted them to know upfront. They accepted me anyway and were really encouraging of my research and opinions.\n\nAlthough I did TA a class there and really struggled when I had graduate students who had absolutely no critical thinking skills and were definitely blinded by political factions and faith talking points. I assigned them to analyze the social media of a public figure and gave them a list of questions to answer. One was about faith and how that public figure practices their faith. I was blown away by the number of students who A. analyzed Trump's twitter B. gave me lengthy answers about how thankful they are to finally have a president who models Christian values and how his twitter is a shining example of that in how he  does this, for example how he \"tells the truth\" and \"puts sinners in their place.\"  Lots of verses about \"telling the truth in love\" (although nobody explained to me which was the loving part). Very one dimensional discussion...just kind of cherry picking the handful of times he was semi-rational sounding during that week  while ignoring the tweets that didn't fit  (literally this was a week where he made several racist and sexist comments, gave several political figures who didn't like him demeaning nicknames,  and threatened at least 2 people). No one used any real support for their argument other than an occasional quote from Fox News or Jerry Falwell (no this wasn't at his school). Regardless of how I feel about the guy or his politics, it was definitely a huge stretch to make their evidence fit the \"what an upstanding Christian citizen\" narrative. Even the professor who I was working with on the course who is an actual conservative told me to grade them harshly because he's teaching them how to be researchers who can objectively look at evidence and it was obvious they were trying to support their preexisting narrative and it's essential that we don't do this as researchers  (kind of surprised me... I didn't expect him to be that objective). It was an interesting case study to me in how the same students who recognize the need for support and evidence when discussing academic things can resort to talking points and unsupported claims when it comes to politics. Also interesting, when I looked back at their \"intro\" bios, most of the students who did this had also gone to this school for undergrad. That could mean a lot of things that I don't want to speculate, but overall kind of fascinating. Regardless, my own graduate experience there was great.",

I think you're comparing a country that only has public universities (that are therefore compelled to be formally secular, and yet you encounter religious paraphernalia and ritual at say Oxbridge all the time) to a country with a robust private university showing, where you not only can get religious universities (which aren't always Christian - there are Jewish universities, Buddhist universities that I know of), but other weird stuff like universities that only admit women, universities that fall in a particular space in the political spectrum, etc. \n\n> Is it like any other uni and the religious stuff is just tradition nobody takes seriously or keeps in the background/personal?\n\nIt depends. Religious university mandate some amount of liturgy for all faculty and students, which may be as inobtrusive as a benediction at the start of term or as obtrusive as a requirement to attend church every day, and usually have religion-based bylaws (e.g. student health services at Georgetown can't prescribe birth control because it's against the religion). If you're looking for a comparison, it's a similar spectrum to public school in the UK.",

I am no longer there (I'm now at a R1). I was hired almost immediately after graduation as a full-time staff, and I worked there part-time while I was a student. My dad worked there full-time about 7 years.\n\nIn my time there, I saw rampant sexism, racism, and nepotism. Bullying and hypocrisy. A harsh rule-set was combined with liberal bending of the rules for people who had ties or played sports. Some people got kicked out over minor offenses. I know one athlete in particular who got away with a whole lot (others got kicked out for much, much less) because he was a star player.\n\nThis school is now under accreditation probation for two reasons: a culture of bullying in the staff, and blatant violations of Title IX reporting laws about sexual assault. \n\nIt's a small world and I knew people from other similar/related schools. My Dad went on to work for another, related, Seminary. The bullying was, if possible, even worse there. From my perspective, if you're invited to work at a conservative campus, don't. You will, in one way or other, be supporting regressive, bullying, unethical behavior. You will be pressured into obscuring the truth about important science. Even if, by being a very good professor, you just draw more people to the school, you support a bad system. It's a bad system. Don't support it.\n\nHappy to share more if anyone is interested.",

Incidentally, I've since heard a professor I'm friendly with go in on folks on the admin side for making people do that in interviews.

It can be a little bit of a hassle when there's a big drive ahead, but we're stuck waiting on folks to get out of church when we could be on the road.\n\nStudents often come in being very sheltered, conservative, and Christian and you do have to deal with some of their attitudes and prejudices.

I haven't changed the way I teach or interact with students if I compare it with other places I've worked.\n\nOh, one other weird US thing you find sometimes are dry campuses. I went to public university in the southern US and it was a dry campus. Totally blew me away coming from an undergrad where I literally took a final exam my senior year in a bar. Interestingly enough, the college I work at is not a dry campus at all. They have alcohol at most events, including themed cocktails. It does not always go over amazingly with conservative, christian parents from what I've been told by students that used to work doing college tours.\n\nTo address STEM in particular (not my area), there's several people on that side of things that I know to be staunch supporters of the scientific. The chair of one such department actually went after a christian private school in the area that wasn't teaching students proper science and managed to get their curriculum changed. He writes extensively on the importance of the sciences and how Christians should be more open to them. He's a cool dude in my book.",

      "text": "I agree, there is a spectrum. \n\nI am currently a post-doc (geosciences) at a Methodist-based school in the US; I'm also an atheist. For us, there is no required faith statement or any personal questions regarding religion. Our department is well-funded and well-regarded within the university, and we have people here studying evolution, the age of the earth etc. The most religion that I notice on a day to day basis are emails to the faculty/staff list-serve about worship groups or advertising a faith-based seminar series, etc.  \n\n\n\nHowever, about an hour and a half down the highway is another Christian university that does require faith statements and religious documentation of their faculty (according to my former lab-mate who is now faculty there.) He is a christian, and this doesn't bother him but was a huge turn off to me when I was looking for jobs.",

From big name \u201cCatholic\u201d/\u201cChristian\u201d schools that are not much different from secular schools (e.g. Boston College, Notre Dame, Villanova) to extremely religious and restrictive schools, which I would never consider as quality educations unless you\u2019re there for a strict and regressive religious education (e.g. Bob Jones University, Liberty University). \n\nI agree that the number of \u201creligious\u201d schools seems shocking at first glance, but if you can stay close to the mainstream then it\u2019s hardly an atypical experience.
