  "title:": "Trying to write a paper but feeling like I have nothing of value to contribute. How to get over this?",
  "text": "Writing my first paper ever, also my first as first author. \nI did write a rough draft during the summer but then decided to add some more experiments and change the order of figures. \nFor the last month or so I\u2019m sitting on the new graphs and the old draft. I just can\u2019t bring myself to write or make figures.  I\u2019m so scared that people will think my results are very obvious and I constantly feel that I made it so far on luck and now I have to prove that I really deserve to be here.\n\nMy boss said this is plain old imposter syndrome and it won\u2019t go away even after I write the paper. I\u2019ll probably think they made a mistake in accepting my paper. He says it\u2019ll take two three papers before I firmly believe in my worth as a scientist. \nThat\u2019s all fine but it does nothing to help me right now. I\u2019m just staring at my old draft and can\u2019t figure out how to proceed. Any advice is appreciated.",

      "text": "Your boss is right - imposter syndrome doesn't really go away. There will always be a \"little voice\" telling you you've only been lucky so far or that your results are so obvious that anyone else could've come up with them. But that's alright; you just need to learn how to live with it/ignore it. Think about this: the reality is that others haven't come up with the results you have, so there must be a reason for that.\n\nFor me, the only thing that helped was actually writing papers and submitting them for publication. In particular, getting feedback from reviewers has been incredibly helpful: sometimes your work is praised, other times you are pointed to literature you haven't considered yet, and occasionally you get criticised as well, but all this just helps you to put your work into perspective. Once all this is done, the feeling of getting a paper accepted for publication is so amazing that it silences the \"little voice\" like nothing else.\n\nSo, go for it and think about how happy/proud you'd be once the paper is published. Good luck!",

      "text": "ECR here too. Your boss is right, classic imposter syndrome. Not to discourage you, but it may never go away, so you gotta embrace it and learn how to deal with it. You'll always be in a point in your career where you know enough of your topic that you know how complicated it is, and how little you know about it. The good thing, that's not true, you probable know a lot more than what you think and you're very likely more up-to-date with the latest literature than the PIs/postdocs. Mentally, novelty always seems to be more \"interesting\" than whatever you're doing, because if you can do it, everybody can do it too, right? Well, that's not true. \n\nSo, what can you do? \n1. Don't trust yourself when you have those thoughts.\n2. Take a step back. Draw on a paper the steps you took and highlight important bits that inspire you to do the experiment (that goes in the intro). Now it may seem like a very linear process, but it wasn't. You just need to remember the whole process. \n3. Highlight interesting parts of the methods (or why the one you chose is the best approach). Get a coffee/tea/whatever is your poison, and try to find 3 main things you thought were interesting from to your findings (what do you want to tell people about what you did?). Even if the findings won't revolutionise science, your field, or change the World as we know it, it's still important to communicate confirmatory and negative results. And in science, we do it with a paper.\n4. Remember that a project is ALWAYS better when it's finished than perfect. Perfection doesn't exist and if you go after it, it'll only feed the imposter monster inside your head and make you keep working for something unatainable. Prioritise feedback rounds (get as many as you can) than your own expectation. Good supervisor/collaborators will likely know better than you what's \"enough\" to submit.\n5. Break down every section to paragraphs, then write a few lines about what the topic of the paragraphs should be. As you already have a previous draft, that gives you a headstart to identify what needs to be changed. \n6. When stuck, look for help. Just send it to co-authors/supervisor and ask them what they think. Ask them to be precise and suggest the changes they want to see (I hate when co-authors just add a comment that says \"change/update\"). Sometimes things take way less effort than what we envisioned, which is amazing because in academia everything takes way longer than what we initially imagined. \n\nGood luck!",

If you're still not sure, you have nothing to lose by submitting it for publication. You'll either get accepted, or you'll get feedback from other academics on how to make it better. Rejection is totally normal, and it doesn't mean the idea is stupid or bad, just that it wasn't totally ready yet, or maybe just that you got a bad reviewer.\n\nBut like many others are saying, also keep in mind that just because something seems obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to someone else!

You're not teasing apart meaning at every step, data mining to find something significant, and forcing your data into whatever narrative you want to have. Clear, concise results are like the holy grail in science.\n\nAlso, to be honest, a lot of science IS luck. We run experiments to test or examine a question, but at the end of the day we have no idea whether we're asking the right question. It's literally an educated guess. We do our best to combat this by designing experiments backed by previous literature and hold ourselves to a high standard while running those experiments. Why did my colleague get a significant reaction and I didn't? Maybe the part of the brain I'm targeting doesn't affect the behavior I'm examining, but theirs does. Literally just luck that I chose one area and they chose another. \n\nSo, sure, you might have gotten lucky, but more likely you have well designed and well executed experiment.
