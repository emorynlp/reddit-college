  "title:": "Do professors' offices typically or ever have camera surveillance?",
  "text": "Back in my research assistant days, I worked for some professors at a top university in basically the field of theoretical economics. (Their work was niche, but I'll try not to identify them here.) They let me come in everyday and work in their office while they were out of town, and let's just say I was a bored, non-PFC-fully-formed teenager who did some very stupid things in the office. \n\nAnd five years later, I am still haunted in the back of my head by the question, is there any chance they had cameras in the office? I didn't see any, but is that any type of standard practice? They were not working with any protected data but they were high-profile professors at a fancy university. They did take care to lock their office door each day and hid the key so there was a level of security. It was a small office within a larger floor of offices that just housed the two professors who worked together and their computers and papers.\n\nIf someone did have videos of me and wanted to ruin my life they definitely could. (Yes, I was very stupid, and I realize that, and I am less stupid now.)",

Right now in CA we can\u2019t even record in our lecture halls if even one student fails to give their consent. I can\u2019t imagine admin would be all that happy if they knew a department or professor was installing cameras in their office.",
