              "text": "1.  Your colleagues get to know you through service. A good department will limit your service burden, but if you let other people down in your service obligations, they'll remember that at tenure time.  It's also one of the few times that you work with other faculty, so don't screw it up. This is what is often referred to as collegiality, and once its gone, its gone.\n2. Work on multiple research projects at once, all at different stages, and be sure to understand what your departments expectations are for quality/quantity of published research.\n3. Teaching will take all the time you are willing to give it- it's always easier to skimp on research and service because the penalty for screwing that up is less immediate.  Still- be as good as a teacher as you can be while still 1) writing and 2) contributing to the success of your colleagues.  \n4. It's hard to do so prior to tenure, but eventually, you have to get off of the 24 hour work clock if you want have a reasonable work/life balance.  Try to keep regular hours, working 9 to 4 lets say, and limit how you compensate for that on the weekends and nights. There's no avoiding working after hours prior to tenure, but don't make it harder on yourself by not effectively using the time between 8 am and 5 pm.  It also helps to show up and work where people can see you working, in case there is any doubt at tenure time.\n5. Lastly, pay attention to yearly and mid-tenure feedback.  A good department will telegraph how you are doing, and being responsive to feedback is the best way to handle mistakes (which will happen- don't beat yourself up).\n6. Oh, and one more- keep your private parts in your pants when students are around.  It's a big world, and there's no excuse in a world with Tinder and other dating apps to think a romantic relationship with a student is ever justified.  Nothing is secret, not with Reddit out there (if you managed to catch the recent thread on /tifu where a student posted about her encounter with a professor, and the professor actually read it and spent the weekend shitting himself, then you can see all the horrible possibilities).",

You should try to be useful, but don\u2019t use service as an excuse not to do other things. It\u2019s the wildcard at tenure, but you won\u2019t get tenure due to service- you can only really be denied because of it. ",
