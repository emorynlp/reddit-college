  "text": "The study is available at: https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(20)30860-2/pdf\n\nTitle: \"Does Tweeting Improve Citations? One-Year Results from the TSSMN Prospective Randomized Trial\"\n\n**Abstract**\n\n> *Background*\n\n> The Thoracic Surgery Social Media Network (TSSMN) is a collaborative effort of leading journals in cardiothoracic surgery to highlight publications via social media. This study aims to evaluate the 1-year results of a prospective randomized social media trial to determine the effect of tweeting on subsequent citations and non-traditional bibliometrics.\n\n> *Methods*\n\n> A total of 112 representative original articles were randomized 1:1 to be tweeted via TSSMN or a control (non-tweeted) group. Measured endpoints included citations at 1-year compared to baseline, as well as article-level metrics (Altmetric score) and Twitter analytics. Independent predictors of citations were identified through univariable and multivariable regression analyses.\n\n> *Results*\n\n> When compared to control articles, tweeted articles achieved significantly greater increase in Altmetric scores (Tweeted 9.4\u00b15.8 vs. Non-Tweeted 1.0\u00b11.8, p<0.001), Altmetric score percentiles relative to articles of similar age from each respective journal (Tweeted 76.0\u00b19.1%ile vs. Non-Tweeted 13.8\u00b122.7%ile, p<0.001), with greater change in citations at 1 year (Tweeted +3.1\u00b12.4 vs. Non-Tweeted +0.7\u00b11.3, p<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that independent predictors of citations were randomization to tweeting (OR 9.50; 95%CI 3.30-27.35, p<0.001), Altmetric score (OR 1.32; 95%CI 1.15-1.50, p<0.001), open-access status (OR 1.56; 95%CI 1.21-1.78, p<0.001), and exposure to a larger number of Twitter followers as quantified by impressions (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.10-1.49, p<0.001).\n\n> *Conclusions*\n\n> One-year follow-up of this TSSMN prospective randomized trial importantly demonstrates that tweeting results in significantly more article citations over time, highlighting the durable scholarly impact of social media activity.",
