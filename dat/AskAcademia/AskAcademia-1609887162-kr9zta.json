They may ask other questions, but those tend to be the most common. \n\nThen strategically think about questions to ask them that convey you are intentional about launching your research program (and aren\u2019t easily google-able)\n\nEg can you tell me about mentoring for junior faculty? how would you describe the culture in the department? How does the PhD student-advisor match work? What does a successful junior faculty member look like in this dept?\n\nDon\u2019t: negotiate at this stage or be long-winded\n\nBest wishes!!!",

          "text": "Hmm I wonder what you think about the advice my mentor gave me about mentioning classes to teach. I was warned about being too specific as some professors may be territorial of certain classes and could see you as a \"poacher\" if you come on too strong. For example, I mentioned courses like Abnormal Psychology, Counseling Principles, and Psychology and Law, but made sure to discuss how I could be flexible in filling in department needs for classes within my area General Psychology, Professional Development courses, etc. For me, I think this helped land me my job as there is a very senior professor with whom I had a lot of overlap who can be a little more rigid about the courses he wants to teach. Is this (departmental politics) something that's been overhyped in hiring or something to be consider?\n\nEdit: grammar",

      "text": "Congratulations on the interview! I work at a branch campus of a much larger R1 school. After being on a few search committees, I have a few recommendations:\n\n1. Be prepared to talk about experience in both research and teaching. We as a campus prioritize teaching, however as a university we prioritize research; so when looking, we are looking for strong teachers who are capable of high quality research. Make sure you have a feel for what type of school you are interviewing at, because it could very much be the case that the table is flipped. \n2. Be prepared to give a quick overview of your research to a group of people who may or may not be familiar with your area. Also have a short version of what you've done and what you can see yourself doing with it over the next 5-10 years. Bonus points if you can explain how you can involve students in your research. \n3. Be familiar with the school's mission statement, size, area, etc. We often ask what interests a person about our school/area and it never looks good when someone from southern California has no reason to move into the middle of the snowbelt other than for a job. \n4. Run your teaching philosophy/ideas by a peer/colleague/stranger before presenting it to a search committee. I can't tell you the number of times a highly-qualified candidate went from a yes to a no when asked about their teaching. \n5. Don't give generic answers thinking it makes you a more versatile candidate (I.e. What courses do you look forward to teaching? I look forward to teaching everything from basic 100 level through graduate level courses.) These are answers given by most candidates, if you are looking to stand out, be positive and be specific. \n6. If they are available, look up the faculty in the department you are interviewing at; it is helpful to know who you are speaking with, especially if you have overlapping research. If you are in contact with a secretary at the school, it may also be helpful to know who is on the search committee. \n7. (Optional) It's rare that I've received thank you letters or emails after a phone interview, but a quick email summarizing the discussion, your strengths, and how you feel you would fit into the department at this point in the interview process may be looked upon favorably.",

When we interviewed people in my discipline (psychology) we always asked about a particular topic that students have difficulty with. It was a core question that was always asked and it went a long way toward our evaluation of a candidate. If there is such an area of difficulty in your field, be prepared to talk about how you've successfully taught it.\n\nAlso gather some information about the institution so you can be knowledgeable about the place and your discipline's place there.",

This means to teach courses they need taught, to supervise in areas for which there is no expertise. And most departments will want somebody who takes an interest in them and their work. Take time to research the people there and find connections between their work and yours. Look at the classes that are required and see which ones you can teach and then find gaps for ones that are not offered and also align with the job ad. Specialized courses I can teach are X and Y. I can easily take on required courses such as A and B as needed. I think one thing people presume is that the best or most highly qualified candidate gets the job. That is often not true. It is the candidate who can do the job they need done and who they believe will be a good colleague, whatever that means for this department. Figure out the gaps that you can fill and find ways to insert these bits of information in your answers. \n\nOne other thing is to speak confidently. Not I hope to, but I have, I am etc. even if your dissertation is still in progress do not talk about it in the future tense. You are not interviewing to be their student, but their colleague. \n\nBe serious, be friendly.",
