  "text": "Hi all!\n\nI defended my PhD last year and am currently on the job market. I'm developing concept syllabi (i.e. for courses I haven't taught, but would like to) to include in my teaching dossier. Would it be odd to publish these on my website? My site already features syllabi for courses I've taught; I don't think that's unusual. But I'm not sure about courses that are purely hypothetical.\n\nRelatedly, am I correct in thinking it'd be odd to put up research/teaching statements on my website? I haven't done this just because I haven't seen it on other academics' sites. Thanks so much for your advice.",

      "text": "Lots of personal websites list publications, conference papers, and syllabi. I've also seen one or two who have blurbs about their approach to teaching. \n\nI wouldn't put a teaching statement, research statement, or teaching evals on a professional or personal website. That's reserved for those reading my job file and my advisors.",

      "text": "One of the problems with putting something like a teaching statement up on your website is that whatever you submit as part of a search should be tailored to the school you're applying to, and whatever you put on a website will be generic. This could lead to problems where a search committee finds a disconnect between how you presented yourself to them and how you present yourself more broadly.",

          "text": "This strikes me as giving way more credit to the search committees' due diligence. I will sometimes look at the websites of candidates before they visit, to get a better feel for them and their work, but I would never go over them with a magnifying glass and say, \"my god, they _said_ they were interested in teaching a course on X but _look at this_ they have a syllabus for Y on their website! _OBJECTION!_\" \n\nObviously if your website is wildly different from your applications (you apply as all qual, but your website is all quant; you are applying as a poet, but your website says you are a chemist; etc.), that is bad, but I don't think having a sample course syllabus is going to be a problem, even if it is wildly different from the job you are applying to (it could just show your range, which is generally a good thing).\n\nI can think of exactly one instance in which Googling a candidate turned up information on their website(s) that made us not want to hire them; in that case, it was that one of their long-term side-projects was essentially advocating for the idea that they were supernaturally psychic, and we couldn't see how that would ever make it past the provost of an engineering school (without our unit becoming a laughing stock, anyway), even if we did want to hire them... but assuming your sample syllabus isn't, \"how to telepathically communicate with animals\" (I wish I was making this up), I think you're good.",
