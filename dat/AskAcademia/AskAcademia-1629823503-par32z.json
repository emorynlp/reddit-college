  "text": "I'm coming up on the end of my PhD program (STEM) and boy oh boy is that impostor syndrome hitting me hard. The past few years have been mired with failures and setbacks that have shaken the little confidence I had as a researcher.\n\nAs the end draws near my PI has expressed his frustration with my lack of results while at the same time acknowledging that the last 3 students to graduate have done so with ideas that I proposed during lab meetings and general discussions. I planned out the experimental designs for the last 4 published papers but it was always a collaboration with my lab mates, and they carried out the bulk of the experiments. I've been stuck as second author (rightfully so) for these papers but have yet to generate meaningful results for my own first author paper.\n\nI've gone through 2 project changes and am now on my third. As I write my dissertation and look back I can't help but feel horribly unlucky. No amount of work has helped me get any results of worth and I feel anger and envy towards my friends that have left before me. It was a running joke that I could come up with ideas for the lab but never could get them to work for myself... but it doesn't feel like much of a joke anymore.\n\nMy questions are: \n1. How do I approach my defense committee/PI given my failure to produce for my own project?\n2. How can I be confident in the skills I've learned when I haven't been able to use any skill to get results for myself?\n3. Do you think that luck has its place in research? How do you deal with being unlucky?",

      "text": "Tell people what avenues you explored and that they were dead ends so they don't go down them too! Negative results and failed experiments are still results, and probably more useful than positive results. Imagine how many things have been independently tried in different labs just because those things don't get published/presented.",

      "text": "Success is a combination of luck and hard work. People would say that I'm very lucky with the project that I have, but they don't see the 12+ hours day/ 6 days a week work that I put in for multiple years, plus my skill in troubleshooting for protocol problems. \n\nJudging by what you wrote, it sounds like you're really good at coming up with ideas but not so good with the application side of it. It's just part of your pros and cons, and you should find a job that fits more with your pros. Just like how I'll find a job with less writing responsibility because Im such a slow writer. \n\nAlso to note, I'm currently writing my dissertation as well and I'm hella depressed lol. I have had a handful of people tell me that their last year of PhD was the worst, so it's probably just that as well.",
