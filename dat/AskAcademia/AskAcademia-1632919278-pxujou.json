  "text": "Look, I appreciate this question doesn't exactly fit here but since it's a forum for graduate students to share their experiences, I'm asking here :)\n\nI'm exactly 1 year into my program. I'm a PhD student in Maths and I do research in a small office-- thanks to lockdowns though, I've never been in the office or met the 10 other people I'll be sharing it with. I started September 2020 in the middle of lockdown in the uk.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is- how do I make friends and socialise in the department having never met them all? Should I go round and say hi? Is it a good idea to ask for socials and propose making a group chat? seeing as we all work in the same faculty that might work?",

          "text": "I didn't downvote you, but to hazard a few guesses:\n\n1.  You said \"since it's a forum for graduate students to share their experiences\" but that's not really true; /r/gradschool may be more suitable.  This sub is mostly about how academia works, and asking \"how do I make friends\" isn't really an academia question, it's kind of a culture and personality question.\n\n2. It's a bit strange (to me) to automatically conflate your PhD colleagues and your friends; it seems like you're kind of getting ahead of yourself here.  Some of your colleagues may end up being people you get along with well, and some may become your friends, but they are not automatically going to be compatable or interested just because you're adults who happen to work in the same building at the same time.  \n\nSo in response to your actual post, I'd say yes, go introduce yourself and meet people as you would at any new workplace, but spend a bit of time getting to know them before you suggest exchanging personal information and hanging out outside of work.",
