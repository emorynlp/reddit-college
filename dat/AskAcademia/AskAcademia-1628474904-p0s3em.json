  "text": "Hi y'all, \n\nWhat is the best way to tell my supervisors in my previous institution that I will be doing my PhD at a different university? I'm working on a paper with them based on my master's thesis. I haven't seen them face to face in about 2+ months (due to covid etc) and our emails have been fairly sparse since I've been working full time in between degrees. They know I've applied to other unis. \n\nIs it better to do face to face? Zoom call? Or can a email suffice? I want to finish things off respectfully (and not make the journal process weird), but not sure if it's abrupt to suddenly book a meeting with them when we haven't had much contact in the last few months. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "My opinion is that you should bring your relationship with your master's supervisors to a close (if that's what you intend) via some kind of live communication, either in person or at least over video chat.  You've presumably worked with these people for a year or more, so in my opinion an email is a bit too cold and impersonal.\n\nAs to how to let them know, you don't need to do anything special.  Just tell them in a straightforward and dispassionate manner that you've decided to do your PhD at the University of Such-and-Such because you're excited about the opportunity to study topic X or use unique method Y or have been offered tremendous financial support there, or something like that.  You don't need to be defensive or apologetic, because decisions about your studies and your career are your business and nobody else's.  Still, it wouldn't hurt to express your sincere thanks and appreciation to your current supervisors, as this might help soften the blow.  In reality, I don't think they'll take it as a blow at all, because by now they've likely mentored or supervised any number of students who have gone on to do different things in different places.  The relationship between a supervisor and a student can be deep and personal, but there's always an inherent time limit too, because students always graduate and move on to something new in the end.\n\nSo, don't make this seem like a big scary deal in your mind, because it's not.  Just convey the information respectfully as you would in any conversation between adult colleagues.\n\nGood luck.",

I'm a just a bit stressed because one of them can get passive aggressive and I wanted to avoid that, but I defintiely need to do this properly. Cheers",

      "text": "Its better to do it via zoom. And if they are passive aggressive its not your fault. I had the same thing to say both to my bachelor and master thesis supervisors and I was lucky that they were very supportive and kept mentoring and supporting me even when I walked away because I explained the reasons to them clearly and openly. That it was always a career choice and not a choice against them or the topic. I also stayed in the same field both times and moved on to collaborators.",

Actually, in Canada, the Tricouncil Agencies will pretty much throw out your scholarship application unless you\u2019ve a damn good reason.",
