      "text": "With the usual disclaimer that things can vary wildly by disciple and by university...\n\nA reasonably safe policy is to start formal at first-contact (\"Professor/Dr Smith\"), especially if it's by email, and then pay attention to how they sign off their email replies. If the reply is formal (\"Sincerely, Prof Smith\"), stay with that. If it's casual (\"Cheers, John\"), I take that as an invitation to respond that way.\n\nIn person, something similar usually works. Mirror whatever level of formality they use, and when it doubt err on the side of more formal and see how they respond.",

In Japanese you never use honorifics like \"Professor\" or \"Dr.\" to refer to yourself, except in specific situations (like on a business card). But this doesn't cause any confusion because you always refer to professors as \"X-sensei\"; even if they are your colleagues or juniors. Even if you just took one class with a professor, you would still call them \"X-sensei\" 5 years later.",

Clearly, Japanese professors and students have a convention that works---it's, from what you describe, unambiguous how to address somebody.

(I'm sure you've encountered the situation where somebody goes in for a handshake, but a Japanese person bows for a greeting. It threw me off the first one or two times it happened, but I don't think anybody will be offended---both people recognise that they are simply used to different conventions.)",

The fact of the matter is that it is widely regarded as an invitation to use the first name if you sign off with it; conversely, an academic is unlikely to correct a student who keeps using the formal title, because it's a bit awkward to do so. The etiquette exists *exactly* to clear up that confusion and awkwardness, and cut out the worry about what titles to use. Formal first, then however they advertise themselves to you. Easy peasy.\n\n>Keep in mind that sometimes the sign off is part of a person's email signature.\n\nIs it? Normally the sign off is one element that's part of the actual email body, and then the signature gives the full title and academic rank, etc. If an email ends like this:\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn\n\nDr. John Smith\nSenior lecturer, UCL\n\nIt's pretty clear what's meant.",

In the U.S., we use honorifics to one another in academia, and it's not that senior professors are demanding junior professors to use it but they don't call junior professors by honorifics just because they're younger. \n\nEvery country and inner culture has a different way and mannerism, so how about showing some respect?",

Other than that, it's about ego, not effective communication. One could argue that students are customers (particularly in the US) and don't implicitly owe professors any deference beyond those of any other profession. \n\nI do not think it is rude and unpleasant to email someone using their name if you have met, if anything this is more standard than adding titles to every email - I don't know a single person who would ever ask that from another PhD holder.\n\nI think some of the hangup about title use often comes from institions or individuals setting norms that seem traditional or \"formal\" in an effort to add some level of prestige.",

If someone is significantly above you in a social hierarchy, you don't address them informally unless given _explicit_ permission to. Signing a letter with your first name doesn't give that permission.\n\nPresident Biden probably signs things \"Joe\" but you'd be an idiot to call him \"Joe\" unless he told you to. Separately, consider that it is seen as quite an indulgence for someone above you to tell you that you can call them by their first name \u2014 that's part of the ritual. \"Ah, call me Joe\" \u2014 is part of the game of showing who is actually in charge.\n\nYou might wonder, should professors care about this? I don't know. But they do. Why? Probably because it takes an _enormous_ amount of effort and sacrifice to become one \u2014 a lot more than it does to become an undergraduate \u2014 and because we aren't typically afforded much social respect for that elsewhere. \n\nAgain, in this situation \u2014 like all involving rules of respect and formality \u2014 you can't err by being too formal until told you don't have to be. But you can err in the other direction very easily. The correct answer is to be formal until you are told to be informal. You might think that's irrational but again, that's how it works in our culture (and our culture is WAY more lax about formality than a lot of cultures; many languages have entirely different ways of declining verbs and pronouns based on your formality status).",

Guided by communication accommodation theory, the study investigated the likelihood that students would reciprocate a professor\u2019s FOA in email communication. Participants were randomly assigned to one of seven conditions varying by professor FOA (doctor, professor, first name) and email signature (present or not), with a signature only control condition. Results indicated students were more likely to reciprocate the FOA when an email signature was not present. Open-ended responses suggested students perceive instructors more positively when instructors specify a FOA and feel anxious and uncertain when professors do not specify a FOA.",

              "text": "Dr. vs. Prof. gets a bit subtle. In the UK, only full professors are referred to as Prof., and in the US, it depends on the kind of institution whether Dr. or Prof. is a more distinguished title for a faculty member. At an institution where not everyone has a doctorate, then PhDs might prefer to be referred to as Dr., but at a research university where it is pretty much taken for granted that faculty have PhDs, but not every faculty member is a tenure-track or tenured faculty member, then Prof. might be preferred over Dr. To complicate matters further, the local convention might be that a student refers to any course instructor as Prof., even if the instructor is a graduate student.",
