Your audience has a limited amount of time and energy to spend on your paper, so make sure you have 1-3 main points you want them to take away from your paper. If something doesn\u2019t contribute to those core points, get rid of it. You can always save tangential points for another paper or a boozy discussion with a colleague.",

Putting the Methods together first also helps me determine if anything is \u201cmissing\u201d (e.g., more data to collect, another analysis to run, etc.) at an earlier stage of the process.\n\nI like to write the Results next as those follow directly from the Methods I just wrote. Results are also the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d of the paper: For me it\u2019s helpful to have that information very clearly laid out before I move on to the Introduction and Discussion. That way I can (try to) avoid going off on too many tangents \u2014 everything I write in the Intro/Discussion should have a direct thread to the data I collected.\n\nThe Introduction is usually easier for me to move onto next, because this is getting at why I did the study in the first place (e.g., what outstanding question am I trying to answer). But writing the Results beforehand helps me ensure I\u2019m only writing about a question that I *can* answer with my data. I\u2019m amazed at how often the data people have don\u2019t really address the question/hypothesis they introduce (if they do introduce one at all \u2014 increasingly uncommon in my field).\n\nI like to leave the Discussion for last because, as I\u2019m writing, I\u2019m constantly thinking about what the implications of my work are, so by the time I get here I\u2019ve thought it through ad nauseam. This also gives me more time to find obscure papers that have touched on related ideas yet don\u2019t get acknowledged much \u2014 something I tremendously enjoy doing.",

      "text": "I'm an ECR (postdoc) so I'm still polishing my writing. I was lucky to work with very prolific co-authors who taught me this approach and so far it's the best for me. \n\nI always find it daunting to begin a paper. 3 key points: 1) Break everything down to the smallest task, 2) start writing and annotating as early as you can and try to be consistent, and 3) set clear goals with your co-authors early on, I find turn-over is more important than \"perfection\".   \n\nStarting from scratch is always daunting for me, so I have a word template with the classic IMRaD structure (see below). This gives me a skeleton and feels more \"manageable\" than a white page, even though I don't know which will be the target journal. I scribble down the Methods section and add relevant publications for the intro and discussion as soon as I start the project.  \n\nOnce I have the results and I know the target journal, I change my template to the journal's structure. Having a couple of examples is useful to identify the overall length of each section (e.g., some journals prefer 3 paragraphs in the introduction, others 4 or even 5; same with the discussion, some use 1 closing paragraph \\[conclusion\\] other journals just 3 paragraphs). Then, I create subsections with \"*paragraph topic*\" which I remove after a couple of draft versions. This approach helps me to keep in mind the logical progression of the paper. I also use \"*sentence topic*\", just in my words not worrying about grammar nor style to start putting words on the page. I usually write 5-6 sentences for each paragraph. Then I add the figures. Figures are super important, so I usually have a PowerPoint with several iterations of the same analysis but presented in different ways. \n\nSo, I begin with the Methods section, then Results, Intro, Discussion, and finally the Abstract. The abstract is just a well-thought summary of your publication so I find it easier to write once I have the other sections ready (writing the abstract is just another way of writing your paper in 250 words, it has its own structure).  \n\nAfter that, it is just a matter of polishing and working with your co-authors. One issue I constantly have is to know when the manuscript is \"good enough\" to be submitted, this is when senior co-authors are key to just tell you to stop and submit it. I'm a veterinarian, so papers aren't a big task during your undergrad. I had to learn from scratch when I started my PhD, don't be afraid of bad reviews and try to maximise the times your co-authors provide feedback, I learnt a lot even though it was kinda painful and discouraging in the beginning. \n\nI hope this is useful :)  \n\nThis is how my template looks: \n\n**Target journal info:** type and length of the article  \n\n**Title1**: \\[the title I prefer\\] \n\n**Title2/3/4:** \\[alternatives\\]\n\n**Abstract:** \\[Number of words\\]\n\n**1. Introduction** \n\n* Paragraph1: Intro to the field \n* Paragraph2: Specific field details and intro to the project\n* Paragraph3: Why's the project relevant to the field?\n* Paragraph4: Closing and the relevance of the study\n\n**2. Methods (begin as soon as you can with this)**\n\n* Paragraph1: General description\n* Paragraph2: Location/case study\n* Paragraph3: Data collection\n* Paragraph4: Data analysis\n\n**3. Results (ID key results and keep it to the point)**\n\n* Paragraph1: Main result\n* Paragraph2: Result2\n* Paragraph3: Any extras  \n\n**4. Discussion (3 arguments max)**\n\n* Paragraph1: General recap and key results in context \n* Paragraph2: Result2 in context \n* Paragraph3: The project in the field's context\n* Paragraph4: Caveats/Issues/What's next?\n* Paragraph5: Closing\n\n**Extras (or in a different document):** \n\n* co-author details (not in order)\n* funding details\n* acknowledgements \n\nI always have 3 documents by the end of the project:   \n1. The word doc with the manuscript  \n2. A Powerpoint with figures  \n3. A word document with all the paragraphs we removed",

No meetings, no experiments, just figures/writing. It usually takes me hours to get \"in the zone\" but once I'm there, the paper gets done super quickly. I've never had a manuscript take more than a week to write when I set it up this way and tell everyone to go away, block email, etc.\n* Bullet point the main idea of any paragraph before writing it. Also, please no more than 5 sentences per paragraph and no more than one or two commas/\"and\"s per sentence. If you need more than that, you're probably rambling.\n* Secret magic trick: once you finish writing a paragraph, take the last sentence and move it to the beginning of the paragraph. Your paper is now 100% more skimmable = better!\n* Whatever order works best for you, but I do results (figures, bullet points for each paragraph, then text), discussion, intro, methods.\n* Definitely use LaTeX. Use overleaf if you don't want to set up the compiler on your computer.\n* Coauthors - give definite deadlines, and send many reminders. But in practice, just do all their work for them and coauthor them anyways. Almost all coauthors are dead weight at the writing stage. The few who aren't are gold.\n* Proofreading - have some text-to-speech software read the paper to you. It takes some time but its worth doing once. You'll immediately notice typos and cringe-bad sections :)",

The final result will be the usual p-hacked nonsense that makes up the majority of papers in fields like psychology that will inevitably fail replication.\n\nFrom the perspective of ethical research, the methods should mostly be worked out before you look at the data (up to some small modifications) since thats how to avoid p-hacking and forking paths. In most reputable sciences (i.e. not psychology/sociology/etc) the methods will have been specified in the pre-registration plan anyway before the data was collected, so your scope for changing them is very limited.

You really can't get more reproducible or transparent than that\n\nSorry but this is a  misunderstanding of replicability. Its not about whether the final version of your methods can produce the results that are claimed in the paper. The problem is that if you have tried 100 different methods and only picked the one that works, then your results are going to be p-hacked and its unlikely that your paper would replicate on an independent dataset. None of your significant results are actually going to remain significant once you adjust for all the many things you tried before cherry picking the single one that worked. Making code available/etc has **nothing** to do with replicability in this sense (although it does prevent outright fraud, and it does make it either for other researchers to try a replication) - its not about whether the final version of your methods ended up working, its about all the things that you tried and never reported in the final paper. Generally speaking, a replication needs an independent data set.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\\_dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pre-registration is only a thing in clinical or human studies but doesn't exist for other fields as it doesn't make sense\n\nPre-registration has nothing to do with human studies. The point of pre-registration is precisely to stop researchers from trying a bunch of methods until they find one that works (which destroys the significance of the results). With pre-registration you have to report the results that you acutally find on the data, rather than deciding you dont like the first set of results and changing the methodology until you produce the results that you want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's better to use cross-validation.\n\nPerhaps better than p-values, but doesnt really fix the problem, if you try 10 methods and pick the best one then you will still have a grossly over-optmistic measure of performance, since you have basically ran 10 different cross validations and picked the best one. Unless you are explicitly accounting for that selection effect, your ultimate estimate of performance is going to be severely biased. A replication of your final method on new data will necessarily produce  worse results since it isnt doing the same cherry picking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you're coming from psych, the methods are relatively simplistic and can be pre-specified because the data is relatively \"shallow\".\n\nIn psych, lack of replicability generally comes from data partitioning: if you dont find a significant effect when you consider all the people in your experimental sample, then try looking only at the men. If you dont find an effect on the men, then try looking only at the young men. If you find an effect on young men then great! Write the paper and pretend that you only set out to study young men and never looked at anyone else. You can even release your dataset of young men and all the code containing your final analysis so that its all \"reproducible\".\n\nThe other big one is changing your outcome measure until you find one that gives the results you want (if you wanted to prove that a certain type of discrimination makes a particular racial group less likely to graduate university but fail to find this effect in your data, then consider instead looking at whether it makes them graduate with a lower GPA. If you dont find any difference in GPA either, then try looking at the salary they earn in their first job after graduation. If you find this is lower then great, youve just proved that discrimination hurts minority graduate salaries and you can write a paper around this. No need to mention all the other measures you looked at that werent affected, and without a pre-registration plan you dont need to tell anyone that your initial primary endpoint was actually graduation rate).\n\nMaybe your field doesnt do those things, but running a variety of methods and picking the one that 'works' is the same thing in practice.",

Picking the best against several cross-validation isn't how proper cross-validation is done. That's why I always use the \"data locker\" method when applicable. Trust me, I know the dangers of garden-pathing, fishing expeditions, data dredging etc. My most recent paper explicitly explores how it can and cannot occur and how to prevent it. My paper is the first on this topic to explore it in this context and exposes the impropriety of how previous methods were employed (i.e. using p-values, without cross-validation, and without analyses of bootstrapped data variance).

Still, I assume you are asking about what to do without compromising on quality. \n\nHere are a couple of tips:-\n\n1. Don't try to make the introduction some epic all encompassing overview of the topic. Just write a couple of basic overview paragraphs then a few more paragraphs introducing what is relevant for the paper.  \n2. Similar to the above, don't try to find a way to cite every single relevant paper. In most fields there is too much literature to discuss it all. Just cite a few of the most relevant and deserving papers, including of course all those that you built your work on.",

In my experience, preparing the data I'd like to publish for a 20 minute lab meeting forces you to 1. structure your presentation in a way that can quickly be ported to paper when the time comes, 2. assemble the bare minimum background knowledge required to make the audience understand the relevance of the work, and 3. receive valuable feedback on how data/figures are presented. Basically this minimizes both the time spent organizing thoughts as well as the length of the paper (the exception is Materials and Methods which nobody reads anyways).\n\nBasically, think of a scientific research paper as being the readable version of your talk, not the other way around.",
