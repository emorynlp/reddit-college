  "title:": "They stole the project I had been working on and never gave me credit!",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been working as a graduate assistant for almost a year now. One of the projects I have worked on was a survey that I developed with the Principal Investigator. This spring semester the PI decided to leave academia so he is in the process of transitioning out. The dean contacts the PI on an email to give permission rights to the other person who is taking over his job. Today, my responsibility was to transfer the project to the said person. Today when I logged in to my account I have no more access to the project. It seems that they just took the project away. Does anyone have an idea how to proceed with this ? I am so bummed out because I worked really hard in this project to be taken away like that! \n\nThank you for your responses!",

They can do that without logging into your account. I\u2019m in research data management and I see that issue often. \n\nTalk to the new PI first.

The dean was cc\u2019d on the email. I reply that was going to do this thing first thing Monday once I was back. \n\nI log in back on Monday and I don\u2019t find the project. I look around the website and found out the IPs that had logged in to my account. Apart from me there was activity in my account on Friday of last week from this unknown username. I Google the username and the last name matches the VP of technology in my college. His initial and last name match the user ID. \n\nFrom this I concluded that the Dean apparently reached out to this person and to get what he needed.\n\nI just find this such a power move. No notice, no further emails.",

This is easily fixable and I think you will find that people will want to help you with it.\n\nI would start out by assuming that it is a misunderstanding and contact the new PI. If that doesn't work, talk to the Graduate Director for your program, Department Chair or Dean, in that order (unless you have already been talking with one of them about this--then talk to that person). The most likely answer is that they removed everyone's access when the project was transferred, which is easily correctable.\n\nIf it wasn't a mistake, then you need to talk to the same people, and also maybe the Dean of your Graduate School, but the conversation will be a little different. Regardless of any IP issues, yanking your project out from under you will derail your academic progress. That's a serious issue that everyone should be interested in correcting. In my former role as a Graduate Director, we would absolutely find a way to ensure that you didn't just get screwed in the transition.",
