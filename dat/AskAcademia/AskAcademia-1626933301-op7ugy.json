  "text": "I greatly enjoy clinical psychology, but I also enjoy medicine. \n\n(I\u2019m in the States)\n\nMy desired careers go as listed, in order \n\n1. Clinical Psychology Professor \n2. Medical Doctor \n3. Psychologist\n\nLet\u2019s say, I get a clinical psychology PhD from a top program, is becoming a clinical psychology professor at an r1 or teaching oriented university realistic? \n\nIf there\u2019s more then a 40 percent chance, then I\u2019ll go down that phd route and if becoming a professor doesn\u2019t not work out then I\u2019ll just start practicing psychology. \n\nBut if there is less then a 40 percent chance then I\u2019ll just go ahead and do medical school because I prefer practicing medicine over practicing psychology and there\u2019s a large chance I\u2019ll end up practicing psychology anyways if I get that PhD. \n\nSo how competitive is the job market for clinical psychology professors and what is a round park estimate on my chances?",

      "text": "You want to be a professor at an R1? Graduate from a top university with some research published in reputable journals and well-known advisors. Then, tack on a couple post-doctorates after that PhD. Then, get ready to sweat for a position because it\u2019ll still be competitive. Tenure track at an R1 is difficult unless you\u2019re really outstanding in your field. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to go for a position at a teaching oriented university, a PhD would probably suffice in most places to get you in the door for an interview, at least. You could secure a position at a CC with a Master\u2019s, but it likely wouldn\u2019t be Clinical, probably just an associates in psychology program.",

You may think you know what you like, but keep your mind open so you don't end up realising 10 years later that you hate what you do, or on the other hand, you don't miss opportunities to find other passions. \n\nIn my experience, it's hard to know whether you like research, teaching, or clinical practice without experience. I'm not from the US though, so maybe you get more experience in high school than I did.\n\nObviously keeping up that GPA and doing volunteering is a great idea regardless, especially if you can use volunteering to explore a wide range of industries.",

              "text": "There is a sizable difference and job security between a psychologist PhD (no drug prescription) and a psychiatrist physicians (yes, drug prescription), with the physicians on top in both aspects. \n\nI have one friend each as a psychologist and a psychiatrist. For the psychologist, schooling was six years, about 60-70k a year because she went to private school while public school can be 40kish, residency was one year, and she told me her salary would be 80-100k. Psychiatrist went to medical school for 4 years, costing 45k because it was public/instate, but private/out-of-state/DO schools can go as high as 100k per year, residency was four years, and current salary is about 200k. \n\nI think there may be PhD funded psychology programs if you want to do research. She didn't want to do research and was restricted by location. It's kind of funny because they both have very similar personalities, so maybe it's a psychology thing. Both can be professors and both can open up their own clinics. I think the main questions are whether you want to learn medicine/prescribe drugs and if salary matters to you.",
