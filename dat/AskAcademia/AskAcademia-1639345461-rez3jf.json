  "title:": "For those of you that have been supervisors for undergrad research projects, to what extent do you guide/teach the students working with you?",
  "text": "So I'm doing a research project right now, and I mean, while it's interesting and all, I feel partially lost? I'm not sure how this is supposed to work, since none of my friends are doing any projects with the same department since it's super small, nor do I know any previous students that well to ask them how it went, and I'm not particularly sure if I'm going in the right direction.\n\nBut yeah, so basically, ever since I started at the beginning of this semester, my supervisor has handed me only one research paper and asked me to study it. Which I did, for about 2 months (had to take almost 2.5 weeks off because of covid though). But yeah, he hadn't told me if I was taking too little/too much time or anything, but just let me read up until I understood it, which I sort of did and then presented on it. I decided that I wanted to do a comparison between certain methods to find something and told him about how I found another paper, so he just said okay and told me to read it. So I did. And it's something I've essentially never studied or seen during my entire degree. So I'm basically teaching it all to myself...?\n\nLong story short; is it normal to give this much \"freedom\" to your students?  How much do you normally guide undergrads specifically, or teach them during the duration of a research project. (Like I guess grad students probably do/should have more freedom when they're working on newer stuff, right?) \n\nAnyway, at this point, I'm not ever sure if I'm going in a good or bad direction, I'm just trying to figure stuff out on my own. And my supervisor isn't terrible, like he'll explain stuff if I ask him to, but he doesn't exactly,,, give me a direction or any indication that the direction *I'm* going in is correct/okay. Is this common? Or should I have asked him to sort of guide me more before?\n\n(Also note that I am not working towards an undergrad thesis, it's basically a senior year project, and for those with my major at my university, it's usually research, so it's not supposed to be super intense I think, I might just be working towards a final presentation or something. But I'm still kind of confused about what I'm doing tbh.)",

He agreed to help you one-on-one, knowing your background and level, so he should know you'll ask things that seem very basic.\n\nAnd if you do ask something so basic that it's truly wasting his time, he can tell you that. And over time you'll learn where that line is, and in the process you'll become less afraid of accidentally crossing it. (and if he gets really mad at you for asking basic questions, that's a red flag, not healthy behavior by him)",

They end up needing/wanting different levels of guidance: some of them will choose not to attend the group seminars or implement the feedback, others will seek quite a bit of further help and resources.

I like to have a quick conversation with them every day they're working on the projects just to check in and make sure they're not totally stuck and going in an unproductive direction. In the times of zoom it's much more of a barrier to just drop in and see how things are without it being a \"meeting\" that people feel they need to prepare for. But - I like them to try and find things out themselves, read papers (rather than me reading them and explaining second hand), read the user manuals of devices we use rather than me trying to remember the command syntax to tell them etc. Realistically I don't know everything, if it's a technique we're not already doing in the lab, it's possible I have a vague outline from procrastinating on wikipedia or whatever, but I'd be doing the same googling as you, just maybe with a little more big picture understanding.\n\nIf it's big picture stuff you're not sure about, I'd suggest trying to open that discussion with them explicitly.",

If it supposed to be a self-guided learning process with a faculty supervisor, your description of the interaction is about par for the course.

I tend to be pretty hands off as a supervisor, and this works well for graduate students but I'm finding less so for undergrads. I had my undergrad take several online modules for the basic topic area, and then asked him to read about 4 papers and document his understanding via weekly presentations and a written document at the end of the quarter. The goal was to get him to understand the basics, learn how to ask questions (of me, and in general). I wanted him to understand where these papers fit into the research my group is working on. He didn't exactly thrive with the hands off approach, and he didn't seem to reach out with questions or ideas. This was a learning experience for me, too.

          "text": "Ahh this is interesting. I feel like it takes time to get used to this approach tbh. We have a semester system, and I'm assuming quarters are like around 3-ish months long? But I'm gonna be honest, it took me about around exactly that much time to sort of get used to doing things on my own, and actually asking questions myself. This last month was when things actually started making sense to me. \n\nI think it's actually really good that you gave him the idea to give weekly presentations and document what he was learning (I think I'm going to start documenting too as soon as winter break begins so that I don't forget anything I've done until now). \n\nI think, though, maybe ask him if he actually understands what he's doing, in a subtle way? And like do a short impromptu q&a with him about the papers and how they relate to your research to sort of gauge how much he does understand, and what stuff he doesn't? Presentations sometimes have me almost memorizing what the paper says without actually understanding every aspect of it, so this might be a good way to see if he knows what he's doing, maybe?\n\nBut also, I guess, you can also just keep asking him if he has anyy questions at all, especially if you have weekly meetings. This worked on me (because I almost felt guilty about not asking anything and going through every meeting just saying \"yep I'm doing this,\" and \"okay,\" lol), but yeah, I mean, I've finally started asking questions about things that I don't understand. If he's naturally really quiet/introverted though, this might be a challenge, because it usually takes some time for some people (like me \ud83d\ude14) to actually get comfortable with saying anything other than okay and doing what I'm told to do, and actually giving my own ideas and asking questions.\n\nOne more thing is maybe let him know how his progress is so far. At this point, the worst thing is feeling confused if what I'm doing is enough, or worth it, or on time, and a bunch of other related feelings. \n\nI also feel like being told (not completely, but given an idea on) how to break stuff up into smaller tasks is a lot more helpful when I need to understand something. Not sure if this fits, but I'm doing an applied math project, right, so in my second paper, there was this one solution to the main equation for a model that I saw that made absolutely zero sense, since obv I hadn't ever seen anything like it before. So I actually (finally) asked my professor to explain what was happening and he guided me to a much muchhhh simpler problem from the same area and had me look into understanding that first, and then he told me 2 different methods to try, which I did afterwards, and while the solution still doesn't really make that much sense, it's a little less intimidating now. \n\nOkay this is super long lmao, but I think maybe just check in with him and see how much he understands what he's doing. If he doesn't say/ask anything during meetings because he actually knows what's going on, then maybe he just doesn't have much to say anyway. But this way, at least you can see if that's the case or if he's just confused or intimidated by the stuff he's looking into, and not saying anything because of that. (This is all assuming that he's actually doing well with the presentations  and documentation, but just doesn't say much to you. If he's not, then maybe it might be a different issue?)\n\nReally not sure if this entire comment makes sense in your case, but this is basically how I've felt for the last 4 months lol, so I'm hoping it might be relevant? Of course, someone with more experience working with undergrads like this might be able to give a better insight on what to do. \n\nThanks for replying though! Seeing all these comments here is starting to make me feel more comfortable with the idea that now I *have* to do stuff pretty much on my own lol, so this is helpful to me too. \n\nReally hoping stuff works out with your student though! I'm pretty sure the student is definitely trying hard, so it might take some time, but I hope the project goes well in the end!",

My main expectations for my undergrad RA are twofold: first is a selfish one, and that\u2019s to perform the trivial and annoying tasks that I don\u2019t want to do such as extract data from literature, organize files, put dafa into tables, and do very basic calculations. Second is more for his benefit and that is for him to learn to work independently in terms of thinking through problems, and bringing up ideas and questions for discussion. Basically, I want him to gain an appreciation and skill for generating knowledge and ideas. A big part of this is ironically identifying the difference between things he doesn\u2019t know (and either asking me for help or researching it himself) versus things that are general gaps in knowledge that require or invite investigation.\n\nA lot of this boils down to the fact that I have no illusion he\u2019s going to study this problem for his whole life; whereas he may well go on to study some other hard problem and needs to learn the process of how to work through things.\n\nIf this all sounds vague and amorphous that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s the nature of the beast :)\n\nIt\u2019s obvious to me that you\u2019re a motivated student and keen on searching for solutions to things. That will serve you well in grad school if that\u2019s your goal. I\u2019d suggest asking your advisor for some guidance on their expectations of you, and for feedback on your performance if you feel it\u2019s missing.\n\nI hope that helped!!",

      "text": "You are dealing with uncertainty in a way you likely have never felt it, but a lot of value can be gained from this (regardless of outcome) by reflecting on the experience. It\u2019s super uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty, but that\u2019s part of the deal. Figuring out how to orient yourself when you feel totally lost will give you an enormous leg up for the next time you find yourself facing uncertainty (so, I hope you\u2019ll take that in stride). \n\nNext, what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t a class, so throw out your expectations that this will feel like a class. Undergraduate research is supposed to be pretty advanced. Advanced, here, means doing the figuring out yourself. Your professor is project managing\u2014making sure you stay on track and advising/mentoring you along the way. They will not be preparing lectures, activities, or lesson plans.\n\nStudents often complain that this kind of learning feels like, \u201cI\u2019m not learning at all,\u201d because the learning is happening in a very different (a more organic and lasting) way than you\u2019re used to. You should be teaching yourself and setting your own goals. That\u2019s the entire point. These are the skills you\u2019re meant to develop during the experience, and you also have to develop your own academic/professional interests. But developing these is work, it takes intentional and sustained focus. The project is a way to give you the time and the push to do the necessary work.",

          "text": "Oh yep, definitely a lot of constant uncertainty, tbh. AND while I do see the value of it, I do wish I was sort of more, like, told that what I was doing/thinking was right/reasonable?\n\nBut yeah, I completely understand that this isn't supposed to be a complete class or lecture or anything. It's good to read that it's supposed to be like this though, I was honestly kind of starting to worry that it was only my professor/supervisor who did this lol. \n\nI do think that for the most part, the learning is somewhat there. It doesn't feel like it, but obv I get to work on problems that aren't simplified for the sake of having everyone in class be able to do them, so that's definitely a plus point. However, I mean, sometimes it does feel like usually I only have a superficial understanding of what I *am* looking at, and that I'll probably end up not *actually* learning the stuff I'm doing for the long run? But yeah, the learning to self learn is definitely happening so I'm hoping that's good.\n\nAlso, thank you for this response. I think it kinda does put stuff into perspective, so that's nice. Hoping my project comes out to be something worthwhile lol. Thanks again!",

              "text": "Trust in the process. From what you shared originally, you\u2019re making good choices. You read one thing and were able to have that lead to the next thing. This is good! Over time, through the things that pique your interest, you\u2019ll develop a specialty. I wouldn\u2019t expect to understand a discipline by reading a handful of papers, though. Set your sights on understanding something very narrow and specific (and I\u2019d give the same advice to a professor doing research!). If you can, situate what you end up studying within a broader context, but that breadth also means a lack of depth.",
