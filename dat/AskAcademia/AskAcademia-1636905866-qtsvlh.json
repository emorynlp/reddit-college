  "title:": "Too Late to Publish?",
  "text": "Hi all. I graduated from my PhD program (Biology, with focus in invasive plant/wetlands/urban ecology) a little over 5 years ago.  Much to the dismay of my graduate mentor, I did not publish my research and went into work that was completely unrelated to my academic preparation.  I've had a lot of guilt about not publishing that I still can't shake.  \n\nMy question:  Is it too late to publish in an academic journal (e.g. do you think reviewers would allow it)?  My data set is probably 10 years old at this point and my analyses were finalized in 2016.  Unlike some other fields, I would have to list the dates in the publication.  I'm not trying to get into a top journal--I just want to close the loop and shed this mental weight that is dragging me down.  \n\nI appreciate your feedback and please be kind.  This is a pretty sensitive subject that makes me feel like utter crap about myself anyway.",

Does this add anything novel?\n\nIn addition, you'll need your PI as a co-author and their permission. They may not want to publish at this point. You'll need to talk to them.\n\nBrian May from Queen submitted his thesis and published results 20 years after dropping out of his PhD to focus on Queen. It was astrophysics though, bit slower moving.",

So, check this first.\n\nYou may be able to publish the dataset itself with much less effort than a complete paper if your field allows that and the data have already been organized with methods and metadata written down somewhere.

      "text": "It's not too late. You've said in your additional comments that the data don't appear elsewhere. I have a long history of publishing long after I collected data including a paper that was published in a top journal 8 years after I collected the data and one that was in a modest journal 6 years after I collected the data. I'm currently sitting on data that is very old and one day I'll get to it. My data has to do with animal behavior in an exotic species so there's not a lot of competition for publication. Pretty much everything I do is unique. There are many reasons why people don't publish. In your case it was your mental health. In my case it's because I was at a teaching college and it was a huge struggle to break free enough time to simply collect data since I had to travel 85 miles one way to simply get to the zoo where I was collecting data.\n\nDo it! Or at least start doing it. You'll find out soon enough whether you really have the interest and ability to actually finish and publish your data.",

If you need to get up to speed on the literature in the last 5 years it'll be even more work. You'll likely need your supervisors (or someones) support.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I'm just going to dive straight in with this question. Why did you not write and publish a manuscript on your data set soon after you produced it? What barriers were in your way?  It is relatively easy (albeit extremely annoying, time consuming, and aggravating) to write a manuscript when you have a complete data set.  I am asking this because whatever barriers prevented you from writing a paper then are likely going to be much steeper and harder to overcome than the barriers that prevented you from writing a paper 5 years ago.  5 years ago the data were fresh in your mind, you had extensive connections (presumably) to get feedback and conduct follow up analysis if needed, and you had direct connection to mentors.  It sounds like you have none of those things now, and the task is going to be much harder an take more effort now than it would have then.  For some reason, it was not worth it to you then, and I think it would be worth even less to you now after changing your professional focus.\n\nI'm just struggling to see a scenario where the reward is actually worth all of the effort.  Obviously you know your circumstances best, but if it were me (I have some side projects from years ago languishing in the hands of my former PI) I would just let sleeping dogs lie and focus on my current work.",

I was completely burnt out and it took every ounce of motivation to get my dissertation completed in the end--to the point that I made myself physically ill.\n\nOnce I had graduated, I went immediately to full time employment.  Besides feeling like I just didn't have the time, I was feeling extremely averse to the amount of stress I had just endured.  Right now, I am taking some time off between jobs, so I have the time and I can see value in getting it completed.  For one, it is just one of those things that weighs on my mind as a personal failure.  Two, while I don't intend to go into academia, there are jobs that are more closely related to my area of study that I am interested in pursuing in the future.",

I've noticed that you have phrased it largely in terms of correcting a past mistake or to relieve guilt more than doing it to finalize what you feel was an important accomplishment.    \nObviously I really don't know your circumstances at all and my past baggage is pretty evident in this conversation, and you know the value of this more than anyone else.
