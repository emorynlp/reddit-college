  "title:": "I want to pursue a career in (literary) academia...or do I?",
  "text": "I've been a hobbyist writer since I was seven and have a good lot of experience in a variety of jobs that involve writing and publishing.\n\nCurrently, I teach high school English and - pardon me tooting my own horn - I rock at it. But as much as I enjoy teaching, love my students, am rewarded by my job, I...am losing it more and more by the year. Public school politics are awful and private schools are ostensibly worse in my experience. Many of the things we purport to do \"for the students,\" are seldom actually done. And so on.\n\nI got into this, actually, because when I was in college, I started off in information technology, but hated it. I was tutoring writing students at the time, so thought it'd be worthwhile pursuing a degree that would help me pursue teaching English (it was always my best subject, anyway); in pursuit of that, I had some GREAT literature and writing professors, and I thought \"I want their job.\"\n\n\"...but I should start with high school first,\" I thought for some reason. So I did. Had a great student teaching experience, too, so I kept at it. Most of my actual-teaching-experience has been great, too, but...well...see above.\n\nI enjoyed those classes, though. And I enjoy teaching. I enjoyed doing historical research and dissecting complex texts based on that type of research. Do people really still do that sort of stuff for a living? Is that a field I can somehow get into?\n\nApologies for the disjointedness of my post, I wrote this in little snippets over the course of the past hour or so. Just wanted to get my question out there, poorly-phrased as it all may be.\n\nAny information would be appreciated, even if it doesn't lead me to making any real decisions. Would still love to read about it.",

      "text": "I finished my MA in English a few years ago, and most of the PhD students who I went to school with don\u2019t have jobs in the field yet. The type of job you\u2019re hoping for exists, but there are a hundred brilliant people competing for the same one. It\u2019s a long, frustrating road for most. \n\nI will say, though, that if you enjoy teaching HS, I highly recommend considering community colleges with an MA. That\u2019s what I do and it\u2019s the best of both worlds for me. I get to teach more advanced material and teach it on my own terms, but the focus of CC is the students and I don\u2019t have to deal with very much political or bureaucratic bullshit. With your experience in HS teaching and an MA, you\u2019d be able to get a CC job without much difficulty. You\u2019ll *can* continue research work as CC faculty, but there\u2019s no pressure like there is in university academia. If you enjoy teaching, it\u2019s a great job.",
