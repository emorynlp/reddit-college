  "title:": "Grad students making our plan Bs - is there space for people like us in academia?",
  "text": "I'm a PhD student in a social science department at a top department in the field. It seems like all of my colleagues are talking about getting out of academia in recent months, no doubt in part due to grim expectations for the job market and possibly also in part based on personal reflection/reprioritization during the pandemic. People who I never, ever expected to leave academia are actively making plans to go. It is sometimes quite sad to me that some of these friends are planning to leave; they are so talented and good at what they do, and their work is important. But they, and I, are considering leaving for two reasons:\n\n1. the job market is insanely competitive and for many people it means 5+ years of prioritizing nothing but work to constantly apply for jobs and move around for various VAPs and post docs before maybe getting a tenure track position, if you are lucky\n2. the toxic work culture of academia is unsustainable and not what we want from our lives. I'm talking about the workaholism, publish-or-perish, performative humblebragging about how much one works, the tenure clock, and like i said before - having to be willing to move anywhere in the country/world at the expense of our personal lives and often mental health, sometimes constantly for years.\n\nWhat I want to know is - - is there space in academia anymore for people who want to work reasonable hours (I mean like 9-6 M-F most of the time)? For people who need to have other things going on that is not work, for people who know they need to rest and do so? I honestly cannot tell at this point. I look at my advisor and the profs in our department and most of them are responding to emails at night and on weekends and just constantly in a frenzy. I imagine that people like me get out-competed by people who just love to work all the time (yes, I know this is unhealthy/unproductive for most people but there are some who just love to work and only work and don't really experience negative results) - - or by super competitive people who are maybe less balanced but are driven to collect everything they can on their CVs. I have done well for myself as a grad student so far, but I value my work flexibility and taking down time when I need it.\n\nSocial sciences/humanities colleagues who have been on the job market in recent years - what is your perception? Are there new hires out there who do successfully create work/life balance who are not culled when it comes time to get tenure? Will things be even more cutthroat in a post-covid world? If one needs something like a 9-5ish job to feel like a human being, is it worth trying to stay in academia at all?",

Don't let the easy out of COVID distract you from the fact that this is not a new trend)), that even these jobs are filled with recent PhDs from top10 programs and they have insane productivity expectations if they want tenure. \n\nSo, honestly, I don't think so. I am 100% planning to get out, and I don't view it as a shame by any means. But that's just me, because I also know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I \\*need\\* my life to go back to having a 9-to-5 job where I don't spend 18 hours a day either doing -- or thinking about -- my research. I have too damn many skills and other interests to run on that hamster wheel for any longer than is strictly necessary.",

              "text": "Really depends -- not all social sciences are alike, and not all subfields within a given field are alike. I don't know what options there are for sociologists or psychologists, for instance. But I know historians and political scientists have plenty of options, though it varies on skillsets developed in the program and emphasis of research. \n\nMany colleagues in my PhD program are not even a little bit clear on what they might do if they left academia, because they only do normative theory and ask \"what is freedom.\" (I'm being mostly snarky here--they do important work, but their professional skillsets are a bit lacking). Meanwhile my research and interests are putting me in a great position to get a job in the government or at a government-funded research lab, or just at a think tank. For added insight, I do international relations with an emphasis on nuclear (& delivery systems) proliferation. I have had to develop a ton of technical knowledge, which will never make me a scientist in my own right but I can hold my own in informed conversations with scientists. I've also had to learn how to use a variety of methods--regression analysis, game theory, primary document analysis, etc.\n\nIn general I think the issue is less that people emerge from these programs as unemployable and more that they aren't being thoughtful about how to use the process to develop their skillsets, or at least how to SELL your skills developed through a PhD to an employer. Finding research gaps? That's analysis of complex information. Generating and performing tests via regression analysis or even rigorous qualitative tests? That's managing data and processes. Finishing a dissertation when you have a zillion other things that seem to conspire to throw you off your timeline? Project management.\n\nThe kinds of jobs you can get are all up to you. I know plenty of people who are using their research skills to work for government agencies, for think tanks, for individuals in congress even, or labs (making $$$ I can't even imagine).",

If you exit grad school with \"big data\" tools, e.g., data management, measurement, and stats, you will be fine. Lots of work there in industry, nonprofits, and government.\n\nI think for those in social sciences, you do have to accept the shift away from on-target \"greater good\" work. Most academic work from folks I know is related to social justice or similar, and job options might not match well with that. I know people who have found $$$ jobs but struggle with that aspect, and also there is often a drop in need for highly technical skills. Your first year of grad stats taught you what you need for industry in many cases.",

It's certainly not been my experience; work/life balance issues were high at the list of faculty gripes when I started my TT position in the late 1990s and they've gotten much worse sense then.

      "text": "There isn\u2019t a one size fits all answer to this in my view. \n\nThe first idea you hit on is competitiveness. For starters, the level of market competitiveness is super dependent on the field - you can check the national association for your discipline and see what the hiring environment is like. For political science, it\u2019s actually not too bad. Understanding the facts for your relevant job market is essential to making an informed decision. Generally though, academia leans towards a winner take all dynamic. This means if you\u2019re at an elite institution working with well regarded scholars you have a vastly higher chance of success from the get go. Even if the market is crushing for the average graduate, the experience of having a PhD from Harvard is vastly different than University of Missouri. Another thing to consider in your own case.\n\nOn work life balance - it\u2019s really tough yeah. It\u2019s like being a corporate lawyer - you have to accept 60 hour work weeks or get out while the getting is good, and you won\u2019t be able to choose where you live. A shocking amount of students haven\u2019t accepted this or thought about this. People who aren\u2019t comfortable with these two facts should consider other destinations. That being said, you can compensate for overworking in your early career by relaxing bigly after you get tenure. And, you can apply for jobs at teaching universities where the pressure to publish is way less and you can live a normal life. It\u2019s the equivalent of lawyers quitting corporate law to start a small town office doing divorce proceedings. But I have to say, in English speaking countries, all competitive knowledge economy jobs have a similar culture of overwork - be careful you don\u2019t jump out of the pan and into the fire.\n(edits - grammar)",

They have multiple \"you's\" working for them as minions, and they have the connections, and what they'll (have time to) work on is getting more and more grants and oppportunities, while you work yourself silly on research in the evening and weekends and let your life slip by out of romanticism and the vague idea people will read papers not written by a few PIs' research factories who massively cite internally and each other.\n\nSo, contrariwise, if you \\*don't\\* have that early advantage - then it's a Red Queen's death rat race to delusionally try to get somewhere that's not for you, or in fact survive the job at all.

Well, that depends on having a good PhD and associated connections etc. OK, so who gets that kind of PhD that sets you up for success? Etc. But the further back you go, the more time and opportunity to compensate of course.\n\nI think effectively, at a guesstimate, you could know well within the PhD whether you're being groomed for success of not. If somone got suckered into doing one of those crappy PhD projects at a crappy institute with a crappy supervisor, with no network, no high-impact publications, no intro's at conferences, no inner-circle contacts and insight about funding? Or *is* at a good insititute with a famous PI and an interesting project, but who isn't the favourite of a stable of students? I'd not want to bet anything significant on them making it.\n\nEdit: but I'd also want to say, I think we need to be careful about applying concepts like privilege to ourselves personally, at an individual level. Maybe, for whatever underlying sociological causes, you've ended up in a position where your talent shines and you can benefit from that, and that's great. Also, in my experience, people very often lie about how busy they are for various reasons, or work harder rather than smarter as long as they can't exploit someone to think for them.",

Meanwhile I see other colleagues of mine who work just as hard in fields that are more \"in-demand\" struggle in multiple temporary positions year after year, trying to churn out publications, still seeking that job. I looked at that, and I looked at the instability of higher ed right now, and decided to not gamble.

It admittedly depends on what you mean by \"best\", but it's definitely not \"the best scientists\". Almost by default the people at the top of the pyramid absolutely, overtly, can't do the actual research. I've worked for people who got millions to \"do\", say, neuroimaging studies, who'd never done anything like that and never would. They're getting money to hire someone to do it for them (and then getting the credit).\n\n\"Best at playing the game\", absolutely. Hence all the fraud scandals and unreplicable results we've had. They're diametrically opposed kinds of merit.",

As a prof, my salary is guaranteed, and I get to pay for cheap grad students. Here, everyone costs, at minimum, twice as much. That said, people are crazy skilled, and can get stuff done pretty quick. I think that's mostly a quirk of a FFRDC, though. If I was a civil servant, my salary would be covered and I'd only need $$$ to pay for contractor time.\n\nBut, yeah, highly recommend national labs.

There is nothing wrong with you for wanting to work 9-5. You are not a slacker for not living and breathing your research. That is just a narrative perpetuated by academia and that continues to be perpetuated because hiring committees and universities still prioritize those who will work countless hours to bring them in more money because (shocker!) we live in a society that is capitalistic and, therefore, values money and competition often to the detriment of everyone\u2019s mental health. \n\nThat got existential but just wanted to give some perspective.

You can do it if you land the perfect job that ticks off all your preferred work/life balance boxes (these vary by person,  for example I don't mind working some on the weekend but I like being able to stop working everyday by a certain time, being close to home matters to me which constrains my mobility, etc). But of course it's already ordinarily hard to find the perfect TT position that ticks all your boxes. And then with the added toxic work life balance some people simply expect successful academia to look like, it just compounds those unideal aspects of a position you might have thought you could handle even if it wasn't perfect. \n\nPersonally I'm looking to get out. I had a very good graduate experience (not necessarily super work life balanced but I didn't feel like I was just cog in the publish or perish machine and was excited to do research and write papers and grants), but a toxic post doc experience (no work life balance or at least not if I'm basically dropping 80% of my duties or doing them rushed so that I can steal away the life part by force to stay sane).

I even changed my job talk to focus on what I cared about (diversity in tech and STEM) going against my advisors advice. But I think this is really why I scored this job. I later learned that 4 of my advisors previous students were applying to the same position. I think they wanted someone who trained with my advisor but I stood out somehow. So the risk I took somehow paid off. You may depend on your advisor for future connections or for a tenure letter so this wasn\u2019t a smart move on my part, but I wanted to do the work I really cared about. I didn\u2019t completely burn that bridge but I needed a break and to be my own researcher. \n\nI feel very very lucky in having scored a tt job at a state school. I love it here and love working with the students.I feel many exaggerate how much they do. But it\u2019s kind of just how western work culture is. We talk so much about how much we work. I have about 7 research projects going. A full teaching  load. 11 students in my lab. And I\u2019m on way too many committees. Most faculty have 1-2 projects at a time. Some have no ongoing research.  It\u2019s my fault for having so much goin on. It\u2019s not required. I can drop most of my projects and focus on 2 if I wanted. When I apply to grants then I do feel like I\u2019m overworking and get in trouble with my partner. The first couple of years were also pretty tough due to new course preps and learning to be a faculty member. Yes the course load is heavy but there are ways to make it lighter (depends on how good of a teacher you want to be).",

This will spill over into the rest of the country as well.\n3. Under COVID most of us are \"doing more with less\" and there's little change that will ever change back as the neoliberal university admin model is all about efficiency and \"nimbleness.\" What that's meant for me and many of my friends at other institutions is that faculty are doing *more* work than ever with less support/resources to back it up, including work that used to be handled by admin staff. If nothing else, COVID will have proven the case that tenured faculty are a risk and using contract workers at every level allows you to dump them when even a single semester's enrollments or housing deposits fall short.\n\nThis is probably the worst time since the mid-1970s to be starting an academic career and it's not going to get better.
