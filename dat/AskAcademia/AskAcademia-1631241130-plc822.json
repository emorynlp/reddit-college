  "text": "Hi everyone, I know there's a lot of CV questions but I couldnt find my exact situation on here. I am a current PhD candidate and I'm curious if it is appropriate to put \"relevant coursework\" on the education section of my CV? If yes, how thorough should it be? I actually have a decent amount of research and clinical experience to list, so i'm not just looking for \"fillers,\" but I just wasn't sure how this would be viewed in academia. Thanks for any advice!",

      "text": "I've never seen it on the CVs of postdocs when doing hiring.  I suspect most people wouldn't care strongly.  At the worst, some might thing it's filler, or that think it hints at a mindset of relying on being taught rather than being independent enough to learn things yourself as needed.\n\nThat said, if you're applying for something and have one or two extremely relevant high-level courses, you can mention them in a cover letter as part of your motivation or evidence of meeting the position requirements.  Then it shows that you're thinking about the direct relevance of your training/experience to the job requirements, and not just adding standardized filler to a CV.",

      "text": "I can only speak for my field, but generally, a CV is a list of achievements, not skills.\n\nIt usually has degrees, jobs, publications, courses taught (not taken), and other stuff like awards, service, etc.\n\nI tell my students never to include their high school degree because it reminds potential employers that they are young and inexperienced. Same may apply here. If you graduated and have publications, we trust that the degree has been designed to cover what you need.",

      "text": "Best thing to put on CVs is achievements (because that demonstrates ability to actually do the skills you claim to have). However, early career and with technical things, listing skills is also fine. The problem with coursework is it doesn't really tell the recruiter much and in itself isn't a relevant skill to what they want to hire you for. \n\nInstead you can say you have knowledge of X or similar. Just be careful though where you've learnt the theory of a practical skill, how you present it. I had a master's student who said she knew how to do qPCR and luciferase assays. Turned out she'd been to a lecture that taught the theory of it, she did not know how to do either of those things. She wasn't lying, she just didn't understand at the time. I'm sure she'd cringe now if she remembered.",
