  "title:": "Theoretical contributions and qualitative research with no data yet ?!",
  "text": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b, so I'm a PhD candidate doing qualitative research combining traditional ethnographic methods and newer participatory action research methods. I haven't done my fieldwork yet, which will take place in India, due to the pandemic and therefore I have no data yet. My research topic has not been explored much and there's nothing about it that was ever done with the population I will study. My research is rooted in Community Psychology and I'm using some of the theories in that field to frame my whole research. Now, the main objective of my research is to deepen our understanding of those concepts as conceptualized by said population. \n\nHere's my issue : my advisor keeps asking me to present what will be my theoretical contributions to the field of Community Psychology. I've told him numerous times that I can't predict what those will be since I haven't collected any data yet.\n\nAm I crazy for thinking that what he is asking at this point doesn't make sense with me having no data at all yet ??? \n\nHow am I supposed to come up with theoretical contributions with no idea of what I might unearth during my fieldwork ?\n\nAny help, suggestion, advice will be greatly appreciated. I just don't know which arguments to give him anymore. And maybe I'm wrong and he's right ?! Sooo confused.\n\nHelp lol ! \n\nNOTE: My advisor is a psychologist and he's dead set on psychometrics and stats and the whole quanti thing. I don't think he's ever done anything quali or been the advisor to a student whose dissertation is using a qualitative approach.\n\nThank you !",

      "text": "This is generally an issue with doing qualitative research of the kind you are doing and having an advisor who is a traditional experimentalist type of positivist person.  \n \nThat said, I do not feel that your advisor is completely off. You must have some notions of what your research is likely to contribute, even if you do not have the data in hand. You can look at past research, you can project some likely outcomes based on your own research thus far. Look to what others in the field have done. Look in other fields.\n \nIt is highly improbable that you would have absolutely no clue about what you might expect to see. Your advisor might simply be asking you to lay down your conjectures, if not traditional hypotheses. It is doubtful that you are absolutely the first person in the world who has stumbled on this topic.",

          "text": "I agree. There are many options:\n\n* If you are using a theory/framing it, what findings have others had that you might reasonably expect in your study?\n* What findings have people found in other populations in a similar cultural/geographic setting?\n* What research has been done in an analogous population in a different culture/\"condition\"?\n* Given your research question/topic, extant literature and framework, what can you reasonably posit you could find given your existing psychological knowledge?\n\nWhen I've done this for my supervisor/funding application, they weren't expecting those literal results; more that I've thought things through and have an idea where they might go -- a demonstration almost that I understand your topic/method and literature",

      "text": "Scholar of participatory research / Child participation here.   Don't overlook the value of doing a literature review of the concept / theories of participation and participatory research and presenting them to a psychological audience.  \n\nThey are to some extent different fields so introducing theories of participation (or a subset of them ) to a specific psychological field makes a valuable contribution to the field of psychology.  You may have nothing new to say about participatory methods that the participation scholars haven't said , but you can still make a contribution to psychological fields, because it will be new to them \n\nAs caveat - there will of course be some people who have worked with participatory approaches in psychology, so you have to make sure you build on what they say.   But it is unlikely they will have drawn on participatory methods as fully as participation scholars. \n\nYou can make this even better by exploring what the two fields can learn from each other , or what the limitations and flaws in participation might be for psych research \n\nAs an example - participation usually implicitly assumes that people are entirely logically and rationally aware of their own behaviours. - it takes for granted that what people say about themselves and how they say they behave or what they do is an accurate account of their behaviour. \n\nBy contrast psychologists have many different perspectives on the link between people's accounts of their behaviour and how they behave. So there's a lot to explore there about what both fields could add to each other and how these contrast.",

Positivist research generally involves non-involved rearchers doing some work and then advocating for their findings to be applied to certain populations. This is the normative framework of positivism as it has been applied in the past.\n\nParticipatory research as defined here seeks to involve communities that will be affected by the research in the research process itself. This approach is therefore non-positivist as discussed here. Whether this leads to greater insights remains to be judged by society. Those are different questions.",
