  "text": "I had my Master's Thesis defense today. I should be relieved and happy, but I feel so so sad. I know that I did not do enough research work. Felt like the committee just gave me a freebie. I know my work is insufficient because I have been working remotely with access to a shitty server that was down for almost a month in between. So there are some severe gaps in my work (I work in the field of deep learning so I lost a lot of training time). I really want to do a Ph.D. later but now I feel as if I would turn out to be a piss poor researcher.\n\nYesterday I was worried if I would pass or not. Today I am worried if I would be even a half-decent researcher compared to my peers. I don't even know why I am writing all this here. Maybe just venting it out.\n\nSorry if my English isn't good. I am not a native speaker and just feel too sad to correct anything right now.\n\nMods please delete this post if it violates rules. Thank You\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - Thank You, everyone, for your kind words. It really helped. I feel loads better. TYSM!",

Some people just want the degree and do the minimum work and are fine with that. You seem to have a much higher standard. \n\nTake this bad feeling and learn from it. Now you know what it feels like and you know how to avoid it in the future. You could always go back and collect more data and turn your masters around into a publishable paper. It looks like you have the groundwork done and just needed more time. This would go a long way into getting into a PhD program.\n\nYou seem to have the right attitude, just turn it into a learning experience and you will do great things.",

They are just ticking boxes off a rubric, more or less. Same for grants, same for jobs; also same for every other profession. None of this determines your worth as a human in any way what so ever. You could get to a noble prize like that, and still feel like \"well I am no Einstein\" or \"yeah, but there is this other guy, who's heaps better and I am actually a fraud\".\n\n\nSuppose you Masters is actually poor quality. Can you learn from your mistakes and use that to do a better PhD? Sure you can. And now you have a handy piece of paper that allows you to apply for a PhD too.  Fantastic!",

They just care that you completed your degree so don't worry too much about the quality of your thesis. I would say you should view it as a learning experience and see where you need to improve.

What happens instead is that the pressure is gone and your body can finally have a little break.\nWhen I handed in my masters, I was sure I was gonna have a great time after.

I guess in science (I'm not sure if it's similar in your area), sometimes experiments and models don't turn out the way you expected. Models don't always match reality, and that's basically what I had to say in my thesis. I'm not that proud of it, sadly.\n\nBut you passed, so it was good enough in your supervising committee's opinion, and that's what matters. If your supervisor is willing to hire you as a PhD student, then that's good news. That means he/she is happy with your work.\n\nA few people, when I've felt discouraged, have told me that it's only a masters thesis, which in the grand scheme of things is very small in the world of research. Very rarely is a master's thesis something that will be published, so if it's not perfect, no sweat.\n\nGood job on passing. Congratulations!\n\nFeel free to message me if you want to talk more.",

A masters thesis is the result of your first ~two years of experience with research. You will NOT be an incredible researcher after two years; people spend decades improving their research skills! \n\nI agree with the other comments; your dissatisfaction is just an indication that you know your work had holes, but you didn\u2019t know how to fix them. With more experience, you will learn how to fix those holes (or avoid them entirely) and you will hopefully feel much more satisfied with your work. I\u2019m experiencing that just one year into my PhD program, and it\u2019s very gratifying. Also, sounds like you had some unusual circumstances making your work harder.

Completing a research thesis isn't about presenting a perfect piece of research, it's about demonstrating that you can conduct an independent research project within a bunch of constraints.

If you completed a satisfactory thesis despite those constraints you should be really proud of yourself.\n\nI do empathise though. I recently got my PhD and I should feel ecstatic, but the best I can manage is feeling relieved. It was not a great process, and I feel like after going through the process of addressing the examiners' criticisms I've actually managed to make the final thesis worse. That thesis will now stand forever as a monument to me taking the easy way out and doing what I'm told instead of sticking to my guns. The good news is that nobody wants to read my thesis anyway!",

Good researchers do and work hard to address those gaps or note that they do exist right now and try to estimate the effects they may have on the results.

Some feelings, however, never go away and you just end up using them for extra motivation.\n\nCongratulations on your defense. The overwhelming number of people do not even earn a bachelors degree, let alone what you have done. Your committee did not give you a pity pass. You earned it.",

Not many who begin their program follow fruitfully to the end. We are our own worst critics but remember that nobody truly gets a \u201cfree pass.\u201d The evaluators found merit in your work. There\u2019s always the possibility of extending your research for your own personal satisfaction, if you choose to. I believe learning is a lifelong process, so celebrate this milestone and rest assured that you did something that great. Congratulations!",

Think back about things you've learned, questions you've answered, systems you've built or models you have tried, and you can start by: \"completed MS\".",

I felt the same after I finished my PhD, even though I had a job at the time. \n\nFor me, it was the end of a project that I had committed to so totally, and that was it, the end. It felt like a loss of purpose, and a realisation that it wasn\u2019t finished, that there was more I could have done, but I wouldn\u2019t get to do it.\n\nIf you want closure, review your Thesis and make a list of all the things you would have done to make it better if you had the time. If you get asked about your thesis in an interview, or for academia, it will do you well to say what you achieved, what you didn\u2019t managed to do, and what you would do to improve it if you had more time or different circumstances. \n\nThe award is enough, it\u2019s the point, a mark that you had done research. The extra work you did after can bring closure, and show that you are a good researcher as well. The mark of a good researcher is not producing the perfect thesis, but showing you can go above and beyond, and are committed to bettering yourself. This is how you can demonstrate those skills.",
