  "text": "I did a research project (physics) over the summer in high school and then continued on the same one after my first year in college and effectively was able to get no results despite working quite hard. In all fairness, no way I could\u2019ve expected to get anything back then.\n\nI\u2019m doing a different project this summer with a different professor after just finishing my bachelors and it doesn\u2019t seem like I am going to get anything this time either. How often does this happen? \n\nSide ?: Will all this time spent help my PhD app at all if I didn\u2019t accomplish anything?",

      "text": "I say in experiment intensive fields it is quite common. Typically internships last only a few months (2-3 mostly) and since most you are relatively new therefore you need to learn a few new methodologies, get acquainted with the experimental tools etc. which could take a couple of weeks. Also, most internship projects aim to figure out something new so even the investigators are not sure if the results would be positive. You will have to be extremely lucky in order to get something useful out of any such project in 3 months. In my experience most such projects are dedicated towards finding if or not a certain method works or a certain technique is promising as such so the findings, even if not as expected, would help the group adjust the direction of their research efforts. Also, most such projects would be a part of the principal investigator's post doc or PhD's work. So rather, just focus on acquiring skills. Learn to operate that new instrument, analyse data and build network with the people in general. Learn about the place, what other kind of facilities exist there and try to build connections for future collab, perhaps a thesis or maybe even PhD if it is promising and you like it.",

If you want to accomplish anything meaningful then sign up for undergraduate research credit and join the lab and put in 10+ hours a week. Research can be hard and you can may only scratch the surface with short internships.",

      "text": "During 2/3 internships in undergrad, the PI was not invested in what I did, offered next to zero mentorship and left me to my devices with a grad student that was constantly on vacation and the lab coordinator.  In the end, I learned to code, started side projects to prep my PhD project, acquainted myself with new methods, etc. I found the internship itself unpleasant, unrewarding and overall an inefficient use of my time. They probably thought I was not intelligent/focused/driven/passionate enough about the field to succeed, too, so we were not setup for success. \n\nScientifically, I accomplished exactly nothing of significance over two summers. I got my name on a poster and in the acknowledgments on a paper, so there's that. I never worked with these groups again and it showed me that their brand of experimental science was not something I could ever do for a living. \n\nThe fact that I GOT these competitive internships is what mattered for my PhD application and subsequent scholarships, by demonstrating that I can proactively get funding for research and use this time on taxpayer's money to develop new skills.",

PIs tend to dangle the excitement of publishable results in front of undergrads - but this case is **extremely** rare. My internship was even funded by the government, and we still came up short of that goal. \n\n  \nWhat we gain from these internships is experimental technique, independence and scientific thinking, which is **so invaluable** for those PhD apps. It will show both on your CV and in your interviews. \n\n  \nMy shitty-no-results-internships landed me a competitive MSc position, and both the top federal *and* top provincial grants to accompany it. It will help assloads. Keep fighting that imposter syndrome OP!!",

As such summer projects (at least good ones) are usually designed to give you skills and maybe develop something the lab/group can use after you\u2019re gone. \n\nYou don\u2019t know going into research what will be fruitful at first glance and that\u2019s not personal at all. But with such a short time line it\u2019s tough to pivot when an avenue isn\u2019t any good. \n\nFinally I will point out most letters that are good can detail what a student did in terms of \u201cthey learned this code and wrote a script in it\u201d or something. If you did accomplish some things like that this summer I\u2019d say it\u2019s been fruitful.",

      "text": "I had a pretty similar experience - I did chemistry research in undergrad (summer + academic year in one lab, one summer internship and a ~2 year post-bacc in another). Most of my work was one leg of a 12-15 person project in the lab, so it was effectively 'rinse and repeat' so the other group members, mostly postdocs, could keep moving forward with their chunks. A lot of this depends on who you're working for/with, what needs to be done on the project, and your skillset. For summer internships, there's not much time to get training and build up enough trust to accomplish much more than that, but it is a great opportunity to prove that you're willing to work hard, make some connections in the field, and learn some valuable techniques that might be useful to you later. \n\nIn terms of PhD applications, the best thing you can use summer internships for is building relationships with people in the industry to write strong letters of rec. I felt like I hadn't accomplished anything in my research (0 publications), but I still managed to get into a top 10 program in my field that I start in a month! Just try to make the experience meaningful for you, whether or not you have meaningful scientific data. Best of luck with your future applications!",

Thankfully it worked out that I had other things to do to keep me busy (finals were postponed at my school and I ended up taking them remotely).",

That's a major reason why PhD admissions committees usually care more about your letters of recommendations than just a publication count. \n\nTwo of my internships during high school & undergrad had no useful results and my undergrad thesis, while it technically had results, was kind of pathetic compared to some other summer internships. I think these experiences were still helpful to me in that (1) I still learned enough to guide and develop my research interests, and (2) I still could get strong rec letters, since my PIs saw the way I worked.",

      "text": "I was a pretty successful PhD student (experimental physics), published several papers as first author, some of which were cited hundreds of times.\n\nI did not publish a paper or have my name on a paper as an undergrad.\n\nI did two summer internships at national labs, one was SULI, the other was similar, and both were very valuable.  I got to learn what research was like, I got to work at huge facilities, and I did help out a bit.\n\nOne was a theory/simulation internship.  In the very beginning of the internship they outlined what they thought my project should be, so I sat down and wrote out the equations, and proved that it would actually be impossible to accomplish experimentally (the energy requirement blew up to infinity).  Oops.  So then they were like, OK, why don't you try this other thing and just see if you can help us with our main project.  So I did that.  I wrote some simulations and played with the results, saw a couple of cool things.  I told the grad student I was working with that I saw an interesting trend, and he exclaimed, \"That must mean there's a conservation law!\"  So he sat down and proved it.  It didn't go into a paper but he put it into his thesis, and I was just happy to be helpful at that point.  It was just the two of them working on it and they were happy to have me.\n\nMy other internship was experimental.  I worked on some impressive machines and tried to test some stuff.  I never really got it working but I showed that one setup was better than another.  So at least that was useful.  It was also my first time doing any sort of experimental work (I didn't have a garage or shop class at school growing up), so that gave me a taste of it.  We also spent a few hours chatting with the lead researcher while he was running his own experiment, and that was actually just as valuable as doing it myself I think.\n\nOverall I was really happy with both experiences and got into a lot of good graduate schools.  I asked both professors to write recommendations for my PhDs, so I think that probably helped.  I don't know what the competition is like these days.  I do genetics work now and the biologists all seem to have papers as undergrads, but I think that's pretty field specific.  It seems a bit implausible.\n\nGood luck!",
