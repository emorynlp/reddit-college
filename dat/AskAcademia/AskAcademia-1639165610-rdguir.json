  "text": "I'm about to exit my postdoc at University 1 to take a permanent research position (research scientist) at University 2. However, I'm remaining a \"research affiliate\" at University 1, retaining my office, and will continue to work from University 1 (I'm working remotely for University 2 which is in a city a few hours drive away) and collaborate with my postdoc group + mentor the student I work with at University 1. Should I list the ongoing relationship with University 1 on my CV or publications? If so, how?",

      "text": "On the CV front, I don't think it would look out of place to list University 1 and 2 concurrently, e.g.\n\n* 2021 - Present     Research Scientist, University 2\n\n* 2021 - Present     Research Affiliate, University 1\n\n* 201X - 2021        Postdoc, University 1\n\n\nAs for the publications, I've seen people with multiple affiliations, so just use whichever applies to the work in question. Purely Uni 1 or 2 work, list 1 or 2. But on collaborative work be affiliated by both, e.g.\n\nDr AWizardIsNeverLate^1,2\n\n[1] University 1\n\n[2] University 2",
