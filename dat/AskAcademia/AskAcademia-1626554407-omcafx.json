  "title:": "Would it be weird to email the author of a textbook about a part of a (mathematical) proof that neither my supervisors nor I understand?",
  "text": "I am an MSc. student in Mathematics, currently doing a directed studies course under my thesis co-supervisors. I've been going through a chapter of a well-known textbook in the relevant (sub)-area, and there is a line in one of the proofs that I don't follow at all. I spent a long time playing around with the proof, but I didn't get anywhere. I also asked my co-supervisors and they didn't know either. One of them tried a few different ways and emailed me about it, but couldn't get it either - he thinks it might be a typo, but even if it is, he isn't sure how to show what he thinks it should say instead.\n\nIt's really bothering me that I can't make sense of this line of the proof (and because I'm not clear on this part, certain parts that follow it don't make sense to me either). So I'm just wondering if it would be some sort of \"faux-pas\" to email the author and ask about a line from a proof in his textbook?  Thanks!",

There's nothing wrong with e-mailing the author, but you're probably more likely to get a useful answer from an online community.\n\nIf you do post a question, I'd recommend including an image of the proof so that people have something to reference if they don't have a copy of the book handy.",
