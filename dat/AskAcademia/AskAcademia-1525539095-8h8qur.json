      "text": "A few years ago, my department was celebrating its 125th Anniversary. It was a huge, fancy gala at this very nice golf club-- everyone's in formal attire, really good catered food & bar, etc. And there were tons of people in attendance-- almost all of the current faculty, grad students, staff, plus a bunch of alumni and donors.\n\nAt some point in the evening, the department head at the time starts giving his speech at the front of the room. At the end, he gives gifts of appreciation to all of the big shots in the room-- the big donors, the keynote speaker, emeritus professors, etc. And then, he turns to his wife (who is standing next to him) and says to everyone, \"And [wife's name] here... she'll get her present later!\" while winking. It was so cringe-worthy, and everyone was uncomfortable. His wife, meanwhile, had daggers in her eyes. I'm pretty sure no \"presents\" were exchanged in the bedroom that night, haha.",

Also, that article is a very superficial explanation of the ORB. It explains it entirely in terms of experience with other\\-race faces, but more recent studies show a motivational component. That is, White people are better at identifying other\\-race faces when they have reason or incentive to do so \\(e.g., if they're told they'll get paid for each correct identification or if they believe the Black person has status or power\\). So that almost makes it worse\\-\\-i.e., it's not that Whites can't differentiate Blacks, it's that they don't care to try most of the time. That article also leaves out that the ORE is much stronger for Whites looking at other racial groups than the reverse, e.g., minority groups are almost as good at recognizing majority group faces as their own.",

Until pretty recently, a common assumption about young women in academia was that they were only there to meet a man and get married (graduate with your Mrs). So, in a context where your academic accomplishments are supposed to be the focus of the celebration, to have someone say that your GREATEST accomplishment was getting married is going to feel like a call back to the extremely low expectations that used to be so widely held for women pursuing academic studies.\n\nThere is a way to deliver the sentiment you are describing without making this faux pas. Something like, \"and equally impressively, these outstanding accomplishments were achieved without sacrifice to OPs personal relationships, as she recently celebrated her marriage to her long time partner, Ops Husband. Maintaining a thriving work/life balance in this environment is, In sure we can appreciate, an accomplishment in and of itself.\"\n\nMaybe that will seem like overkill to you. But the way it was delivered definitely would feel to me more like a condescending pat on the head than an earnest showing of respect for my achievements. We are constantly questioning whether or not we are being taken as seriously as our male counterparts, and that kind of statement would feel like a confirmation of those fears (your most important achievement is marrying your husband).",

It's not a zero sum game, we can improve more than one society at a time! The issue is with OP that your perception is of course very different to hers. As a woman with a PhD, I've been congratulated about tenfold more on my upcoming wedding than my PhD.  It gets extremely grating after a while. And every one of those people individually are just being kind, but taken as a whole society simply does not value the achievements of women in the same way as our marital status. Please understand that in a context where women have only recently been accepted as scholars in our own rights, that well meaning comment is actually quite demeaning and if it were me, I would have felt absolutely crushed and humiliated.

I've just never been able to fathom the idea that one's professional life is more important than personal relationships, and I certainly can't understand being offended at the suggestion that personal relationships are the most important part of life.\n\n> And I'll also point out for the billionth time that she did not simply congratulate me, she specifically said that my wedding was more important than anything else I'd done professionally. Therein lies the implied insult.\n\nUnless there's other evidence that she didn't really value your work, I'm just not seeing the implied insult. Perhaps she values marriage more highly than academia and that came through in the wording of her comment. That wouldn't mean she's diminishing your work in comparison to anyone else's work, man or woman. It just means that she considers family life quite important and, perhaps unthinkingly, inserted her values into her congratulations and praise of your life accomplishments.\n\n>  Maybe you should read some of the other comments that specifically address why those simple words are a bit smarting to someone who has already dealt with sexism and harassment throughout undergrad and grad school.\n\nBut why add to that by choosing to interpret a passing remark in the worst possible way? The principle of charity is not just good hermenutics, it's also gelreat therapy. Interpreting ambiguous statements in the best possible light saves us from a lot of strife.\n\nI mean, as someone who works in theology, I'm certainly heard my fair share of openly derogatory comments. Plenty of people in academia don't even think it's a real discipline and don't think we belong in a university. I'd go crazy if I decided to interpret every ambiguous remark as an attack on the value of my work.\n\n> I also would have expected fewer personal insults from someone with a religion degree. \n\nI'm sorry for that, and I shouldn't rush to conclusions about your overall character. It just becomes very exhausting having to walk on eggshells in certain circles because there are so many people in academia who rush to condemn even sincere praise as some kind of misogynistic insult, especially when you'd give the exact same praise to man.\n\n",

I think I'm a better judge of how she meant something than people who have never spoken with her before. She did other, much worse things, to the dept while in charge. She's a professional politician. In fact she never actually gave me the monetary award that was supposed to accompany the award in question. I'm just saying it's odd that a bunch of people are rushing to her defense when I'm the one who had a personal relationship with her. This comment is now infamous in my old dept specifically bc it was clear what she meant. \n\nI work with mainly men and had been told by people that my opinion didn't matter because I'm a woman. I'd been physically harassed at professional meetings. You'd be disgusted to hear a list of the things ive heard and seen. I was finally being recognized for my work and then was reminded that it'd never be as significant as what my life meant to a man. It stung. Especially bc I had previously refused marriage for that exact reason. \n\nI'm sorry that you've been belittled because of your choice to study religion. Everyone wants to think their field is somehow more pure or right than others. I'm in a biological sciences field and that kind of attitude is rampant. \n\nThanks for calmly responding.

That attitude is as damaging to women (and men) academics as anything else is.\n\nAll the harassment and beliitlemenr you've gotten from male colleagues is obviously shameful, and I'm sorry you've had to deal with that.

I would just caution you against assuming that, in general, anyone who makes a remark like that is meaning to say your work is less important because you're a woman.\n\nThat said, I can with sincerity that my  academic praise will never be as important as the respect of the people who love me and whom I love.

I had done 99% of those things without him around. He has been a driving force in other areas of my life but not professionally. \n\nSorry for implying that family life takes a back seat to academia.

She was not being given a \"great at life\" award, she was specifically being celebrated for her academic accomplishments. It's also important to note that the person speaking was NOT a close acquaintance of the OP--it's not like they had ever discussed her marriage or any relevance that it might have had to her success in the program. So, her achievements were all listed by this person who does not know her, and then we're followed by \"most importantly\" mention of her recent marriage. This is actively positioning her marriage as her greatest achievement to date, which had absolutely nothing to do with the award she was receiving.  It's also ASSUMING that she is more proud of her marriage than of her academic success, when one really has exactly nothing to do with the other. I am proud of my marriage; I would never rank it against my professional accomplishments, and I wouldn't appreciate it if others did that on my behalf. \n\nI've seen a few people here ask if there would be this kind of outcry if it were a man receiving the award and the praise for his ability to get married. Here is the difference that many people seem to be missing: I believe that's a straw man argument. I do not, in fact, think a man sitting on that stage would have ever even had his marriage mentioned, especially not in that specific context. And if he did? I'm pretty sure it would read as a cheeky joke, not earnest praise. Because men are hardly ever told that the most important thing they will do in life is get married. \n\nMy point is, gender flipping this scenario should really work to only further demonstrate the gendered nature of this issue--not challenge it.\n\nIf you have any examples that would counter the assumptions I'm making here based on my own experiences, I'd be happy to hear them.",

If I were at an event celebrating my academic achievement and had also just gotten married, and someone unthinkingly mentioned my marriage as my \"most important\" recent achievement, it wouldn't even cross my mind to take offense or to feel diminished by it. \n\nIf men are less likely to have their marriages mentioned (and I think you're right that they are), that strikes me as a problem in itself. That it would be treated as a joke is a serious problem that diminishes the value of domestic life and encourages men to devalue being good husbands and fathers. I don't think it's a problem we counter by encouraging women to adopt the same attitude, and when women do internalize that attitude it just perpetuates the disfunction of professional and academic cultures.\n\n",

Generally speaking, I'd say academia has a long way to go before it could be called \"family friendly.\" In my department, there is an unspoken understanding that it's not a good idea to talk openly about planning to have kids soon if your not tenure track (out of fear of contract nonrenewal), and there certainly isn't much focus on creating position descriptions which allow--realistically--for a healthy work/life balance. \n\nAt its core, I think the issue is the disparity in expectations and treatment of male and female colleagues. Right now, that has manifested in many women feeling an uncomfortable necessity to create deliberate space between their identity in the work place, and their identities as spouses and parents so as to be taken as seriously as their male counterparts. I don't think that necessarily equates to women talking those personal roles any less seriously or devaluing them. Perhaps it's more a rejection of the idea that those are the MOST important aspects of our identities when men often experience more social freedom to be treated as individuals outside of their roles as husbands and fathers. I like being my husbands wife very much, but I don't feel that it is the most important trait in my personal identity, and I don't consider it at all as a part of my professional identity. Many of my male colleagues, however, seem uncomfortable talking to me about anything OTHER than my husband and my marriage, and I wish that were not the case. I'd love to be invited to one of their writing groups or have a conversation about my current research.",

This puts their input into your \"irrational\" camp--if they don't agree with your \"rational\" approach, they must be, by default, irrational.\n\nSo, in many of your posts, you are responding to posters who you KNOW to be women, who have just shared their personal experiences, and you are, for the most part, attempting to write off their experiences as likely one-off issues, rather than evidence of a larger systemic issue. From your perspective, those people who are disagreeing with your assessment of these issues are being resistant to your \"rational\" analysis, despite their direct, personal experience with the issue at hand.\n\nDo you understand why I think this is a problem?\n\n",

I'm not suggesting you did it on purpose, but do understand that the only reason we are going back and forth on this is NOT because I am personally offended--it's because you are completely unwilling to see the ways in which your choices, regardless of intent, play into larger power dynamics. \n\nYou can be a part of the problem without *meaning* to be a part of the problem. Thats exactly how these social power structures are upheld--by otherwise decent people who cant or wont see how innocently intended statements and actions do, in fact, work to \"uphold the patriarchy\" as you put it. Sometimes those actions and choices can feel totally insignificant when they have never directly impacted you--I get that. I also understand that it is extremely frustrating when your words are interpreted through a lens that is very far off from your original intent. But please be respectful when people who *have* been directly impacted by these prejudices attempt to articulate why and how they are, in fact, a part of this larger problem.\n\nBelieve it or not, I'm trying to help you see this in a way that enables you to NOT be a part of the problem in your future interactions. Unfortunately, you do in fact need to think a little bit more carefully about how you communicate with women, just like we need to think a little bit harder about how we present ourselves in professional contexts. We are not at a point yet, culturally, where those of us who want things to change have the luxury of ignoring gendered implications in out language choices and actions.\n\nThat's all! I am going to leave you alone and get back to grading now. Sorry if this whole dialogue got more confrontational than I think either of us meant for it to.",
