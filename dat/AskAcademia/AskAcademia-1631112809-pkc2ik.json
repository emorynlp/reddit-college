  "title:": "Possible routes to become a permanent resident from UK to US",
  "text": "I'm an organic chemistry PhD student in the UK, I'll be finishing my PhD soon and I've always wanted to permanently live in the US. \n\nI know that there is a limit of 65,000 on the number of H1Bs that are given out each year for companies via a lottery, and that if I take a post doc at a US university it will likely be under a J1 visa, and that US universities are H1B exempt.\n\n1. Would it be possible to go straight into a research associate job under the H1B visa without a postdoc?\n\nI've been looking on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn but most research associate jobs in universities don't say if they will sponsor a H1B visa.\n\n2. Would it be possible to take a post doc under the J1 visa then somehow get sponsored for a green card by the university possibly through EB2 or self sponsor under EB1-B?\n\n3. Also what is a NIW ( national interest waiver), I've seen this term used on other posts, what are the requirements for this and what happens if you apply for an NIW?\n\nThanks for your time",

Assoc. is preparation and intent to stay (at least in the field, if not the institution) -- While a postdoc is 1-2 years and done, I presume a Res. Assoc. may be willing to stay for long enough to be included in new proposals, etc., so that an H1B is warranted (and the institution handles that process). \n\nThe (modest) difference in salary is then on the basis of responsibilities and expectations (seeking funding), not only experience.

I and many of my friends have been held up at gunpoint at some point.  Gun control laws are much stricter in the UK.  Less crime and far fewer murders.\n\nPolitics: Crazy religious nutjobs dominate one of the two major political parties running around trying to decide policy.  UK isn't always much better to be honest.\n\nStandards of living: Rare in the US for neighborhoods to be dense and easily walkable and accessible.  In the UK you might live in a quiet area really far from the town center and that might be half a mile away.  And your town of 70,000 people that nobody has ever heard of has its own bustling downtown area and a shopping district with major streets that have been permanently closed to traffic so pedestrians can enjoy themselves.\n\nIcing on the cake: Americans think baseball is a sport.

                  "text": "I'm in the US so I'll take a crack at some of these questions, although I'm no expert.\n\nRegarding retirement, my entry-level employment prior to working on a PhD had a 401k associated with it, so I would imagine a university position would as well. Between that, medicare, and medicaid, it's very possible to retire comfortably. You have to be in a position to have those kinds of plans in place and whatnot, but that's a separate set of issues that are unlikely to bite OP.\n\nMy perception of working hours here versus Europe is that we have a more work-oriented culture. A lot of the PhD students at my particular institution are working about 40-50 hours a week, but from what I've heard of other places our culture seems to be different that way. The top performers (and the professors) are working more like 40-60 on average, with some weeks being as many as 80 hours (in rare cases). That reflects what I'm hearing of other US PhD students.\n\nCommuting time depends on the region. I chose an apartment walking distance to my institution to avoid driving anywhere. Public transportation is fine, but driving is almost always faster. An hour-long commute isn't uncommon depending on the region, but 20 minutes isn't uncommon either.\n\nPolitics in the US vary drastically depending on the region. Universities are generally quite liberal, and most of the things you see getting reported about our politics do not reflect those regions whatsoever. The double-edged sword of providing states so much power in the US system is that the politics and experiences between each can be very different.\n\nI wouldn't expect there to be restrictions regarding investing (beyond any existing restrictions). If you want to put your money in the US stock market, I don't think the gov will try to stop you. From what my international friends have mentioned, the taxes are the same, but the process of submitting is different in some cases.",

In Canada, I'm in a pension plan which costs me 10% of my salary.\n\nI did the math. The pension is a better deal in term of how much money I get out of it vs how much went in (as I'm ignoring the employer's contribution), but the opportunity cost over a career of the \\~12% pension deductions amounts to something close to a half million dollars.",

They also tend to sponsor J1 if possible but are willing to sponsor H1B if you fight for it. \n2. It's very very unlikely that universities sponsor green card applications for postdocs. I personally have never heard of it. You can't self-sponsor EB1-B (maybe what you think of is EB1-A, which you can?)\n3. EB2 typically requires an employer's sponsor. But you can get that requirement waived by arguing that waiving the requirement is beneficial to the US. That's EB2-NIW. Basically, you can self-sponsor an EB2-NIW petition. Another EB that you can self-petition is EB1-A. Generally, EB2-NIW is easier (you only need 10s of citations, but usually \\~100, and a good lawyer) than EB1-A (you'll need \\~1000 or high-hundreds citations plus a good lawyer). But EB1-A is faster than EB2-NIW. \n4. One thing is that you can actually file a GC petition (Form I-140) even when you are on a non-immigrant visa (e.g. J-1). The non-immigration intention rule only applies when you apply for the visa and when you enter the US on the visa. It's okay to change your intention once you are in the US (but of course once you have shown an immigration intention and leave the US, you are not allowed to enter the US again on the same non-immigrant visa).   \nOne thing to be careful about the J-1 visa is that it sometimes has a 2-year home residency requirement. Basically, after being in the US on the visa, you must return to your home country for at least 2 years before you could apply for an immigration visa. Depending on your home country, it might be possible to obtain a waiver against this requirement. I know it's easy to obtain this waiver for some EU countries, but very difficult for my home country for example. So you should check. \n5. Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer and these comments are not advice. You probably should consult a lawyer before you decide on a strategy. I'd be happy to answer if you have any questions though.",

Most universities would have that as an option, but good luck actually finding a position as competition is fierce right now. As a PhD in a STEM field, you'd likely be shooting for an EB-1, -2, or -3 visa.\n\nThe other primary option would be to be sponsored by a spouse, which would require you to marry an American citizen. However, that might be a tall order to try and date and marry in the (limited) time period of a postdoc.\n\nAlternatively; if you specifically live in *Northern Ireland*, you would possibly be eligible for the Diversity Lottery visa, which is basically a lottery that hands out LPR. The UK is supposed to be exempted from the lottery, but Northern Ireland might still be eligible because of the US's relationship with Ireland and the wonky way the border works (from the US's perspective).",

H1-B are dual-intent. That means that regardless of being non-immigrant, you can 100% intend to stay in the US permanently. That's the point of them being dual-intent: non-immigrant **and** immigrant intent.",
