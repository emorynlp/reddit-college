  "title:": "Has anyone here quit their postdoc shortly after realizing it was not what you thought it would be?",
  "text": "Hi, I'm in a difficult situation deciding between two postdoc offers right now. Both are largely promising with a lot of pros but also some cons that are unknowns. The pandemic has been hard in terms of not being able to get to know the lab as much as in person and especially whether I could live in the city since I can't enter the country due to covid-related restrictions. So I'm getting LOTS of anxiety about showing up, hating it, and having to leave without much to show and/or being miserable. I have heard one story about someone showing up for a postdoc, realizing it was completely not for him and then quitting a week later - now he is a PI after he ended up reapplying to a different lab. I know this is only \"worst case scenario\" but it would really help to know that I'm not dooming myself to living out a terrible situation for years:\n\n**have you or have you heard of people who showed up to a postdoc, hated it, and left quickly, either to a different industry or started again with a different, better postdoc?**\n\nBoth PIs are pretty nice and understanding, and have supported previous postdocs to non-academic careers. Ideally I would still stay in academia, but **just in case** I realize I absolutely hate it, they would be supportive of me finding something else more meaningful. Stories/anecdotes of people in similar experiences would be very appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: A lot of people have been misunderstanding me. I fully plan to \"commit\" to one postdoc and turn down the other, and give it my best shot. I'm not \"planning\" to leave a postdoc before I even start. I'm just asking if people have heard stories where it was really an unpredictable terrible scenario, and they were able to back out and pivot to another, better position that ended up working out for them.. I have also done EXTENSIVE research, talked to everyone in the lab at least once on zoom, picked up as much hearsay as possible about the lab, watched videos of the PI speaking, attended their lab meetings, looked up the neighborhood on google maps and YouTube, I have done as much due diligence as is physically possible. I am banned from visiting the country due to COVID and so I'm just asking in case shit hits the fan unexpectedly, to hear any reassuring stories that I'm NOT doomed to live out a terrible situation for 5 years. If you don't have anything to this effect, don't bother commenting to \"not\" do this, I *know* the consequences. ",

          "text": "*But generally I do think that if you take up a job and relocate you should probably give it a decent chance, which means more than a few weeks. You do often have you give things a bit of time to see if you settle. If you're being abused or something by all means get out asap, but otherwise I'd recommend giving it a few months before calling it quits at any new city and job.It took me a few months to settle for sure in my new country/city/postdoc job, which I had seen for a grand total of a day before moving my life there, and it was a great job and opportunity that set my entire career up. I did panic about going, and told myself if I hated it I could leave, but I did promise myself a decent time to settle in before making the decision. I remember getting quite homesick around 6-12 weeks in, for instance. But it would have been very detrimental to take that as a sign I should leave. It was genuinely one of the best times of my life.Go in knowing you're never stuck, but willing to give it a good shot. And in my n=1 experience it's completely normal to be terrified before relocating your life.*\n\nThanks!! This is almost exactly my situation and I'm yeah, terrified about it. One of the issues is that I didn't have a great PhD and obviously this past year and a half has been a depressing time because of the pandemic. So my tolerance for staying in a shitty situation is very very low, since I've already been surviving for 2-4 years. But going in with the expectation for things to be stress-free is a recipe for disaster, I know.\n\n*I don't however think it's very realistic to imagine you can keep the other offer on ice and take it up after a week if you get a bad vibe. You do need to make a decision and commit to it.*\n\nOh no definitely not, hopefully I didn't imply that. I would fully expect to lose the other offer and have to start from scratch to look for any kind of position, rather than \"get\" the other one back.",

And from what I can understand of your post, you have no data to support the hypothesis that the second postdoc would be objectively better (for all you know, there might be different things wrong with it, and what will you do then?). Moving anywhere is always a question of risking some unknown cons! \n\nIt\u2019s mostly a question of at least finishing up some work and giving the PI time to understand that you are planning to leave. This goes in your favour as well, because it doesn\u2019t immediately mark you as someone who quits at the first sign of trouble, and word of mouth is powerful in smallish specializations. For every story you hear about people quitting something one week in, there are stories about hundreds of people whose careers were forever blighted by some such decision, even if those decisions were beyond their control. (Also, a lot of places in Europe, especially in France, have higher notice periods right after you join, so you might not be able to leave immediately without some trying financial concerns.)\n\nI would suggest eventually trying a short visit before you actually sign the contract. If that\u2019s not possible, write to the PI, to the current members, and most importantly, to past members of the lab, and ask them about your concerns. You should get a reasonable picture of the experience from these accounts, and then you can make your decision.",

These decisions in the end require a bit of a leap of faith - you won't what it's like to join a group, work with a PI or live in a new city until you actually do those things. It's normal to feel a bit nervous or apprehensive - I certainly did. Particularly if there's an international move, time zones, etc involved expect a bit of homesickness, particularly at the 2-3 month mark (and I can speak from experience, worse due to COVID).\n\nI had a few postdoc offers as well (I stopped searching after I was informally offered 2, but could have widened my search), and ultimately settled on the more 'risky' choice (in brief: more established lab vs less established lab). I was told by others that there's usually a 6-12 month 'grace period' - if you leave soon after joining, people will see that you weren't a good fit for the group and won't judge you for it (nobody is productive in a new group in this time frame anyway). If you stay for a long time, are unhappy and unproductive as a result, that's more difficult to ignore. Conversely, I know of many people who join a lab and leave within the first year for a more lucrative job offer in industry.\n\nIf you have multiple offers, then multiple PIs have seen something in you.
