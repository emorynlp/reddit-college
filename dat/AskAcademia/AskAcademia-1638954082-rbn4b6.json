  "text": "Good day, I am looking for summer internship in molecular biology or related area and just wanted to ask if directly contacting the professors that I am intersted in is acceptable, or does writing to a professor that does not know me is considered inappropriate?",

      "text": "It is fine to directly contact the PI but you should expect that most PI's won't be able to take you and many of them just won't even respond to your email. So you should email *a lot* of PIs. Make the emails personal though, don't just copy and paste. As recommended by IkeRoberts, definitely also look at programs because you're far more likely to be successful via that route.",
