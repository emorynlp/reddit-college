  "title:": "Singular 'they' in academic writing?",
  "text": "Tl;dr: can I use 'they' in my thesis to refer to people whose gender is unknown/irrelevant?\n\nSo my thesis supervisor finds it odd that I use 'they' for persons and entities whose gender is unknown/irrelevant (it's a literature thesis,  sometimes I use 'they' to refer to the narrator, hence \"entities\") . I have a background in linguistics, and as most linguists I'm pretty chill about \"proper\" language use. Plus, singular 'they' goes back centuries. My supervisor was wondering if I used 'they' to indicate non-binary/fluid gender, but he's in queer studies (my thesis is not queer-oriented, tho), so this interpretation is probably more obvious to him than most people. Is the use of singular 'they' acceptable in academic writing? \n\nAlternatively, I would like to go with the convention used in parts of pragmatics, where the speaker/communicator is referred to as 'she' (s for she, s for speaker) and the hearer/reader/addressee as 'he' (h for he, h for hearer). The problem with this is that the novels I am are working on are both written by women, and I don't want it so seem like I am referring to the narrators as female just because the authors are female. I could explain this in the introduction, tho. Thoughts?",

In many older books from the early and mid 20th century \"He\" is always used as the gender-neutral pronoun, which obviously is discriminatory and makes no sense. I was therefore taught in the late 1980s and early 1990s to use \"they\".  Many feminists have recently decided to use \"She\" as a kind of revenge for years of \"He\", which I can kind of understand. I prefer just to stay out of the whole thing and use \"they\" or other constructions.",

It is much preferable over the stilted he / she, that may not even be considered sufficient to cover everyone. Gramatically, he / him was indeed used for neutral. You can ask \"whom did you see?\" and one would answer \"I saw her\" without anyone even thinking about gender issues, although the m in whom comes from hiM not her. \n\nAll these gender issues in English are extremely funny to speakers of other languages. English speakers are definitely not more gender biased than speakers of languages where nouns like manliness or testicle have feminine gender. And definitely not more macho than speakers of gender neutral languages like, say, Persian. It is very, very silly to think usage affects such views. Should we eliminate positive from physics?",

      "text": "Yep. I do a lot of research on anonymity and spent a lot of time making sure I got this right. \"They\" is correct in all of the following instances:  \n\n\n1. If the person is non-binary. \n2. If you don't know. Even if the name sounds a specific gender or even if you've physically met the person. unless you actually know how they prefer to be called, it's \"they.\"\n3. If it's anonymous and no way to validate. Even if they claim to be a specific gender, if it's anonymous and you have no way of validating, it's always \"they.\" \n\nThe last one is a tricky one for me because my research in anonymity has suggested that our identities in anonymous online spaces are usually actually more accurate to who we authentically are and people often use anonymous spaces to \"test\" or live out parts of their identity that might be taboo, new to them, or less socially accepted. Given this, if someone claims to be a \"she,\" for example, my lean is to say that's fine even if that's not what they go by in their face-to-face life. The problem comes when it's used in a dishonest way. Like someone trolling political posts by claiming to be something they aren't. It complicates the mix because my lean is to let people be whoever the hell they want/claim to be, but because anonymity lacks accountability and there's no real way to separate which is agenda driven versus authentic, it's \"they.\"",

              "text": "It is really interesting! So basically, it talks about the influence of fantasy in our anonymous online life. It can be good or bad. \n\nSo, take the gay teenager from rural backwoods south whose religious parents would disown him if he even considered having a boyfriend who is wrestling with who he is. Being able to act out that \"fantasy\" gives him the courage to become who he actually is because he can \"try it out\" and becomes comfortable with it. Great stuff. \n\nOr imagine a kid who doesn't have a lot of friends at school whose online persona is confident and well-liked who gains confidence that carries over into their face-to-face life. Or even if it doesn't... they have virtual friends who help them to give them that needed socialization. Still, totally fine and great. \n\nBut there are several problems. The first problem is separating how much of what takes place is based on groupthink and the influence of the culture. In a feel-good instance like that, the kid didn't start being gay just because he joined a culture where it was accepted. He learned to accept himself for who he actually is.\n\nWhich leads to the second problem - imagine someone who has thoughts of racism or pedophilia. If that person explores fantasies in cultures that normalize their behavior, the outcome could be dangerous. Would the person have wound up there anyway? Maybe. But the social taboo may have kept that person in line. It's taboo for a reason in this case so there's a huge danger in being able to create a fantasy world that normalizes it, especially when that person is likely to find others who enforce it - especially with the pressures of groupthink.\n\nThe research really struggles to draw a line between how much someone is acting on who they authentically are but just has a space to do so versus the influence of the the culture and groupthink. In reality, it's probably a mix of both.",

Most of what I've done has been qualitative and the downside of qualitative research is that people are often unreliable but it still offers some insights. My research has included qualitative interviews and also analysis of the specific online spaces to look more at the actual interactions in these type of spaces (for instance, looking at indicators of groupthink in these type of spaces or looking at language that indicates disclosure). It's a much smaller piece of a really huge puzzle. Anonymity is very challenging to study in general because of the number of unknowns but it's why the multiple angles are so important to kind of piece together the larger puzzle.",
