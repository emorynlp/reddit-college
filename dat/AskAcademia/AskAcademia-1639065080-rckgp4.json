  "text": "So.. \n\nI am studying for an MFA at a good institution... (supposedly \"the best\" in the European country I am in) and I am in my second year, and I am having a really hard time adjusting.  I understand it is a  practice based degree, as opposed to \"taught\". However there is very little support when it comes to the practice element. We have studio access and workshop access, and occasional lectures and that's it. The lectures and seminars that we had were.. kind of underwhelming? Like we read \"closely\" 3 essays over two terms in one seminar, had some  artist's talks, and that's it. I am supposed to deliver a paper in a while. It's the only paper I will write, it's 4500 words, and the grade doesn't count towards the final degree grade. I get 20 min personal tutorials a term. I did not get to choose my tutor & when I tried to change them, I was told no. We get \"study support session\"... that feel again somehow..basic? on how to write essays, or do referencing.. which I though most people should be familiar with by now? As a comparison, on my undergrad, which was not art related, I had 4 lectures and 4 seminars a week, and had to do around 30 minimum  pages reading for each of them, and was graded on essays and exams for each. A 4500 words essay was something I could write in a week or 2 and get a decent grade.  I thought it was relatively \"easy\" compared to a lot of other subjects, but I still worked hard to get the grades I got. \n\nHere I feel that I will have to just show some evidence of art work over the 2 years, and that's basically it? I don't know if I am not doing enough, or if I am misunderstanding something, but it feels like a DYI course, that I am paying for, which seems like a waste of my money tbh.",
