So they got a job right out of school and never had to fight for it like our generation does. Getting a permanent contract right away also meant that they never went outside the walls of that college. So they thought they were the most knowledgeable people and when I came back from an exchange semester with loads of new baggage, they were offended. It was a reason for me to leave that school (and go to the exchange school).",

In the 70's when they had a position, the then-chair would just call up his buddies at the nearby PhD-granting institution to see which recent grads wanted a job. That was how they hired.\n\nIt was seen as controversial to suggest that, just maybe, they should advertise or recruit at conferences too. Thankfully the next chair (who was telling me this story) used the 80's to build a decent department (\"no more hiring locals who can't get jobs elsewhere\") and by the time I started the dead wood was gone.",

Profs are not moving on so chairs not always free, unis encouraging early career development for posts that don't exist. It's a mess.\n\n Yes times have changed, the classic academic route to a Prof etc isn't what it was. Now you will def need to be in the right place at the right time more than ever and have the support of a damn good mentor. Even whilst doing your PhD you will need to line up fellowships to keep the ball rolling and push harder than ever. What I don't see a huge influx of is supportive mentors as they tend to still be pushing their careers hard as well so are mostly myopic. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but now with funding harder than ever to secure, getting independent positions and your own career going is going to be tougher.\n\nNot saying don't, just be aware. That's one issue where career advise falls flat usually. Good communication if reality. It's like a secret club sometimes lol. How, who, why and how often people get promoted or secure positions/funding doesn't always come down to being good and having a good idea, as ever it's about who you know and where you are at the time. I know a few that secured 3 Yr fellowship funding in bs results and the ability to shout the loudest...",

Funding for universities is more precarious than before, with governments not thinking out the incentives of increasing uncertainty; greater investment in assets, more saving for a rainy day, less investment in permanent staff. As the author of the FT piece says, it shouldn't be for the least well off staff to bear the burden of these changes, nor the existing permanent staff. Nor should present students get less for their money as Universities use their fees to save up for a future rainy day.\n\nIn many universities, there seems also to be a growing disconnect between staff and management. What I've seen myself shows that there really is too little consultation and, what there is, exists to simply support what the management says. The change towards education being a market seems to have been a big part of this, as Vice Chancellors move around unis trying to implement new policies without enough consultation and engagement with the needs of staff.\n\nI don't know if I buy the oversupply of PhDs argument given the globalisation of education. Yes, there are many more PhDs than before but there are also many more students from many more parts of the world and more competitive universities in other parts of the world. I also worry what a tightening of this would do to the diversity of PhD students.",

And then would want to stay in those countries. So if you're in a one of those countries that pays well as a faculty... tough luck, the competition is fierce. \n\nI'm unsure why tightening it would effect diversity.

The paper itself acknowledges this in the discussion. \n\nBut putting that aside, assuming we accept the assertion that mandatory retirement is necessarily ageism, can you explain to me why older individuals holding onto jobs (especially in a highly competitive market, and where they cannot get fired for doing a poor job or being outright abusive) well past usual retirement age isn't an example of taking up resources? Or even if it's not, what can be done to avoid the problems with the tenure system that are being presented here? Do we remove tenure altogether and wait for the ones who have tenure now to retire/pass on? (Genuine question, open to the answer.)",

Some are very applicable in industry, others not.   \n\nMy experience is mainly in Neuroscience (Germany and Netherlands), where maybe half of my friends took more than 6 months to find a job, often only after getting more training.  \n- One studied communication (I think she did a Bachelor) at a University to do Science PR. I also know an Behavioural Biologist that is trying to go this route via an internship at our institute's PR department    \n- Two went on to become Big Data Consultants, I believe one got the certificate before he secured the job, the other lucked out and the company paid for it.   \n- Multiple ones got certified as Quality assurance manager or Project manager. Some lucked out, others still took months to find a job (up to a year, as far as I am aware). This is the go-to program our employment office supports, so it's quite common for different STEM graduates in my region. I also know three more people who tried to take this route without certification, they are still in science, though.     \n- One went on to become a medical writer for drug applications, she got trained by the company.  \n- Other than that a consultant firm that basically does consulting for every type of problem solving is heavily recruiting in the area, I think one of our friends ended up there, would have to check again.  \nI personally made the surprisingly smart choice to add a Master in Computer Science after my Bachelor in Biology and got basically hired through that and not my Neuroscience PhD. (Software Tester, where I also picked up a certification during my Master.)\n\nI also know one guy in Physics (Computer Vision) who's now working at Bosch in automated driving.

This exacerbates publish or perish pressure in grad school and means the competition on the job market is fiercer.\n* Dropping enrollments = less demand. The post-WWII expansion of college attendance has ebbed, and people having fewer kids means dwindling enrollment, university closures, etc.\n* The collapse or reduction of influence of the old boys club means open competition rather than nepotism, so even grads from top schools must be better today than they were in the past if they wish to secure a good position.",

Later this retirement age was eliminated and their hiring reduced to around 40-ish new faculty a year. So that is roughly a 20% decrease in the number of jobs, plus there was probably an increase in the number of new PhDs per job because an academic staying longer usually means they train more students.",
