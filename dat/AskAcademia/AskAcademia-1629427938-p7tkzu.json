  "text": "\nHi All,\n\nI am in my fourth year of the TT road and next year I will be submitting the package. Just wondering should I start looking for some jobs to see where am at on the market now? I tend to apply associate professor with tenure, any advice on this? \nAny advice or anybody had the same experience will be really helpful! Thanks",

Assistant and MAYBE associate. Whether you can get an associate position depends on the institution.\n\nYou would need to be an excellent-to-perfect fit for what they want in expertise and experience to get automatically promoted with the job offer at most schools. \n\nIf you\u2019re definitely the best candidate but they don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t by policy(or admin decree) give you the associate rank automatically some may offer it to you at the assistant rank with a faster timeline to promotion.\n\nKeep in mind that many schools won\u2019t let you keep all of your tenure clock at the assistant level. Be prepared to have to spend an extra couple of years untenured if you make the move.",
