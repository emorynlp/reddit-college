  "title:": "Got my PhD. But what's the point? I've never felt worse in my life.",
  "text": "So last week I had my viva and it was successful. How cool. It's anything but that.\n\nMy PhD path wasn't the smoothest. It was interdiciplinary which caused problems with the various committees and my funding institution. The degree committee of my department didn't like that a good portion of my work was outside of their scope and kept reminding me that if I do too much of that they won't be able to approve me at the end. The funding institution wanted me to move in that direction so if I didn't they would stop my funding. Finding the middle ground was no easy task since it often went down to areas that I didn't like. On top of that my supervisor died in the middle of my PhD. So had to find a new one, convince the funding institution to keep funding me and all of that. New supervisor didn't like my methodology, etc. To make it short, it's done. But at a price.\n\nPast four years have been hell. On average I worked 12 hours a day, 365 days a year to pull this off. Zero downtime. Zero holidays. Zero time spent with friends (I don't have any I guess, since I haven't seen them in so long) or family. At times, I worked 16 hours a day. Based on my calculation I've done nearly 10 years worth of typical \"full time\" work in the past 4 years. My health suffered significantly at multiple times. That's what it took to overcome all those issues and end this successfully. Now that it's all over, I see that there's no there, there. I don't even want to go to my own graduation. I can have them mail the degree.\n\nThe truth is, I've lost all interest in everything I did. All that I worked on during that PhD. All that I did before it. All that I studied. To me they're just meaningless things now. I don't want to spend another second doing any of it. When I see someone doing something simple and easy, I envy that. Delivering pizzas or cutting the grass actually looks good. These people look free. I feel like I've been a slave to a system.\n\nI don't know. Im 28. I'm too old now to start over. Already 10 years after 18 and I feel like everything I learned after 18 is pointless. So I effectively not only wasted 10 years of my life, but it took away everything I had, mentally and physically. I don't have it in me to work that hard anymore. It seems like nothing I can do can make me happy now.\n\nI want to move on from all of it. Just can't see where. I don't think people outside of academia understand. People tell me how happy I should be and how amazing my life is going to be now that I have a Dr in my name but that's just nonsense to me.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\n",

      "text": "First of all, well done.\n\nSecondly, take some down time. The first advice I give anyone doing a PhD is \"take your holiday, and treat it like a job\". You currently have no perspective on anything you've done. Go out, get away from it for a few weeks. Catch up with your friends (they are still your friends - I just had an amazing weekend with friends I barely get to see more than once or twice a decade now). Spend some time with your family.\n\nAllow yourself to celebrate your success. Go out and smell the roses. Give yourself some thinking time. I can strongly advocate for going out and doing a manual labour job for a few months  - it gives you wonderful perspective and time to think.\n\nYou didn't do it to get a Dr in your name (at least I hope not). That is simply a byproduct of you having learnt phenomenal project development, management and completion skills.\n\nAlso, 28 is not too old to do anything. I *started* my PhD when I was 27.",

Which is why it's a bit amusing watching people from countries (or in fields) with shorter programmes complain about being too old when our \"standard\" finishing age is much layer.

Then re-evaluate in a few weeks. If you still hate it, find something else. I started my PhD program at 27.  There is always something else out there. \n\nJust make sure you take a break before you make any decisions. ",

      "text": "First, and I think you can see this from the other comments, you are not alone.  Many people get burnt out during their PhD.  Your doctorate research topic does not have to be what you do the rest of your life.  In fact, for the majority of people I know, they are no longer doing anything related to their dissertation (other than being in the same discipline).  So do not feel trapped by your topic.\n\nI agree with others that a vacation would be a good idea.  You probably have not been able to save much if any money so it may not be traveling the world, but getting to know some old friends by crashing on their couch and hanging out for a couple of weeks may be helpful.  Around my 3rd year of my PhD I had a major crash and disappeared for a couple of weeks doing this.  It really helped me.\n\nYou have more than Dr in front of your name.  You have learned how to persevere.  After all, that is what a doctorate is really about.  You went through hell (and it sounds like you had it about as bad as I have ever heard it), but you survived.  Maybe you are not the same person that went in, but you did make it.  That is the most important skill.  You can always learn new lab techniques and learn about new research areas, but perseverance and the problem solving skills needed to persevere is what you gained.\n\nI think you can be amazed how different work environments can be.  My graduate department was filled with factions and bitter rivalries.  This gave me a great deal of insight of the red flags to avoid in future jobs.  Not every department will be like your graduate program.  There are better jobs out there, you just have to seek them out.\n\nThere are also a bunch of non-academic jobs out there where your degree will be helpful.  I don't know what field you are in, but scientific writing, government oversight/funding, industry R&D, technical sales, etc.  Clear your head and then really start thinking about what you could see yourself doing, but clear your head first.\n\nI will reiterate what some others have said.  You may just need to recharge your batteries, but you may need to seek some professional help.  Seek out a PhD in clinical psychology that graduated from a big research university (I am possibly making a US assumption with this advice).  While I have some bias is suggesting this (you can find it in my post history), the real reason I suggest this is that the person can probably relate to you.  Clinical programs are typically very heavy research based.  I have known a bunch of them and PhD horror stories seem to be the norm.\n\nWhatever you do, think about ways to spin it so you have a reason you can give someone later so you don't close doors.  Maybe you do deliver pizzas for a while (I did that through out grad school to make extra money even though I was not supposed to).  That is fine, but consider adjuncting a class or volunteering in someone's research lab so there is not a hole in your vita.  Maybe being a pizza store manager is a future, but if you want to jump back into academics or industry later, you want to avoid holes.\n\nGood luck.   ",

Do lots of manual labor kinds of things and go outside as much as you can. Give it some time and you will gain some perspective on your next steps. \n\nMy defense was pretty anticlimactic.

Defending with someone who didn't originally pick you adds to the meh. Nothing at all against who I defended with, he is a wonderful person, but there isn't the same hurrah feeling in the group when you're a step-child of sorts.\n\nEveryone is spot on about taking a break.

When I was done with my PhD I hated everything it-related so much that I quit academia, and just earned monely in an office 9-5 for 5 years, doing hobbies on the side. It was fun, because it was very different. I hated my PhD discipline so much I got rid of all books that even vaguely reminded me about it (hid them in the attic in my mom's place). In 5 years however I wanted to do it again, but it really took that long. In 3 years I considered doing it again, in 4 years I started reading popular books and blog a little, and it 5 years - returned to academia, successfully. \n\n3) Take a really long vacation, or a job-like project that looks like a vacation. Travel for at least 1-2 months (not weeks, months!). Change everything around you. Go to another country if you can. It helps to clear mind really well.\n\n4) Don't feel obliged to use your PhD, or return to academia, or whatever. If you decide to do it - you'll be able to. If not - it's OK.

So, you are done, you have to figure out what you want out of life... it doesn't really matter what, but you probably should, and then... go for it.  You've already demonstrated that you can achieve one of life's harder intellectual tasks, so choose something else and go for it.  Or stick with it, and grow with it.  It doesn't matter to the system, the only thing that really matters is you and your community.\n",

      "text": "Hi. I'm commenting to say I've been there, and because most comments here are suggesting that a vacation and a few pina coladas are going to fix you up. I hope it does, and that your funk is temporary, but if not, I want you to know you'll still be okay.\n\nAbout a third of the way through my 3-year MFA program I realized I didn't give a shit about writing fiction, at least not in the capacity my program and mentors expected me to. It was the teaching I loved-- but my classmates and faculty derided the students and the craft. I finished my degree because I got to teach great courses and young people, but it was a struggle to plow ahead with something I had no investment in. And at the end, I felt completely deflated and alienated. My classmates were proud of themselves. They'd published, gotten fellowships, etc. I'd done none of that. Yeah, my students were grateful for me, but students finish your course and move on, you know?\n\nWhat was worse was graduating and realizing that I was in pretty much in the same place professionally as I was when I finished undergrad-- except 40k in debt. Despite 3 years of teaching experience, no one was interested in hiring me. Why had I wasted my time? I became depressed, and had panic attacks and intrusive thoughts of cutting my wrists or jumping in front of a train. The latter terrified me-- I felt so far from the person I thought I should be, but I didn't really want to die-- so I started therapy. \n\nThat was about two years ago. I don't panic much anymore, and when I feel a depressive episode coming on I can get myself out of it. Even though I still  ocassionally have intrusive thoughts when I'm psychologically stressed, I know they're just symptoms, and that I definitely want to live. The therapy I've had has been life-changing in terms of helping me realize who I am (and how my shitty childhood set me up for failure in part) and who I want to be. I'm not there yet. Actually, I don't believe in a \"there\" anymore. I'm not sure these demons ever leave. You just get better at carrying them. \n\nI am adjuncting now. It took me 9 months from the time of my hiring to get a class, and the only reason I got hired was because I walked into the chair's office cold and asked for a job. It's still a struggle-- I'd never be able to afford this lifestyle without the financial support of my husband, and I feel very guilt about that. On the other hand, I'm making professional strides and doing what I love. I'm starting to make friends who appreciate me for me. I'm calling my parents out on their codependent, narcissistic turdmongering and finding new confidence. \n\nI was 28 when I graduated, like you, and I didn't even do a PhD. You absolutely have time to turn things around. Or to sit in your bed and cry if that's all you can do. No matter what, there's time. If anything, seek out therapy, just a single session. Finding validation for your concerns is really helpful. \n\nI'm pulling for you :)",

You've been buffeted around by the process, more so than average, and you need recovery time.\n\nAs others have noted, you also could be depressed.  Feeling that things are pointless and having no interest in things are signs of this.   Take care of yourself, catch up on sleep, get some exercise, do things you used to enjoy before grad school, and get a little distance.  Try to feel proud of what you accomplished, because it is no small thing!  Consider whether some professional help would also be in order.",

True effort and hard work never betray, but at the same time it falls on individuals to make their skills visible and translatable. You've done 95% of the work, and I hope you can recharge to do the final 5% to understand your skills in a grander scheme and be able to show and apply them accordingly.\n\nCongratulations!",
