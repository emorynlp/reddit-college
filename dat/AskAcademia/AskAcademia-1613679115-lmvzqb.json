  "text": "I got rejected from basically all of the Clinical Psychology Phd programs that I applied to. I am immensely interested in researching mental health/developmental disorders, as well as malignant brain development due to environmental stressors/trauma within marginalized communities. I have more specific research interests that I expressed in my personal statement as well, that I believe aligned with advisors I wanted to work with. I didn't apply to that many because I couldn't afford it and didn't qualify for the income waiver either that typically requires below poverty level indication. \n\nI've been trying to find full-time research positions since I graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in Psychology from a small university and I have been applying to a variety of full-time research assistant/coordinator/manager positions (*all around the U.S.*) since I graduated and have only gotten rejections and no interviews, even for positions I was clearly qualified for. The people that I've known to get these type of positions always have had some kind of connection from the inside to get in, which I do not. I ended up taking a full-time management job in the private sector, whilst volunteering in a research lab part time (*this lab does not have any full time positions*).\n\nI feel very stuck and discouraged especially as a BIPOC person, it seems like gatekeeping runs very deep in academia and full-time research/PhD opportunities for Psychology and Neuroscience are incredibly slim. \n\nAny advice on the next steps I should take to increase my chances of getting into a PhD next cycle? I would also be open to applying to Cog Neuro Phd programs as well. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "One thing to keep in mind is that the current environment is incredibly *atypical*  because of the covid-19 pandemic. There are many programs in many disciplines that have simply suspended their normal intakes of graduate students, especially programs where there is simply no way to avoid having people in close physical proximity together in the course of doing professional training and research. So you need to not come to any fixed or final view of your qualifications or chances of admission under more normal circumstances, which hopefully will come back into view in the 2022-23 academic year (and thus will influence applications this coming fall). \n\nHowever, if you want to look carefully to see if there's any issues in your applications that you can improve on before the next application cycle, the very best thing you could do is to show your applications from this year to a trusted undergraduate professor that you worked with--and if you had any peers or friends who were majors in Psychology at your university alongside you, show them too. \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is even if it's true that the jobs you applied for were ones you were qualified for and should have been considered for, keep in mind that the atypicality of this year applies to those applications, at least since March 2020. It may well be true that many of those opportunities have gone to people who were known to the people running the lab as well, but you have to find a place to put your legitimate frustration and anger with that possibility out of mind temporarily while you are working on your applications--it can affect how you present yourself and your candidacy in ways that you might not pick up on.",

          "text": "I understand the pandemic has played a huge role in deficits of positions within academia. However, I also expressed issues I have faced even before the pandemic with academic research positions.\n\nI received 1 PhD preliminary interview after I applied and was not submitted to the formal interview from this advisor, due to other interviewees having more experience and greater familiarity with this lab's methodologies because of their experiences. So, I took this as needing to gain more full time research experience to further strengthen my skillset.\n\nI've had several established individuals within academia (*undergrad professors, PhD student in the current lab I'm volunteering in, another PhD student I met a conference*) extensively look at my application prior to submitting and giving me feedback that I made changes on. So, I did the very best that I could with what I had.\n\nLike I've said earlier, I've been applying to full time research positions since the summer of 2019 pre-pandemic and still the same roadblocks are evident. Also, I have in no way expressed any inkling of frustration or animosity towards any individual within academia that have contacted. I've always framed my verbiage in a positive manner, even when I receive rejections, I always respond with gratitude for their consideration. I think the major barrier that I face is the prevalence of gatekeeping in academia, and the lack of willingness to give opportunities to \"outsiders\" that are not affiliated with lab.",

              "text": "Unfortunately, you're running into the sad side of academia. It's pretty exclusive and heavy on connections. I'm sorry. \n\nOne thing to consider is how strong your application is. Clinical is the most competitive, and usually applicants are expected to have a few years of research experience as well as substantial clinical experience (suicide hotlines, shadowing clinicians, etc.) Many full-time research positions are filled from inside, and the rest are often filled from the students of folks the PI knows. The rest are highly dependent upon the amount of research experience students have. If you had less than 2 years of research experience in undergrad my best guess is that you are under-qualified for those competitive full-time positions. Since you  said your research portfolio might not be strong enough, the main things that might help if you continue to pursue grad school is more research and more clinical experience.\n\nI'm sorry. I feel your frustration. I hope things look up  next  year :)",

You can try talking to any undergraduate mentors to see if they can help you make connections. You might also ask them if there is a mismatch that you're not seeing between what you trained to do and the kinds of labs or programs you're interested in. \n\nYou might also look to some diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives out there that are trying to improve the odds for BIPOC candidates coming into grad school and those seeking faculty placements, organizations like the Consortium for Faculty Diversity. They may have resources you can call upon, including mentors, and may also help you identify concrete signs that your applications were inappropriately screened out or excluded for consideration. \n\nIf you're determined to continue, another possibility is to pursue a Master's program to bolster your credentials in the particular field(s) of clinical psychology that interest you and to increase the number of possible mentors or recommenders you can call upon. \n\nBut the big thing is to just be aware of how difficult this environment is for all applicants--research-oriented programs have all been cut back even in fields that were in demand prior to 2018 or so.",

      "text": "First, this was an incredibly competitive cycle, with more applicants and fewer slots. Hopefully next year or two years from now will be better. Clinical psych programs are also very competitive, and I'm hearing moreso this year. If you want to go research, look more into non-clinical programs, which it sounds like you are doing with Cog neuro programs. This area can fall into different programs including neuroscience and psychology, so look broadly. \n\nFor RA positions, applying across the country might actually be hurting you. For some reason, I've known a few people who like to hire RAs that would not be moving. Their rationale is they want them to be likely to accept the job, and many of these jobs have a probationary period and people don't want someone to move across the country and then lose their job after 3 months. Not saying this is the right reasoning at all, but there is a chance your application is getting tossed when they see you live far away. \n\nDo you have any mentors or profs you were close with at your undergrad institution? They might be able to help you network. Otherwise, sadly, the level of competition is stiff. Try to get on papers and posters. I actually value an undergrad who presented their own poster, even if at a local school event, over an undergrad who probably just got lucky to be a middle author on a paper they didn't lead. Look for diversity fellowships. There are lots of them and I encourage you to contact future PIs and tell them you'd like to apply to fellowships. If you are free, you are hard to turn down! Look at the conferences in. your field, many have diversity scholarships that would pay you to go to the conference- great networking and an award to put on the CV. Best of luck!",

This year they definitely had more applicants maybe like 50% more for the same number of spots.

A postbacc is the norm these days but if this is something you truly want to do, it's not a big deal. I took four years off and I don't regret a second of it.

I have typically applied to positions that have posted research coordinator/assistant/lab manager positions on a university jobs page, that claim to be open to all applicants, even outside of the university. Also, I knew a couple of people who had undergraduate advisors from different universities, that were affiliated with other advisors who had open lab manager positions and recommended my acquaintances to their lab, and got these positions right out of graduation. I'm unfortunately not this well connected. \n\nI did do research in my undergrad from a small university. I hardly see the PI in the current lab that I am volunteering in. I've seen him in group zoom meetings a couple of times and have never worked with him or under anything he is directly researching. His grad students/post docs have separate research projects that they work on and I work under a PhD student who was the one who gave me a chance to volunteer in the lab. The PhD student that I work under helped me a lot throughout the application process and was my letter writer because he was able to give a more personalized account working with me versus the PI that I've never worked with, who would have had to write a more generic letter due to lack of familiarity with me. The PhD student said that unfortunately the way their lab works only allows full time research for grad students and postdocs and that he would have recommended me for a full time research position or promoted me if he could. He understands how competitive the whole process is and just recommended me to keep applying to research coordinator positions and hopefully I'll get something. My other letter writers basically say the same thing. Since, I came from a smaller university with limited research resources, the professors that I worked with aren't super well connected enough to recommend me to different open positions. They hadn't published in several years and as it isn't really a priority for them either.",

Having the PI co-sign is one way to get around this (I did this in grad school -- I wrote the letter as the TA because I knew the student, but my advisor co-signed the letter). \n\nIf the PI of your current lab won't do that, can you get a letter from a prof at your undergrad institution?

Most undergraduates who do research during their studies are not really researching full-time, except perhaps over a summer or two.  I wonder if you might be inadvertently overemphasizing this distinction and undervaluing your experience in your application.\n\nEdit: just thinking more about this.. I am actually wondering if you should really be trusting this PhD student at all for grad school application advice.  It's true that they've been through the process once successfully, but that doesn't necessarily translate into an actual understanding of what's required for success.  And in fact, if they were writing you a letter of recommendation, I'm guessing they have a pretty poor understanding of what makes a competitive application.",

I think others having more direct experience in labs that are very similar to the research of the prospective PI was of a greater benefit to them, that I am trying to mirror.\n\nI'm definitely thinking about it, but would prefer to not get an MS, because I have been 100 percent financially independent since the age of 18 and would prefer to not get myself in further debt, especially since most programs don't transfer the credit of an incoming masters degree.\n\nYou're right that most undergrads that do research are not doing it full-time but most are not getting into PhD programs right out of their undergrad degree either. The Psych PhD programs have become increasingly competitive and often times if you look at their grad student bios, these students almost always have full time research experience after they have graduated. I definitely didn't undervalue my experiences within my application. I tied all of my experiences together in a common narrative and highlighted the strengths from what I've developed amongst all these experience.

What faculty members say in public versus their actual practice varies a lot. It sounds bad, after all, to suggest that status does matter. The fact is, though, that it does, often more than the committee consciously recognizes.\n\nIt's really worth it to try to get a not generic letter from the PI at the lab where you're working. Asking the PhD student to collaborate with the PI on the next letter could be a way to make that happen. Even if the committee would rather a detailed letter from a PhD student to a generic letter from a faculty member, it's almost a moot question. In a competitive application cycle, odds are that everyone who's accepted has three detailed letters from faculty.\n\nYou also might look into ways to fund a masters. You mentioned elsewhere that you're BIPOC; there may very well be funding opportunities that could help you stay out of debt.",

If that's the case your best option could be to apply to Masters programs in clinical psychology (occupational therapy, neuroscience or cognitive psych programs could also be good options, but I prefer recommending OT/clinical programs as they have good back up careers outside of academia), preferably competitive, research programs. Masters programs are generally more willing to give \"unknown applicants\" chances and it will give you an opportunity to complete research and \"prove\" you can make it at the next level. It will probably lead to additional student loan debt and it likely won't lead to earlier completion of a PhD (most masters degrees don't transfer to PhD), but if you are determined to get your PhD it could help.",

Several years between undergrad and grad is unfortunately very normal. \n\nHave you been applying to listings on university website or to initial job ads from faculty? Often by the time it goes up on a university website, the spot is already filled. This isn't gatekeeping but you have to find the initial job ad. They send job ads to listservs, other professors, twitter (check out @CogNeuroJobs - there are recent ones hiring for RAs to work on depression & psychotic disorders). Reach out to your undergrad professors, anyone you've worked with and ask if they know anyone looking for an RA or lab manager or PhD student. I also know multiple people who've gotten positions just by cold emailing -- no connections, just a little good luck. \n\nFit might be worth thinking about too. Clinical psych departments tend to be focused on/prioritize therapy and behavioral studies and studies of better therapy interventions. If working with neuroimaging techniques (eeg, fMRI) is important to you and therapy is not, clinical psych departments might not be able to give you that.",

This is based on comparing my experiences as a STEM PhD to the experiences of friends (and my psychologist) who have done PhDs in clinical psych. First, clinical psych does require working as a lab manager first, and that does seem to require having an \u201cin\u201d. Second, clinical psych is often a 7-10 year program, but a neuro PhD is 5-6. Third, as a BIPOC researching \u201chard\u201d science (neuro) you have tons of exclusive opportunities for fellowships and grants. While this may be somewhat true in all disciplines, medically-relevant \u201chard\u201d science has the most funding opportunities overall. Finally, PhDs in medical colleges have higher pay and fewer outside requirements (e.g. TA ships) compared to basically all other PhDs. The drawback of a neuro PhD is that it might be harder to work on the developmental effects of growing up in a marginalized community, but you can definitely find neuro opportunities in developmental disorders or mental health.\n\nOne last thing... Department\u2019s admissions have been affected in a variety of ways due to the pandemic. If you decide to look into neuro PhD programs, you should look around to see if any you are interested in are still allowing applications.",

My background is in psychology and I also studied mental health, so I know a ton of folks who went clinical; students who had 2-3 years of undergraduate RA experience + 1-2 years of lab management/full-time research experience + clinical hours up the wazoo sometimes had to apply two or even three rounds before getting offers, and that's with applying to 7-12 programs each round. Clinical psychology is *incredibly* competitive.\n\nI'm also BIPOC and my research area was in the same general area as yours. Are you tied to being a clinician? Because if not, there are *lots* of other PhD programs that are less competitive where you can study that. Look at health psychology, neuroscience (if you have the background for it), or public health as other avenues.\n\nIf you are looking only at research assistant positions at universities in psychology departments, I would also expand that. First, you can look across the university: there are research coordinator jobs in the medical/health sciences departments of universities that may have relevant research going on, too (think psychiatry, neurobiology, public health, perhaps even nursing). The NIH has an IRT program that is targeted at preparing people for doctoral programs that are related to health.",

Full-time research experience is the main thing that determines whether you get into a PhD program,  but there\u2019s a scarcity of paid positions and lots of inequity in opportunity to work full-time as a researcher. It\u2019s extra difficult for people who start seeking full-time research positions later than others. Application fees also obviously favor wealthier applicants who can apply to more schools.\n\nYou see people talking about these problems on Twitter but the conversation about how to fix these problems is unfortunately in a very early stage and so far not much has been done.\n\nMy only suggestion is to broaden your scope for the full-time postbac positions you\u2019re applying to. I would apply to any clinical psychology lab. If you\u2019re willing to apply to general neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, or psychology programs, then I would broaden the scope even wider to anything in those fields. You will have a fair amount of flexibility to switch topics when you start your PhD, although of course you will not receive clinical training if you\u2019re not in a clinical psych program. I\u2019m also not sure whether you need some sort of \u201cclinical experience\u201d (like shadowing a clinician) for clinical psych programs. Your chances of getting in will be significantly higher if you apply to non-clinical psychology programs and apply to many schools.\n\nAlso check out the NIH postbac IRTA fellowship for postbac positions...there are probably a couple of labs at the NIMH or NICHD intramural programs that would be a good fit and I think that it\u2019s slightly less competitive to get this position than getting a full-time tech/lab manager position (as you mentioned, lots of labs hire internally for that type of position).",

      "text": "I feel like what I'm about to say has already been said, but as a current postdoc who faced similar frustrations after undergrad, I wanted to encourage you to not give up. Two anecdotes to offer:\n\nAnecdote 1: I almost gave up going to a PhD program. I had gotten a ton of rejections and had more or less decided to find a different career path. After reaching out to some colleagues, a professor I knew encouraged me to apply at his school. I hadn't considered applying there, but it seemed like a great fit in retrospect. The only problem was, it was already January, and the application season had ended. The professor said to send in my application anyway - he'd make sure they'd at least read it. I got in, with funding, and that professor who helped me out became my advisor.\n\nAnecdote 2: My cousin (who is also BIPOC, though I'm white) got rejected from every PhD program the first round. He was also discouraged. He applied again the next year and got rejected from every school except one: Harvard. He's now a tenured professor in the West Coast. \n\nThe main point is this: you will face innumerable rejections in your PhD path. Persistence is key, as is advocating for yourself. There are a lot of gatekeepers in Academia who only want to let in in white guys who went to the same Ivy League school they went to. But there are also people who want to help. Go to conferences (I know that's tought right now) and online lectures. Send out some cold emails now to professors you admire. Some people will ignore you, others will be flattered. I could go on, but just don't give up yet.",

      "text": "Hello. WOC in biomedical science PhD program (where neuro research is highly popular). I\u2019m not in neuro but in my program neuro research labs  are the predominant ones. \nI skimmed thru all the posts below and have a few suggestions. \n1- letter of recommendations for our admissions are predominantly read by a group of professors and students who won\u2019t be in the lab that you\u2019re joining and I don\u2019t think they care for your lab skills. I don\u2019t think having a PhD student talk about your skills and using up a recommendation letter for that is a good idea. If you write your resume , all your skills should be obviously listed there. Use your rec letter to have others talk about how amazing you are! Use people you know in high positions! I had the head of virology at a medical school write me a rec letter. I 100% believe that was important in pushing my application to the top. \n2- yes connections are important. A lot of students in our program started working as techs in the lab they later joined for phds, but connections aren\u2019t always necessary. The program I\u2019m currently in, I had no connections there. \n3- I feel like you\u2019re not applying to biomedical science PhD programs that have tons of neuro labs, and you\u2019re losing out on being accepted there. Look into those!",

      "text": "I think you have a great deal of advice on support here. I can't add much to the conversation. I will tell you that I graduated my undergrad in 2013, and received my MA in 2018. I've applied to 40+ programs (Clinical and Counseling alike), and I've had maybe 6-7 interviews (this is all pre-Covid). I'm also about to be 30 this year. I only have maybe a year or 2 of research experience (including my Master's Thesis which was an ongoing project for my MA). I've worked on a suicide hotline and as a crisis clinician, and in numerous other jobs. I plan on working full-time as a paid RA (I'm very close to a job) for a year or 2 to gain more experience.\n\nSometimes it feels like we're forged from failure, but that's okay because you are slowly learning how to succeed. Don't give up, and lessen your gaze to other people around you that get into top-notch programs. I truly wish you all the best.",

I imagine it is probably harder to get into to a masters-to-Phd program then to do it piecemeal as a masters and then a PhD. \n\nTrying to do a masters on work study or something might be easier to get into and at least help you get your foot in the door.",

      "text": "I have a PhD in clinical psych and let me just say - I completely feel for you and that\u2019s an awful feeling. My husband, who also has a PhD in clinical psych, went through 3 application cycles before getting in (eventually after doing a master\u2019s). This was a TERRIBLE year for applicants because funding lines for students were cut. My husband\u2019s former program put out a statement that they weren\u2019t considering applications at all this year, and clinical psych program place we are on postdoc at had DOUBLE the number of applications for HALF the usual spots \u2014 I\u2019m talking like 1500 applications for 4 spots. Universities are hurting this year, so please don\u2019t take your \u201cperformance\u201d on this year\u2019s cycle to be indicative of your potential. \n\nIt really sounds like you did everything you could and are doing everything that you can. My biggest suggestion (if you are not already doing this) is to keep your eye on research output \u2014 posters and pubs. Can you spend 45 min a day on academic writing? Can you ask a grad student who you work with if you could be on a publication? Could you ask one of your PIs if there is a \u201cslacker stack\u201d of projects in the lab? (i.e., projects that had potential but didn\u2019t go anywhere; theses/dissertations that students didn\u2019t publish because they went into clinical work/industry, etc.). Look for \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d in terms of things to publish or take a step further.\n\nPlease feel free to message me privately if you want to chat more. Also happy to look at any of your materials or think through potential next steps based on what programs you are interested in.\n\nVery best of luck \ud83d\udc99",

Right in the sweet spot of being underprivileged but not enough for anyone to care. You fucked up. Be poorer. The only ways to have opportunities these days is to be poor enough to qualify for all the aid and special programs or to be rich enough that your economic status opens the doors. It's the people in-between that get left behind. This is why the middle class is dying/dead and honestly you'd be better off not being in it. Isnt America great? \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
