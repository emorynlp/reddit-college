  "title:": "Looking for degrees at the intersection of Computer Science and Humanities with a focus on tech",
  "text": "I've got a bachelor's degree in computer science and I've had a programming career of around a decade.\n\nNow I feel like my interests have changed and I'd like to pivot towards the humanities side of things if possible.\n\nI've always been interested in how tech intersects with society and I was wondering if there are degrees that would help me learn more and explore this topic. So maybe things like history of computing or say algorithmic fairness or questions involving our life online or our interactions with machines.\n\nI know that this seems like a wide stretch but I wanted to contrast what I do NOT want - something like digital humanities, which involves using computing to augment the study of humanities.\n\nAre there degrees like this? Am I searching for the wrong keywords? I'm still trying to figure out what I want, so any help/ideas would be great.\n\nThanks for your time! :)",

      "text": "> history of computing \n\nThat speaks more to history of science, or information studies with a historical slant. \n\n> algorithmic fairness or questions involving our life online or our interactions with machines.\n\nThat more sounds like computer science with the subdiscipline of computer science interaction (HCI). Though you also have sociologists and a variety of other social science disciplines who cross over into \"algorithmic fairness\" work. The jargon phrase to look up would be \"computational social science\" for the latter social sciences. That is if they haven't rebranded the marketing spiel to data science yet.",

Basically, you can look at the subdiscipline of Computer Science that goes down this path -- human-computer interaction. Maybe Computer Science education, which critically examines how CS is taught. Or, you can look at disciplines within the humanities or social sciences that tend computational, including media studies or certain liberal arts programs. Information schools (ischools) are another one that tends to include this focus.\n\nSince this is an interdisciplinary area of study, you'll find a lot of cumbersome names for the departments or programs involved. You might do well to find faculty that write things you're interested in, then find out where they're working.",

      "text": "Hey there! I\u2019m sort of in the same boat as you. Mind you, my boat is a bit smaller as I started a tech program but will not be finishing it. Next year I\u2019m switching to a college program that focuses on working with and helping folks with disabilities. I plan to take the tech knowledge I\u2019ve gained and combine it with this degree and hope to one day work with assistive technologies. Whether that\u2019s helping design, program, consult with businesses/schools/individuals\u2026 I\u2019m not sure yet. Just need to finish the dang program first \ud83d\ude05",
