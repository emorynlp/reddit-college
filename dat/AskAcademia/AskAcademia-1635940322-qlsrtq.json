  "text": "Hello, can anyone tell me the average time they spent per week studying, conducting research, and writing per week in a terminal degree program? \nI find myself spending about 8 hours a day doing the aforementioned. I wanted to see if anyone figured out a way, besides hard work and dedication, to achieve their terminal degree? \nThank you in advance!",
