This doubles as an explanation for why you're interested in the position they have available. My current position has nice set hours, an enjoyable work environment, and no looming make-or-break deadlines decided on in a completely arbitrary fashion. It's a lot less stressful, if perhaps not as stimulating. The pay is, unfortunately, on-par with my post-doc, however.

When you write your cover letters and interview, focus on those personality and work ethic traits you developed over the years. Put effort into that cover letter to convey those things and why you want to transition out of academia. \nMy background was in cardiovascular inflammation, but I work with people from all sorts of backgrounds. In my experience, they're way more interested in your work ethic and passions than your actual set of skills (depending what you're looking for!). You'll find the right fit if you just start going for it. Best of luck!",

All roads lead to better pay. Everyone in industry understands that. No need to bring it up. When pay does come up, it will be with a recruiter or HR as they go over potential salary range. Do your homework to know what that will likely be ahead of time and that is the pay you discuss (if needed).\n\n>Anyone successfully leave their postdoc for industry?\n\nYep. Though the transition is different depending on if you are looking for a bench vs non-bench role. I've only now caught up to my fellow bench scientist colleagues salaries with comparable experience - took about five years in industry.\n\nAny ideas what you want to do in industry?\n\nI'm in genomics now. But not at the bench. I left the postdoc for similar reasons. Worked mainly with C. Elegans during that time. So don't feel like it limits you.",

If doing science is what fills that need, not the specific topic, a bench role can be very fulfilling. But you don't really pick your projects in the same way. Even if you work in discovery. \n\nWith non-bench roles, you typically need to learn a lot of new skillsets upfront. Or work on polishing ones that were underdeveloped. Academic training values bench skills above all else - writing and effective communication come in a distant second. So if you take a role in marketing or product management or sales, anything visible in the business or customer facing, you will need to work on those things a lot. So intellectual curiosity is usually not a problem. \n\nWork / life balance is largely the same. Both roles offer opportunities to skew that balance and take on more responsibility - so you can choose to do a more 9 - 5 job (typical of most roles) or something that takes up more of your day.",

You'll need to learn how to sell yourself to each company, generally you'll need to show you have the skills in Python, R, etc, and understand how to do the basic analyses needed.

My field is in the social sciences, and I transitioned into UX research in the technology industry.\n\nBefore you can transition out successfully, you need to figure out what you want to transition *to*. It's not enough to just know you want to leave: what do you want to do? Since you know you want to leave, begin to safely scale back your work as much as you can so you can devote some cycles to investigating other job options for people in your field, with your background. There are some jobs that will directly use your skills in industry, particularly in national labs or government agency research, and some that will engage them more indirectly, like management/strategy consulting or data science.\n\nConsider joining a professional organization in your current city (or online) in fields in which you're interested; in my field, the equivalents are groups like UX Professionals Association and SIG-CHI. They sometimes will let you know about jobs before they are posted, and you can meet professionals in whatever field you're interested in and do informational interviews. \n\nYour undergrad or graduate university career center may still offer their services to alumni, so I'd check to see if they can do resume review or if they have an alumni job listserv (and if either of them are any good).

Yeah, you didn\u2019t enjoy your postdoc and, while that in itself doesn\u2019t feel great, take pride in the fact that you went out of your comfort zone, hopefully picked up some new techniques/type of research, and have now taken away the fact that this isn\u2019t for you. That\u2019s not bad! If anything it\u2019s solidified your interest in working in industry and makes you that much more confident that your next step is going to be amazing.\n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about your research not being 100% applicable to your future career. I think 99.9% of grad students have this fear but the truth is our PhD/postdoc work is extremely specialized and will not completely apply to most jobs out there. I\u2019ve heard from a couple people in the pharma industry that some relevant exposure is certainly helpful but they\u2019re mainly looking for candidates who show the ability to grow and think critically. If you feel like you\u2019re really not prepared, maybe something like an industrial postdoc might be of interest? Would give flexibility to work with multiple groups and explore/pick up relevant skills. Job security isn\u2019t guaranteed but might be an option to consider along with a full time job depending on where you get interviews",

      "text": "I honestly just told possible employers here in Germany exactly that: while I did enjoy my PhD and the work, I am looking for a more stable career, where I don't have to move every few years, constantly worry about my pay and so on. I got lucky early on, so I talked to less than 10 people but they all understood, nodded and some said they often hear that.  \nIn my opinion it's actually a good answer because your new company very likely can give you a lot of that.   \nSo pick out which skills you have you can apply in the new job and spin it like that:   \n*In my academic career I always enjoyed the lab work but I am looking for a more secure career. I think the products you produce are great and I'd be excited to work in your lab to develop these new drugs and help people improving their quality of life\". Or you enjoyed travelling/networking (customer contact as consultant/salesman), writing/documentation (medical/technical writer), programming (Software Engineer), testing (Software Tester), communicating/presenting your research (Science Communication/Press Releases), ....  \nLeaving science because the job market is shit is a valid reason and one employers can relate to. The hard part is actually to twist why this now different career is not only exciting for you but why you'd be a perfect match for the position. Because you usually can't claim job experience, so you need to argue about your skills and your years of experience applying them \"in a different field\".\n\nYou can also find some resources and examples on r/LeavingAcademia.",

      "text": "Did a postdoc for 4.5 years. Now in industry (pharma). Postdocs are basically required for a lot of industry jobs these days. They aren't advertised as such, and they don't pay you extra for your postdoc experience (only industry experience counts after PhD) but for a lot of positions they are only interviewing candidates who have done a postdoc. Now this might be in part due to academia being a ponzy scheme where more and more people are accumulated through the system in longer postdocs or second postdocs or non-TT positions, therefore there is a glut of more experienced people that pharma can hire for cheap. They did ask me why I wanted to leave academia and my answer was that I had always done both and was interested in doing great science with a huge impact and didn't care if it was in the industry or academia.",

      "text": "Depends a lot on location and also whether the jobs you are applying for are closely related to your current knowledge and skills. In my experience (phD in theoretical physics, living in Australia) it is very difficult to transition from academia to industry because people in industry don't see the value to high-level education, at least not in my country.\n\nThe only avenues for me have been closely related fields, literally R&D in Theoretical and Mathematical Modelling of very specific stuff (e.g. photonic systems), but the jobs for this are so scarce it is like trying to win the lottery: there are thousands of people applying for the same 10 jobs, so chances are near to none especially if you don't have a strong experimental component to your research.\n\nIn your case, I am not sure how it would play out. Nearly everyone I know from the genomics community went unto other universities (either moved states or countries altogether) to pursue more postdoctoral positions, or landed a job that is literally genomics-related in a private institution or government facility. Chances of moving to a field outside of genomics, let alone in industry are zero to none.\n\nEven if a job asks for a \"phD\", chances are they won't take most people because most companies these days are specifically interested in people with a Machine Learning or Data Science background, so unless you can prove you are very proficient at those things: forget about jobs in business/finance/data analysis. Again your chances may vary depending on where you live. Apparently many companies in the US hire just about anyone with a phD because they think it's equivalent to having worked at NASA or something, so maybe luck would be on your side.\n\nThe main advice I can give you though is: choose a job you really like and that really aligns with your skills/interests. A lot of people I know from STEM moved to data science because this seems to be the only field in industry that is willing to take in people from academic backgrounds. I tried to do the same, but to be honest data science is extremely boring unless you LOVE programming Python/R and using packages like Pandas and Scikit-learn. For the most part, it's a very business-focused profession, there's little innovation or profound knowledge in it, and because it's so overhyped these days you will probably be competing with at least 100 other people for any job you apply with the words \"data\" in it, even if it is entry-level.\n\nA better option would be to apply for R&D jobs, since you come from a more \"practical\" area than me, I think you probably have better options in those. If you really don't want to do research, then I guess try out data science or something to do with \"Statistics\". But be fore-warned: you might be going for a job you are not only overqualified for, but will also completely undermine your level of expertise and you will end up getting paid the same as someone who barely made it through a Bachelor's degree. Truth be told, businesses in the HR/consulting/financial/banking sector don't need more people with PhDs, they are already oversaturated with people that are \"good enough\" to do the jobs they have.",
