  "text": "I know I have choose STEM but just would like to  ask broadly:\n\nI recently received a request to review an article for one journal. I said yes as they gave me 14 days. I printed out the manuscript and spent time read it. Then on the 10th day, when I was ready to give my comments, the reviewer\u2019s  portal was disabled. \n\nI wrote an email to the editors. However they replied me with \u201cthe portal was disabled because they got enough review comments\u201d. \n\nIs this a normal situation? I could be a bit late in handing in my homework but \u2026 my timeline is also within the requested timespan.",

I received a review, asked for a copy of the manuscript with line numbers, 10 days later I finished my review, asked where the line numbers were so I could add them to my comments, editor told me they didn't need my review anymore.\n\nThis is incredibly disrespectful and not normal. I would not review for this journal again or submit there. Which journal did you have your problems with?",

I almost never have more than the minimum number of reviewers because it's so hard to get good people to agree!\n\nAnyway, in the rare situation where I don't need the review anymore, I first wait until the deadline. If the extra review comes in before the deadline, I always consider it -- after all, I asked for it, the person agreed, and they submitted it in a timely manner.\n\nIf the review still isn't submitted after the deadline, I e-mail the reviewer and say \"if you aren't able to complete the review, we have received other reviews and are ready to move on, but if you have already started the review and are able to complete it in the next X days, I would be happy to wait to receive your comments.\"",
