  "title:": "I'm an undergraduate student and have a meeting with a professor tomorrow to discuss opportunities for research experience. I have no idea what I'm doing, please help.",
  "text": "I have finished my bachelor's and am applying to a selective research master's program for 2021. However, because it's selective, having any research experience is an advantage. I managed to plan a meeting with this professor, they're a family friend but I don't personally know them (they do research in the field I'm interested in). We emailed a bit beforehand and basically I said that I want to do a master's in their field and that I would like to get a bit more experience with research as I haven't had any opportunities during my undergraduate. They replied that we could have a meeting and they could \"see if they can help with what I'm looking for\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... how should I go into this meeting? I have no idea how these types of meetings work. Do I express interest specifically in their research? I have read a bit of their publications but I'm not sure if they're currently working on anything. If they're not personally doing any research at the moment, should I ask about their colleagues? Or is this a bit of a faux pas? **ANY advice on what I should or shouldn't do is hugely appreciated.** Also any insight on how these types of meetings are supposed to go. Thank you!!\n\nEdit: field of study is neuropsychology/neuroscience",

Know your plan basically, go to this meeting with a good mindset and with your goals in mind. It's probably going to be pretty casual not like a regular interview but it could help to practice for interview questions.",

      "text": "Will this research experience just be shadowing someone in the lab? If so then simply showing interest and a willingness to learn/listen should be fine (if you were meeting me that\u2019s all I\u2019m looking for). If you know a little about what techniques they use, then it\u2019s worth mentioning if you\u2019re asked about what they do in the lab. Don\u2019t get too hung up if you don\u2019t understand the techniques, at an undergraduate level I wouldn\u2019t expect this (if I was the professor). Again, showing that you\u2019ve done background reading shows your willingness to learn. There\u2019s also no harm in asking about colleagues if they\u2019re not currently perusing research, if they\u2019re not willing to help with additional contacts then its usually not a great sign of their ability to collaborate (in my experience). \n\nMost importantly, try to relax and just have a nice conversation. Good luck OP.",

      "text": "Hi! I would say you made a great decision reaching out to your professor - I am sure they would appreciate an extra hand should they be having active projects, and by the end you'll not only learn more about the field itself but also be able show enthusiasm and determination. Well done on having a look at publications too, that should help better understand the nature of their work and thus be a better assistant.\n\nIn general, I would suggest not stressing too much - explain your motivations and interests as well as you can and simply ask about ongoing projects they might be working on. If there's anything you like, ask for some details and readings, and you can figure out more as you do the work. I don't think you need to talk about their research specifically rather than the broader subfield, but if there's any of their publications you read that might've stood out to you asking if there's any work building off of that would be a good idea. \n\nIf it turns out they don't have any work you can help with, I don't see why you shouldn't ask about colleagues - I don't think you would be drawing any resentment or anything like that. And then, if they mention another colleague, you can just get in touch with them and repeat the process.\n\nYou're already making great steps and I'm sure you will do great! Relax and relay your interest and passion for the field and you will be fine - there's nothing to lose by asking.",

That's literally their job (a big part of it, anyways), so don't worry about feeling underqualified or naive or anything.\n\nBe enthusiastic, show your interest. You can talk about how interesting the results of his field are, how they apply to other things...you can talk big picture. But be honest that you don't really know the details of how those results are gotten. That's what you want to learn. Connecting \"big picture\" to \"day-to-day work\" is a really imortant thing that (most) research profs look for in workers.",

I am personally interested in Latin American studies, more specifically, corruption in Latin America; so I asked a comparative politics professor to help me come up with a more in-depth research question to go off-of. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to know exactly what you want to research, but you are expected to at least have an area of interest in mind. Try to go in with a couple of research questions regarding the aforementioned and go from there. \n\nYou could always ask for recommendations on what to research given your interest in x studies or ask if they have any projects currently going on that you could join.\n\nBest of luck!",

Use this realization to relax a bit\u2014meetings like this are usually not dealbreakers, they\u2019re opportunities for you to learn. \n\nYou sound genuine. You are taking the right steps by reading a bit about the profs research and reaching out. As long as you are approachable and not arrogant you\u2019ll be fine.

Ask the professor if it will lead to a publication cause that\u2019s your goal. Never any harm in asking that.\n\nBut don\u2019t be afraid in turning down an opportunity if the professors just want you to do menial work and you don\u2019t learn anything.

Is there any overlap with his background and yours or any of your teachers prepared to recommend you.

You want to appear to be an asset not a liability. Find better questions to ask. For example if you have a decent understanding of the current state of the field, which you want some sense of, asking the expert to share with which important directions in the discipline hold the most promise for someone just starting down this path?\n\nAlso be sure to ask whom he would recommend you also speak too. You might ask which are the best schools for your interests.\n\nGenerally it is better to ask a question where they can share their experience than one that turns the spotlight on you. For example, if you don\u2019t know which area to specialize in, do not ask about this. Instead present a question like: \u201cwhen I finished reading you recent publication x , I started wondering how does someone with similar ambitions choose which area to focus on? Or how did you choose your research focus? Or how did you choose where to do your research.",
