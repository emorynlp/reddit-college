  "title:": "Can someone explain how some people publish so many papers - both as a prof and especially before becoming a prof?",
  "text": "I'm at a highly ranked R1 and my department just hired a new TT assistant professor. In the two preceding years as a postdoc at a prestigious school, he had published an average of **11 journal papers per year**, all in good journals in their field and with about half as first author, **before becoming a prof**.\n\nI just can't even imagine having that rate of output unless one is the head of a large center or group and they get their name on every paper that comes out of it - which this person clearly was not. I average \\~4 per year in good field journals as non-TT associate prof and I'm happy as a clam if I get more than that in a given year.  \n\nDoes this person just work themselves to death all the time? Have some neat mechanism or approach to coming up with publishable ideas? Have access to crazy resources? Have a strong base of connections? Just has a good sense for research? Maybe all of the above? \n\nAnyway, for those who publish a bazillion papers per year or see people who do, what gives rise to that level of output?",

Plus they had their thesis research and some papers with other teams. It was a win-win all around.",

First both have that weird gene where they can sleep 4 to 5 hours a night and wake up refreshed.  Second is they never said to no to collobations or projects that will increase their resource access or connections.  Finally, both are amazing mentors who know how to break down a paper into easily assignable units to graduate students and can manage many tasks at once by looking at these smaller pieces.  \n\nAlso if a paper is not good enough for a top journal they will rework it for a lessor known one.  They see rejection as a sign the paper needs to be reworked not it is unpublishable.  Also both have an open policy on lab members running secondary analyses, so often one an experiment is one, a few people break off into different groups and test their own ideas while we wait for the papers to come together.",

But, as Rota observed, pretty much every mathematician has a small number of tricks that they apply - including Hilbert.\n\nThe people I know who have published many papers early in their career usually found a technique that is broadly applicable that no one found before, or noticed that a trick from one area would work in several other areas. I don't mean to be disparaging of their work, in fact it should be taken as a compliment. In order to do this they need to have a deep understanding of each of these areas/problems. The key skill seems to be the ability to quickly develop deep intuition and understanding.",

There are some cases when someone's database was used and they are just added as a co-author to a bunch of articles. Others are just extremely productive and work a lot.

My strategies have been to separate content generation and editing when writing. I can crank out a lot of text and content at first when I'm not constantly censoring myself while I'm putting words on the page. I usually spend at least 15-20 hours writing per week and try to collaborate and network a lot. I have a big board of sticky notes tracking different papers and grant proposals through my publishing pipeline, with priorities identified and work that needs to be done noted. I frequently check in with co-authors to track progress on papers. \n\nI would like to get more publications, but I don't ever want to become a workaholic. I feel like I have to cut corners in some areas, like teaching repeat courses in my department that nobody else wants to teach so I don't have to do a lot of new prep, viciously limiting my time for meetings and scheduling only short times, and I'm not great at responding to email. Yet, my tenure, marketability, and impact on my field aren't based on the length of my meetings or the quality of my email responses.\n\nI've seen some who have crazy amounts of papers (10+ a year) and most often they either behave questionably or lack work-life balance. Some are incredibly efficient or love the work they do so much that they can't stop. Yet others, however, either take more credit for projects than they deserve (i.e., strong-arming postdocs and grad students to give them first authorship on a paper the postdocs/grad students deserved 1st authorship on). Others play really fast and loose with the data and do what looks like rampant p-hacking. Others collect a lot of data and are good at shipping it out to other co-authors to take the lead.",
