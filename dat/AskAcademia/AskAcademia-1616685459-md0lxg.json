  "title:": "My Depression is Killing my Ability to Work",
  "text": "I don't really know where to start, or to an extent, even what I'm here to ask...\n\nLet me preface with I love academics. They have always been an important part of my life, and I've always used them as a distraction from when my life is too much/feels overwhelming. I have had serious depression issues all my life, and am being medicated for them for a few years now. The meds arrangement I have isn't great, but it's better than nothing I guess.\n\nRecently, I've found myself questioning if I am really meant for this. I love research, reading and writing papers, but I am hitting the point where I have no happiness anymore in my life anymore. The things I used to love, that I used to continue going on, are becoming more and more difficult to do. It's at the point that even though academics are one of the few things that are keeping me going, my mental distress is now preventing me from being able to make the most basic progress possible.\n\nMy long-term girlfriend recently decided that she doesn't think our lives are going to be going the same direction and wants to end things so she doesn't prevent me from having the life I typically thought I would have (family with kids, etc.). It really took me by surprise, but now I am looking at my life, where I am now, where I am heading, and if I am ever going to be happy.\n\nMy main realization is I don't think academia is meant for someone like me. I'm soft, sensitive, just searching for a glimmer of happiness, and I feel like all I find in academics is isolation and loneliness. I feel absolutely lost because I just about hate everything else I could do with my degree except academia (engineering, but all the jobs I am best suited for are programming-related related, which I don't particularly enjoy).\n\nHere is my issue - What now? If I don't go on in academia, I have no idea what the hell I'll ever do. I don't feel mentally OK. I don't feel like I can have a job, a life like some people. Quite frankly, I feel like, aside from academia, I don't have a place in the world. But it seems like now I am losing my ability to even do that. That leaves me in an interesting state - I think I'm longing for something that just doesn't exist. I am going to keep going, but I am really questioning the reasoning as to why I am continuing on like this. I think I am forcing myself to keep going and there is no light at the end of this tunnel, just a brick wall I am going to run face-first into.\n\nI know COVID has been isolating, and many who have never had depression before are experiencing it. I am a slightly different case, I've had it all my life, I have been constantly depressed since I was in undergrad and now feel like there's nothing out there for me. Its a heartbreaking realization to come to, but I feel like maybe, I should save everyone some time and just leave on a \"high-note\" (before it becomes so painfully obvious to everyone that I'm a hollow shell of the man I once was).",

      "text": "Is it possible to take some time to focus on getting well? It's hard to think clearly about life goals when you're ill. I was feeling very much the same way during a serious depressive episode in 2019-- thinking obsessively about my life choices, wondering if I should continue on my current path, feeling trapped, thoughts spiraling...All that unproductive thinking exacerbated my anxiety/depression to the point where I found it very difficult to function at all. I needed to take some time away from the pressure of contemplating major life decisions. Depression really does alter your perspective! Connect with mental health resources at your school/in the community, find some helpful medication, and give your brain a bit of a break. After a year off I found that the spark was back. (I have dealt with depression over the long term, too. It can take a while to find an effective treatment plan). Hugs! You are definitely not alone!",

You mentioned using academics as a distraction from when your life feels overwhelming. You might also be using academics as a way to make yourself feel good about life. But, you should really love yourself and love life apart from anything else on its own. I think maybe getting into therapy would be really really great for you. Maybe you can find an excellent psychologist in your area to help you through this hard time.",

It seems like you've already accomplished most of what is needed to just get your degree, and I don't think dropping out now or \"leaving on a high note\" is a good option. For all intents and purposes, you're near the end of a marathon and you should just power through and finish it. When you get your degree, then you can evaluate whether or not you should continue through with academia or pursue an industry job. Focus on getting your degree, yes it seems daunting but you're almost there. \n\nFinally, on a personal note, like you, I feel that I am too soft sometimes, but if anything that has strengthened my resolve to go into academia (because if there is one thing academia needs more of, it is humanity).",

I've had my own episodes dealing with anxiety and depression in academia, and without a doubt, the two things that have helped me come out of some really low points are medication and therapy.  I agree with another poster here- depression really alters your perspective!  I was so hyper-focused on little things and overthinking it all that I also found it very difficult to function, be productive, but most importantly, be happy.  A therapist helped by just listening to what I was feeling without judgment, then helped me to peel back those layers to get to the roots of the issues.  The most important piece of advice was to take time for myself.  Having a few days where I could truly detach from academia was transformative.  \n\nIt sounds like you're really burnt out too and definitely in need of a break!",

Not sure whether you've found the physical activity that just boosts your mood, but maybe try looking for one? (I want to point out that for me, it doesn't work out with any activity though - running makes me sad and depressed, whereas cycling just hits that sweet spot).",

This way if we go full steam ahead with academia at least we\u2019ll know what we\u2019ve walked away from. \n\nI\u2019d suggest you apply to some jobs.

I know academia isn\u2019t for me, but I\u2019m not sure what is for me and it\u2019s very disorienting. Like what happened? I used to love this and now I hate it. I used to be so motivated, and now I couldn\u2019t care less about my research. I think some of it is pandemic-related. But I also think as I learned more about academia, I learned I don\u2019t love it. I try to view these realizations with optimism. Like \u201cnow I can try something new\u201d. Or at least \u201cthankfully, I realized this now instead of ten years from now\u201d. It doesn\u2019t always work, but it\u2019s something. \n\nI think the most helpful thing for me is reflecting on all the very different things I\u2019ve done personally and professionally that have brought me joy and have nothing to do with academia. These things remind me I can find a new vocation that fills me with joy once I\u2019m done. I\u2019m sure my new career path will be a spur of the moment decision. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find as much or more joy as I found in academia and all earlier endeavors. Things just work out that way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth stressing about now because I don\u2019t have to make any decision yet. I also figure \u201cif don\u2019t know what I want to do, then thinking about it over-and-over won\u2019t provide any clarity\u201d. I\u2019m only going to solve things by gathering new information.\n\nYou mentioned academia was your whole life. If it really is the only thing you know, definitely try something else. Even something unrelated to your degree, something you think you\u2019ll dislike, and/or something you know you don\u2019t plan to do for very long. Maybe consider picking up an old passion or trying out something new that piques your interest.",

I question whether I'm making enough progress to justify this lifestyle. Whether I'm shooting happiness in the face by refusing to put down the books. \n\nWe spend our lives in search of meaning. Whole religions are built around this. People live, love, give life, kill, and die in pursuit of this, \"meaning.\"\n\nIt's silly to put all of my eggs into one basket. Thinking I'm going to find fulfilment in a single setting in a single season of my life. That discovering that one thing...that one breakthrough...that will finally do it. \n\nNo. My brain is addicted to the idea of that. My happiness is separate from that achievement. At least that's where I am this morning.\n\nI'm at the end of my PhD. I'm considering a postdoc...but also unsure if it's going to bring me the most security and allow for happiness. \n\nAs each day goes by, I realize I deserve respect from myself. That I deserve security. That it might not be where my 18 year old or 21 year old self thought it was going to be. It's okay to find that those choices weren't for you. \n\nLife is beautifully ambiguous. The sooner we embrace it...the sooner those clouds of uncertainty break into rain, shedding rainbows on our day. We CAN start to see those little things that made us feel awe if we do that. If we're just...present. \n\nTomorrow will come. And we can meet it when it does. And it will deal with us no matter where we got today. It has to. Tomorrow doesn't get to procrastinate because we weren't ready for it. Tomorrow just happens. And soon it becomes yesterday. This too shall pass.",

You may decide to head in a different direction than academia. You will always have your degree to fall back. My recommendation is to not rush into any decision and if you\u2019re able to take a little time after you\u2019re done with your PhD to figure things out, then do it and reconnect with yourself",

      "text": "I would be careful in acting on the thoughts you have now, as what you're saying sounds very irrational. No doubt this is caused by the flux of negative emotions you're experiencing right now. First off, it's very unfortunate that your girlfriend wants to break up with you. While I haven't ever been in a relationship I wouldn't interpret this as being a result of your choices to pursue academics. It's far more likely that your girlfriend has been falling out of love with you. Even if it is because of the reasons she stated (you and her moving in different directions), are you absolutely sure that you care enough for her to forsake your academic prospects for her?\n\nPutting that aside, you seem to have a very negative self-view. You're claiming that you might be too soft for the academic world, but the idea that you need to be tough to survive in academia seems ludicrous to me. Sure you need to work hard and have perseverance, but I can assure you that this will be expected from you in whatever career path you take. Since you've been depressed for most of your life, I'm wondering whether you've ever seen a therapist? If not I can suggest giving it a try. You're in a precarious position so I would advise against making hasty decisions. I would urge you to try and combat this negative outlook on life, as difficult as it may be. You are allowed to feel sad, but expecting the worst, undervaluing your own skills, worrying about the future, and whether you'll be happy are undermining your ability to deal with adversity. They instead serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. You need to learn to take care of yourself by being more compassionate and forgiving towards yourself, by accepting the uncertainties in your life for what they are without worrying about them too much.\n\nFinally, several of the problems you cite seem to be in your head. Depression is a silent killer, all the more so when you have all these negative thoughts to deal with. Regardless of what you're going through, regardless of how you feel, you can only focus on the things which you have control over in this moment. Worrying about happiness is understandable, but ultimately meaningless. You are going to have good days, and you are going to have bad days. There are no certainties regarding the outcome of your endeavors. There are also no certainties on whether you're skilled enough. All you can do is learn to trust your own skills and judgment.  Even if you graduate, you might not be able to enter the academic world. I would nevertheless encourage you not to quit. That degree has more than one use to it.\n\nAs for how you're feeling right now, if you have someone you can reach out to, do so. Talk to them. Express your feelings. Maybe you have the opportunity to take a break?",

It is the best decision I have ever made and I suggest it to everyone who may be struggling. \n\nTake some time off; meet with your therapist to come up with a recovery plan (for instance I became so wrapped up in science I lost myself and am reconnecting with hobbies and what gives me meaning); and if you aren\u2019t on meds, talk to a psych. I was also nervous about that but found a medication that worked and had no side effects for me so far besides slight stomach ache if I don\u2019t eat.\n\nYou may decide during this time that you do like academia and just needed time to collect yourself and heal. You may decide, like me, that academia and the culture isn\u2019t for you and  you wanna move into industry. But I promise you can\u2019t keep going like this even if you think you can. You\u2019ll burn out even more and be worse off.",

There really are a lot of worse jobs, probably most jobs, and it is your anhedonia and despair probably talking now, which would extend to anything , even stuff that is fundamentally good (and not academia, which is fundamentally a mixed bag).\n\nMeds help, but real focused therapy helps at least as much, if not more.\n\nAnd exercise.  If you can force yourself to take a walk or do something else that you dont mind for a bit in the mornings this has a really high success rate.  And makes new neurons and BDNF.",

I feel sad and I feel really bad for wasting my time doing random things as i\u2019m constantly worrying about I can\u2019t even support myself after my parents pass away, despite the fact that they never push me hard for being successful etc. Somedays I wish an accident could end my life... but sometimes I feel so confident and energetic that I could do anything even with a shit grade, just by reading, drawing, or hanging out with friends/family for a bit.
