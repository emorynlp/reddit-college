  "text": "So I became a reviewer for one of the journals I published to during my PhD and I'm happy to be doing it, but I find that I reject far more papers than I accept and it's bothering me. I can always tell when a great deal of work and thought has gone into a manuscript and it makes me sad to send a rejection recommendation. Obviously, the field would not necessarily benefit if I lowered my standards (assuming they are calibrated properly), and I do make sure to find and note aspects of the paper I like and give grace where I can, but even so, rejecting doesn't feel great, especially when you've been on the other side of it, as we all have I'm sure. Any way to get over this while making sure I stay a quality reviewer?",

      "text": "I think it's important to keep in mind that you aren't rejecting any papers as a reviewer. That's not your role. You are simply giving evidence-based (hopefully) recommendations, and the editor is the one making the final decision. A good editor should not choose to reject only because a reviewer recommended it, and there are certainly cases where editors overrule reviewers. As you gain experience in the field, you will start to better calibrate your standards to those of the specific journal, but in the meantime, remember that you are a reviewer to assess the facts, not the amount of effort that authors put in.",

          "text": "I want to emphasize this sentiment from u/late4dinner: you, as a reviewer, are making a recommendation to the editor, but the editor is the one making the decision.\n\nInevitably, there are times in which one or more reviewers will recommend a revise and resubmit and one or more reviewers will recommend a rejection, so it is not uncommon for an editor to have to make a decision contrary to at least one reviewer's recommendation. Which is to say that your recommendation is just that: a recommendation.\n\nI don't think anyone takes joy in recommending that papers be rejected, whereas it can be fulfilling to see a paper through the review process and go from an initial manuscript to something that is published, but it is an important part of the process.\n\nOne thing you can do, if you don't already, is to provide constructive feedback about things that the authors can do to strengthen the article. As you can imagine, a rejection that comes with concrete steps to improve the manuscript for my next submission (or improve my research going forward) feels better than having a rejection without any ideas of where to go from there. Think of your role as a reviewer as, yes, someone who helps to make sure that articles that are published meet the standards of your discipline, but also as someone who can help researchers whose studies are not at that point to reach that point in the future.",

Unless people are trying to get their papers published quickly, most of my colleagues will aim for a journal that they don't realistically expect to be accepted by, and then quickly resubmit to a more realistic second choice. Rejection is infuriating the first few times it happens, but researchers should soon learn that it's part of the process. The fact that people have put a lot of work in shouldn't concern you - it's not like all that work evaporates when you reject the paper. As long as you give them constructive criticism they can tighten up the paper and resubmit it elsewhere, and that hard work was still worthwhile. It's important to be courteous and constructive, but I don't think you'd be posting this question in the first place if you were an arsehole!\n\nThe standards calibration thing is always a challenge for me. Perfect research is very rare, and you can pick apart anything if you want to. It is hard to get the right balance between letting minor things go but being strict about the things that really matter. I don't want to be the one arsehole reviewer that tears a paper apart when the other reviewers were fine with it, and likewise I don't want to be the one soft touch who misses something important.",

I really only ever suggest rejection when there are critical/substantial technical flaws not easily addressed or obvious omissions. For instance, my most recent review led to a suggested Major Revision (I debated recommending Reject) because I could not understand the degree of overlap between the authors\u2019 new manuscript and a previous publication of theirs. And the advancement they made wasn\u2019t clearly couched relative to their previous paper. After much consideration, I figured there was a path to making that distinction but it\u2019ll require considerable reconstruction. Nevertheless, the ideas they were advancing were interesting and by suggesting Major Revision rather than Reject, I\u2019m hoping that they tackle the revision in good faith rather than send unchanged elsewhere. The only time I easily reject papers is when they propose baseless notions that contravene logic - rare, but happens.",
