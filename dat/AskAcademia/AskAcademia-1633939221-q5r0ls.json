                  "text": "> I resent that remark actually\n\nI wasn't saying you *are* entitled, simply that your choice of words *sounds* entitled.\n\n> They've been in the office only for a rew more days than me. Their PhDs are related whereas mine is different.\n\nRight, but on the basis of that have they been in contact before now? Regardless of how much physical office time they've spent together, they might have already forged friendships. Are the other people who weren't invited also working on different PhD topics to the 9 dinner party people? Also, you say \"a few more days\" than you, but before you said there was a two week delay to you getting into the office. Two weeks is a more substantial time frame than a few days, especially when all the introductions etc. are being made.\n\n> You simply don't welcome someone by openly planning a social gathering that doesn't involve them right in front of them.\n\nYou don't like hearing this, but again saying that they haven't welcomed you the right way makes it sound like you think you deserve some kind of specific treatment/relationship from them that you simply haven't developed yet. You also didn't answer my previous question about what you've tried to do to socialise with them and befriend them.\n\n> Only natural when I've spent the last 20 years being part of different friend groups and environments where I was excluded deliberately.\n\nRight... if you acknowledge that you've been affected by past interpersonal experiences, then can you not acknowledge that perhaps your perception of this situation is coloured by that?\n\nIf they were setting up an office event (explicitly labelled as such) and chose to exclude you, you'd have a point If everyone in the office *except* you was invited, you'd have a point. But at the moment it still sounds like 9/13 people have something specific in common and know each other better, so they've formed a friendship group and made plans for that group. And sure, you're not invited, but it isn't only you who isn't. Have a dinner party with the other people if you're that concerned about it.",

      "text": "Hello AskAcademia. Is this the right platform to ask advice for thesis titles? I am currently a nursing student already on my third year. I am thinking to do a thesis related to EHRs (Electronic Health Records) as these are still almost unheard of from the province I am currently studying. I do not know what to focus on but I am confident that a thesis revolving around EHRs and the lack of it in the province would prove advantageous for me. I was initially researching stuff for my title and I realized that I was going for a feasibility study, which I do not know how to make. I was hoping to have investors as my target beneficiary for my thesis. I already have the word \u201cassessment\u201d for the title but I don\u2019t seem to know what should I assess, and I am hoping someone would point me to the right direction. Thank you!",
