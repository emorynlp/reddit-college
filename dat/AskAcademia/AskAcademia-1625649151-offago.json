  "text": "I'm at week 9 of a 12-week course. I feel like I havent slept in 3 months. I teach Tuesday/Thursday, which means that I spent Monday and Wednesday in course prep, which leaves me Friday and the weekends to catch up on research. \n\nMy lectures are only 80 mins long and yet I still feel like I'm never prepared, never have enough time for anything else. I have had more sleepless nights in the last 9 weeks than I have the previous year. \n\nI should say that I'm a PhD student still and my uni doesnt provide any teaching resources so I am learning a lot on the fly. But this summer is making me rethink my ability to handle a faculty job. I worked on my lecture until 11pm last night, fell asleep around 1am and have been up since 3:30am. I'm too old to handle this stress.\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who responded, especially those with practical insights and encouragement! I just wanted to add some clarifying information. Firstly, I was extremely sleep deprived and just crying in my bed, listening to my partner sleeping, when I wrote this post. Since I was in that state, I exaggerated a bit and was a bit dramatic. I was working that late on my slides because I had a full day of work and didn't couldn't start working on them until about 5:30pm, which is why I was working so late. I did not spend the full day working on my slides. I feel overworked because I am doing lecture prep, lecturing, working on my dissertation, doing research assistantship work and running my non-profit. It just so happened to be lecture prep that broke me last week but it rotates \ud83d\ude02\n\nI also wanted to say that since my university is unionized, the course materials are classified as the intellectual property of the instructor, not the university. Therefore, we can only get prior course materials if we contact the previous instructor directly, which would require us to know the person's contact information without the university giving it to us. I did happen to know the prior instructor and asked for help, was told many times they would send something but then never did. I am very in support of unions, this just happens to be the one downside that I have come across.",

I do make edits all the time as newer technologies come out, and even did a major overhaul last summer when we were all at home. \n\nI feel like I've done a lot backwards out of necessity, which increased my work for the first five years. When you first start teaching, your main focus is on lectures and exams, and you don't have time for anything else. I could barely keep a week ahead my entire first year or two. Then I started to add homeworks as I saw students were struggling with important concepts. Then I wrote up lecture notes to help them better understand the concepts, that I turned into a book. Then I wrote attendance questions and practice exams that were similar to the real exams. Finally, I wrote objectives, and rewrote the exams and homeworks to align with them.\n\nOf course, knowing then what I know now, I would start with the main objectives for each chapter, then design the Powerpoints around those, then base the homework off of the objectives and lectures, write practice questions for the students either for attendance or sample tests, and then finally make the exam questions perfectly correlate to the objectives, notes, homework, and everything else. But you just don't have time to do it this way when first starting, which is why everything feels so overwhelming!",

I was in my 20s still and was nervous every lecture that students would ask me something on the spot that I didn't know. I thought I would be embarrassed, laughed at, etc. Fast forward 15 years, and if I don't know something I say \"That's a great question! I don't know. But we can look into it after lecture\". I think it's important to be humble and show students you too are human. In fact I am often more likely as I get older to share stories of when I didn't know something, or when I failed, rather than talking about my successes. It definitely helps with engagement.",

That's a tough spot to be in, so don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nThe other side is... because teaching is so audience-facing and so immediate, we have a tendency to create an open-ended commitment to it, especially for the first couple times. Like... \"I just *need* this to be good / can*not* allow myself to lose my train of thought so *need* to prep more / *have* to be anticipate these questions\" etc etc. Once you find your footing that commitment will become more reasonable and you can stop having sleepless nights :).

Sounds like you're just being thrown into the water having had zero talks about how to swim.\n\nThat said, I would encourage you to keep in mind that there is absolutely no need for you to reinvent the wheel. Your uni doesn't provide resources? In all likelihood, someone else somewhere else may have made materials and collated content that you can draw from. This also takes some time, but it may alleviate some of the pressure of you thinking you have to come up with entirely new and unique material that it of the absolute highest quality. You don't. There is no need to kill yourself. Draw boundaries. Try to set a schedule where you don't work past a certain hour. Have a few tricks in your back pocket - if you run through the lecture content with more time left, see if you can have a general discussion exercise, or think of strategies where the students can engage with the ideas and present the key ideas in groups or something. \n\nFinally, don't be afraid to ask for help, or even just find other PhD peers who are also teaching to vent with and maybe get ideas from. Without knowing more about your subject or the level you're teaching, I can still say with a certain degree of confidence that your students are probably just fine and wouldn't notice if your lectures go at a slower pace or you don't have all 80 minutes jam packed with tons of information. \n\nBest of luck!",

People griped about the lab manual, but frankly to have a $25-$30 textbook available that you can buy used is a miracle in this day and age, even if it could use some revisions.\n\nAlso, in OP's case, there's no reason for the old TA's or profs not to leave resources for the new guys, even if they had beef with the department. That doesn't get revenge on their old bosses; just the poor newbies who have to take over. It's a shame, really.",

You'll have the information and structure after you've done it once and then it's updating, going over your materials and once in a while rethinking the whole class.\n\nAlso, I found that new preps became much easier as I gained experience. I taught for 38 years and my last 5 years I was chair with a 2 course release. One of those years I hired somebody who had brain cancer in remission (I knew that) and a week before classes started she called me and told me that she had a reoccurrence. Given various teaching schedules, I picked up 3 of her 4 classes, 2 of which were upper level and that I had never taught before. I spent that semester feeling completely overwhelmed and an imposter, working from 4:30 am to 10 pm preparing for those classes and doing my regular job. I was absolutely sure that the major students were wondering how I had ever gotten a job, at all. But at the end, I got the best student evaluations I had ever gotten and the next year a number of students told me that they had heard those classes were great and asked me if I was going to teach those classes again (I was absolutely not going to do that!). I think I actually benefitted from being overwhelmed with 2 new preps and didn't do all of the, \"They have to know this!\" aspect of class preparation that involves going well beyond the core materials.\n\nBy the way, my new hire quit to take care of herself. She's still with us, 7 years later, completely beating the lifespan odds for her type of cancer.",

If you give that up and accept that your first time isn't going to be perfect you will be a lot less stressed. \n\nBy the way, instead of preparing an 80 minute lecture every class, why not prepare an activity for students to do? Make them do most of the work! For example: prepare a 40 minute lecture (half the work!) and print a list of discussion questions... Put them in groups for the second part of class and assign one question to each group, have them discuss in the group for 15 minutes. Then have each group present their answer to the class and the other groups critique it.

What portion of your 80 minute lecture do you think students actually retain? If it's not 80 minutes worth (I think studies show attention starts to wane after about 15-20 minutes), then you are spending hours preparing material that's going in one ear and out the other.\n\nWith online teaching, you may need different strategies to get participation. Try an anonymous poll, breakout rooms, have them submit answers in advance of class, etc.\n\nRegardless of what method you use to get participation, my suggestion still stands, and it's common for inexperienced teachers to have a lesson that relies too much on your prepared materials and not enough on student participation. \n\nIf I had to make a wild guess based on what is admittedly not very much information, I'd wager that you're probably also preparing far too much material at the expense of depth/understanding of the main subject matter. This often happens with instructors who lecture for the entire class period-- when someone suggests adding a participation activity, they insist there's no time for an activity because they won't be able to \"cover everything\". But the amount of content they planned to cover was determined by the fact that they intended to lecture for 80 minutes-- so it's a circular argument! \n\nThe fact that students are reluctant to participate is actually also a possible symptom that you're covering too much-- they may say very little because they're lost. You may have lost them a long time ago-- if you never stop and do an activity to check for understanding how would you know? Don't rely on what they tell you (yes, professor, I understand, no I don't have any questions, please keep lecturing). Rely on what they show you. If they can't show you that they understand chances are they don't. \n\nIt takes time and experience to get comfortable with the idea that you don't need to cover everything-- some things can be skipped and some things can be shifted to the student's responsibility to learn outside of class-- and that you don't need to control every minute of the class period.",

I think usually it\u2019d take me 3-4h prep per hour of lecture my first go around (eg designing slides from mostly scratch), 1-2h my second, and <1h my third. \n\nStudents IME have also been very accommodating if you let them know it\u2019s your first time teaching the course and that they\u2019ll be serving as the animal model of choice to grind down any rough edges.\n\nAlso see if you even have to make everything from scratch \u2014 unless your topic is completely new to the world, ask other instructors at your uni if you can adapt modules from their materials for related courses. Can also reach out to colleagues afar, or even Google your course name to see if there are any publicly available slides that are relevant (and then email whoever made them to see if they\u2019ll permit adaptation with attribution).

I have my lessons on Word files and after 5 years, preparing for class takes me about 1 hour or less. I just review the class and adapt it to the particular students profile of the semester, and maybe add some new information about current events related to the field.\n\nFor structuring the class, it\u00b4s a trial and adjustment approach. You will try diffent things on class and indetify what subjects, examples, exercises, stories and questions are more important and more engaging for students. Then you go back and add (or subtract) them from the next lecture.\n\nHaving this kind of structure makes the lecture so mcuh easier and gives you the freedom to promote discussions during class, giving you a mental map of the subjects you want to cover and the time it takes to do so. This will become natural over time.\n\nOf course every lecture then is different because the level of participation and involvement from students differ. But having this structure makes you feel more confident when giving the lecture over time, and allows you to take much less time for preparation.\n\nThe flip side is that once you reach this point, you may develop impostor syndrome, but that\u00b4s another whole discussion ;) For the meantime, don\u00b4t worry, it will become much easier!\n\nGood luck!",

Sorry for the bad news. \n\nTo keep yourself fresh in terms of prep more or less requires you to go back over the ground of what you're going to be talking about (whether in lecture or discussion). At least a little bit. Some people, I guess, can stay fresh-sounding just off of a sort of muscle-memory of previous classes on the same subject, but not most--and it's really hard to connect to students if you sound rote or mechanical.\n\nOver much longer time scales (10 years +) a lot of us also have to cope with two other issues, but don't worry about this much right now: 1) a sense that the vastness of what is known and knowable about the subject we're teaching about is much bigger than we ever suspected, which starts to be a pervasive worry surrounding every decision you make to present a particular subject (this is one of the roots of what people call 'imposter syndrome')--paradoxically this feeling arises from a growing sense of command and knowledgeability about a field or subject matter; 2) a concern about whether the way you frame and think about some important aspects of your discipline and specialization are outmoded or difficult to translate into the way your current students tend to think about the world (a particularly acute problem with a lot of social science).\n\nWhat gets easier is the underlying infrastructure of teaching as a craft--you get more comfortable in front of a classroom, you start to have a more practiced understanding of what works and doesn't work and where the points are where students are going to be confused, you start to have a more intuitive command over the core knowledge areas you're going to be speaking to. Your prep work starts to be more focused on that need to \"be fresh\", to be in the moment of this upcoming class, and less concerned with *everything*. \n\nBut I don't think you want to get into a situation where it's all on automatic, because that can quickly become the teaching equivalent of highway hypnosis--you're so in the zone that you're effectively zoned out and unaware of the pedagogical moment that you're actually in. You want to think about it the way an actor or other performer does--you might get over the initial kind of stage fright and you might really memorize your lines, but you don't ever want to lose the meta-awareness of each performance as a thing unto itself and you need to do whatever is necessary to get yourself ready for each time you go into a classroom.",

I was so concerned about making sure I was prepared to answer a number of questions (that were never asked) that I would spend an extra 3-4 hours per lecture prepped. I eventually learned not to sweat the random questions and will tell students that I'm not sure of the answer but will look into it.",

      "text": "There is a lot of good advice in here, and I certainly resonate with a course being very time consuming to teach for the first time.\n\nOne piece of advice I can add that I haven't seen here: consider dedicating more of the time to things other than actually lecturing. For example, have a discussion question or two and ask students to talk with a partner next to them, and then ask for a few responses from the class afterward. Ask students to do a written reflection at the start or end of class. Include videos to supplement your lecture to highlight important concepts--these can provide visuals or personal narratives (depending upon your topic) that go beyond what you can share by talking.\n\nIn other words, sometimes less is more. A lecture should, of course, include you talking and sharing important details about a content area. And what is practical may depend upon the specific subject and the class size. But you may find that if you have students engage in some small discussion, application, or reflection activities, it both takes time (i.e., less lecture for you to prepare) and it ensures that every student is actively engaging with the material from the lecture and readings. In other words, it's a win-win.",

And what increases the chance that you teach the same class? Doing a good job, and getting good student reviews.\n\nIf you anticipate good reviews (encourage your students to do so, if possible) go to whoever makes the class schedule for your department at the end of the semester and request that you teach the same course again. Make the case that you spent X amount of time per week on it, and reducing this time will enable you to focus more on your research/dissertation/papers/etc. No guarantees of course, but it might help",

      "text": "Depends. When you are a phd student or early-career academic, you usually have a little control. Your teaching load might change a lot. The same module might be shared with someone else next year, they might cancel it, one of the professors might want it, or someone goes on mat leave, and you are asked to cover, then they return. So you might end up with bunch of prep, just to never use it again next year.\n\nEven when you become the module leader and get the fake freedom to do things your way, admin might decide to make lectures 180 minutes or cut the module from 10 weeks to 5, so you have yo shift things around again. (happened to me)\n\nDepending on the area, you might also have to update the content due to new developments or student feedback. Its also possible you get really unreliable co-lecturers or visiting lecturers and end up having to prepare for their part last minute.\n\nMy uni used to give 4 hour prep time per lectures, it was never enough for me when I was a PhD student. I wish I was one of those people who just got up and talked, I know really brilliant people like that. I prefer having my own slides and think of class activities/discussion points before going in.\n\nTo be clear, i do think it gets easier every year, if you are teaching it alone. But my department was not super organized.",

Spending the entirety of a day to prepare an 80-minute lecture seems excessive to me but I'm in math, not social science.

I was responsible for assignments, tests, and learning how to grade fairly.\n\nYou say that your \"uni doesn't provide any teaching resources\" but are there no other faculty around who have taught this course?  Have you spoken to them, and they have flat-out denied you help?  They have told other graduate students who have taught this class to refuse to help you?  It is mind-boggling that you have no way to get help here; when I bring new faculty into my department I practically deluge them with teaching material, notes, tests, homework assignments,..., any of which they can use or modify however they want.\n\nI am also a PhD student in math (part time; I am full-time faculty at the community college here) and the department has graduate students teaching freshman-level courses, all of which are designed from top to bottom by a full time faculty member.  The role of the graduate TA is to deliver lectures and work with students during office/tutoring hours.",
