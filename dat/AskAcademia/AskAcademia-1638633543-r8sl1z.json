  "title:": "Search Committees: What Do You Want to See After a Successful Second Round?",
  "text": "I had a second round full-day interview with a private liberal arts college and thought it went great. I felt connected to everyone I met and interviewed with and even though it was 9 hours of virtual meetings, I ended the day feeling very energized and optimistic. Based on advice from others, I sent a personalized thank you to each person I met the next morning, but now I'm second-guessing those emails. The replies I received have been encouraging, but I feel like I may have leaned too heavily into my emotional investment and overshared my enthusiasm.\n\nFor those of you on hiring committees, do you expect any sort of follow-up from short-listed candidates after their full-day interviews? If so, what do you want/hope to see?\n\nAs an aside: Is it really for entire committees and departments to put a smile on and keep candidates encouraged throughout the process? I seriously did not expect so much positive engagement throughout the day, but since I don't have a ton of second-round interview experience, maybe that's the norm?\n\nFirst post here. Thanks in advance for any advice.",

It's a busy time of the semester and they might not have the time or capacity for a more thoughtful response. \n\nWe always try to be as encouraging and enthusiastic as possible during the interview. If we end up making an offer, we want the candidate to accept. We're trying to sell the school just like the candidate is trying to sell themselves.",

It\u2019s that double-dynamic of me pitching myself to the school and the school pitching itself to me that caused me to second-guess showing too much enthusiasm. That said, it\u2019s good to know that a simple thank you is all that\u2019s needed, and if I personalized it a touch more than normal, all should be fine. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s nothing else I can do at this point to differentiate myself from the other candidates.",

You want to work somewhere that loves your enthusiasm, not somewhere where they see your enthusiasm as a negative (assuming you didn't reach a pitch only dogs could hear before screaming how much you love them). \n\nWe're doing some faculty recruitment at the moment and we had one candidate who practically bounced off camera she was so excited by a question our director asked. I'm a curmudgeonly introvert and I was absolutely charmed and her enthusiasm was just infectious. I really hope we are able to offer her a post because I think she'd just be a great addition to our institute. \n\nHopefully, they see you the same way.",

      "text": "9 hours?! Yikes and holy cow that's more than we ever require. I am a fan of notes, although I've seen both ways of doing it, to members or to HR who shares with members.  But one thing we tend to like, and I certainly do, is seeing a candidate who not only has the expertise and experience we want, but shows enthusiasm and excitement for the job. So I'm on your side on what you did, and that comes from being on committees and seeing loads of candidates. When I see relatively equal candidates the one who seems energetic, outgoing, etc will often be my choice.  \n\nAs for your second question, yes the norm is be very generous, encouraging etc to the final candidates, trying hard to show no cards.  The reason is the committee members may not be unanimous on who they want, so we have to fight it out in a later meeting where we'll do our best to convince the others of our preferred candidate.  On the other hand, encouragement is often a really good sign. But I note for me there is genuine encouragement for candidates I really want the uni to hire and sort of business/fake encouragement to candidates I know I'd never vote for just so they leave feeling ok.  It's hard for me to have any sense of the people you met but maybe you can tell.\n\nThe fact you were part of the second round is already great. Good luck, I hope it works out for you.",

If so, what do you want/hope to see?\n\nNothing is needed. It's nice if you send a little thank-you e-mail, but it's honestly not necessary (if you do or don't, it won't change a thing about our deliberations \u2014 if we aren't convinced you're the right candidate, it won't make a difference; if we are, it won't make a difference). Don't expect any kind of reply, much less one that gives you any information (I don't reply to them at all \u2014 I don't want to send any \"signals\"). \n\nAs for positive vibes \u2014 if they are encouraging you throughout the process and being positive, it probably means that they think you are someone who they might want to work with. It does not mean you are their #1 choice, though. You might be the #2 choice, or the #3 choice, and so on \u2014 but they know, through long experience, that you often end up with the #2 or #3 choices, because the committee does not really have control over who gets hired, in the end (that's a complex little dance between deans and provosts and candidates and so on; we just make a recommendation and an ordering, that's all). So yeah, you can probably take it as a positive sign that things went well! (Or, at least, that the committee and everyone else you talked to know how to act like decent people; I try to be nice even if I don't think I want to hire a candidate, though I admit it is easier to be consistently friendly and encouraging to the ones I actually want to hire.)
