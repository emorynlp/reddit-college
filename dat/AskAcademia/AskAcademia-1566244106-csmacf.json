      "text": "I have a couple of odd ones, one truly idiotic and another just odd, but with a happy ending.\n\nAs a Ph.D. student, I submitted a paper to a conference (in my area, conferences are the primary publication venues) and it was rejected with three strongly positive reviews and one very negative review that said my work was too closely related to a number of others.  I spent weeks reading the cited papers and others from the same research groups, which were exactly nothing like my work.  My advisor eventually called a friend on the conference program committee to ask about it.  Apologetically, the friend admitted that they had more highly rated papers than they could accept, so they decided to reject some of them, including mine, and *the program chair assigned people to write fake negative reviews justifying the decisions*.  I didn't mind the rejection so much--it happens--but I felt badly burned by the deception and the time and energy I wasted because of it.\n\nAnother time, as a tenured faculty member, I submitted a paper with my students to the top conference in my area.  The work was foundational in a certain sub-area and I expected the paper to not only be accepted, but to win the Best Paper award and be highly cited.  Despite getting positive reviews, it was rejected.  (On the plus side, they did *not* write a fake review justifying it.)  At the conference, the Program Chair explained that another eerily similar submission proved nearly identical theorems in nearly identical ways with nearly identical terminology.  Ours was stronger and the other had a few issues, but the other author was working toward tenure and their work would be rendered moot if my paper was accepted, so they rejected both.  \n\nI happened to know the other author, so ... I got in touch, explained the situation, we exchanged papers, I invited them to visit (at my expense) and collaborate on a joint paper, we did so, and it won a Best Paper award and went on to become one of our most cited papers.  I later wrote a very positive letter for their (successful) tenure case based in part on that experience.",

          "text": "The first is just weird. I've been part of conference organization before. There's often more papers than can be fit, and eventually the reviewers take a call and pick some. Sometimes it literally just boils down to whether or not there are other papers which can then be merged to create thematically linked panels. The rejected papers are always told why they were rejected, and that it wasn't because of quality but simply because we couldn't accommodate them in the conference. As far as I can tell, nobody has ever held that against organizers. Why would you make up negative reviews?",

      "text": "We had a paper rejected at journal A, and were pretty sure we got a reviewer who authored a paper on a similar topic from the same dataset that took a very different approach than us. We heavily revised the paper, including writing an entire page about how our paper builds on that other study, and then sent it to Journal B.\n\nOne of the reviewers said we gave only a passing cite to that other paper. Clearly, the same person got invited to review the paper again at Journal B and rejected it without reading any of our changes, including the ENTIRE PAGE dedicated to their paper. We actually appealed this one, and in the end they said \"Yeah I actually missed that but I still say reject for X, Y, and Z\" (which were reasons that didn't make any sense). \n\nFinally, we sent it to journal C (the one the other paper was published in) and got the easiest R&R I've ever gotten. Reviewer 1 said it was beautifully written and Reviewer 2 said it was horribly written, but fortunately the action editor agreed more with Reviewer 1. It's conditionally accepted now.",

Apparently spelling it that way made me ignorant and offensive. The journal wasn't a gender studies journal - it was a broader, field specific special edition of a bigger journal with a higher impact factor as my \"first attempt\" with that paper. \n\nOne of the reviewers even wrote something like \"Having long identified as genderqueer myself, [...]\"\n\nThe paper got outright rejected so I didn't even get a chance to respond with something cheeky. The great irony is that it was a qualitative study and my PARTICIPANTS identified themselves that way and one of the older ones even spelled it that way, so I wasn't just randomly inserting offensive hyphens into random words. Honestly fuck the editor for letting those reviews dictate whether the paper was rejected. It took him EIGHT MONTHS to get those poor excuses for reviewers.",

I was desk rejected at a flagship journal for an article that--as the editor specifically noted they were adding parenthetically to the boilerplate--the editor personally found both interesting and valuable, but didn't think the journal's readership would care about.\n\nThe article was entirely framed as a response to a recent, highly cited article in that same journal.\n\n(Things worked out for it in the end, though, since it got published in the field's other flagship journal, where it even elicited a published response from a more-important-than-me-scholar who hated it.)",
