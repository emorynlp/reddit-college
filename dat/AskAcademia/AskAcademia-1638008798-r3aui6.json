  "text": "My research direction is mainly controlled by my Co-Supervisor (weekly meeting).\n\nSo for all submissions, the principal supervisor predominantly helps.\n\nNow I got some results based on some conditions given by my Co-Supervisor, not at the time of publishing when the principal supervisor when asked about the main conditions were chosen, I am replying by saying \"we chose because of this and this....\"\n\nBut my Co-Supervisor has gone completely silent. By silent I mean the Co-Supervisor has been a part of all the emails but not responding that it was his suggestions in the first place.\n\nEven when I showed my interest on the same topic that my principal supervisor is asking the Co-Supervisor said \"it is not publishable\"\n\nHow to handle this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I tell my principal supervisor that my Co-Supervisor suggested these things in the first place?",

If that's the case and you've tried contacting them, you need to get your supervisor to chase them.",
