  "text": "Obviously I wouldn't word it exactly like that. I guess I was just wondering if the idea itself is considered taboo or unacceptable in the academic world. I read how in hard science, the authors usually don't get any of the funds from people using money to access their articles so if you email them they'll often send them for free. I was wondering if a similar dynamic exists in lib arts/anthropology world, and also if this works when there's more than one author",
