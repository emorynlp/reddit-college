  "title:": "The top journal in my field constantly asks me for peer review, at what point is it reasonable to ask for a position on the editorial board? Is that ever even an option?",
  "text": "So as the title states, the top journal in my field of speciality constantly invites me for peer review, invitations which I generally accept. In the past year alone I have done 7 peer reviews for this specific journal. Admittedly, I do frequently submit my reviews late due to competing commitments  or get disinvited because the number of required reviews is reached (I assume they over invite in those cases, since I have often been reviewer #4 on some manuscripts). \n\nI also peer review for several other journals but less frequently; I feel this journal takes an unusually larger chunk of my review time and I wonder if it would be possible to approach them to be considered for their editorial board? Is this even something that one does or just waits for an invitation (if that ever comes)? Given that performing reviews as just a peer reviewer takes a lot of time and  brings very little added value to my CV, I think having some sort of formalized position would at least justify me prioritizing this journal's reviews on a more timely basis than I have been up to now.",

      "text": "A couple of thoughts:\n\n* If you review frequently for the journal, then sure, go ahead and ask about the possibility of an editorial board position.  Of course, be sure to phrase your request in very professional and positive terms.  You really respect the journal, it's your go-to place for the latest and greatest in your field, you have reviewed for them frequently in the past, and so forth.  Don't let any hint of the idea come across that this is a quid pro quo situation, i.e., that you've done a lot of review work for them in the past and now you'd like to be rewarded with a position.  In strict numerical terms, the journal has very few editorial board positions but many, many reviewers, even reviewers who review multiple times per year, so in that strictly numerical sense, your situation is likely not special.\n* The other point is that, even if it's ok for you to ask about the possibility of an editorial board position, it's another matter entirely as to whether this is a good idea.  You yourself admit that you frequently submit late reviews (the bane of any editorial board member's existence), and so it might be wise to ask whether you truly have the time available in your schedule to serve as an editorial board member, which is a whole new level of work entirely compared to being an ordinary reviewer.",

              "text": "This is true, but it would be a bad look as an editorial board member to be submitting late reviews (especially if the goal is to use the EB role as a springboard to greater journal responsibility in the future). In fact, I know of journals that reduce your reviewer requests if you maintain a record of submitting reviews before the deadline.",

In the one I'm editor of, editorial board members handle papers and make decisions, which are vetted by the EiC. 99.9% of the time they go with your opinion. Associate editors operate independently of the EiC and their role is to steer the journal and recommend editorial board members.\n\nThis gives you quite a lot of power if you are an editorial board member, as you get to decide what gets published and what does not. I guess this is due to the fact we receive north of 5000 submissions a year, so the only way to handle this is trusting your editorial board. Each of us handle around 25 papers per year.",
