No one is going to hire you because of your Facebook, they're only going to decide not to hire. Not having a Facebook is an advantage in that situation. However, in academia, up to a point academic freedom requires that academics are allowed to express opinions no matter how unpopular they are - the obvious limit is when their views impinge on the freedom of others, eg hate speech, transphobia etc.",
