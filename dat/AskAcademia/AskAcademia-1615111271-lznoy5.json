  "title:": "This might sound really stupid, but can I still submit abstracts to conferences call for papers after graduating and no longer being a graduate student?",
  "text": "Please forgive me if this is the wrong space to post this. I finished my MA degree a few years ago, and I have been doing work unrelated to my degree since. Today my former second reader professor forwarded me a call for papers for a special conference about a very specific niche, on which I wrote my MA thesis. I really want to be a part of this conference, but I only submitted and presented papers while I was a student, and I no longer belong to an organization or school. Is it allowed for a regular \"no-longer-a-student\" person to participate? Will they welcome my submission? The call for papers said, \"Early career scholars and graduate students are very welcome.\"",

In the humanities (my field and at interdisciplinary conferences) there seems to be an understanding that everything is cratering and the field should be open to qualified, alt-ac people of all sorts presenting. Of course, the abstract has to be of good enough quality to be accepted (they are read blind).\n\nI wonder, if the requirements for admission to a conference in your field (or STEM in general) is different, and/or if jobs are plentiful so as to self-select only affiliated scholars. Or if the field had some weird history with non-trained people somehow getting in?",

It was actually often actively recommended against going into industry vs continuing on to the post-doc/professor route, which is why our field is currently heavily saturated with degrees but jobs are currently not abundant at all. Once you leave academia in my field it is often hard to get back in due to lack of publishing. So I wonder if making it more difficult to present at conferences is just another way to keep people from coming back and establishing research. \n\nI would agree that it should just be that if your abstract is good enough you should be able to present at no cost higher than those of professors. It is some weird prejudice that I still do not understand!",
