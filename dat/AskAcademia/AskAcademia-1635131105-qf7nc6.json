  "text": "Given that to get your phd, you have to expand science or knowledge somewhat, which means that the next phd student will have to have slightly more work to advance it and so on.  From what I understand, phd students are taking longer and longer to complete their studies, but the economy still needs them for education and work.  What happens if there is no longer enough phds to fulfil societies needs?  \n\nI imagine some fields this won't matter, but in sciences and math, it would be worse.",

As I'm European they of course also had a Master degree but \"not needing a PhD\" and Bachelor Vs Master are of course two different discussions. I'm still definitely at fault for not making that distinction more clear as I of course kind of default to \"no PhD = you have a Master\" which simply isn't true for some countries.  \n\nPersonally I don't know anyone who got a lab or even research job in industry (where of course \"bubbles\" come into place), my peers and I am went to more or less \"transferable skills jobs\" so PR/science communication, patent right, Data Analyst, Software Dev/Tester, IT, Project Manager, Quality Assurance etc pp. We also usually did extra training or certificates before most of us found a job, but I think that's actually again very Germany-specific. Here the problem is that too many people apply for such jobs so they simply give preference to those who can show they had job related formal training. I was told e.g. North Americans are less easily impressed with certificates, not sure if that's for the better or worse.\n\nI'm always curious about official numbers but mostly I see anecdotes about that topic.",

I'm not trying to be combative but this came off as needlessly condescending. I'm not indicating that a large proportion of people that have earned bachelor's go into R&D positions or easily get industry jobs. She wasn't an undergrad at the time of those publications - she had already graduated. She had the opportunity to get those publications because she started as a research assistant and took initiative to develop her own research projects, building experience and credibility along the way. I'm just pointing out that, in contrast to academia, industry is more likely to look past the lack of an advanced or terminal degree and instead consider experience. Maybe that's not borne out in the numbers, but that's my experience, I just gave one concrete example.",

I'm confused about the misunderstanding you're having. I just pointed out a difference between academia and industry in terms of how they look at the degrees you hold.

You never learned how companies work and only know how to work in an academic setting. You also usually lack experience in that exact job so yes, you absolutely are at risk of being put on a junior position because doing a PhD for 7 years in Biology doesn't mean you have any job experience as Consultant or whatever. You're also \"oVerQUaLIfiEd\" which just means that they prefer to hire someone with less degrees for less money (because they assume you'll ask for more or demand more raises). Another problem I observed is that especially for the \"transferable skills\" companies often seem to hesitate because they don't have a way to tell how good you actually are in those as you never received any formal training.",

Getting a PhD is an indication that you have enough knowledge and experience to proceed to contribute to the work of science.

Fast-forward to the mid-twentieth century. The PhD became a more normal standard for becoming a professor in many fields where advanced studies were required. They still had a component of demonstrating sufficient knowledge and contributing novel insights, but more they required doing work under a professor as an apprentice to understand the techniques and practices of the field. But they also, as the modern capitalist framing effectively became a part of most western cultures, became a source of cheap labor. As the funding for science increased, due to the ever increasing complexity of research in biology, physics, etc., the PhD student was a cheaper alternative to hiring a \u2018scientist\u2019. This was further turned into a pyramid scheme when postdoctoral fellowships went from being optional opportunities to develop new skills to pre-requisites for getting hired in many fields. That led to a scaling of cost of labor (PhD < Postdoc < Research Scientist < Tenured Professor). Further, the increase in funding to train students at the PhD level was not matched by equivalent funding for the upper level positions, leading to ever increasing attrition across the ladder. This has led to inventive systems and metrics that are used to select as people move up the ladder\u2014but which do not necessary correlated significantly with long term contributions to scientific knowledge. Further, they metrics are broken at most levels. For example, as a PhD student the different lengths of time between PhDs in the EU vs US create asymmetries in the likely paper produced during a PhD. Further, luck plays a major role in PhD students likelihood of publishing in a top-tier journal. As you more from Postdoc to PhD, the entire system has selected for a person who successfully works \u2018alone\u2019 or as the \u2018primary\u2019 driver of research, but the primary role of a professor is to teach and manage students and postdocs. This is not actually part of the incentive or metrics that led to\u2014or sustain funding\u2014at the top level.\n\nAnd this is before we get to the problem that science in many if not most fields (e.g. neuroscience, where I work) has grown so complex, requires so many skills to be brought together, that the only way to move forward as a field is to start taking larger-scale collaborative approaches to science the de-emphasize the individual and focus more on collective contributions and generating truly \u2018useful\u2019 knowledge. That is, a paper that produces a novel finding, but is never replicated, cannot be easily contextualized in the larger area of investigation due to unnecessary idiosyncrasies, etc. is likely to not actually be a \u2018useful\u2019 contribution in the long run. But the system as it is now provides impediments to moving in this direction in most fields (high-energy physics and astronomy being the notable exceptions). From funding mechanisms, to hiring, to promotion, the focus on actually generating useful knowledge and training new scientists for the changing space of human knowlege is lagging.\n\nAnd then there is the final problem. We fund science at a tiny fraction of the GDP spent on many other aspects of society. We let companies capture the profits on the backs of basic publicly funded research. The fact that we achieved a Covid-19 vaccine in record time required the combined efforts of many sectors and was built on huge amounts of basic research over the last 10-20 years. If we want to solve the problems humanity faces, we will need to shift the allocation of resources to science and applying that scientific knowledge to the problems. Of course, if we do shift those resources and recalibrate the incentives and metrics, getting a PhD is a great idea! We need more people working on the myriad of problems we need to solve if we want to avoid the disastrous consequences of climate change or cancer let alone keeping human civilization around as long as the other species who managed to get by for millions of years on this planet.",

If scientific advancements are more expensive, universities need more cheap labor - aka more grad students.\n\n> \nGiven that to get your phd, you have to expand science or knowledge somewhat, which means that the next phd student will have to have slightly more work to advance it and so on.\n\nIn practice, most dissertations are written to close a gap in a niche literature. This is in a sense expansion of scientific knowledge, but it concerns an obscure lemma (that may even be irrelevant to the function of the discipline) rather than a big new proof. There are millions such gaps in any literature, and the closing of these gaps often generates more gaps. Being able to find and close such a gap doesn't necessarily entail learning more in some absolute sense rather than learning a specialized niche of study. tl;dr students have to do about the same amount of work, just in a narrower scope.\n\n> phd students are taking longer and longer to complete their studies\n\nI'm not sure that this is true (I mean I know PhDs take a long time and often longer than matriculating students expect, but I'm not sure there's a lengthening dynamic through the years - if you have such data, that would be interesting). I'm also not sure that the causality you want to see is the causality that's there. There's lots of factors that can lengthen a PhD, and ime many of them occur more frequently than someone not being able to do the research: ran out of funding, advisor/committee issues, personal issues, experiments not working or getting scooped... If anything, imo this is more a problem at the TT level, where to get tenured you may have a requirement of x pubs in top 10 journals, and many people are simply unable to produce x separate research projects that are among the best in the entire discipline. The PhD dissertation simply isn't anywhere near that high a bar.\n\n> the economy still needs them for education and work\n\nthat's not what hte market is telling us\n\n> What happens if there is no longer enough phds to fulfil societies needs?\n\nthis is a science fiction scenario",
