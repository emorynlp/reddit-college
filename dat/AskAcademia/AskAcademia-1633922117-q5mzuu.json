  "title:": "PhD at BS and MS university",
  "text": "I have read a few posts here talking about how it is important to go to a different school for their Phd. I understand that networking is important and that it will help me gain new insights and learning methods, but I am unsure I will be able to get into any other school. For context, I did well in my undergraduate finishing with a 3.8 in Electrical Engineering and I am currently enrolled in my school's (UCSD)  BS/MS program but I do not have any research experience. I want to study ML/AI but I feel like any other school that's better than UCSD in those fields will require me to have insane stats. The only guy I know who went to Standford for AI published 8 papers during his undergraduate so I feel like I won't be able to compete if every candidate is of the same or almost of the same caliber. My school lets students who do well during the MS and can find an advisor transfer into the PhD program. I would either start my PhD in spring/summer of 2022 at my current school or graduate in December 2022 and apply for Fall 2023 programs.  \n\nShould I just risk my current school for a chance at another or should I stay here and take advantage of the opportunities I already have?",

      "text": "One thing I rarely see mentioned about this sort of situation is the difference in lifestyle, especially moving from undergraduate to PhD level. This may apply less to you since you\u2019ve already done an MS. But I went straight from undergrad to doing a PhD without realizing that things needed to change. I still hung out with the same friends, still went out and did the same things. And I didn\u2019t have the commitment to my PhD program that I needed. \n\nThings change a lot when you move to the doctoral level. And I think moving to a new place really helps to cement that change and give you a clean break from your previous life. \n\nThis may not be as relevant to you. But I do think it\u2019s something worth considering.",

      "text": "This sounds more like a think out loud. Well, nothing says you can't apply to programs this cycle. You'd find out around spring 2022 which is when you'd start at your current school. I got a few acceptances as early as January. So yeah. Do what you will but seems like you have a safety net. If you're asking us if it's worth the trouble to apply that's a question you need to answer for yourself. I went to a program I never thought I'd get into. I've known others who had the same experience of me and others who got rejected from everywhere but a single school. So up to you.",

      "text": "Like others said, you can (and probably should) apply to more than one university anyway. But even if you can't, there is nothing inherently wrong about staying in the same university. There is an old stigma against it because it can cause what some people call academic inbreeding, but that's something we inherited from a different time where collaborating with colleagues either meant setting up a phone call or physically moving to their university for a week. We are closing on 2022, I now have students whose face I have never seen, and may very well never see before they graduate. Overcoming physical barriers to communication and collaboration has never been so easy.",

      "text": "It's certainly not a death sentence to your career, particularly if you can find a means to justify it. It's not nearly as frowned upon as doing your PostDoc at the same institution as your doctorate, but even *that* has all sorts of caveats and wiggle room in it.\n\nSo basically; you're going to be asked about it, but if you have a legitimate (sounding) answer, then you won't get seriously hampered by it.",

      "text": "Going to different schools matters to some, does not matter as much to others. It depends on what you want from your education. \n\nA PhD at a different uni than your BS, MS is usually recommended because it allows you to experience different cultures, network with more and different people. It basically expands your horizons and also allows you to dip your toes in different fields of research even if it is in the same discipline. \n\nOn the other hand, if you really do like your current PI and college atmosphere and your work, you should ask and try to stay back. This way you will have a steady project to work on and probably publish more papers and better papers sooner than you would - not that you would not publish good papers elsewhere. \n\nDecide what you think is more important and make the choice. No wrong answer here.",
