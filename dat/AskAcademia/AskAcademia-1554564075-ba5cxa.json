  "title:": "Been removed from academia for almost four years. Worried I'm not intellectually ready",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I recently was accepted to an awesome master's program in Latin American/Caribbean Studies. I also received a fellowship that will fully fund my first year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am worried I am lacking a bit intellectually. I have issues focusing when ready and especially explaining/putting into words what I just read. I know this post is a bit vague but I'm just afraid my analytical skills are a bit lacking and I know this will be a demanding program. I've begun to read about a few professors I'll be taking classes with to familiarize myself with their work as well as some of the readings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for someone who has been removed from academia for awhile on how to get up to speed with the demanding nature of masters programs? Any and all advice is super appreciated! ",

Some univesities post their course material or their syllabi online.\n\nOnce you have, I suggest reading some of the books and see if you can understand their content. If you cannot, its is an opportunity to write down what you are lacking, instead of keeping that dreadful sensation of thinking that you lack some intellecutal knowledge without knowing what.\n\nIf you have any furthr questions, I'm here !\n\nI'm helping my gf get back in intellectual shape after her disease got her bedridden for two years.",

It went slowly.\n\nBut what we did was to make her read books she liked, and fundamentals. She wants to become a researcher. Reading is essential. So we started little by little, and small. We began with comics, mangas. Things that were easy to read. Once she felt comfortable, we switched to small novels, and then bigger and bigger. Once she felt comfortable reading, we switched to reading fundamentals of philosophy, sociology. We talked a lot about what she thought, what was her analysis. Steady on. She could make links she couldn\u2019t before, her thoughts became clearer. \n\nShe still hasn\u2019t recovered. She used to have a photographic memory. Now she doesn\u2019t really, there are gaps. Be she made progress. And she\u2019ll continue to do so.\n\nP.S.: She wants to become a researcher in social sciences. ",

      "text": "I would suggest reading recent academic articles.  Try to identify the common theories, themes, ideas, etc. being discussed and understand them.  Do you have certain authors you want to study? Find articles about them as well. And awesome; you\u2019ve already done part of this: find articles your professors have written and read those too. \n\nAlso, for what this is worth, when I moved from my BA into an MA lit program, I only had a week in between the two (as opposed to four years), but I found that my knowledge and understanding was subpar compared to my peers (real or perceived/imposter syndrome). But I hung in there and tried to catch up. Most days you\u2019ll hear your a name, idea, etc. that you haven\u2019t heard before. When that happened to me, I\u2019d write that down or remember it then look it up later (some grad students are happy to explain if you ask though\u2014these people are great; but some others use this as a reason to flex, feel superior, and put you down to compensate for their own insecurities\u2014fuck those guys). \n\nMy point there is just that no matter how well-prepared you are, you\u2019re going to encounter names, books, ideas, etc. you haven\u2019t heard before\u2014no matter how prepared you are\u2014so don\u2019t take that as a sign that you didn\u2019t prepare enough or aren\u2019t qualified to be there. Just learn as you go because that\u2019s why you\u2019re a student and everyone else is in the same boat as you. ",

Take this time to relax, make some extra money, figure out how to do your laundry efficiently or anything else that will make your actual time in grad school, when you will need to prioritize studying, easier. That is almost never reading all the things beforehand. It usually means getting some life things out of the way so that, come september, you can focus on school.",

      "text": "Hi OP. I am starting off my Masters program at a really young age. I'm probably the youngest in my uni's grad school. \n\n I had a similar concern with you. For me, I'm a perfectionist to the point that it affects my writing because if I don't do a set of routine I have in mind (i.e: reading a specific number of articles), I won't even write for the day. \n\nBut one BIG thing I realized about being in Masters at a young age and with no other postgrad student in my field to guide me, is to be okay with failure. I faced so many failures in the beginning that I even went to my supervisor and told him I'm ready to give up. I'll always remember what my supervisor said to me when I told him Masters is too hard and I just wanted to cry every day.\n\nHe told me that just because something is too hard, doesn't mean it can't be done. I learnt from many, many mistakes I've made that you just need to give yourself time and just BEGIN. Don't be too hard on yourself. I have several sample dissertations within my field that I look at to make sure I'm on track and I can compare the quality of my writing to theirs as well as my findings.\n\nOh, and one thing... you'll have to read A LOT. I've come to accept that fact and I don't try to find a way around it. I used to try to find shortcuts earlier on in my program but it really showed in my writing. \n\nIf you're concerned about your analytical skills, just think logically and ask yourself a lot of questions. From there use the keywords to do your research. Read, read, read and read some more. You probably think you don't have an idea or you're not as smart, but when you read, you get inspired and from there, you start. ",

I was far from alone: even though most of the people in my cohort came directly from undergrad, they had varied skill sets and experiences, and they didn't necessarily feel confident about their abilities. It can help to read articles from the discipline and listen to relevant podcasts in the lead-up to the program, if only to help you feel more prepared, but I think it's far more important to be open and proactive, and to do the work. There will always be a learning curve in grad school, but at the end of the day, this program accepted you for a reason.\nYou'll have a ton to read once school starts, so I echo previous commenters in encouraging you to relax and take time for yourself over the summer.

      "text": "I felt exactly the same way as you did last year. GRE really helped me boost my vocabulary (it is REALLY useful). Other than that, I spent all my free time reading from the time I got accepted until school started. I read some light novels, but made sure to join on the reddit bookclub to discussion it or right down my thoughts on it. If I really liked a novel, I read an analysis of it off JSTOR (a lot of good articles with people\u2019s thoughts on this). I eventually moved onto comprehensive history books (I\u2019m studying Chinese history) on my field of interest. And when I felt I was doing good at that, I ended up reading more advanced books and articles. I made sure to note take and highlight in them. I ended up doing great my first semester (4.0) and am now taking even harder classes this semester (one has all Ph.D students). Just work hard and you\u2019ll get that haze off in no time! And just know that you will never feel prepared. I did all this, and I still felt like I was going to be destroyed when I started school back in Sept. Hell, I still feel really inadequate in my hard class with all Ph.D students. But the key is to just try your best and put your best foot forward each day. \n\nAlso, I know a lot of people say to enjoy the free time. I agree with this, but also I really am so thankful that my past self did all the work that I did do. I ended up still pulling from the material I read over the summer all the time, in addition to becoming better at understanding texts. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about analysis. I felt like that comes more as you take classes and engage in discussions. I really would encourage you to just pick up some books that interest you or that you\u2019ve always wanted to read. :) but be sure to remember not to burn yourself out before school. I ended up taking the last 3 weeks before I started to pretty much just play video games and felt completely refreshed by the time school began. \n\nOutside of some reading, if you have the entire summer off then I suggest you learn what you can do to ground yourself. I ended up doing a lot of random activities and sticking with instruments and running got me through a lot of the craziness that grad school demanded. ",

What are the author\u2019s main points? How is this paper contributing to the overall body of knowledge about the subject? How does it relate to what you\u2019re studying specifically? \n\n\nMake a solid outline before getting starting on papers/assignments. I like to copy/paste the highest mark descripts from the rubric in the relevant sections of my outline as a way to help stay on track. You can bring the outline to the prof\u2019s office hours to get feedback. It\u2019s important to understand each prof\u2019s expectations about work and class participation. \n\n\nPrioritize your mental health. Reflect on what energizes and restores you and do those things regularly. Be proactive in taking advantage of counselling resources and workshops at your university to learn additional strategies and get support.  \n\n\nCollaborate with your cohort. They can be invaluable academic, personal and professional supports. Discuss readings and assignments with them. \n\n\nAct professionally with profs. Show up to classes and be prepared, be a respectful and active listener when they lecture, ask good questions, follow through on commitments, and don\u2019t make excuses. \n\n\nGood luck and congratulations on this next chapter in your life!

He laughed and said, \"You must be a second-career student, only a returning student would mistaken me for a student, I'm a professor.\" Embarassed, I apologized, and proceeded to tell him how out of touch I was with college. He said, \"Don't worry - all my students who are returning adults always do better...they're formidable, on a mission.\" I've always carried that with me. 2 years later at time of post - on the honor roll. You'll do great. ",

I hope this isn't too simplistic but if you're worried about, say, putting into words what you just read, you can practice this thinking any time of the day, reading the paper, listening to music. Enjoy the extra thoughts that come when you're processing info like this.\n\nTo dip your toe back into the forbidding process of *learning* (which really we are doing all the time, we just forget) can I recommend a book I mention quite often which is *Learn Better* by Ulrich Boser. It's a very readable book with such reasonable (some might say common-sense) advice about how to handle new information entering our brain that I'm sure it will reassure you a little.\n\nMeantime use [sci-hub.tw](https://sci-hub.tw) to dive back into your old field free of charge (or write to the academics asking for their papers if you're happy pestering and uh not breaking the law). Read widely and enjoy.\n\nNerves are inevitable but it sounds like you have a great attitude and I'm sure you'll be ok :))))\n\nAlso because it suits your topic sort of here is a link to an album I've been joying a lot recently, [Tumbele! Biguine, Afro & Latin Sounds From French Caribbean,1963-74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wdZLUILdyI). Great tunes to chill to while pondering your fate!",

I struggled and in fact still do struggle with this. What helps me is chatting with my (super lovely) advisor and fellow students - informal moments where I just speak a bit about a book or article that interested me and that I think might interest them too. Also taking lots of notes, of course. ",
