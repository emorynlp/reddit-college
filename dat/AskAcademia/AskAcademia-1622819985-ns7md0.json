  "text": "Hi all, I've been in my current postdoc position in the organic chemistry field (US) for almost two years now (33yo). I and my PI have discussed recently starting writing papers to prepare for switching positions by next year. But I still have some pieces left to complete a paper. \n\nI've struggled with infertility for many years. I am pregnant through IVF, it's now only 6 weeks. Until now, I am still doing research in the lab, even wearing PPE and performing in the hood, it's impossible to not be exposed to organic solvents.\n\nI plan to tell my boss until 10 weeks or so when the miscarriage chance significantly decreases. My major concern is the risks of continuing the lab works on the fetus. This pregnancy is too precious for us, I won't take any risks. \n\nI would like to hear people who have similar experiences or any suggestions are welcoming! Thanks!",

      "text": "Congratulations!\n\nI became pregnant during the final year of my chemical engineering PhD, and like you, had outstanding experiments that involved harsh chemicals that I didn\u2019t want to expose the fetus to. I had a great relationship with my advisor, and so I chose to tell him about the pregnancy early (around 6-7 weeks). Together we then decided to bring on a master\u2019s student to do all the wet lab work, while I remained in charge of planning the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing it up. While training the student we ran mock experiments using non-toxic chemicals. \n\nPerhaps you can do something similar and bring on a student to do the wet lab work for you, who can become a coauthor on the eventual paper?",

I told her very early (6 or 8 weeks I think?) and we made plans to have interns or the lab manager or others in the lab to run my last experiments that required any toxic supplies.  \n\n\nCongratulations! Don't worry too much, both your work and your baby are important enough to make sure they are safe (and completed).  There are lots of ways to finish up and it sounds like pretty perfect timing really since you don't have too much to finish up before transitioning out of lab.  So exciting!",

My MSDS folder had a check for all the chemicals it was okay for pregnant lab members to work with. \n\nIf you want to wait, check yourself you might not be working with anything harmful. In that case, you can wait to say something. You'd be surprised at how many are okay and okayish (we wore hazard masks for okayish).\n\nThe facilities lab coordinator made us completely stop with the okayish ones so extractions during pregnancy just had to be done by other folks in the lab. Luckily our lab had PLENTY to do so it wasn't an issue. \n\nThis portion of your life if a snap shot. Your child is not. Check your MSDS, research what you're working with and I recommend NOT taking avoidable risks. Another poster was absolutely right. You don't have to fully disclose.",

      "text": "Have other people do the actual synthesizing parts or do without it. You can still do all the synthetic planning, help them troubleshoot purification, etc., but you shouldn't actually expose yourself to these chemicals. Very few chemicals have actually known reproductive effects, and some common ones are known to be bad (eg toluene). The risks just aren't worth it.\n\nThis is also a personal thing, but I would recommend telling them now and starting your precautions immediately. Depending on country/laws/university policy they may or may not be forced to actually allow you to not work in lab, but now is when your baby is most vulnerable to these kind of things. Plus, even if there's no policy forcing the professor to act, I can't think of a professor who wouldn't radically change plans because their mentee is expecting. This is one of the few things that academia is actually very good about work-life balance wise.\n\nAnd two potentially relevant articles.\n\nhttps://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i6/Chemists-Struggle-Infertility-Miscarriage.html\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2006/04/top-five-challenges-pregnant-scientists",

It wasn't my preference but I was working on fixing/troubleshooting an old peptide synthesizer at the time, and it used large quantities of dangerous chemicals in a not very well-ventilated area...I didn't want to risk it. They were a bit surprised (maybe because I'm a lesbian lol) but overall happy for me and I was taken off that duty right away. We scrapped the machine shortly thereafter anyway.\n\nFor the next go around (currently trying now), I want to wait until I'm further along to tell. But I work with only minimal amounts of anything dangerous and can easily avoid exposure with PPE. \n\nGood luck and congratulations! I know what it feels like to finally be pregnant after fertility struggles, so happy for you!",

You can tell others you need some help with some experiments before you are ready to let people know about the pregnancy.  When I was pregnant, I told my PI pretty early to set up those accomodations and reasons if I needed to leave for a doctor appointment.  Even though I do solely computer work, I had a good enough relationship with my PI to have those talks (I had to use the bathroom a lot).  I also trusted my PI wouldn't tell others before I was ready (other than his wife but she didn't interact with our lab a lot and could also keep the secret).  \n\nI also told my PI in case of a miscarriage.  I unfortunately did have one while in this lab.  My PI let me take some time off to grieve and heal from the miscarriage.  I'm not suggesting this will happen for you.  But when I got pregnant again, I again told my PI as soon as I knew (confirmed by doctor at 8 weeks) in case I needed to take time again.  The pregnancy was successful but I'm glad I at least told my PI.  The rest of my labmates were told after the first trimester when the risk of miscarriage is much lower (and I was further along than when I did have my miscarriage).",

Don't endanger yourself and your fetus and make sure to follow health and safety rules in order to protect yourself from \"law-breaking\" consequences (if you are not supposed to be there and break safety rules in a lab and end up endangering others it's not good either). Hiding it so far could create a bunch of problems if it's actually very bad for the fetus/ you (remember, pregnant women are like the canary in the mine) and kind of break trust if you have a good relationship if your supervisor ends up having to prove they didnt know and didnt force a pregnant woman to work under dangerous conditions...\n\n\\*If the supervisor is known to be problematic with pregnant women, you can register the conversation when you announce it, I know a prof at my uni told a phd student doing a lot of lab work she refused to work with her anymore (mid-phd...) because she told her she was pregnant and \"wanted the results faster\"... so having ways to protect yourself is important.",

      "text": "Of course, you are free to wait until any moment you feel comfortable to tell your PI. But the overall miscarriage risk is pretty low, and it doesn't drop off a cliff at week 10 or so: At 6 weeks, the risk is about 11%; at 7 weeks, 7%; by 8 weeks, it's a little less than 6%. It's more of a gradual decline before hitting a floor around week 11 or 12. I don't know what percentage risk is a comfortable place for you, but I think there's a perception that there's some magic to weeks 10-12 and the true story is more nuanced. (Data is from Emily Oster's excellent book *Expecting Better.*)\n\nI don't have children, but if I were you I'd go ahead and tell your PI if you are comfortable. It may take some time to find some arrangements that work for everyone and keep you safe.",

He immediately ordered a radiation badge that was monitored weekly and moved me away from tasks that could put me and fetus at risk. Other lab members were extremely supportive and did experiments or surgeries that I couldn't do. I did my fair share of data analysis, writing, and smaller experiments. \n\nWishing you success for your pregnancy :)",

They are a bit finicky when it comes to what type of filter, how many hours you can use the chemical filters for before having to throw it away and replacing them, and the cost as well. In general, if the procedure, risk assessment, and MSDS calls for it, your safety officer and safety will have to provide it. Then you have the problem of whether you wear prescription glasses and how you can make the glasses work with the PPE.\n\nIf it really matters to you but safety thinks the other controls are enough and you don't need gas respirators, then you might as well put the effort in and find out about them and how to use them.",

Basically anything to keep you out of the lab for plausible reasons. You could also use a white lie and tell them you're dealing with some health or \"private\" issues and need a break from lab work, although I personally would probably tell my PI the truth but use that white lie on nosy colleagues if needed. Basically, just telling them something is up without telling them what, so in worst case you don't have to disclose everything to everyone.    \nIf someone else needs to pick up your experiments, I'd probably also try to use either one. Either you'll stay away from the lab because you need vacation or time to write/think or you just feed them the minimum necessary information: you are dealing with something that keeps you from the lab.\n\nI understand that bringing it up now can backfire but I'd say the health of your child is more important now.   \nI'd rather deal with having to tell everyone that I can start working normally again than with the knowledge (or worse: the fear) that some solvent did any harm to the child.   \n\nI wish you the best!",

This is understandably an anxious time for you but a chemistry lab is not an unsafe place to be.
