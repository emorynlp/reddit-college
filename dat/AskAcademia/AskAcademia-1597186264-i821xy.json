  "text": "I\u2019m applying to law school in the fall. I asked a professor from undergrad to write a letter of recommendation. She said yes and then wrote:\n\n\u201cIt would be best if, when the time comes, you send me a draft of what you think needs to be covered on the basis of your interests, courses, and experience. I can\u2019t speak to any of that, only your work in my course.\u201d\n\nIs she asking me to give a brief explanation of my \u201cinterests, past courses, and experience\u201d. OR is she asking me to give her a list of attributes to \u201cjudge\u201d me on, like analytic skills, reasoning abilities, and so on? \n\nI just don\u2019t want to send her the wrong thing and lead her to believe that she made a mistake in agreeing to this when I can\u2019t follow simple directions.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your replies. I really appreciate it! I will not be writing my own letter of recommendation, but as a handful of you suggested, I will give my professor a list/explanation of the skills I improved on in her class and how I believe it will aid in my future success in law school.",

Delegating the task of writing a draft of a LOR to the recepient is common, but best done when they actually know what a LOR is supposed to look like. Few undergraduate students will have the experience to make this worthwhile. Certainly anyone applying for a junior faculty job should have a draft of their LOR pre-written before even asking their letter writers. If you are writing letters for someone like that, then yes, have them write drafts of their own.",

The process of doing this will make their application materials better since they will spend more time considering what they want and what they bring to the table. I particularly use this strategy for students who are planning for careers in which they might have to write LORs in the future - it's not something routinely taught as a course assignment. Often I read the draft and set it aside without using the student's writing at all.",

I think that's very difficult for a student to know.  Maybe a student helps me when I'm struggling at the board -- they might think nothing of it, but maybe I'm impressed.  A student falls asleep in class every morning, but I find out that it's because they're working two jobs and have to take the last train home every night; and they still get a B+.  A student manages to solve an accidental challenge problem, or happens to be especially good at some technique...  I think there are a lot of reasons why a student might not quite realize the things that make them special that a professor should be able to see.\n\nMaybe that's the stuff that goes into your last bit but it seems very difficult to write a recommendation letter without that stuff.

I just really want you to think a bit ahead, and help me to strategize.\n\nTwo examples:\n\n1) A student applies to a dental school. Later this same  student applies to a masters in public health. In one case, I need to praise their dexterity, and ability to do microdissections. In the other case, I need to write more about their programming skills. That's helpful!\n\n2) A student is good in areas A and B, and professor X (no magic powers, sadly) knows about both A and B, while professor Y knows only about A. In this case it makes sense to tell prof X: by the way, I have another person to describe A a little bit, but I have nobody else to write about B.

Presumably your other application materials paint a specific picture of you as a candidate and that you are using particular experiences, interests, and skills as evidence of your suitability for law school. I think that your recommender is asking for you to put some of this in writing so that she can write a letter that lays out a consistent narrative with your other application materials.\n\nSo, I would include information that is reinforces and complements your other application materials.",

That defeats the whole purpose of a letter.",

A lot of people have already commented that your prof is asking you to write a \"draft.\" Oftentimes these \"drafts\" aren't drafts but will be the letter a prof submits, maybe with a few additions. It's common practice, but HIGHLY unethical. \n\nDoes your prof understand what you have gained from each extracurricular activity you've done? No. Do they understand every skill you've developed during your education and life as a whole? No. Can they talk about how experiences you've had have helped you grow and mature? No. And that's not their job. Those are stories *you* get to tell in a personal statement. \n\nThe best thing you can do is provide a detailed CV for your prof to reference. Highlight projects you've worked on, group work you've managed, unusual skills you've gained and ask your prof to talk about how they see those skills in your interactions with them and how, based on their relevant expertise, those skills will serve you well in your future pursuits. You can provide details that are extra from what you include in your CV but you should not be writing a draft for them. \n\nI am honestly appalled at the people here saying this is an acceptable practice because it is *NOT* and should not be normalized.",
