  "title:": "Advice: Non-TT (great pay, great location, stability questionable), TT (relatively poor pay, meh location, stability high), PhD (zero pay, but my heart is happy, future is wide open)",
  "text": "Given the academic job market, I find myself in the somewhat enviable position of having options and could use a bit of objective insight.  \n\nA bit of background first: I am an artist and technologist (MS in Info Studies.) I have been teaching in creative technologies for \\~7 years (non-TT line.)  Worked in IT for 7yrs prior to that.  Administrative BS + COVID related budget constraints led to my post vanishing eighteen months back.  Rather than wait out the market (and be reminded that the lack of a terminal degree equates to effectively being a second-class citizen...), I pivoted towards formalizing my art practice and spent most of COVID working towards a Master of Fine Art (new media / digital.) Baring a complete face-plant, I will have said MFA shortly.  Being acutely aware that the Fall of 2022 is closer than it may appear, I've been  working in parallel toward either returning to a teaching post or continuing down the scholarly road and working toward a PhD.  \n\nAfter a flurry of apps,  the following options have more or less materialized:   \n\n\n* Position A: a two-year scholar in residence post in the 80-90k range.  The location is geographically fantastic, but at the old institution which let me go previously (trust is low.) The posting is housed in information sciences, and the course load is focused on teaching programming, HCI concepts, and the mutual impacts of technology on society.  I'm interested in these topics, but feel distanced from them as well.  I've asked and there is potential for the position to become a full-time instructor, 3yr contract, non-TT, after this appointment.  \n\n* Position B: a TT path in a digital arts + design program. Smaller school. Decent location (not bad, not great). Pay is in the 50-55k range, which is obviously much lower, but still very manageable (I'm a simple person, what can I say?)  The things that make this even worth consideration, especially in light of position \"A\", are that 1) being on a tenure line, there is stability here (which, after the past two+ years is \\*highly\\* desirable.)  And, 2) more importantly, this work is closer to where my interests lie - in digital media and arts.  I could grow something, long-term.  In a field that I feel in closer alignment too.   \n\n\nPath C:  In parallel to applying to positions, I've also been applying to PhD programs (practice-based intermedia and locative art, broad thematic focus on the desert southwest + place as sites of cultural and symbolic meaning.)  The more I research faculty - and clarify what my research trajectory would look like - the more excited I get.  I see this as a way to dive deep into a subject I've always wanted, while bringing my artistic, technological, and, now, personal/location-based interests in concert with one another. It's a staggeringly loud call.  Obviously, the pay is bad and I would be reentering the job market 4-6 years from now, but the person, scholar, and artist I could/would/should(?) be on the other side...that's a different kind of stability.  Stability of self.  Living within purpose.  \nI realize that others on this forum may be struggling on the academic job market and I apologize if my privileged indecision is seen as a lack of gratitude for what lays before me.  I promise you, I am grateful, but I'm also trying to suss out what makes the most sense not just in a career, but in life.   \n\nSo, I turn towards those outside my situation, those with some level of impartiality and ask: what would you do with this wonderful little mess?    \n\n\nTTIA for everything!",
