  "title:": "Finishing my PhD, considering MD. Best route?",
  "text": "I'm about 2 semesters from graduation (neuroscience). Looking into jobs and realizing MD is still something I think about. Originally thought being a PI was just as satisfying but I'm really not enjoying writing this much (grants, reviews, publications) and thought it was something I could learn to enjoy. I can see myself in an industry position but science policy is really the only other area I think I'd enjoy and I'm worried it's a lot of writing as well. \n\nMain hesitation is that my undergrad was in psych over 10 years ago, so I have no chem prerequisites. I know there's some universities without course requirements. And some MD 3 year accelerated programs. \n\nMain attraction to MD is being more patient facing, active physical job (I'm just doing data analysis on a PC most days), always interested in neurology case studies. I'm thinking of finding a doctor to shadow after the holidays.\n\nAnyone went this route? \nAny advice on prerequisite issue? \nAm I just having a midlife crisis?\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the responses. I know it would be a lot of work, and no, I don't enjoy being a degree collector. While I can get well paying jobs as a PhD in industry, I've yet to find something that I know I will enjoy as a long term career. Though selling my soul to consulting and making money to buy a house is always a consideration. I took 5+ years off between undergrad and grad school, still working in research labs, so a science career is something I've always enjoyed - not just avoiding reality with school. I would first shadow an MD before making any decision. I'm just weighing options right now, seeing if someone has advice of something I'm not aware of. It sounds like the comments suggest there's a huge wall to climb over, but the reward could be worth it - should I not find something with a PhD in the patient setting that I enjoy.",

Most med schools I know won\u2019t care about the chem prereq at this point. Instead of finding a 3 year med, I\u2019d recommend in your case finding somewhere that accelerates the preclinical years and gets you into clinic sooner (this is about half of all allopathic programs these days). \n\nAs a physician scientist I\u2019m biased but my own experience is that writing grants and reviews and papers is all way more tolerable when once a week you get to go into the clinic and talk to the people you\u2019re doing it all for. I know some physician scientists who have left for bench-only positions but me? If I could only do one, I\u2019d be a clinician. There\u2019s something deeply intrinsically rewarding about it. Med training is a long-ass road, but I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nGood luck!",

The basic science years are boring & MD programs are expensive (although there are many programs that forgive/pay 1 year of loans for 1-2 years of paid work).\n\nBest way to get the answer is to call some people in the 3 year program, professors,  admissions, and advising people.  If you end up needing undergrad science you can take it anywhere.\n\nBut - do you want to do any neuroscience?   Are you excited by the idea of patient-based research? You could continue to do research along with teaching and patient care if you become attending faculty at a teaching hospital.\n\nIf you'd rather work in industry, what industry and will the extra cost and time of an MD make enough difference in your career?  What I'm asking is, do any of these job choices excite you?",

Life is better if your work is somewhere you want to go.\n\nAcademic and nonprofit research is probably the lowest paid, least reliable career route for a scientist. Usually soft money.  It's not a great choice if you don't find it fun.  If you add an MD or BSN your salary becomes livable and your job reliable, plus good benefits, social life, & working with people.  You don't have to go the full MD.  You can be an advanced practice nurse or physician assistant.\n\nWith the PhD you can get a hard-salary job at the NIH which gives a decent salary, great benefits, career advancement, and very reliable employment.  You could have sex on your desk in  broad daylight and not be fired. \n\nScience policy was fun for me.  It includes lots of regulations, hierarchy, reading, report drafting, report editing, committee management, grantwriting, budget management, team management, constant deadlines . . . along with good salary, reliable employment, great benefits & career advancement.  You could give it a try.  The National Academies of Science is a nice place to work.\n\nOther possibilities include working for a journal, a field organization like the Society for Neuroscience or the Academy of YourspecialtyApplied, or a teaching college where you can expect a long term, hard salary career. \n\nA year isn't long to be looking around.  Think what will be most pleasant.  Apply for different jobs to get a feel for them.  Never take an interviewer at face value.",

While a year isn't that long now,  I feel like it's a lot of time to give up trying different careers just to end up going to med school even later in the game, in which case I may not even go through  and possibly regret it at the end. \n\n I'm mostly just trying to rule whether or not med school should be a factor after the holidays,  because if it is, I probably need to start at least getting the prereqs together.  And if I end up needing to take a year plus of classes before even applying, then I'll probably have a full-time position that utilizes my PhD.

      "text": "My biggest question is what your plan is after finishing a MD?  There are some things but it can also be a drag.  I'd suggest looking at companies that run clinical trials.  A PhD friend actually goes around to hospitals and makes sure they are following correct protocol as well as working with hospitals to get it to work for them or explain things.  It's more physical but still patient connection.  \n\nMy concern is what you've described is still rose colored.  Traditional MD is still tough with long hours, additional training after finishing MD (residency), and straining on any relationships.  Shadowing a MD is good.  But you really need to look at what you in want to do in 10 years. Another degree isn't always the answer.  I'd honestly suggest doing a bunch of informational interviews with lots of different industry people or alumni from your school that have your degree.  Many won't be traditional research jobs.  Lots of consultants which is fun.  There are a lot of options beyond just research that still allows for physical movement and challenges without a lot of the writing.",

They\u2019re dictated by a governing body. The year of gen chem, organic chemistry, physics, and biology really can\u2019t be avoided. You\u2019ll also need generally two semesters of pure mathematics. Some places are ok with stats as one of the semesters. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve had a semester of calculus at some point. \n\nEven accelerated programs are going to require the traditional premed reqs. Be careful and make sure you\u2019ve checked all your boxes formally. The applicant pool is quite large for a limited number of spots. One requirement out of place can get you rejected.\n\nNB: you should absolutely have at least 100 hours or so of physician shadowing. This is an unspoken requirement. Applications without it look quite strange. You\u2019ve obviously got research. Make sure you have also completed medically minded community service. Another unspoken requirement which essentially everyone does. Does this all seem stupid? Absolutely. If it\u2019s missing, can it fuck you over? Yes.",
