I have sought to understand more of the research material for the last couple of weeks and have gotten to know that the work we are doing is subpar applied research at best and our first author is adamant on getting it published even if it's on a sketchy journal. Both of the members are quite lazy and I don't 100% trust them. \n\nIf all my fears turn out to be true, will this affect my resume when I apply to grad school in the future?

          "text": "Congrats! :) I'm a second year grad student, so I may be of some help. Starting a project can be overwhelming. Since you're on a time crunch and your priority is to produce data, I would first assess:   \n\\- What is your big question and how you can break it down into smaller pieces?   \nI don't know your topic, but starting off with something like, \"How does X affect Y in \\[xxx\\] conditions?\" is just too big of a topic to study in a year. You should start off with some fundamental questions that can be addressed with the techniques you already know and the ones you're learning.\n\nSo, instead of, \"How does X affect Y in \\[xxx\\] conditions?\", you can start with, \"What are the properties of X? How does it express/behave in \\[xxx\\] conditions?\" \n\nThis is a really rough example, but it's just to jumpstart your project with some basic experiments...It's good to read a ton of papers on a specific topic, but I quickly learned that it's an easy rabbit hole to fall into and not every paper is going to be relevant to what you're trying to answer. \n\n\\- What techniques did you use in your last RA-ship that you can bring to this project? Techniques you learned before are ones that you're familiar with. Learning new tools and software can require a lot of troubleshooting before you can produce good results within a year. If they're relevant, you should consider using it. \n\n\\- Which new technique did you learn that can be incorporated into this project?   \nThere are a ton of applications you can learn in a lab, but not everything will be relevant to what you're studying. You might not have the time to learn about every one of them AND be good enough to produce results that can go into a paper.  \n\nFinally, just have fun. I personally don't think you HAVE to produce a ton of data as a RA to prove that you learned something. I think just understanding your project, knowing how to ask questions, and taking some technical risks here and there is pretty good. I would schedule regular meetings with your PI and prepare some ideas and questions to jumpstart this project in the initial weeks though. Also, don't be afraid to ask grad students and postdocs for advice! :)",

You don't need to be an amazing programmer, but picking up just enough Python or R to do social network analysis or basic data mining tasks could go a long way.",
