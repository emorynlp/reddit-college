  "text": "I hate being forced to have a supervisor who I have to obey. I want to be independent. I am a master's degree student. Still couldn't find a dissertation topic. My supervisor doesn't help, she just doesn't care, acts like someone who is nothing to do with academics. Like she does not know anything about any subject. \n\nNow its been months, I didn't contact her. Now I'm afraid she will be angry. I'm having nightmares about her. I hate being forced to have a \"master\" who I have to obey, I hate hierarchy. \nI wish there was a \"robot supervisor\" option, an AI which guides students, it would be amazing.\n\n\nedit:  Thank you for everyone who replied here, you are so kind and helpful. I post this topic without thinking and looking back twice, now I see I look like stupid here. I couldn't express myself correctly.  I am not competent for \"independent research\" I agree. All I was trying to  say was that \"I don't want human factor, I wish there was computer artificial intelligent supervisors which will HELP ME, I wouldn't have to worry about communicating, I don't feel submissive and the hierarchy\"  I said this because, I am having trouble about communicating my supervisor. I am anxious and afraid of her, it is all completely my fault, I am incompetent and I need help.",

      "text": "You can't complain about not wanting supervisors and complain that you can't find a dissertation topic and your supervisor doesn't help in the same paragraph. It sounds like you're basically working supervisor-free if she doesn't watch over your shoulder, you don't need to contact her all the time for her to get upset, she doesn't tell you what to do. If you want to work independently, just do it? You can update her but honestly it sounds like the problem is more about your mindset and your complaining about a supervisor you chose to do your master's degree with. If you want independence get to work on it and go ahead and show your supervisor you work well without supervision, prove that that works for you.",

          "text": "Yep I'm with you, deserveanupvote (also, I upvoted you!). If you're still searching for a topic, it just means you need help and not exactly independent as you make yourself out to be. There's independence and then, there's arrogance. Think about it OP.\n\nA supervisor is meant to guide and mentor you. They're meant to challenge you and push the envelope further. They're there to help you realise your potential but it's a two-way relationship. They're not mind-readers so help them help you. If you think you're not getting the support you need from your supervisor, then maybe it's time to look for someone new (but only if you have exhausted all options with your current one).",

You want to work independently but everything you've said so far indicates you aren't at a point yet where you are able to do that. You were given a project with quite a wide latitude, which you say you wanted, but you've done no work on it and you've avoided your supervisor. I don't know how you can even say it's a bad project when you haven't done any work on it. \n\nYou want to be an independent researcher, well the first step is taking ownership of yourself and getting in touch with her. \n\nFWIW no one works truly independently. Even when established academics work on their own without a team their work is still reviewed, peer-reviewed and critiqued in multiple different ways. Most academics collaborate at some point in their career as well.",

I am afraid of all academic staff actually. I respect them too much, this is why I can't say a word to them. \n\nAbout the topic she gave me, what is your suggestions? I mean it is a broad topic that you can do anyting. But shouldn't dissertation topic must be spesific like \"xxx analysis of xxx in xxx\"   If it were like that, I would start or at least try. But this time, I don't know where to start because it is too broad.\n\nbtw: why the downvote guys? I need help I am in trouble.",

You  could have:\n\n1) continued forward with your chosen topic, and tried to display semi-successful results as a way to support your original ideas.\n\n2) browsed the literature to find supporting evidence and broad application for your topic and use that as evidence it would be a worthwhile topic to explore\n\n3) developed an idea and experiment that bridges between what you want to study and what your PI would rather study, so as to have their support. \n\n4) worked closer with your PI to find a topic you both like \n\nYour choice was to do none of the above, play Skyrim and wait until the problem became worse and worse.

If you\u2019re at a point in your life where you cannot work effectively with others, you\u2019ll waste the opportunity.\n\nNone of us can help you find a dissertation topic. But typically, you pick a lab based on your interests aligning with that lab, and everyone has a limit. It hasn\u2019t occurred in my lab yet, but if someone proposed a topic way outside my expertise, my answer would be no or not without a co-adviser. Being told to pick something within the analysis of X range is very much how choosing a topic in your adviser\u2019s expertise goes. If you can\u2019t do that, I strongly advise you to take time off and work on yourself until you can.",

Students often propose ideas that would take 50 years to complete.\n* It isn't scientifically important or significant enough. That the student is interested In a topic and wants to learn more about it doesn't suffice.\n* The student doesn't have the skills/prior knowledge needed.\n* The topic is outside of the discipline.",

I need guide. I need help.  The reason I said it was that, I'm having trouble finding topic and communicating my human supervisor. And since I made terrible mistakes ignoring her, I am afraid now she would be mad. If it was a computer AI,  I wouldn't have these problems. Most of you guys here lashing me out telling me how incompetent I am. I know , if I wasn't, I wouldn't beg here for help.",

I think you might underestimate the complexity of the task, and what supervisors do.\n\nMaybe we don't need human researchers someday in the future, but that is science fiction-level possible.",
