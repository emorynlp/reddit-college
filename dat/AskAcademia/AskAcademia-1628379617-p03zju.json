              "text": "To add to the other answer: SOP is actually a good place to put an extra explanation like this, so they can get that question answered and not let it affect whether they decide to interview you. But space in the SOP is limited, so explaining your incomplete degree will not contribute well to the overall narrative of the SOP unless you also point out the ways in which it affected your current/future path (which is usually the overall SOP theme, in my fields anyway). To not tie it in like that makes that explanation a bit of a waste of space.",

It was a hard decision, since I had full tuition covered and the probability of getting full tuition covered in the next course was really low. I had to study for the entrance exam again and aim at the first place. Luckily I managed to achieve this. I tried to complete both courses simultaneously, but at some point it became really hard and then I had to give up on the one I didn\u2019t like.",

Generally, it's difficult to do that without distracting from the SOP's narrative, from a writing perspective. A good rule of thumb is to be vague and only give specific detail/reason for things that help build the message you're sending the reader. That way, those things are highlighted. \n\nIn this case, I would just say: *you switched to your new program when that opportunity came up* (notice this is vague, no details) *because you discovered you liked that topic better* (this is specific), *although you did leave the old program on good terms with a good academic record* (specific). I'm making some guesses here on the details, but hopefully you get the idea of how you might incorporate this into your SOP. The length of this example explanation is about the maximum I would recommend, too. You don't want to go on for more than ~1.5 sentences for something like this.",
