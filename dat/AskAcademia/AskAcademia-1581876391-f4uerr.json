  "title:": "How to pursue a PhD without feeling like (being) a massive financial burden to your SO?",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am very interested in pursuing a PhD, however I am really struggling to reconcile doing this with my situation. I have been with my SO for more than 6 years now, and we are still very young without much in the way of savings. He is completing a Master's degree soon and has no intent of pursuing a PhD, and will soon go on to make a lot of money. I want to be able to help support us and save for a family, but if I go for a PhD, I will essentially will make nothing until we have kids. I also don't want my SO to feel guilty about making so much more $ and feel like he has to support me financially either. I realize it sounds like there's a clear answer to this (don't get a PhD), but my heart is in doing research, and I'm sure I'm not the first person in this position. I just want to hear some other experiences. Thank you very much.",

It never felt like a burden to me, because I cared for her and it was something I valued.

And why do you believe that to be an investment in you and your family that your SO would not happily choose?\n\nIt definitely is a burden, the question is whether the OP and their SO are ok with making it work. Going into grad school, I knew it would take 5-7 years for me to finish, and during that time I wouldn\u2019t be contributing as much financially. We discussed this before hand but it was still hard actually getting through it. Talking about it and living it are totally different things. \n\nThere\u2019s also the opportunity cost of the time spent in school to consider. That\u2019s 5-7 years longer to wait to start a family, buy a house, pay into retirement, etc. There were weeks when I wasn\u2019t available to help with the chores, do the shopping and all the other things couples do together to keep a household running. I did the best I could but when I had major deadlines, I just wasn\u2019t as available as I should have been. \n\nThe OP also needs to discuss geography, you are asking your SO to potentially distance themselves from their friends and family, at a time when they be constantly busy and stressed. My wife is a saint for picking up the slack and honestly I think it will take many years for me to pay her back.",

My younger colleagues treated it more like university. They came in at 10am, spent half a day looking at Facebook and left at 3pm. They were much less productive for any day of \u201cwork\u201d and hence took longer in general to finish. \n- I had a lot more direction. I knew that I *really* wanted to do a PhD (see finances negatives...) and in what field. I came with some research ideas already thought through and I knew that I wanted to get it done quickly and well. My younger colleagues were aimless for much longer. \n- I had industrial level skills, in my case writing a lot of high performance code quickly and well. My  younger colleagues had very little experience with actually building large systems. The best they had done was some undergrad projects which is not nearly the same. \n- I had experience writing and reading documentation and making and giving presentations quickly. This was a great help when it came to competitions which are often ended up being about presentation skills (rather than the underlying research quality) \n\nSounds great \u2014 but what about the negatives? \n- finances - I took a huge pay cut to become a student again. I had to sell my car, downsize my appartement , pull back my expense etc. By contrast, my younger colleagues saw the PhD stipend as an upgrade from their undergrad life. \n- focus - my industry background made me too focused on solving problems \u201chere and now\u201d (as industry must do) and not thinking about 5,10,20 year out problems which academia thinks about. \n- theory - I had to work much harder than the recent grads to remember and recall the theory. I had spent so much time building stuff that the background didn\u2019t matter any  more. In academia it does.\n\nOverall, I think the positives outweigh the negatives, but the negatives all grow larger the longer you\u2019ve been out. So don\u2019t wait too long....",

I don't feel qualified to give advice on a lot of things but after 14 years and watching countless divorces (military couples divorce constantly and messily), I do feel qualified to talk about this...\n\nIt is easier said than done but you need to let go of the notion of marriage being \"equal.\" If you are pursuing a PhD, this will be a season of life where he supports your family financially more than you do. And here's the rub...you may never financially catch up. I don't know what fields you are in but you might spend money and time getting a PhD that never financially \"pays off.\" BUT, if it is something you want to do to be the person/teacher/researcher/whatever that makes you happy, it will be good for your relationship in the long run.\n\nA lifelong relationship should be a space that creates an environment where you can thrive and be the best version of yourself. That is not to say that it is without sacrifice or stuggle on occasion but that, on the whole, you are happier and more fulfilled together than apart.\n\nWhen I met my husband, we made the exact same amount of money (we did the same job in the military). I got out of the service and all of a sudden that balance was waaaayyy off. Then for a little while after I finished undergrad, we were again equal. Now? I am an unemployed PhD student/stay at home mom. In three years, I hope to have a PhD and he will retire and mostly stay home.\n\nEbb and flood, my friend. Marriage is a partnership but not necessarily a balanced scale. Settle in and focus on being a good partner, not a financial equal.\n\n\\*I am very happy but I do not, for a second, think getting married at 20 is a good idea. It worked out for me but it was insanely stupid. I joke often that, every once in a while, someone jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge, lives, and comes out with a new lease on life. That's awesome but honestly, therapy and medication would have been a better choice. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean most people don't turn to jello when they hit the water.",

So a single person might scrape by on a stipend but with an SO that's not true.\n\nI also agree with the other comment about projecting. These are valid concerns, but you need to talk to him before deciding to forgoe a PhD solely for financial reasons.",

I was able to get a lab tech job for $35k + benefits, but my wife struggled to find work. For the first 2 years she did a combination of side gigs and part time jobs (freelance design, T-shirt screen printing, retail) before landing a job at a local newspaper. During those years I took on more of the household bills and we split what we could. She got promoted to art director at the paper eventually and we were on fairly equal footing for a year. \n\nThen we moved cross country so I could start grad school, I took a 10k paycut while she landed a job making over 50k. For the 6 years I was in grad student (not even getting cost of living raises), she got several promotions and yearly raises. Not to mention my retirement savings are also significantly behind hers. As a postdoc I am making way less money than her, and still don\u2019t have any kind of retirement match (just what I can put away into an IRA). In fact she\u2019s making a good deal more than friends of mine that just started as associate professors.\n\nWe are now in our mid-30s and just now able to start thinking about buying a house. We\u2019ve also put off kids until now as well. I\u2019d say that part of being in a relationship is being ok with supporting your partner. It\u2019s rare for both people to have equal salary, equal time for upkeep, etc. \n\nYou should have a real conversation with your SO about this, and realize that it will set you back. In the long run I think getting a PhD was the right decision, I love what I do and shouldn\u2019t have an issue having steady work. Neither of us had major student debt, or else I wouldn\u2019t have done it. It wasn\u2019t easy and did cause some stress in our relationship, but we are both happy now.",

If you want a good academic job you need to go where the job is, and this can be very disruptive to the career of the \"trailing spouse.\" The job may well be in the middle of nowhere, hundreds of miles from friends and family. Otherwise more than likely reconcile yourself to crappy adjunct type jobs in the city you really want to be in.",

The next thing that'll happen is you'll get nine side gigs just to survive, which means you'll extend the time you're doing it and you won't be giving your attention to it. If you're doing those things, why bother doing it at all? This may sound rude, and I'm sorry for that, but I've just seen a good number of PhDs sidetracked because they think they can do all of it. \n\nThe trick, I found, was to get to a point where you couldn't move forward at all without the degree\u2014 a point at which the money aspect sort of fell away (yes, you'll live like shit for a few years). This isn't the \"love what you do and you'll never work\" bullshit, but rather the \"once you're willing to sacrifice comfort, go for it\" model.\n\nIt's late winter, so you're not applying anywhere now (in the US at least) until later in 2020, right?

      "text": "I think I can offer some advice based on my own personal experience! Let me start by saying I completely understand your \"financial burden idea\". I don't agree that you're viewing your relationship as transactional. I think you (like myself) may be viewing it in terms of you and your SO's overall financial standing. My SO (full time social worker/MSW candidate) and I (PhD candidate) and we both grew up in a low socioeconomic class. So we both heavily discussed how entering these degrees were going to take a major hit on our financial standing. In order to be honest with the situation, you and your SO should expect a financial setback, since I see in the comments you think it will impact purchase of a home and it DEFINITELY will. Many of my friends from college who just got jobs after BS degrees are already making 6 figures/close ( in California ), and heading towards senior statuses of their jobs, and one of my close friends already purchased their first home. Me and my SO are definitely not expecting to purchase property until probably 5-10 years later, because we simply don't have the income, and we're 100% okay with that for the time being. What you have to ask yourself and your SO is if you are both ready for the setback, the outlook of both your careers, and whether or not you are both comfortable with the possibility of being \"behind\" on socially-\"normed\"-adult-milestones. \n\nAlso, did you mean that you want you and your SO to support a family/buy a home during the program? Or after? This is a big Q too, but more so about your energy and time. Your research will practically be your baby for the first 1-2 years. If you plan to have a child during the program (which I've seen it done by another student), it would likely be planned for the latter of your program, but it would also be a time set-back on your degree, on top of financial.\n\nIn response to your guilt and financial support of one another, your family unit will of course depend on your SO financially. That's something you should be talk about and expect. Some practical advice for during your program: currently, me and my SO are doing financially decent and able to put away a great chunk of savings every year, despite living in an expensive city (NYC). This due to well planned budgeting, cooking 75% of all meals, and accepting limited attendance at social events.\n\nAlso, I saw the program you're interested in, and most likely you will find a funded a program and get 30-35k in stipend a year, which is pretty good considering minimum wage in some stages is 30k a year (15/hr). \n\nAlso, consider how certain you are about enjoying research. Maybe you can try finding a funded Masters program to give it a shot first? That's what I did, because I wasn't sure if I was ready for a commitment of a PhD. Is it possible you will find other interests during a Masters program? Just things to think about.",

      "text": "Are you willing to share your field? In many fields, a PhD is funded, and while the money isn't much (in my field a PhD stipend is only about $30k per year in the US) it's certainly enough to contribute meaningfully to shared household expenses. \n\nIn my field, a PhD is a research degree that offers some opportunity outside of academia, mostly in government. Nonetheless, it is definitely not a moneymaking degree, and those who succeed are typically people who can write successful grant applications. If a PhD is your dream and you are driven by your passion for it, you shouldn't be discouraged, IMO. Every friend I know who went on to a PhD is in a stable, secure job making good money... just not always in a traditional tenure-track position. \n\nI have no idea how helpful my rambling is, there. But I'm wishing you good luck!",
