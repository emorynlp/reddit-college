  "text": "I had a really wonderful professor a few semesters ago that really changed my perspective about life. In private she taught us so many life lessons and I\u2019m so grateful to have had her as my professor. I miss her. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if it is mutual.\n\nEdit: did not expect this post to blow up, it\u2019s been lovely to hear your thoughts and personal experiences. Thank you so much!",

      "text": "I think it's less so. An individual professor or 2 can make a real difference in the life of a student as they help the student learn, change perspectives, and maybe make a life-changing decision. It happened in my life and here I am 48 years later, with a career that I can really trace to an individual professor (who remains my friend) for helping me determine. It's very powerful stuff as a student.\n\nFor a professor, this is what we do and I think many of us hear about life-changing classes and experiences on a regular, but uncommon basis. But, we're not typically intimately involved in those thought processes and decisions. I think that when we hear about them, we're gratified. And we do often hear about individual successes from individual students. Heck, I hired a TT faculty member who had taken my Intro Psych class years before who became a psychologist, he said, because of me! But, the students who I think of fondly I don't miss. I am much more interested in their successes as they move on to bigger and better things!",

However, they do remember certain moments or perhaps certain parts of their classes where they know they've made a big impact on those students. Even more so it's the relationships and mentorships they build with some of their students, the ones who engage in the class, who clearly want to learn the material as much as the professor wants to teach it, or even simply just keeping in touch after graduation. I have two professors of mine from my undergrad whom I keep in semi-regular contact with and even 8 years later they still remember me (even if they don't remember all the details). One of whom even has helped me out a lot in my grad school applications with offering feedback and letters of recommendation. \n\nThe professors have a lot more students than the students have for teachers, so not every student will be remembered, but the professors do remember the students that put in that extra effort to be active and engaged in the class.",

I'm also in touch with a great many going back over the last two decades and it's wonderful to watch them grow in careers and into their adult lives.  We develop close mentoring relationships with a subset of students and I almost always miss those when they leave-- though by the same token it's exciting to see them head out on their own.\n\nRelationships differ between types of school as well. I'm at a liberal arts college where faculty lead all the study abroad programs and we do a lot of field work as well. I've been abroad with students, led them on domestic trips, taken them on extended camping trips, etc. etc. The students I've spent time with in those contexts I often especially miss because I get to know them on a deeper level. That's different from just teaching hundreds of anonymous people in huge lectures, which I did at my previous institution (though I made connections with some of them as well and missed them after they left).",

He missed one of my fall classes due to other commitments, but it was something he would eventually have to take (I teach CC, so he would have just taken it at 4y), so I agreed to teach it to him alone.  We finished the normal semester's material by spring break, and I was so looking forward to teaching him brand new, more advanced topics in the second half when we just didn't come back from spring break at all.  I gave him materials to work on, like I did with the rest of my classes, but it was not the same energy as our in-person class.  I would very much like to have spent another semester with him.",

It's also a fun part of the \"ice-breaking\" exercise. Every once in awhile I end up opening up an old photo from a class a few years back, and it's a fun little trip. Some of the students I can't remember at all, because I teach so many and they just didn't distinguish themselves that much from the others. But others I think, \"oh, yeah, they were great, I wonder what they're up to?\" It's nice, though it also reminds me how quickly the old classes fade from my mind once I am half-a-semester into a new class (I recently looked at the last pre-pandemic class photos I took, and it feels like it was a million years ago).\n\nThe students I have been a thesis advisor to, I frequently am in touch with after graduation, because I got to know them a lot better than most of the others. Some of them I consider to be friends at this point. \n\nI don't \"miss\" students, though; that sort of implies a longing, and there isn't any of that. But I do like staying in touch with them, and I love it when a former student e-mails me to tell me what they're been up to.",

However, that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t be excited if one stopped by my office or emailed me to catch up. \n\nI did have a class one year that was suppose to go on for two semesters (first year English stretched out over Fall and Spring). I loved one of my classes. We all just jived really well. Before Spring began, the school I was working for was having major enrollment issues. A lot of instructors were not getting the classes they needed in order to pay the bills. I had been splitting my time between this school and another and had planned on this being my last semester anyway before moving to work solely at the other school. So I told the department head to give my second semester classes to someone else (luckily to an instructor I knew and trusted). \nI felt good about my decision, but oh boy did I miss that class once Spring semester started. They invited me to stop by on the last day of the semester. I did, and it was such a joy to see them all again.",

Those 4 students are why I don't quit when I'm exhausted and discouraged myself. So I do miss those students and am always so pleased when they send me a follow-up email to let me know how they are doing! \ud83e\udd17",
