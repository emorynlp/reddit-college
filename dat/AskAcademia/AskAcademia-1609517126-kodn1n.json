  "text": "Sorry for this rant post, but I can't possibly the only one who can't get any work done from home. I feel like the only way anything is going to get done is if I start waking up at 4am, but I normally don't go to sleep until 1AM or later, so I'm not going to be in a good mood. I can rarely get work done in the evenings, because I'm just exhausted.",

      "text": "Here are some tips, from someone who worked from home pre-pandemic and now works and does a PhD from home:\n\n1. Take time to figure out your productivity windows and then schedule your day around that. It make take a few weeks, but as you go through the day take note of when you\u2019re tired, when you\u2019ve got physical energy, and when you\u2019ve got mental energy. Do all your most demanding work when you\u2019re high on mental energy, and save administrative and less intense tasks for when you hit a slump. When you have physical energy, get up and move! It helps you keep focus throughout the day.\n\n2. DON\u2019T push yourself to work at the times you know you won\u2019t be productive. Can\u2019t work in the evening? Don\u2019t! Wake up earlier or take shorter breaks throughout the day instead. Save easy tasks, household chores, and activities to wind down for those times.\n\n3. If you\u2019re not getting anything done and can\u2019t figure out why, track how your time is spent for a day or two. Then look at where your time went and, importantly, what you accomplished for that time. Spending an hour re-reading the same  couple pages because you can\u2019t focus is not the same as spending an hour clearing out your inbox\u2014mail cleanup is actually achieving something. \n\n4. Create a routine and stick to it for a week. Get up at the same time, have a rough idea what you\u2019re going to work on/do/eat but leave flexibility for things that may pop up. Also actively plan how you\u2019ll gear up for the day and relax for the night. At the end of the week\u2014was it too much structure? Not enough? What worked and what didn\u2019t?\n\n5. Reassess your environment. What things about your home office make it hard for you to work? Bad lighting, uncomfortable seating, other people? On the flip side, what things about your pre-pandemic atmosphere made you more productive? Try to replicate what you can.",

It\u2019s absolutely chaotic. I was a contract legal researcher for a law firm, so I had more flexibility in my work schedule, but on the days when no one napped or kids were sick, I was only able to work on projects after bedtime and weekends when my husband was home. \n\nEven now, as my youngest is 8, I work from home, it\u2019s very, very difficult. My husband\u2019s in upper administration in the university, so he\u2019s in meetings all day. I have to teach tech workshops and do consultations with grad students and faculty throughout the day via zoom, while supervising 3 older kids at home. I sit in the kitchen so I can keep an eye on the living room, dining room, snacks in the pantry, and make meals usually while on a meeting. I can do this because the kids are older, but it\u2019s still exhausting. \n\nParents of babies, toddlers, small children, we see you.

We tried to find a 2-bedroom that would suit our needs and fit within our budget, but rent has gotten very expensive in our city in the last 2 years, and hasn\u2019t gone down since the start of the pandemic. So our only viable solution was to keep our current flat and move my desk to our bedroom. Which is all well in theory, but I can only access my desk after ~10am on weekdays and ~noon on weekends because my boyfriend sleeps in the morning and goes to bed at 1-2-3am. As a morning person, my productivity has tanked significantly since this change.",

      "text": "I told a fellow PhD student that \"I can't write my thesis at home. I need a separation of work and home\", in January. Since 2020 screws with us all, I had the delight of writing my thesis until June from home. Luckily all I had left was data processing, analysis, and writing up. My sleep schedule are shot to hell. My spouse still works in an essential job I would wake up, make our breakfast, eat it, then I sleep again until 10, which then I start working until lunch, then continue until I have to make dinner. After dinner, I continue working until like 1-2 am. I'm a night owl if there's no separation. I managed to finish it anyway. We still haven't had children yet, which makes it a bit easier (though where we are, childcare centres didn't close and we actually weren't hit badly \\[Australia\\]).\n\nI recently found that I can't work much with a laptop anymore (work from home setup). Laptop monitors are too small and they give me neck pain. I need comfortable monitors and an office.",

I regularly get about 75% of my work for the day done in the first 2 hours, partly because this is my more productive time and also because I try to start at 8 which gives me a clear window before other people start bugging me.\n\nTake breaks. Keep a to-do list. Break your list down to super manageable tasks. Seriously, break every single task down to little bits you can do in 15-20 minutes. If Pomodoros work for you, do those.",

I tend to go down a slippery slope... If one day is unproductive and boring just staring at the screen or procrastinating, the next day I feel sad and am likely to do worse, and so on. So if I feel a day is starting to get away from me I have a couple of serious tries at some other technique to focus or a different bit of work, and if I'm still not getting into it I just walk away. Spend the day cleaning, cooking, do some exercise. Do something that will make starting work tomorrow easier. But forcing myself to stay there and do nothing just doesn't help me.\n\nBasically you need to find what works for you, read lots of advice but be prepared to ignore half of it, and know when to give yourself some slack.",
