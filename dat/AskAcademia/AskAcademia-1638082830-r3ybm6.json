  "title:": "Adjunct / Sessional Employment Reference",
  "text": "I'm currently teaching a course as a sessional (adjunct) and want to apply to teach another courses at a different institution. The application requires employment reference, and I don't know if I should ask a full-time faculty member who I report to or the director of the program. I don't want it to look like I'm trying to switch institution, so I'm kind of in a dilemma. Is it common for sessional (adjunct) faculty members to ask for a recommendation / reference?\n\nIt's a little weird because I started during COVID where everything was remote and I didn't have a lot of interaction with the director or my reporting faculty member. I don't want to jeopardize my position and sound like I'm thinking of changing institution.",
