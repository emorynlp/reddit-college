  "text": "I'm not really sure what I'm feeling right now, I'm not sure what to do, I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post, but I decided to go with it. Please pardon me for doing so.\n\nI'm from Global South taking PhD in a prestigious university in my field. I'm not the most outstanding student around, but this PhD is literally my dream. I've achieved high marks in addition to doing research at my uni and other institutions concurrently. I'm quite proud of it.\n\nApparently this costs my relationship. My girlfriend of 2.5 years broke up with me.\n\nShe felt that the relationship was never my priorities, second or third to academics. I realize I have been super focused on academics, but she was the person I have ever I invested the most in my life, after my parents. I opened up to her about things I never have to anyone. She had been with me since the start of the PhD. She was with me when I had to go through hardest times, when family members passed away during covid.\n\nUntil 2 months ago. She left me and apparently she is already with another guy now. That really hurts me. As if the 2.5 years is meaningless. My heart aches. My grades and acceptance letter feels worthless. Every morning I kept thinking what should've been. I can't shake the feeling of being guilty for focusing on my academic pursuit. Maybe this sounds pathetic. But it's just very difficult for me. \n\nI should be talking to my supervisor about my progress but there's literally no progress at all and I feel like I'm really shitty and unprofessional if I bring up this matter with my supervisor. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to discuss personal stuff like this. \n\nHas anyone went through something like this? Am I being unprofessional? What should I do?",

      "text": "My marriage blew up during my PhD. And it took about 3 years of ups and downs before I finally decided to get out of the relationship. It definitely impacted my work a lot, but in the end I was okay. I made it through and graduated.\n\nYou're probably going to be a little worse off because of this, but that's okay. Life happens. All you can do is make the best of it. Keep trying to get back on your feet, but don't beat yourself up too much if you find that difficult.\n\nOne big thing: if at all possible, this is the time to see a therapist. A lot of universities have mental health services which can make it affordable or even free. I made liberal use of that, and it helped a lot.\n\nI think it's pretty clear from the words you're using -- like \"meaningless\" and \"worthless\" -- that your perspective is distorted by grief right now. And that's totally normal when you're going through something difficult! But a therapist can help you work through those feelings, and maybe get back to a more balanced point of view.",

      "text": "I discovered my partner was cheating on me toward the end of my PhD. We broke up and it took me months to get over the pain. This of course delayed my defense by some months, as well as my thesis and papers writing. I got everything done anyway eventually and a great job opportunity came up right after I defended. If I defended earlier maybe I would have missed it. Life is unpredictable.\n\nHang in there. We are humans and we are much more than our PhD. And sometimes we need to give ourselves time to heal from hurtful personal life situation. PIs know that as well. It will get better soon!",

      "text": "No, it is not unprofessional. You are a human with emotions doing a creative type of work. When you are not in piece with yourself, it becomes hard to create. It will take some time to heal, but everything will be ok. \n\nThere is definitely one thing that you should never do on this situation: suck it up and not talk to anyone about the issue. If you feel uncomfortable talking to your advisor, as already suggested, find out about counseling/psychological aid at your Uni. They are there exactly for people in situations like yours, and they have real experience in helping. I personally know many people who used this kind of service at the campus, and it does seem to have helped them.",

      "text": "My breakup occured during the second year of my PhD. Many compounding factors led to crippling depression and anxiety. You are not alone. What helped me, and I recognize this is not for everyone, was telling my advisor that I was going through a difficult time to readjust his expectations. I had a plan for my mental health moving forward which included seeing a therapist and a low dosage of antidepressants (that continued up until the last year of my program), which gave him confidence that the lack of productivity was temporary, that I was committed to bettering myself, and our professional relationship was better for it. \n\nYou are in a doctoral program for so long it is impossible to expect someone to not go through ups and downs. If you are passionate and committed, I bet you are far from the worst student your advisor has ever worked with!",

      "text": "Not doing work for 2 months is unprofessional, but in this case that's completely expected. If you were professional literally 100% of the time and worked at a normal pace through this life event, people would think you're robotic and would have trouble relating to you. No one actually wants their colleagues and collaborators to be professional 100% of the time, they want them to be human and relatable and just consistently professional when needed.\n\nLet your supervisor know what's going on. You probably won't have to say much, like he won't need to know the details of what she said or why. A long-term relationship ended and that's a big deal.\n\nTalk to a therapist so they can help you direct your thoughts in a healthy direction. Spending lots of time on unhealthy thought patterns is like wearing ruts into a dirt road -- it will be hard to avoid those thoughts in the future, because they'll be familiar patterns. I've seen this happen with friends, where they get stuck dwelling on the same unhappy thought loops for *years* and it gets in the way of them enjoying life freely. A good therapist will help you grieve and gently guide you toward healthy mindsets in an appropriate timeframe (not too fast, not too slow).",

That might involve them kicking back for a while, or us working on a series of attainable objectives that we follow up on regularly.\n\nFor me, it is better to know there is a problem, or a problem brewing so we can get ahead of it as soon as possible.  Despite lots of posts to the contrary, we want students to graduate, we want them to pass.  The self centered part of it is I do not want a black mark (non-graduating student) on my record.  I have an interest (besides common humanity) in you getting through this.",
