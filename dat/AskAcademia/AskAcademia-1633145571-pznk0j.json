  "text": "About two months ago, I submitted an abstract to an international conference they said would be held in December, with decisions communicated on September 30th. This conference has been deferred to spring 2022 due to restrictions on travel. However, they have not released decisions on abstracts when they said they would, with no updates as to when they will. Would it be unprofessional to ask them to review my abstract and provide a decision now, especially given that an acceptance would be a significant boost to my CV for upcoming applications?",

If you haven\u2019t heard back 2 weeks after Sept 30 a polite email is acceptable. Sincerely, someone who is also organizing an international conference during a pandemic while still keeping up with the normal workload. It is tough.",
