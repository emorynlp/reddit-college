  "text": "Not sure if this is NSFW because it doesn't go into details, but there's swearing and sexual comments in here.\n\nThis requires a lot of background, but the first things you should know are:\n\n\\- I no longer work in the same place where I was stalked and neither does the stalker\n\n\\- He is a popular, charming, funny and universally loved researcher and I am a quiet, socially awkward person who was classed as admin staff\n\n\\- He always either harassed me when we were alone together, out of earshot of others, or in a subtle way so others would assume he was joking. e.g. make nasty comments about my weight in private, then 'joking' in public that of course I would want some chocolate during coffee break.\n\n\\- He tried to extract information from my husband about where we will go (which country and city, what workplace) so that he can apply at the same place 'and we can all be together' (his own words).\n\nWhen the harassment began at my workplace, there was no committee or organisation I could go to to file a complaint. In addition, since the stalker was so popular and careful to harass me out of sight of others, I was afraid it would be a case of my word against his and his extroverted, fun-loving nature might win everyone over to his side. In the past I have experienced this. Due to fear of it happening again, I played along in public and was friendly because I was scared of the reaction if I didn't.\n\nHe eventually left, but continued to maintain and build new connections at my workplace. Since then a body to which employees could report harassment was established and I reported his past behaviour to hopefully ensure the safety of others if he might return.\n\nSome actions were taken internally, but afaik he continues to be successful, respected and well-liked among peers.\n\nHere are some specific incidents:\n\n\\- Frequently asked me to work on jobs that had nothing to do with our current workplace. Due to the hierarchy between us, I felt obligated to do them. He continued to try to get me to do work for him even when he was no longer employed at the same place.\n\n\\- Would compliment my outfit at normal volume, but ogle me and then whisper something lewd only I could hear. Before I could respond, he'd throw up his hands and say, 'Not to be sexist, or anything!' at normal volume.\n\n\\- Wonder out loud about my sex life in front of others, then quickly change topic and talk at length before anyone replied.\n\n\\- Our workplace was spread across several buildings and I had a bi-weekly meeting in one particular building. After discovering my schedule, he made sure to stand at the end of a path I had to take on my way to this meeting. He was always there and he would stare at me with a smirk the entire time.\n\n\\- Talk about his list of 'women to fuck' and always mention he had not yet fucked a woman of my mixed race background.\n\n\\- Made sexist jokes in front of others that everyone always laughed at, but he would stare and smirk straight at me every time.\n\n\\- Invited me to lunch under the guise of thanking me (before creepy comments started) for a task I did. Then spoke about women at another table, said 'That's the real reason I asked you to lunch; you're hot and that increases my value and makes me look less threatening to other women.'\n\n\\- Frequently describe women as 'stupid idiots' that can 'easily be manipulated into having sex and doing anything you want'. Afterwards he would always make direct eye contact with me and smile.\n\n\\- He befriended my husband and very quickly declared him his 'best friend'.\n\n\\- Told my husband stories of how he has psychologically manipulated women into giving him sexual favours.\n\n\\- Frequently told stories we never asked to hear about sexual encounters he supposedly had.\n\n\\- He discovered I went home on the same train line as him, so he changed his work schedule to match mine (he used to come in and leave late) and started regularly trying to catch the same train with me.\n\n\\- He gradually pushed to have lunch together with me, my husband and our friends during the week and to spend the weekends together. This got worse and worse until he was trying to have lunch and dinner with us every single day of the week, AND spend every weekend together.\n\n\\- If I did not satisfy his curiosity about something, he would bring it up repeatedly, ask lots of questions about it and sit and stare at me in silence for long periods of time until I felt pressured to share information I did not want to.\n\n\\- He never accepted the word 'No' when we (my husband and I) did not want to spend time with him. We actively tried to avoid him by going home early without telling anyone, but he would appear out of nowhere and ask, 'What are we doing? Where are we going?'\n\n\\- Tried to push us to accept a gift of a book written by some guy who speaks of the benefits of being able to have sex with anyone, regardless of their relationship status. He specifically mentioned being able to have sex with a woman who is already married.\n\n\\- Started pushing us to invite him to our home. My husband frequently has business trips abroad and I was afraid this stalker would turn up uninvited while he was away, so I never agreed to this.\n\n\\- When we were unavailable, blew up our phones with lots of paranoid and insecure messages.\n\n\\- He made lots of comments to me such as 'Have you gained weight?' 'Are you going grey?' 'What's wrong with your face?' 'What did you do to your hair?' (and turning to pull a face at me which nobody else will see). 'Yeah, you're already X years old, it's all downhill from here for a woman.' 'Why aren't you wearing higher heels?' 'Anyone ever told you your smile looks fake? Makes me wonder if your whole personality is fake too.'\n\n\\- Insulted and embarrassed me any time I tried to leave a get-together and my husband chose to leave too. He would look at me and say, 'Oh, you're one of those strict wives who never let their husbands enjoy anything in life, huh?'\n\n\\- Before he left, he made sure to let me know several times that he hates those 'stupid feminists/psycho bitches who feel you're harassing them but never tell you to your face', then staring straight at me in silence. (Note I had not reported him at this point and was still playing friendly.)\n\n\\----------\n\nI am currently looking for work in another country and the stalker found my professional profile (and my husband's) online. My husband may start a new job soon and news of this (and the location) has already travelled to my old workplace, where the stalker has a huge number of personal and professional connections. What action can I take to ensure he doesn't randomly turn up or apply for a job exactly where we would be? What can I do if he starts to spread rumours about me and my conduct (or my husband's) as retaliation for blocking him and refusing contact?\n\nEDIT - I think I made this a bit confusing because I don't want to mention specific countries, but hopefully this makes it clearer. \n\nAll of us were working in country A when the harassment happened. Stalker then left the workplace and moved to another country. I knew the stalker was maintaining connections with researchers, but when I heard he was building new connections with others who just arrived and there were rumours he was going to be re-employed, I reported him. I had zero evidence because it is illegal in country A to record anyone without consent and I had since blocked him on a messaging app (deletes conversations as well).\n\nSome time later, my husband and I moved to country B and there is a job offer in country C. My old colleagues caught wind of the news of what's happening in country C, so stalker may already know and try to go there or apply there. We are friends with the person who will become the director, so all I can think of is informing him of the situation. However, there is no evidence apart from my statements and what others may remember of the stalker's behaviour in public.",

Depending on your state or country, you can look into filing a restraining order, and if the stalker is harassing you online you could look into reporting him for harrassment to police. However unless he is trespassing or threatening you, I'm not sure if law enforcement can do much to help outside of a restraining order",

Block him from all online accounts and on phone.\n2. I would suggest talking to your most trusted family and friends. Then can provide strong emotional support and sometimes legal support.\n3. Collect all the evidence of harassment. Phone calls, messages, emails, witnesses, and anything that links to him and file complaint in a local police station.\n4. Somehow, if he is still harassing you after complaining to the police, update the police with evidence such as phone recording, phone logs. If he is talking to you in-person then try to record the conversion.\n5. If the police complaint didn't help, file a restraining order in the local court.\n6. If you believe that the above process is not enough, you can file a civil lawsuit.  For that, you have to hire an attorney specialized in harassment cases and submit the evidence.\n\nGuys like that should be punished and we are here to support you as much as we can.",

If he did that in public, other people will be able to put two and two together, and people like feeling like they're in on a scandalous secret.  \n\nEven if they don't tell, it's likely that they'll be lukewarm to him when it comes up, and that he'll find it significantly harder to pull the shame shit.  \n\nMake sure that you're careful to frame yourself as the victim /someone to be saved (correctly, because you are!).  Don't lay it all out at once.  \n\n\"Oh... I'd rather not go to XYZ event if he's there... he just makes me kind of uncomfortable... once he XYZ'd.  I don't know, I really want to go it's just that he keeps seeking me out and making these comments... I don't want to make a big fuss.  I tried reporting it because of XYZ but nothing really happened and I don't want to make a huge issue in the department...\" \n\nYou want them to talk themselves into outrage as a response to what you tell them.  You are not trying to talk them into outrage yourself, because people really don't like that.   \n\nTrash his reputation as much as you can, while looking like you aren't trying to trash it and are just trying to keep the peace.  People will try to champion for meek victims in a way that they won't for an angry women. \n\nIt's not a nice game, but if I were playing office politics that's how I'd do it.",

      "text": "This is really unfortunate. Depending on your location, it is handled differently, unfortunately. \n\nIf you could go back in time, then making a complaint when you knew you were leaving anyway would have at least lodged a formal, written complaint against him. Then, in the future, you could raise (when appropriate) that this staff member had at least one formal complaint lodged and indicate that this would be an issue with him moving institutions. \n\nOf course, for the above to happen you would have to know that he was applying to your institution and somehow be able to take aside the panel members and have the conversation - which is unlikely. \n\nIf he moves, then you should make your HR/management aware that there were previous issues with his behaviour toward you and anyone else you witness at his previous place of employment. You can indicate your preference for your work to not overlap or to keep your distance from this staff member. Hopefully, that would happen. \n\nIf it doesn't, then you would keep a written record of every incident which occurs in your new workplace. Ensure that with every incident you turn to him and say \"Your behaviour is making me uncomfortable, please stop.\" It is really important you say those words.\n\nThen after the incident, send him an email (don't copy anyone else in) saying \"Hello X, In regards to the incident yesterday where you pulled me aside to tell me how sexy I looked in my green suit, I would appreciate if you no longer commented on my appearance. It made me feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nIf you have a record fo you telling him this and his persistent behaviour it demonstrates a pattern and that is something a University can act on if they are so inclined. And the \"so inclined\" thing is the big problem. Because if he is some superstar and they are not so inclined, then it is likely nothing will happen. \n\nASs a side note, I would be certain that you aren't the only person this happens to and that everyone in his network knows he's a creeper. They just put up with it. Academia is rife with all kinds of inappropriate behaviour. The privilege, hierarchy, and cult of personality foster it. Even the best-intentioned HR person cannot fight against an entrenched culture of preference. \n\nSo as a last resort, unfortunately, you might have to deal with it, stare him straight in the eye and (within the code of conduct) tell him something that makes him wither and keep his distance. What that might be is up to you.",
