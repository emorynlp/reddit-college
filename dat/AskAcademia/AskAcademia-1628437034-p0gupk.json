  "title:": "Curse of the video-meeting - how to set limits? (Asst Prof)",
  "text": "In 2020, the new-found ability to meet digitally was a much-needed lifeline.\n\nHow, it seems the pendulum has swung to the opposite extreme. I find that nearly everyone wants to set up a virtual meeting- to the point where this has become an impediment to getting actual work done. This week, I had interactions with 3+ parties all of whom wanted to set up times for a zoom meeting to do what could have been handled over email: 1) a tissue database I contacted wants to meet on-line, rather than just tell me if they can make available the tissues I need, 2) an equipment sales team wants to meet to discuss what we need to do with their equipment in our lab, 3) the electricians in my department wanted to set up a meeting to discuss electrical outlets, when I told them I needed a schematic of where the unused emergency outlets were on our floor.  On at least one occasion, the response I got after telling them that I didn't have time for a meeting was \"No problem, let us know when you DO have time, and we'll schedule it for then.\"\n\nSeeking advice on strategies for setting boundaries for time-wasting virtual meetings.\n\nHow can I make it clear to people without being rude?  Considering putting a line about this into my email signature.\n\nWhat criteria could I use to objectively determine when a virtual meeting is worth-while?",

      "text": "Im suspicious that the sales people are hoping to talk you into more sales. But to be fair, sales people are very much people-people and thrive on f2f so may well believe you do as well. With them Id say, \"I prefer to reduce my zoom fatigue and handle this via email. \n\nId say something similar to the tissue people but add, \"unless there is some issue that needs further discussion.\" They are likely to be relieved but maybe believe offering a meeting is polite and bond forming. Do you need to bind with them?\n\nFor the electrical people Id meet if that is what they want. In general I find it is important to establish good rapport with building people as such things often are more complex than they appear and because they can screw you up if they arent happy with you. I would ask for the floor plan before the meeting though \"so you can be prepared\".\n\nI guess my criteria is what is needed to get the job done now and into the future. Professors are very used to working alone and thinking through all the issues themselves but university staff have more collaborative jobs that require building good relationships with a wide variety of people. They are competitve with one another and have a delicate network of alliances to maintain (speaking generally and based on 20 years of directly working with U staff).\n\nMeetings help to keep the balance. Plus they have no doubt encountered short tempered bullying faculty  (I say this with affection for my tribe but awareness of our weaknesses) who made their life miserable. A meeting helps them get a feel for what kind of person you are. You want that to go well because staff talk and will spread the news. \n\nYour treatment from here on will flow from this. If you are nice and helpful then you can get the odd thing taken care of as a personal favor.\n\nAlso, I have found that building things are rarely as simple as they appear on the surface..fire codes, neighboring needs, etc. all take consideration. Sometimes it defies our commin sense but we dont have the same problem set they do.\n\nTldr: Is a long term relationship part of the deal? Are there potential complicating factors you couldnt know about? Is there an emotional or political need to be fulfilled by a meeting?",

          "text": "/u/AliasNefertiti has a great response, but I wanted to draw attention to this helpful reply, too. Zoom fatigue is a real problem, but phone calls don't cause the same kind of exhaustion. (And I say this as someone who wasn't a huge fan of calls before COVID.) Phone calls have less faulty and/or extraneous sensory data than Zoom calls, but they also have more helpful sensory data than email/text and allow for quick, spontaneous clarifications, questions, addendums, etc.\n\nEven if it turns out you're going to have all of these conversations, make sure they're over the phone. Some people may be *relieved* when you offer that option. It's easy for people to forget that the more complex technological option isn't necessarily the most effective one. You can do it while relaxing on your couch with some tea/wine or while taking a nice walk or while wiping down your counters. The possibilities are endless.",

      "text": "As someone on the vendor side (applications, not directly in sales), is the equipment you're buying/using complex? Are you getting a new order set up and running? Have you used it before?\n\nMy team's product is pretty complex and it really does help to have F2F (virtual if not possible in person) meetings to discuss exactly how a user will perform experiments so we can make sure they have all the correct consumables, filter sets, modules, SW training specific to their types of experiments, understanding of how to extract/use data, etc. \n\nIt helps prevent endless cycles of back and forth emails that ultimately lead to misunderstandings and then sometimes anger or disappointment in the product that could be avoided with some upfront work. Maybe you can pass off the meeting to a post-doc or grad student who knows the workflow and intended use.",

Whether online or in person they are a huge waste of time and energy. At least online I can mute and keep reading my stuff.  Ok sort of related rant over. \n\nAs for you, I try to get an understanding of what they need from me. I often say, please send me an email so I can consider my response more carefully.  And I try to get them to tell me what they want, e.g. in the case of lab equipment it seems they want sales. I push until they either say, oh we just want to chat in which case I say, sorry I don't have the time, or they admit it's sales and I'd say sorry nothing needed right now.  If I'm not in charge of facilities and outlets I'd pass the request along to the right person. If it were me, yep I'd ask for the schematic and if they don't get back, I retain my time.  In other words, I push quickly and hard up front for the reason and outcome they expect.",

For the tissue bank I would just say you\u2019re happy to meet with them if absolutely necessary like they need more details from you, but can they just confirm if they have the samples over email first?",
