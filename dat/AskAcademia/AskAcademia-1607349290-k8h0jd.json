It's not claiming to replace or somehow circumvent the actual physical modeling, it's just a convenient way to interpret results. (in other words, they're not claiming that you no longer have to run the initial models)\n\nThe problems with this are it isn't really physically justified and can't be used for any sort of extrapolation, plus in reality it's not something you couldn't do with classical regression techniques with similar results.

But they're just ignoring the fact that they needed wildly in excess of that original 2.2s to train the initial model, so in any real sense it's absurdly slower.\n\nEffectively they're pointing out it's faster to evaluate a curve fit than it is to come up with the original data for the curve fit, like no shit.\n\n\nI saw a conceptually similar study recently where a group did something like 20,000 CFD runs over months, trained a model on the results, and then claimed their evaluation of the neural net (with seriously shitty accuracy) only took seconds and was therefor faster. I wanted to throw a chair.\n\nAlso, join us on /r/cfd",

                              "text": "I can't believe I'm defending ML in physics, but this isn't completely fair. Obviously it is a fancy curve fit and the speed advantage is there purely because you're solving a curve fit and not the actual physical system, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. To use a chemistry example because that's what I know, if you have a model that truly gets within ~1 kcal/mol of DFT in \"small\" molecules, that's massive for pharma and all the training required is 100% worth it. That's not something I expect to see in the next two decades, but that would still be a game changer. I don't know if that's a realistic thing in CFD, but apparently that has happened in quantum chemistry. It's not actually useful because there's not enough computational power to do the training on a sufficiently large bond basis, but it worked. You gave it a structure and it spit out an answer that is similar quality to DFT.\n\nAnd while this isn't \"dEeP lEaRnInG\", I also think there's a lot of potential value in taking ideas from compressed sensing to get real simulation speed up. With judicious sampling choices, you can get a completely solvable undetermined system which saves you from having to solve for however many points with the real model.\n\nWhile this is an ongoing thing, graph theory is also proving to be the answer to \"how do we deal with systematic errors in thermochemistry?\" The data requirements are pretty extreme for that, but you create a \"thermochemical network\", solve it for self consistency, and now you can immediately see whether or not your experiment/calculation for a new quantity is sensible. It's probably still not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the old method which was \"we have two conflicting values here. One was taken by a lab with an h-index of 116 and the other by an h-index of 15, so I guess we'll go with the 116 data.\"\n\nAlso, not coincidentally, if a paper uses the words \"deep learning\" and it's not explicitly an ML researcher, you can pretty safely not read it because it's a trash paper using a model that is ill suited for the system in question. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take a shower after this post.",

              "text": "I agree there's a fair bit of not-enlightening work that uses ML, but I'd like to defend at least some of the people you're talking about here. There are certain questions that can only be tackled on a large scale and that inevitably means losing a lot of the local context and details. It would be difficult to imagine how we would be able to achieve something like Widmer et al. (2017) by hand, for example. And a lot of the time, when experts on a specific language disagree with some of the codings, it's because the way that typological categories are defined as comparative concepts doesn't match up with the local, emic categories used in linguistic description. But different language systems are incommensurate, especially when it's across language families and areas, so this is a necessary evil whenever one is doing large-scale comparative work.\n\nAlso, at least a subset of the people who work on large-scale computational typology/hist ling have had much experience producing detailed descriptions of particular languages themselves. For example, I'm not sure how well-known this is outside of the TB community, but Bickel has a lot of important work on Kiranti grammar. Those people *can* draw from their knowledge working on particular languages in their typological work. And there are more and more people who have mostly worked with relatively 'traditional' linguistics in their careers but have lately teamed up with people with computational skills (Claire Bowern obviously, but lately I've also seen papers from people like Lyle Campbell and Laurent Sagart), which just further shows that there is value in such methods.\n\nSo I don't think the situation in linguistics is quite the same as e.g. what the fluid dynamics person above said.",

I'm a pretty big fan of connectionism, and I think neural language models are massively useful even when they're not particularly interpretable (it finds use, for example, in creating information-theoretic measures like entropy and surprisal more accurately that traditional n-grams do). In fact, I did end up running a few recurrent neural networks (though not deep ones) at one point in that project, though that part was abandoned early on and didn't go into our final paper (which will be out at the end of this month). It's just the knee-jerk reaction ('why use something else when you could use deep learning' with no justification) that I find problematic.",

This is a huge generalization, of course, but one could make a career out of writing on this subject so please forgive my reduction. \n\nUltimately, all methods of inquiry have the same ends: Increasing our understanding and knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in. The means differ, naturally, but it\u2019s important to zoom out from time to time and remember that all of our fields and disciplines and subdisciplines are fundamentally connected and contribute to one another constantly.  \n\nAlso: a science is only as good as its scientists. So, if you\u2019re making a roundabout critique of the tendency for pseudoscientists to gravitate towards Psychology, then... Yeah, fuckin\u2019 tell me about it. APA last year was frankly horrific.

This was something that floated juuust under the surface at all times. My experience that I mention here which made me realize that I was not happy in the field was the breaking point because I was in disbelief that they would be that overt about it.\n\nAs for your other question... It is my hope that there are some pure studies and labs out there, but you have got to be some sort of naive if you live in the US or any other highly industrialized heavily capitalistic society and still think money doesn't affect scientific and even some (if not most) academic studies. Unfortunately, who funds a project can tell you a whole lot about a study and the validity. I find [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3954632/) NIH publication to be quite helpful if it is your first time encountering the 'money issue.' I didn't just \\~decide\\~ all of neuroscience works like this, this is common knowledge in most fields. Even if it wasn't, this is how my well-respected department worked, and that is disturbing in and of itself as many people take what the department puts out to be God's truth (whether or not they should).\n\nI take it that you're a scientist from your username, so I am honestly shocked you've never come across this issue before!\n\nEdit: to be fair, I guess I could have always moved to a country where this isn't an issue (if there is one), but I wasn't that dedicated and I have a partner that needs to be here in the US.",

Whilst there was a huge push back on this, at one point with a lot of archaeologists challenging our own bias of perception, it seemed to lead to an unproductive split.\n\nThere are those who bring on questions of ontology and epistemology and end up stuck in that loop of 'but can really know' and others who try and stick to the facts and reporting data, but still referencing assumed models. The former is important, but we need to work on how we apply it effectively, whilst the latter helps limit bold claims and unsubstantiated rumination, but is still working under assumptions that often can be dismantled with some research into the former group. Furthermore the former group really helps in engaging the public and bringing to light research (which I argue is pretty key to archaeology), whilst the latter group provides that strong evidence to document and is excellent commercial research projects outside universities. I'd really like there to be a shift where the two sides intermingle more within individual papers and reports, to help reduce confirmation bias, whilst still clearly presenting the raw data.",

My institute got two new qPCR instruments, and a field engineer and application scientist were there to install them and conduct training.\n\nApplication scientist was talking about the importance of running melt curves after qPCR to make sure you're actually measuring what you think you're measuring.  She notices a lot of blank stares in the group of \\~20 people.  Asks how many of them are in the habit of performing melt curve analysis after each experiment.  My hand goes up immediately, along with maybe 2 or 3 others.  You can see that she's visibly stunned at how many people completely skip qPCR quality control and blindly trust whatever numbers the machine spits out.  Some people didn't even know what melt analysis was or why they should be doing it.  The trainer couldn't even manage to speak for 5-10 seconds, at which point she just stumbled forward in her presentation.  Later, I spoke to her one-on-one and asked how common an issue this is in the field.  She tells me that she's a field specialist for the USA and Canada and travels all over both countries doing qPCR training, anything from small schools to the highest reputation institutions there are, and is shocked at how little understanding most bioscientists have of what qPCR is and how it works.  I asked her point blank how much confidence she has in a standard qPCR data appearing in the literature.  Her response?  Maybe 25%.  Because people don't do quality control, and so they don't have the slightest clue whether their data are of even minimally acceptable quality.  That tells you all you need to know right there.  A field application scientist doing training at institutions all over North America doesn't believe the overwhelming majority of the qPCR data that make it into the literature.  And people win millions in grants and make their entire careers on this stuff, the vast majority of which may turn out to be irreproducible garbage.",

There are decades of 'research' where the source of data is the linguist's own judgements of the grammaticality of sentences they constructed themselves (perhaps along with some judgements elicited from colleagues). In other words, an ultra-WEIRD population that puts the white American undergrad bias in fields like psychology to shame, miniscule sample sizes, and it's not just bad statistics - it's no statistics at all. Then there's the related line of research where weird decontexualised sentences are presented to language consultants to judge their grammaticality, or whether two referring expressions can be coreferential, or whatever, or where weird sentences are presented in a contact language like English or Spanish and all the research consists of is eliciting translations for those weird sentences. These types of research may tell us a lot about how weird sentences are judged and translated and how structures of English/Spanish/whatever are reflected in other languages, but they don't tell us much about how language works.",

Or was it a boring old nerd?), do other labs use the finding/method for their work, has it been systematically successfully used outside academia, what does the gossip network say, are there open debates about it (which I'd take as a good sign)... There's no Sola Scriptura in science.\n\nThe worse bullshit though? That's the post-truth stuff where they've degenerated so far they've rejected the whole concept of right versus wrong, true versus false, reliable versus unreliable - it's overtly, if not using the same brevity of terminology, bullshit.
