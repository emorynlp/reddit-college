  "title:": "Need advice on Black/African American students in chemistry.",
  "text": "Context: I teach at a regional state PUI. My campus has a lot of at-risk students, many first generation, many with low ACT scores. \n\nFor many years I taught biochemistry and had very few Black/AA students. I assumed they were simply not majoring in chemistry. I was moved to organic chemistry a few years ago (the gateway course to biochemistry) and I have found LOTS of these students. \n\nAlmost all of them fail. Regardless of instructor. The fail rate of my White students is about 35%, the fail rate of my Black students is closer to 80%. When I brought this to the attention of administrators, it was sorry of a, \"yeah, it's been like that for years.\"\n\nWhat the hell can I do to help this demographic do better? They are generally failing because they aren't studying, and/or didn't retain what they needed from general chemistry.\n\nEdit: I'm getting some great ideas and thoughts here. Please keep contributing if you think of something!",

The first assignment of the semester is for them to read a couple of articles on study strategies and goal-setting, and write a short statement of their goals and approach to the course- then I go over it with them. We also revisit this after the first exam and modify things appropriately. \n\n2. I make all students come to my office to pick up their first exam so we can go over it together. It helps reduce the barrier to visiting office hours, and helps form a productive relationship and chance to talk to every student about strategies and success. \n\nI also have started using Slack for my class to build an online community, and it seems to really break down the barriers students have in asking me questions- a quick message and photo on their smartphone is a lot less of a barrier than an email, and it also lets them set up study groups with each other.

      "text": "Is organic chemistry a first-year course, or is there a gen chem prerequisite? If there is a gen chem prereq, can you coordinate with its instructor(s) to address the issues you're seeing? Early intervention will be the most helpful.\n\nIs there a common theme in where they're failing? Stoichiometry? Rates? Functional groups? The large number of reactions which are generally memorized by rote? If you notice a pattern (e.g. students are particularly underprepared in math), focused attention can be helpful.\n\nOne approach the first-year team at my university is trialing is basically \"re-exam\", with midterms having two phases. The first phase is exactly like a typical exam. After the first phase exams are collected, the same exam is passed out, to be completed again in groups automatically determined by the instructor team.\n\nThe second phase is optional, and will either (not change|somewhat improve) the mark any student can get, but it gets groups together talking about their answers and their thought processes.\n\nThe instructing team is still trying to determine if this change is driving improved results downstream, but it's one of the larger changes they've made. For reference, the final is still entirely traditional, and the two midterms are weighted in total about 20, 25% of the overall class grade.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: Also, do try to get support from any additional departments or offices within your institution. Is there an office dealing with minority student support? They may have additional advice or resources to draw upon.",

Organic chemistry is really different from general in the way you need to approach your studying - relying on algebra skills and brute-force memorization of concepts can get you through gen chem, but will eventually fail in organic (I speak from my own experience as an undergraduate, unfortunately).  Plus, many students have seen some general chemistry material in high school, but the vast majority of them are seeing the organic material for the first time.",

(I think there\u2019s others but these are the ones I remember.)\n\nI like the earlier comment about collaborative learning and getting students info study groups\u2014making sure to create a community and shared responsibility between students who will look out for one another. I try to monitor my problem students early in the semester, even building in weekly check ins with some of them. I ask them if they have ideas for methods or activities that would work better for them. Of course, the larger the class size the harder this becomes and the less time-per-student.

      "text": "* Hi! I did some research this past summer on barriers to minority success in STEM Education. Hopefully I can help a little bit. Many minority students come to college woefully under-prepared academically. This includes not just the rigor of coursework that they've been exposed to, but also things that are the making of a good student - knowing how to manage your time, knowing how to study *effectively*, knowing when, where, and how to ask for help, knowing to form collaborative study groups. And of course, there's the feeling out of place/feeling like you don't belong in an institution of higher learning issue/lacking the identity of a scientist.\n\n* Here are two successful programs working to address minority student success if you'd like to adopt some of their strategies:\nhttp://bsp.berkeley.edu/about\nhttps://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/\n* There's another program at the University of Texas - Austin (I believe) that does similar work that integrates research opportunities/experiences into each major as coursework and it apparently does wonders are reducing the attrition rate among minorities. I'll update this if I can find it. \n\n* One problem that I think we have is that the burden of success falls, almost entirely, on the student. To an extent that's fair, but in my opinion a greater burden of success needs to be placed on the institution. That implies changing pedagogy to be cognizant of its failings among at-risk populations, but also to be more efficient in general. One of the things I found that successful programs do is change their institutional practices/mentality regarding student success. The administration, faculty, and staff all get on-board about implementing institutional changes/changing mentality and acknowledge that as a community, we're all accountable for student success. That means all of those people at that level showing genuine concern for students, but also teaching students to concern themselves about the success of their peers. Teach them to ask their friends and their peers about how school is going. How did they do on that exam? Is there anything they can do to help? Students need to be accountable to both themselves and others. \n\n* Emphasize the importance of group work and give them extra practice problems to work on. The problems should frankly be intellectually stimulating and challenging. They don't have to be remedial. I can't remember the name of the program, but there's a calculus program out in a western university that focuses on helping essentially at risk students. The person leading the program either leads sessions himself, or successful students volunteer to help, but basically they lead their students through these study sessions and work to collectively learn concepts and solve challenging problems. \n\n* Study habits - My understanding is that among at risk students...their study habits are generally pretty terrible. I can speak to that personally because I'm Hispanic and had no idea how to study for college when I did my undergrad in molecular biology. I coasted during HS and college was a wake-up call. Personally, what helped me the most in organic chemistry was the immediate application of whatever concept I'd just read. Emphasize DOING and APPLICATION over things like...taking notes from the chapter or flashcards which can be a pretty passive form of learning. I did that and bombed my first O-chem exam. But basically what I would do is read the textbook, and immediately after finishing a section, I would go to the chapter problems and immediately try to solve the problems related to that section. I would do this section by section until I'd finished the chapter, but the immediate application of what I'd just read got me out of that false sense of \"Oh I just read this and I understand it\" followed by moving onto the next chapter section. So basically emphasize do do do and the application of whatever they're learning. If you can, give them old practice exams as well. All my courses in grad school allowed us to study from old practice exams and it helped a ton. \n\n* Time management - I use a few apps. \nI just finished graduate school for something else, but one Chrome extension I used was **Blocksite**. It does exactly what it sounds like and forces you to be productive by blocking whatever sites you might visit that take away from your time. I also use one on my phone called **Offtime**. It basically blocks me from using my phone for an hour and a half, but has permissions for what apps you might need (G-mail, texting perhaps, spotify, the calculator), things like that. \n\n* I also used one called **Toggl** It's free and its a time-keeping app. My project management professor stated that in graduate school the expectation is that for every credit hour of class you take, you should be spending 40 hours in the class studying, doing homework, attending class, and taking exams. So a 3 credit hour course through the semester should mean about 120 hours, 12 credit hour course load is about 480 hours. Over a 14 week semester that's about 34 hours per week that should be devoted to school. But the problem we have is that often we don't know where our time goes. So basically, I would use this app to only track my time devoted to studying. You can be extreme and see where ALL of it is going, but I don't think that's necessary. So for example, 34 hours per week should be school. Say you have 4 classes that you're taking, that means you spend 12 hours JUST in lecture (assuming 1.5 hours per class). That means you should be spending 22 hours with your nose in the books each week. It might feel like you did, but I think we tend to overestimate the amount of work we actually do. Toggl helped me up my study hours and actually approach that number. \n\n* Get them to form a schedule. To the best of their ability, their days and weeks should be routine. That means accounting for time with friends, time at the gym or doing other activities, time in school (obviously). Google Calendar helps a TON. I also go through all my syllabi and add every assignment to my google calendar as a task and sort by date. Then I can just look on the right and I know exactly what I have to do to get through this whole semester. I would put in papers, problem sets, exams, projects, etc. It helps to have everything in one big list already sorted and accessible. \n\n* If they do need remedial help, point them toward something like Khan Academy to go through things like algebra I/II which will be helpful in passing other courses. \n\n* And just emphasize that they should be there. It'll mean so much to them coming from a person in a position of power to hear that they believe they all should be there, that they can be scientists or doctors or whatever else. Check this out: http://bayerfactsofscience.online-pressroom.com/ Basically Bayer did a survey of like...3000 (that number might be wrong) minority chemists. Asked them what contributed to their success in science, how they feel about things like discrimination, things like that. This population believed that the biggest contributor to their success was mentoring and support from professors/similar people. But they also find that the people most likely to discriminate and be an obstacle were those same professors. \n\nThat's all I can think of for right now. \n\n\n",

          "text": "I just looked through some of those and I think these are some great suggestions. \n\nThe biggest difference though is that the students I'm working with are ALREADY underachievers. I very seriously doubt Berkeley is taking students with an 18 ACT score. I have given them a TON of information (like what you mentioned) already on how to get help, how to effectively study, even things like how we form memories and how to reinforce them at a neuroscience level. The problem that happens is that they seemingly don't care. I assign extra credit problems here and there, and very few students bother to even turn them in.\n\nAfter reading all these really insightful responses from everyone here,  I've had to accept a really hard truth: my students are bottom of the barrel as far as ability goes. Our ACT scores are low to get in. Our high school preparation is low. Our students have huge time management issues and I know part of that is working 2 jobs, etc... but I DO have a lot of traditional students (most of my minority students are) who live on campus and only work a small part time job. \n\nThe approach I've taken over the years is to try and encourage them to change their major to something that is more conducive to the skills they already have. I've had great success with them going into criminal justice, but that's not solving the problem I want to solve: I want them to do well in CHEMISTRY. \n\nI don't even know if I'm making sense at this point. I just graded too many lab reports! Thanks so much for your response though. I'm going to go through all these and come up with some changes to see if it helps. ",

The question is, are you willing?\n\nYou have to make them feel as if you are approachable, and that you care about their success.  Is it that they aren't studying?  Or they don't know what to study?  What can you do to make sure they retain the knowledge they receive in class?  You need to not only talk to your department, but also academic advisors and maybe if you have a multicultural services type of entity on campus you can engage their help for outreach.  It's rough.  But it's rougher being a scared student, wanting to do better, and be better, but not knowing how the hell to do it.\n\nSource: Black American woman with a PhD whom started a program for at-risk students to help them adjust to university life edit: oh and I was an academic advisor, for a few years because the job market is a beyotch.",

      "text": "Lots of good food for thought here; I want to add two more ideas, which might require more buy-in than just you (but at least one you can start on your own).\n\n(1)  Add a recitation section to your course.  This is the tough one, because you have to change the course layout and possibly credit hours and find an extra hour (or create a new one-credit co-requisite class).  This requires departmental buy-in and institutional support as such a course change will likely have to go through an accreditation committee.  That's usually a pretty easy approval process though, and offers help to all students.  The advantage of the recitation period is that it is a mandatory one-hour session of problem solving.  Just find ways to set up problems and figure out how to think through a pathway/reaction.  You can mix it up a play \"follow the electrons\" one week and have more standard problems the next.  Courses with recitations generally tend to produce more students passing and mastering the material, if only because it's an extra hour of practice each week.\n\n(2)  Contact an HBCU near you and see if you can pick some brains for strategies they use to retain students.  You might see a handful of students fail, but when you have 50%+ fail, then the problem gets addressed.  Some HBCU's strategies are better than others but there are some good ideas out there and some collaborations and partnerships available.  You'll likely find a some integrated programs using a variety of techniques for success in STEM, and hopefully you can mimic or apply those.\n\nIt's been suggested elsewhere, but both a sense of belonging and peer study groups are very useful in promoting retention.  I'm lucky in that my institution is small enough that the study groups self-organize now (especially after I strongly encourage it).  Sometimes you can get that ball rolling by hosting an initial study session, maybe providing pizza and drinks or something, maybe on- or off-campus, a lot depending on your class sizes and campus culture.  Good luck.",

Things like \"Nate made a really good observation as I was circling around in the groups, can you share that with us Nate?\" Or \"that's perfect, can you write how you worked through that up on the board as an example\" In the same way addressing errors in a measured way is important.\n\n- competitive games can build a sense of community. I'm a fan of kahoot. Just keep in mind that not all students have smart phones so have them play in teams with one designated phone person. \n\nGood luck!

Bringing up the pass/fail rates in the very first document they encounter in the class might come across as \"gloating\" about how many students you fail (because students often think we want to fail as many of them as possible).  If they score about average on the first exam, they might think \"look how many people are above me\" rather than \"look how many people are below me\".  Do fewer students in general show up to lecture/office hours after seeing the first exam stats?  Do the underrepresented students show up significantly less so?  If you take attendance it might be worth running some quick stats, especially if you have it for a few years.  \n\nDo you grade each exam on a curve relative to its statistics?  If not, the data are reasonably irrelevant to the students.  Next time I would do a little experiment and take out all references to the P/F rate and not share the individual exam stats.\n\nAlong a different vein, many years ago my colleague and I did an intervention during the first day of class (or for HW that night).  In addition to having them fill out a survey with their preferred name [now I also ask pronouns], major, prerequisites, comfort with various levels of math and computer programs, they had to write a paragraph or two about either something they were good at and why or their career goals (or major) and why they chose them (it).  [It was ~8 years ago and the exact wording/file is on a different computer, so I'm going off memory.]  IIRC, my colleague adapted it from a paper she had read about increasing female success in physics/STEM.
