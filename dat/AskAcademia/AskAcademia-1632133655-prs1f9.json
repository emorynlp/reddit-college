  "title:": "When should I tell my supervisor that I\u2019m thinking about dropping out of my PhD?",
  "text": "Here\u2019s my situation, in a bit more detail: I\u2019m just at the end of the Master\u2019s portion of the degree, and would be leaving with a good grade in that; I\u2019m in a social sciences/humanities programme in a world top 10 institution for my subject; I am in the UK; I\u2019m fully funded by a research council. \n\nI\u2019m basically 95% certain that I want to leave, and have already started searching for jobs. I don\u2019t want my supervisor to put work in to my project when I know I\u2019m planning on leaving - I would feel really guilty about it. On the other hand, I can\u2019t afford to pay my rent if I lose my funding before I find another source of income and am a big fan of not starving to death - I don\u2019t know if telling him means the institution will be alerted and cause me problems on that front, especially because I have no idea how long it will take for me to find something. At the minute, I\u2019m considering not saying anything until I have a job secured, but again, I\u2019m worried that that\u2019s a dick move. \n\nWhat would you guys do, in my position? I can provide more information about my reasoning/situation if that helps - I\u2019m being purposefully vague about the specific university and course.",

      "text": "Don't say a word until you have a new source of income. It's just about priorities, and your supervisor should understand if they're a decent person, and if not then meh, they evidently care more about their convenience than your wellbeing. But also: you don't \\*know\\* what'll happen, maybe you look around and are disappointed and end up being very happy to continue with that very decent-sounding funded project. It's just way premature to think about making waves and potentially screwing yourself over, however (overly) nice and considerate it is.",

Life became hell for me after that and ended up getting let go, in my opinion unfairly. Nevertheless I didn\u2019t have another job to go to but it was okay, it just sucked for a couple weeks",

      "text": "Look at your contract/information from the research council/institution about funding. That should tell you when you'll be cut off if you drop out. Knowing nothing about the UK, I'd bet you're cut off when you withdraw. If you're at the end of your master's program, I'd assume you'd end your program at the end of the semester when you are awarded the master's degree.\n\nIf that's the case, I'd let your professor know after your final meeting is scheduled. If you think your professor might be a dick about it and cause you problems during your final meeting, you could tell him/her that you are leaving when your master's material has been signed off and sent to the administrative offices for the degree to be offered.\n\nIf you don't find a position before your master's has been awarded you could simply continue into the doctoral portion of your program and then leave when you find a position. Graduate students leave programs all of the time. It's a pain to deal with, at times, but that's part of it. If your advisor puts work into your project and then you leave, I'd bet that your advisor will simply assign that project to a different student. It would surprise me if s/he has designed a project that only you could do.\n\nLeave if you decide it's not for you and do it in a way that maximizes your own benefits. The university and your advisor will be just fine!",

          "text": "I\u2019ve had a look at the paperwork and from what I understand, I have the funding to the day I file withdrawal paperwork or start full time employment - whichever is first. Otherwise, assuming my academic work is up to scratch, I am funded through to 2025! The next academic hurdle is a paper due at the end of December, so I\u2019m hoping to have a job by then because I really do not have the motivation to start writing the damn thing. Also, my master\u2019s graduation is in December (even though I\u2019ve finished all the course work and it\u2019s been graded) so if I go for jobs saying I\u2019m doing a master\u2019s at the moment it\u2019s not that dishonest. \n\nMy project is one that I designed myself and applied to the school with, so if I don\u2019t do it it just won\u2019t happen - which is a shame, because I genuinely think it\u2019s a good project and I enjoy researching - I\u2019ve just found the environment in this department toxic and it\u2019s put me off even wanting to stay in academia at all. If I don\u2019t want to stay in academia, a PhD in my discipline is basically useless, whereas the master\u2019s I\u2019d be leaving with is really quite employable - so I figure it\u2019s time to go now.",

Additionally, you will be much more protected from Covid in academia. \n\nA PhD may not \u201cmatter\u201d but it will not hurt either, and could be quite useful should you decide to write a book.\n\n\nEdit: only this crew would downvote a plan to stay employed and safe during covid, and instead would make 1,000 recommendations about how to tiptoe around a resignation that might backfire.",
