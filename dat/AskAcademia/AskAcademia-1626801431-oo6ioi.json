      "text": "Disclaimer- I work at COS (who builds OSF). OSF is really meant for documenting and posting a lot of the items that are normally lost (manuscripts, data, protocols, code, survey items) and then connecting them to your project- often with its preprint. The big difference I think is that COS's mission is about increasing reproducibility and transparency of research; whereas research gate is more focused on academic social connections and open access.",

You are able to see others profiles and everything. OSF on the other hand is more like a super awesome DropBox. I love OSF and what it stands for (I promise that I am not Brian Nosek) and think that could be the way to go. Then you can always link to it with a stable DOI.",

So you might be able to link your repository in your OSF project to make things easier for others to get the whole story. Or also your future self when you look back at a project. \n\nI am in clinical psych with a big interest in quant, so I'm happy to chat more if you have other OSF or workflow questions!",

The OSF is great in terms of having a stable (touch wood) link to your data that you can plonk in the paper. But I get a reasonable number of paper requests on ResearchGate, so it makes sense to have them uploaded there. No harm in making your papers as easy to find as possible.",
