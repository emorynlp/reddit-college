  "title:": "Are there many students in computer science masters programs who participate in Machine Learning/Computer Vision/Natural Language Processing research?",
  "text": "I know this differs from university to university and lab to lab but are there many research opportunities in ML/CV/NLP for masters students? It seems undergrads tend to get more involved in research while masters students are left out. Would masters be worth it if I get rejected from phd programs I wanted to get into and I need more time to build up the publication records and get good LORs?",
