  "title:": "Should I pursue a PhD after PharmD?",
  "text": "I\u2019m graduating next may with my PharmD. I\u2019ve always had a passion for research and have had some exposure working in it during school (lab assistant for a chem synthesis lab, RA for a pharmacology/toxicology lab). I know it is possible to work in clinical research as a PharmD, however I\u2019m a bit more interested with the basic sciences like med chem and pharmacology (although clinical research would still be amazing). \n\nI will have about 120k USD in debt after school which compounds my problem of pursuing a PhD. \n\nIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to pursue a PhD - completely dedicating myself for 6-7 years to drug discovery/med chem/pharmacology and being able to perform independent research, and also writing a thesis. \n\nI would appreciate any insight from academia!  Thank you",

      "text": "There are a lot of threads in this subreddit devoted to whether one should pursue a PhD, but I think it boils down to whether you truly want to spend your life in academia, potentially adjuncting for years and never making it to the tenure track. If the goal is to just write a thesis, I am not sure if it\u2019s worth it. What are your end career goals? If you can\u2019t picture yourself being happy in any other industry, I\u2019d say sure, but it\u2019s a difficult path that is hard to move through if the goal of ending up in academia is not the motivation.",

There aren\u2019t really any professor positions that just focus on research and not any of the other stuff. It sounds like you don\u2019t want an academic job.",
