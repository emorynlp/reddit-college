  "text": "My thesis advisor is very understanding, and supportive of my occasional shutdowns/burnouts for undergrad/MSc studies in Hungary.\n\nI hope to move to either Ireland or UK for PhD and later, and I worry that it'll be less survivable with my personal difficulties.\n\nFor someone who has such diagnoses (F84 and subtypes), either made late or in childhood, what were your experiences when it came to asking for accomodations, and how those accomodations affected your academic career?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think there are many meaningful accommodations you can request, tbh.\n\nI\u2019m diagnosed autistic in the UK and I couldn\u2019t think of anything useful beyond \n\n1. I prefer instructions given in writing, rather than verbally\n\n2. I need a stable workspace\n\nOther than that, you can\u2019t be exempted from conference presentations or department talks or anything social like that. Even if you could be exempted, it would harm you in the end and put a stop to any academic career. Your upgrade or confirmation process at the end of the first year likely wouldn\u2019t be changed either, in less you could prove a separate disability that would make a viva impossible. \n\nHaving a diagnosis of autism simply isn\u2019t very impactful overall. Without classes or exams, there is little *to* adapt. You might find that it\u2019s not even worth getting accommodations if there are no specific accommodations you need. \n\nBut things like burnout probably won\u2019t be accommodated in any useful way, so you should be careful. Taking medical leave may mean you lose your visa and funding, and being ejected from the country for one term or one year is a massive hassle. Additional sick leave wouldn\u2019t add any time onto your PhD funding except for very exceptional circumstances, so whatever time you take off outside of full intermission, you lose.",

      "text": "I've been diagnosed with ASD during my PhD. Getting accommodations as a PhD student has been okay - I've been able to get extra time and flexibility with deadlines, a funded extension, sick leave when I needed it for autistic burnout. Things like conferences and teaching have been extra challenging for me - most of the accommodations there have looked like me just... Being allowed to not do them.\n\nI can't really speak to the academic career part. I have found that for me, an academic career probably isn't what will work for me - I don't want to work short contracts, move home a lot, or do some of the \"networking\" aspects, so I've decided that I'll likely leave academia post-PhD. \n\nI think it will depend on the university - I would check the website and/or contact the Disability Services at any university you are seriously looking at and see what they can offer, how communicative they are, whether they are knowledgeable and experience with students with your support needs.",

I have a ton of autistic PhD friends who worked in physics, and most either got hired on at the same institution to do similar work to their PhD (e.g. one did research with a specific kind of machine and now his job is to run and maintain that machine for other research teams)\n\nOr, they do similar work in industry, software development, industry materials research, data wrangling, etc.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know much about what kind of formal accommodations you might need and/or be entitled to, but it\u2019s not like ASD is all that rare in academia, so I\u2019d be surprised if most supervisors wouldn\u2019t be quite understanding if you explained clearly how it can affect you, and what kind of leeway you might need occasionally.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a thing in Hungarian universities, but basically all universities in the UK and Ireland have some form of disability office (sometimes it\u2019s called something different like an \u201caccess office\u201d, etc), that can help provide you with additional supports and if needs be can liaise with your department if there\u2019s ever any issues. Very worth inquiring into if you end up in a uni here.",
