  "title:": "I just completed PhD in Comparative Literature at an Ivy League; fell in love with another field (East Asian Studies) and find myself fantasizing about doing a second PhD. If anything in this world was possible and I could overcome anything that stood in my way: how would I go about doing that?",
  "text": "my completed PhD is in Medieval European Literature. Would I even be considered as a viable candidate for a PhD in East Asian Studies? If it is not common, do you know anybody who did? Or how you would react if you saw my application?\n\nAnswers to questions you might have:\n\na. The tenure-track market is oversaturated and there are very few postdocs in my field in the US. I don't want to move anywhere just to get a job and find myself teaching 4 classes per semester while directing a program of studies (i.e. bureaucracy, advising, faculty meetings, conferencing, etc.) or <insert academic horror story.> Hence I am looking at academic administration and industry jobs while we ride out of corona, and while I get a few more articles published from my dissertation materials in order to remain viable for hiring (turns out humanities PhDs are sought after if you know where to look, e.g. content development for museums).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI loved doing my PhD at this Ivy league (won't mention the name) and I was very successful with my research and dissertation; advisers and many colleagues were upset that I wasn't giving the tenure market this year a try.\n\nIn my free time, I am teaching myself classical Chinese and Japanese. It started as a fun intermission between my PhD and starting a job but am now obsessed with it like I was with medieval studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care for economical arguments against a second PhD. Yes, I'd be making less money. No, I don't care. But I do need a PhD fellowship to support myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also don't care about social stigma or being called Peter Pan or eternal student. I'd just like to know if it is possible to embark on a second PhD and what challenges I would face. \n\nFields are: Medieval European Studies (completed) --> East Asian Languages\n\n\nAny positive and constructive comments would be especially appreciated.",

      "text": "It is not common. It would be exceptionally rare, and not necessarily in a \"wow cool, two phds\" way but in a \"uhhh, why did you do two phds?\" way. If I was considering your PhD application, I would be happy admitting you. But I would also be very skeptical about offering you funding. While the reality is that doctoral students are also affordable labor, the commitment narrative is always about whether students will become contributors to our field. That is, tenured professors who produce publications and expand our network. Thats why your mentors and colleagues are disappointed in your decision to not get out there. The switch you want to do would strongly suggest that you don't intend to be that or there is something else funny going on with you. Now, admittedly, I've never been a tenured professor at a PhD program, just privy to admissions cycles while on temporary appointment. \n\nThe more serious thing you should consider is that a second PhD would be interpreted very poorly in a job application. The conversation would immediately be \"no way does this person have the focus to get tenure.\" That I do have recent experience with. But I am speaking entirely from the perspective of the US academy here. Maybe it's different in Europe.",

There's no way they are going to be competitive when up against someone who is fresh out of their program, active, and engaged in their field, and eager to start their career. At best it would read as flighty-- as a chair I'd be very worried about their ability to commit.\n\nFurther, as someone with an interdisciplinary background and position, I see little/no market value to this particular combination of degrees. There can't be more than a couple of position in the world that demand parallel training in these fields at the Ph.D. level.  A second MA perhaps -- that is what I did --could be seen as a useful investment of time/energy, but not *after* completing an Ivy Ph.D..",

In other words, they were different disciplines and metbods but related topics. The second PhD was in a way a logical extention of the first.\n\nIn another instance, it was a candidate who had supposedly done two PhDs at the same time. Rather than being impressed, I found it confusing and unrealistic. There was probably an explanation for this (perhaps a country specific thing), but the application did not elaborate so I found it odd.\n\nAs many others have said, I think the impression of a second PhD (not a Dr.Philos) depends on how it is justified. If the second PhD is integrated towards the person's specialization, or if the change in career direction is justified, it can be a good thing. Changing career direction can be a good sign, as it could indicate following a true passion, particularly if there is additional documentation to support this.",

As per the comment above, I am active in the field with publications both out and outcoming and would definitely be eligible for tenure if there were more jobs out there for me and my colleagues.

But I need language and historical training that I couldn't obtain working 40 hours a week and studying with my own resources. Fields are close but to acquire specialization they require very different itinera of studies. Thanks again and let me know if I understood your point correctly.",

I get the urge to do something completely different after your PhD but the academic career cycle seems to require that you stay in the same area until after tenure. I'm also not sure you need a second PhD - you could probably just get a grant to study the language you need and study the history/culture part independently. Given the time investment that would also probably have to be post-tenure but it doesn't sound impossible to make that pivot later in your career.",

I know several people who followed similar paths-- most doing a second masters or professional degree *after* being TT, but a couple that did Ph.D.s as well. In every case these degrees were related to their research/teaching interests, so things like political science Ph.D.s who did JDs after being hired, or in one case an ethicist who did a computer science MS because he was interested in the ethics of AI. That makes sense to me. In most cases these folks pursued those secondary degrees at the institutions where they were employed, so they were *free* and possible to do part-time over several years.",

If you don't get a TT position within 2-3 years of completion-- unless you're in a mandatory postdoc field --search committees will look at your c.v. and say \"Well, she's been out four years and *still* hasn't had a TT position, let's move on to the *fresh* Ph.D.s.\"  I would imagine the same response to someone who has decided to start over on a second Ph.D..  There's also the reality of age discrimination in academic hiring...you didn't share your age but if you're 35-40 when you finish #2 and hit the market there are people on committees who will simply pass you over for a 30 year old. Not justifying it, but those are the facts.\n\nAll of these issues aside, this is probably the worst time in the last 75 years to be starting a Ph.D. with a hope for a traditional academic career. Schools are shedding jobs all over and post-COVID we are going to see hundreds of smaller colleges go out of business. Meanwhile, admins are seeing COVID as the perfect justification for their investment in term/contingent faculty who can easily be shed if enrollments drop.  Academia in the US is not going to bounce back from this, ever, in a way that looks like it did a year ago. Do another Ph.D. and hit the market in say five years and you'd be competing for ever fewer jobs *alongside hundreds of experienced professors* who have lost their jobs in the wake of the pandemic.",

With a precious few exceptions (nursing, comp sci, some flavors of business, a handful of STEM fields) I think the odds of anyone starting a Ph.D. today having a traditional tenure-track career ten years from now are very, very low. If you're not in a top ten program and aren't one of the top students in your cohort the odds are almost certainly close to zero. American academia was in flux prior to COVID-- due to the imposition of the neoliberal business model and the looming demographic cliff ---and COVID will bring the culmination of those impacts much sooner than expected.\n\nFor anyone insistent on investing their time/money in a Ph.D. now I would simply say \"Have a *primary* career goal outside of academia and treat the academic career as a slim chance.\" No more \"alt-ac\" stuff: you need to have a career path outside academia that is your primary goal. Network your ass off and figure out early on (first or second year) exactly what that path will be and pursue it in parallel with your academic aspirations. Don't invest ten years of your life in something that almost certainly will be unreachable for the vast majority of people who try.",

HS, administration, etc. is where you would look, but that would be your new path.  \n\nMaybe you become a HS teacher that eventually becomes the head of languages at a really fancy private school or it leads you to teaching at a community college.

It is not tenure track at a research university, but it is forward momentum in a career.  \n\nGetting a second PhD without a good reason (for which I can only think of doing it in a new area where there is an interesting intersection between the two) looks like starting over and not moving forward.",

As my advisers could confirm, there is nothing funny with me and am able to get a tenure track position: trouble is there is no tenure job out there for all of us. So I have the choice between slaving away in the administration or faculty development working 40 hours or more a week, or look for other options. I do want to read and research, and other jobs don't allow for that. Gosh, do even tenure track positions these days allow for that?!

      "text": "Professor here. Why wouldn't you simply pursue administrative/non-academic jobs and continue language learning/reading the literature/scholarly canon on your own time?\n\nIf you want to apply, you should do what you want. It's extremely unlikely you'd be admitted. If, for some reason you were, I can't imagine any department offering you funding (even though, for good programs, full funding for all is the general policy).\n\n**First**, your lack of formal coursework and language fluency in reading/writing the relevant classical language and reading/writing/speaking a modern East Asian language would take you out of the running. No one is just going to take your word for it. Evidence of language abilities would be even more important for non-U.S. programs, where the PhD might be 3 years instead of 5-7.\n\n**Second**, you state you're not pursuing academic jobs, in part because the markets barely exist (accurate). This is also the case for EAS. Because you'd clearly know the state of affairs, that would add another layer of confusion for a search committee. Why would we expend resources and funding on someone who has already benefited from them and who is pursuing a new field \"for fun\"? \n\n**Third**, I understand you don't mind making a stipend that's roughly double the annual income for minimum wage workers. I also understand you don't mind losing an additional 5-7 years worth of matched retirement savings. I just want to emphasize that if, somehow, you're admitted to a program, you will make yourself even less competitive for industry (and academic and administrative) jobs.\n\nWith rare exceptions (mostly in STEM), a double PhD doesn't signal ambitious curiosity or intellectual commitment. It signals questionable judgment and, most importantly, an inability to carve out or manage an independent path. I don't mean an entrepreneurial path. I just mean succeeding at any role that isn't \"perpetual student.\"\n\nIt's great you don't care about social stigma. That shouldn't determine your actions. But the social stigma is actually distinct from the material impact of *not getting a job* and *being unable to support yourself*.\n\n**Fourth**, you might want to interrogate why a perfectly good \"obsession\" *has* to somehow translate into another PhD.\n\nFor the sake of transparency: I received my BA in two distinct fields, did my PhD in one field at an Ivy, held a fellowship in my other field at another Ivy, and am now a professor at a top ranked public R1 who was just on grad admissions this year.\n\nGood luck with everything.",

I will address some and would appreciate your feedback if you happen to glance over at them.\n\nI wouldn't pursue these studies in earnest while working because I couldn't be able to do my diligence as a scholar without devoting myself full time to the study writing and research. We all know how long and what resources it takes, not to mention the need to be in a library. I also need support to acquire specialization in things like paleography, philology, and cultural history of these languages, otherwise, it would just be a hobby. And because tenure is basically denied me in medieval studies out of a mere probabilistic reasoning (Royal society says less than 1% of PhD got tenure in 2019), how should i go about continuing my scholarly training in seriousness while working in the administration?\n\nI do agree that given the state of things, I would find myself in a similar situation at the end of the second phd. This is very sad to me but I have no answer to your well-posed question.  Will there even be tenure in 20 years? I am starting to doubt.. What would I do then? I think I would prepare better and prepare to support myself outside academia if I wasn't able to secure tenure.",

I was suggesting you commit to a life-long passion without seeking a formal degree.\n\nPursuing a PhD in another field, particularly another humanities field, will not increase your chances of getting a tenure track position. **Several people have already told you the market is nearly non-existent in EAS.** If you had studied Tang dynasty China instead of medieval England (or wherever), you would've ultimately faced the same dire numbers. \n\nA few others, including myself, have emphasized that **a second PhD will essentially ruin your chances at academic** ***and*** **non-academic jobs.** If you are committed to ignoring this fact, that's fine. \n\nI'll just emphasize once more that you lack the basic language skills to be competitive for graduate admissions. Moreover, it's disconcerting to see someone who, as far as I can tell, is an Anglophone scholar from the West with **no coursework** in Chinese or Japanese act cavalier about pursuing a doctorate in East Asian languages and cultures. ***You do not know these languages.*** And a doctoral program in EAS is not the place to learn them.\n\nYou are not going to magically acquire fluency in the span of a few months or even two years. We're talking about ancient *and* modern languages and an entirely different alphabet. Moreover, we're talking about reading and interpreting complex cultural texts and contemporary scholarship. I'm struggling to understand why you think a committee should even look at your file when you lack the most fundamental prerequisite.\n\nGiven that you're in Comp. Lit., I would expect more awareness. Language ability is not an accessory. This is especially the true when we're talking about western scholars producing knowledge about other parts of the world. In case you haven't seen the news, orientalism is alive and kicking.\n\nGood luck.",

The fact that you'd mistakenly deploy the concept of Orientalism in this way makes me even more apprehensive.\n\nAnd your identity doesn't change the issue of this oddly cavalier attitude. Pursuing a ***PhD*** in EAS while *lacking any formal coursework or native fluency in those specific languages and cultures is*, on some level, insulting.\n\nIt is not wholly dissimilar from applying to a PhD in Molecular Biology when you've never taken an undergraduate or graduate biology course but have just been learning about the field in your spare time.\n\n**However**, unlike molecular biology, it's not impossible for you to acquire the necessary language skills and to do so in a way that would register for a search committee, i.e. Middlebury summer language programs, immersion programs abroad, etc. If you want to pursue the PhD, then that's the bare minimum you would need to do. If you're not willing to, that gives you important data about how much you actually want this.\n\nFinally, I've noticed in other posts you keep reiterating that your primary goal is a tenure track position. *Getting another PhD right after your first one, especially in the humanities, will only hinder your efforts.* Numerous people have said this. \n\nEven if you continue to cannibalize your dissertation, entering into another program means you won't be developing your own repertoire of undergrad and grad courses or forging connections with other early career scholars. Instead, you'll be with another cohort of inexperienced graduate students who will be unable to relate to you. And because you'll technically be a student, the faculty will not view you as their peer even though you have a PhD. **That's the worst of both possible worlds**.\n\nYou might want to consider why you feel the need to challenge so many responses here, given the clear consensus. The rare exceptions people have noted have been in STEM, which I brought up in my very first post. But you don't need to persuade us that your choice is the right or logical or beneficial to you.\n\nThe admissions process will unfold however it unfolds. You are absolutely free to make the decision you think is best for you. That's all any of us can do. Good luck.",

The challenge: your two fields are both in the humanities, and you really need to ask yourself the question 'why'. Having an academic interest in the field is certainly plausible, but it does not necessarily have to be actualized through a Ph.D. program. If you are doing it for potentially better job prospects, the answer is a bitter 'not likely'. As I said previously, the job market for EAL is equally horrible, if not worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdmittedly, some comparatively highly demanded fields (Modern Chinese Literature, for example) have a better placement record. But the reality is, most sub-fields have a very, very bleak job market. There are a few lucky people who can secure jobs even though they are doing fields like ancient Chinese history, but they either already established very good academic networking connections (through family, advisor etc.) or sometimes they are just really lucky (a niche field position opened up because a certain university received a very particular grant that supports the establishment of a position). \n\nI would advise to get an MA (Harvard, for example, has a very good MA program in EAL, with funding opportunities) to further pursue your interests. Or to find a job at a higher ed institution and audit graduate level seminars. Most seminars welcome auditors who have a genuine interest in the field and knowledge in humanities research! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope I don't appear to be too bitter but the reality is the reality.",

The degree proves you can do independent research, so your task is to go do independent research. Like, if you want to do East Asian studies, you could start reading the latest research in the field, attend conferences, and start publishing in that field. Aside from maybe community colleges, a PhD doesn't hold you down to only that field. \n\nIt's obviously not the same thing, and I wish I could switch too, and with the classes and environment and everything, but it's not a complete loss either.\n\nThis could also be wrong - just something I came across the last time I looked into it.",

I have a long standing purpose for this though, namely I am very interested in sino-western post-classical transition, and for that, I simply need the technical skills to do both.\n\nI already have the research skills to do both, and have presented and plan to submit to journals on this topic, but to get a deeper appreciation of the source material, I simply need more specific language training.\n\nSo with that said, given what you're interested in, are you sure what you want is another PhD?  Especially if funding isn't actually an issue (for whatever reason).  Because your research skills likely won't improve, because you're already doing professional level research.  But technical skills, that would be a reason to do a terminal MA, since they're frequently not funded (or not funded as well) and the explanation for the reason to do so would be more clear.\n\nAs some of the other academics have pointed out, the reason to not give you a second PhD is likely out of funding.  There's only so much money to go around, and a spot given to you is a spot not given to someone else.  However, this is also university dependent, so it might be worth shopping around.\n\nI would also recommend, if what you like is the language, just doing the courses in the subject or a second BA.  A PhD is simply a different beast, and one you've already tamed.",

I'm quickly interjecting here to tell you, kindly, to get off your high horse. A PhD gives you no preparation and no qualifications to teach high school.\n\n**Teaching high school is as complex a job as any other**, and it requires its own combination of skill sets and training. The intellectual and psychological needs of these children are different than those of 20-somethings. Their home environments and how those environments impact their ability to work are different. Their methods for socializing with (or failing to socialize) peers are different. Their relationship to authority and to adults more broadly is different. How an instructor should respond to a college junior failing to submit assignments is completely different from the response needed for a high school junior, let alone a 12 or 13 year old freshman.\n\nAll of this is also true for middle school.\n\nIf you have never demonstrated any sustained interest in working with a high school population, there are far too many candidates who are *actually* qualified to choose from. At wealthy private schools, particularly in classics, many of these candidates will also have PhDs. But whether the applicants have BAs or PhDs, their resumes also include an MAT or three years of Teach for America or teaching/counseling at a summer camp or a Fulbright to each English.\n\nIf I, as a junior faculty member with a significant research profile and ample collegiate teaching experience, decided to go teach high school, the first thing I'd do is spend a few summers teach one of the many pre-college programs my university offers as proof of my commitment to a career change and as the way to begin some necessary training.\n\nThey didn't hire you because **you were under-qualified** and, more importantly, unaware of that fact. They worry about fit because you have offered them no evidence that you are at all invested in the specific needs, pedagogical and otherwise, of this specific population and this specific vocation.",

                      "text": "Hun, I think you're missing the point. I'm referring to your question \"if a PhD doesn't teach us to teach, what will?\". Synthesis-synthesis answered this. A teaching qualification will teach you how to teach. And a PhD is really not a teaching qualification.\n\nI've worked in schools as a language assistant, worked at summer schools for three years, have done a few months of teacher training and am currently doing a PhD. I'm doing a PhD because it is EASIER than teaching high school. Like way, way, way easier.\n\nJust as you won't learn the languages you need for EAS in 6-12 months, you won't learn to teach high school students in a few weeks of \"training before the semester started\". Especially not with the attitude that you're 90% of the way there because of your PhD. You're not. You're at most 50% of the way there with your PhD. \n\nI would advise you to come back and reread what synthesis-synthesis wrote in a week or two because it's very good advice.\n\nEdit: I empathise with the dilemma you're facing regarding your desire to do a second PhD. Summary of this thread seems to be it's possible but you'd be a bit of a noodle to do so. If you want to do more research, you have to pursue tenure. That might be impossible but it's the only way forward. A second PhD will harm your chances, plus as a linguistic anthropologist studying Mongolia, I think it's bizarre you think you have the mandate to switch without any prior experience in the language and culture of East Asia??? If on the other hand you don't want to pursue tenure, your days of academic research are likely behind you and it's time to rediscover the pleasure of learning for learning's sake, at whatever pace that is possible while working full time.\n\nI want to alert you to the fact that although I'm sure you don't want to, you've said several things that have come across as relatively arrogant. Repeating that you were at an Ivy is one (and this is coming from someone who went to Oxford so no sour grapes here), also claiming you'd be a shoe-in for a tenure position if only there were more of them (sounds like you're not a shoe-in then, because those positions are filled), this whole 'being overqualified to teach at high school' stuff, and the idea that you'd be ok with 'just' a stipend (hello, a stipend is a relatively high salary?!). \n\nI share that boundless passion for learning, and I love learning about new languages and cultures, but I recommend you meditate on humility for a while and you may end up in a world that is far bigger and more exciting as a result. I really share that feeling of wishing I could just do PhD after PhD after PhD but at some point it is time to move on and find new ways of integrating financial stability, existential security and intellectual curiosity into your life in a balanced way.\n\nConcretely, if I was in your position, I'd take a well paid job for four-five years and save up the money for a master's in EAS whole pursuing language skills on the side of my full time job. Then I'd take a year or two to do that masters and enjoy the ability to be a researcher and a student again. Then I'd reassess my desire for a second PhD/further research.",

When working with younger students, you need to be prepared for the fact that most of them are literally incapable of working at a level of abstraction that an adult is used to and plan accordingly.\n\nTeachers are also often expected to think of fun extracurricular activities for their students, cooperate with other teachers (interdisciplinarity is all the rage in education science at the moment), interact with parents in a way that doesn't get them angry, etc. \n\nMost good/competitive schools also expect you to do pedagogical work, i.e. they have a certain ethos, certain values and ways of thinking that you need to instill into your students, etc. A candidate that shows awareness of these issues (or even active interest in them!) and has relevant experience in that area will be perceived as a \"better fit to the culture of the institution\" and will get the job before you do, simply because knowing all these things with a good enough knowledge of Latin will give you better outcomes than not knowing any of it but having mega-expert-level knowledge of Latin will.

You seem to be in the mindset that a bachelor is one 'level' above high school so it qualifies someone to teach high school, so a PhD must make you *super* qualified to teach high school which is just... not true. I've known people with PhDs who were brilliant experts in their field, amazing advisors to their students, but were *terrible* teachers to anyone who wasn't also highly specialized (i.e. undergrads). There's nothing wrong with that, not everyone needs to be a good teacher, my point is simply having a PhD in comparative literature tells people basically nothing about whether teaching high school would be a good fit for you. \n\nA lot of people have already told you this of course, I just wanted to put in my two cents. And also to tell you to please stop saying 'alas'.",

In *some* cases they will have courses on teaching, but those are still not universal. But as someone who routinely hires new faculty in a teaching-based institution (liberal arts college) I can tell you that nobody we hire lacks direct experience teaching their own classes. If you didn't get that experience during your Ph.D. that's unfortunate-- and one reason that UK Ph.D.s are often not competitive in academic hiring at PUIs in the US.\n\nWhen I was hired way back in the 1990s I had not only been a TA for multiple semesters, but had taught a half-dozen different courses independently at three different universities. Everyone in the applicant pool had a Ph.D. but I'm quite certain that all of the short-listed candidates had similar teaching experience. That was 25 years ago-- now it's simply non-negotiable for applicants at teaching-focused institutions in most fields. We simply do not hire people who have not taught as instructor-of-record, so it's their responsibility to get that experience during (or immediately after) their Ph.D..",

Even at my top ranked R1, teaching inevitably swallows so much time.\n\nMy previous post mentioned several of the relevant experiences a BA (or other PhD) applicant might have that demonstrates their competence and commitment: \"their resumes also include an MAT or three years of Teach for America or teaching/counseling at a summer camp or a Fulbright to each English.\" Presumably you're not intimately familiar with these candidates' resumes or job materials. Moreover, just because someone's highest degree is a BA doesn't mean that they went directly from the BA to a high school teaching position.\n\nI hope you make the decision that is best for you.
