I am trying not to let it affect my schoolwork and I\u2019m staying on top of things so far, but it\u2019s killing me and taking everything that I have in me to do my work. I don\u2019t know what to do, I feel like such a failure. I am afraid that if I reach out for help that I\u2019ll derail my progress in this program and my professors will think less of me. I am afraid that I\u2019m ruining my life and I need to just suck it up and get through it.",

              "text": "I say this with true concern, but I think you need to get therapy. No degree is worth dying by suicide for and you seem determined you have to do this the hardest way possible by ignoring your physical and mental needs. \n\nI'm a senior member of staff at a research institute. I've taken time off for mental health, I've had accomodations for exams, I once even missed half an exam because I got the timetable wrong and then cried in the exam hall while taking the exam. Fuck anyone who judged me and truthfully with the exception of a few AHs no one ever has. But I've also used those experiences to advocate for better systems and support. Being the best means looking after yourself so you can then deliver the good stuff. \n\nLook at it a different way. I trust and expect everyone who works for me to be able to manage their time and needs, and that includes knowing when they need help and support, when they need time off, when they need a mental health day. I expect my staff to take care of their health so that when they are working they're at their best. I don't see ignoring a mental health crisis and refusing support for disabilities as success. \n\nYou don't deserve to be this unhappy. You deserve good mental health and support to give you equity with others. Please, please take the help available to you. Mental health is like a rubber band - you can stretch it so far but if you stretch it too hard it never goes back. Don't break your mental health now for some future dream because you'll never be able to enjoy that dream if you aren't well enough to realise it. \n\nYou aren't a failure for having disabilities or mental health issues but you are failing yourself by not addressing them. Please, take care.",

You can't have one without the other (well, some people seem to manage without the former). How you get to the place where you deliver and have the skills and headspace to manage your career doesn't matter. You'll meet plenty of AHs in life but don't let them be your metric of self-worth, a good person will value what you bring to a situation and won't care that you need special software, extra time on deadlines, or whatever else that you need, because ultimately results talk. Focus on being in the best position to deliver your best self and hopefully you can find joy in that. Good luck.",

We see a lot of students who have difficulties of one sort or another and we really save our unhappiness for those who cheat, who don't bother to do their work, who blow off the class/program, who have never-ending excuses that don't have any background for them, and so on. Students who are having difficulties and go through the Disabilities Support folks are not seen as failures by the vast majority of professors in my 38 years of college experience.\n\nIf you're staying on top of it for now you're in a good position to get help without it being seen as some sort of fake attempt to get out of doing the work. Please get the help you need-that's what it's there for.\n\nMy daughter got her LLM in tax law 2 years after she finished law school and was in one of those \"you gotta be kidding me, how many hours do I need to bill?\" firms. It was very difficult to try to juggle both and she didn't have a PTSD background with your symptoms. She got help a couple of times and didn't find that anybody thought less of her. In fact, she became an adjunct at the law school after she finished her LLM.",
