  "title:": "Do you use social media to promote your research?",
  "text": "Over the past couple of months, I held multiple discussions with my colleagues in academia on whether journal publications are the best way to achieve impact. \n\nThere seems to be quite a difference in opinion between more senior colleagues (publications is the only way to share research) and younger colleagues (preprints and social media). \n\nAs I'm mostly active on LinkedIn, I decided to test it and I shared the PDF copy (author version) of the paper that I published a couple of years ago. I saw much higher engagement with the audience in a couple of days after I posted on LinkedIn than in 3 years since the manuscript was published on the journal website. I share more details on my approach to sharing research over here: [https://motivatedacademic.com/disseminate-research-social-media/](https://motivatedacademic.com/disseminate-research-social-media/) \n\nI wonder how do you share your research and what approaches you found most effective?",

For example, if a colleague or friend shares their latest publication on twitter, I might throw them a like or retweet, largely just because I know them. It's more of a \"hey congrats!\" than anything. However, I'm not going to cite their paper in my own work unless it is actually relevant . That's why I would agree that social media metrics are largely about popularity/size of personal networks, while citations (typically) are a better reflection of the true impact of your research on the field. Obviously there's a degree of self-citing and citing your friends that goes on, but I would still say a paper with 100 citations has made a far greater impact than a paper with no citations but 100 likes on social media. \n\nThat being said, social media can be useful for getting more visibility for your work, which would hopefully lead to more citations.",

Hence, \"likes\" fall to the well known traps of social media (click baits, flashyness, shallow popularity, herd behavior, etc) and becomes a poor (and less fair) metric.

The system for distributing money was intended to do it based on merit, but given the way human psychology works, it mostly does it based on popularity and career statistics.",

Your career isn't only going to be decided by stats that the hiring committees explicitly base their decisions on. Your connections and reputation help you get citations on your papers, get papers into high impact journals, get grants funded, and get onto short lists for jobs, and these are the main things determining your long term academic future. Having a big Twitter following helps massively with that, though it is also not the only factor and you can do well without it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: of course rereading your comment, it seems I just repeated your second point",

      "text": "I have a strong social media presence primarily because I run an art business on the side of my PhD. So my social media is a combination of my scientific research, art, and the intersect between the two. Good points raised from both sides in this thread. Some long thoughts from myself:\n\nSocial media requires an active presence and you do have to be 'smart' about its use. If you're using it for engagement for your research but post rarely, at random times of the day, while not interacting with others, then you won't get engagement. The algorithms are painful, but don't let them consume you. I just post whenever now, and am much happier than the daily posters I think.\n\nI have had more people look at my research thanks to sharing it on Twitter/Instagram/LinkedIn but not more citations. My artwork actually attracts interest first and then my research comes second. One aspect I enjoy is how social media forces me to communicate my research creatively and to a wider audience. I am in ecology though so this is much easier to do for our field than most (hence a strong ecology presence on social media)\n\nYou must be careful of what you say online. This goes for anything. Overall I'd say my favourite parts about social media are not to promote my research, but to make contacts and have important discussions in the research sector (look at the #Blackintheivory or #Phdchat twitter hashtags, for example). I made contacts with researchers on Twitter who sent me samples for my PhD research and we now maintain strong contact (email didn't work)\n\nFinally; people will try and find you online if you have any online presence at all. Someone with the exact same name as my hiring manager had looked at my LinkedIn profile two days after I applied for a job. Online presence must be maintained as strongly as real-life nowadays.\n\nAnyway, while I can see academics here that are all like \"fuck that noise\" about social media, I think it does have its benefits for discussion and sharing. Humans are social animals and being an academic doesn't suddenly make you exempt or \"greater\" than others for not using these platforms. There are a lot of tone-deaf professors out there who could really learn a lot by just witnessing discussions had here on Reddit or Twitter",

My project did not have funding for attending conferences and I could reach other academics and industry partners through Linkedin. I think social media could have a positive impact on research output on socially relevant topics as you could engage with the end-users of the research and explain it to them in simpler words.",
