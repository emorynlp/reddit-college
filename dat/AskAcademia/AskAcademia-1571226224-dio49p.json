  "title:": "I feel obliterated. Will I pass my PhD? Should I even bother?",
  "text": "This post has a trigger warning. \nWhen I [30F] started my PhD, my primary advisor raped me at a writing retreat. \nMy whole professional life hinged on this person, so I kept working with him. He had a stroke and then his partner was seriously ill for two years. During these two years, I waited without pushing for comments on manuscripts. That means I never published.\nHis partner died and shortly thereafter he asked me to a \"work lunch\" wherein he made inappropriate, sexually explicit comments. \n\nI collapsed in a panic attack. I finally filed an anonymous report to my university and had him removed as a supervisor. I was advised that this was the best course of action until I complete my PhD and finish off any papers with intellectual property rights. The anonymous report has no formal disciplinary action. \n\nTonight, I recieved an email from this person stating that I was a poor communicator and that my writing was too unclear to be publishable. He requested to be removed from all authorship and acknowledgements. Mind you, I've waited years for this feedback. All without publishing from my PhD. \n\nI should feel relieved that I no longer have to work with this person and I do. But I also feel stupid, worthless, and hopeless. Minimally put, his email was purposefully degrading and hostile. \n\nI'm sorry that this is a super self-pitying post. I just don't know if I should pull the plug on my PhD. I'm so tired and empty. What should I do? \n\n\n\nPs Perhaps someone can tell me if the writing was unclear?\n\nEDIT: Oh my gosh. I wish I could say tbat I've read all your feedback without a teary-eyed consumption of one-too-many old fashioneds, but that would be a lie! \nI took considerable note of all comments and will respond when sober.",

It's no wonder you feel worthless now.\n\nYou need to devise a realistic plan for graduating.  Find someone--a dean, a professor, an ombudsman--who you trust and who understands the situation.  Work with them to find out what your options are.  There may be possibilities you haven't thought of.\n\nAlso, start seeing a therapist.  The panic attack you describe sounds a lot like ptsd.  You will not be able to do your best work without dealing with it.  And you can deal with it.  It will get better with therapy.\n\nYou are not stupid or worthless.  Your writing is clear.  You're in a really hard place right now, but you have reason to be hopeful.  You can be hopeful because you have resources available to you that can lead you out of this situation.  The most important of those resources is your own ability.  Your ability to perform in your field and your ability to find support from the people around you.",

They aren\u2019t interested in your writing, they are only interested in controlling the situation and you. Don\u2019t let him manipulate you. \n\nIs there anyway you can get a female advisor? Not only because of this scenario but to also help you along the way with your own projects from others who know the road of academia. I had a female advisor and when she left I had to switch to a male, and considering a lot of my subjects were on female sexuality, that didn\u2019t bode well with my ultra conservative advisor. My former advisor had written a book on sexuality and it was not a problem previously. It was a welcomed subject. \n\nAlso, talking to someone will show you what your options are. Removing him from the University is something title IX can work on if it is something you want to report and might make this journey a lot less difficult if you don\u2019t have to worry about him creeping around the corner on you. \n\nDo not give up your dream because of him. This is your journey. You would not have been accepted unless the university recognized your skills. Talking to somebody can open doors for you to get time off to heal, if needed. Sadly you aren\u2019t the first person this has happened to and won\u2019t be the last. There are professionals who can help you and are familiar with these situations, even if you just want to keep it between you and a counselor.",

And \\[assaulter\\] can no longer take any female students. What more does she want?\" \n\nI pointed out what a great deal this was for \\[assaulter.\\] If he never could work with a female student again, in any capacity, he was now exonerated from serving on a fuck ton of committees.\n\nHe also  got to pass off half of his existing roster of students--the female students--to other professors, who would essentially finish his supervisory duties for him. \n\nPlus, this meant that no female student could really study \\[his field of study\\] at this university again, since he was the \\[field of study\\] expert. \n\nShe said, \"Well. I hadn't really looked at it that way.\" \n\nWhich,to me, was fucking astounding. \n\nPoint being: tenured professors talk a good game about liberalism and inclusiveness, but when the rubber meets the road, they are some of the most conservative, timid people on the planet. They will protect themselves, and the university, at all costs.",

So your options were basically:\n\n1. Waste years on current advisor, then continue to work with the current advisor who is a horrible person and other than that also does not appear very useful on the purely factual and intellectual part of his job.\n\n2. Waste years on current advisor, then find a new advisor who is supportive, and publish your papers with them.\n\nNormally option 2 would be a lot harder because your current advisor would get in the way, but he just got completely out of the way. \n\nDon't feel stupid and worthless, I am almost certain him asking to be removed is not due to the quality of your work. It seems much more likely that he was either told to gtfo, or realised that he could be screwed pretty hard because of your complaint, and that is why he wants to get as far as possible away from you as he can.\n\nI think your best bet is to ignore any of his opinions, find someone else to work with and publish the work you've done so far with them.",

I hope that you are able to get the help you need (friend vent sessions, counseling, etc.) to help you in processing all that has happened. I also hope that you are taking extra good care of yourself.\n\nThe university ombudsperson is a great resource.  Their job is not tied to protecting the university's butt, but rather acting as a mediator of conflict, or determining what (if anything) can be done within academic rules to help you.  If you identify as female, and there is a Women and Gender group on campus, seek them out as well.  Finally, I would go right to the university's Title IX office, if you haven't already and file a report - showing a copy of that email.  (You said you filed an anonymous report, but I don't know through which organization).   \n\nAs far as your publishing, if you have it in writing (and it sounds like you do) that this person wants off of all your publications, then guess what - you are in the driver seat now.  If there are other collaborators on the paper be sure to have them approve a draft before sending out for publication.  But, if it is now a solo-authored paper, go ahead and send it out and see what some reviewers have to say.  Since they will be in your field, they will be able to give you the most unbiased feedback (just be prepared for Reviewer #2....they have a reputation for a reason ;) ).  \n\nDo you have a new advisor who can help you finish out the program?  Depending on how far along you are, it may just be as simple as changing some paperwork.  \n\nHope this helps.  Hang in there!",

      "text": "OP, there is a lot of good advice in the comments section, especially those saying you should ignore your supervisors harsh words. He is probably just angry that he is no longer allowed to supervise, and he may not want to admit that to his students. So instead he claims the work is terrible and he wants to be removed from it and hope they won't find out he is banned from supervising.\n\nSecondly, find a new supervisor! Everyone gets an overwhelming amount of criticism on the early drafts for their papers - the only difference is you have been waiting years to get it. Your papers would probably look completely different today if he had given you feedback earlier, or done his job and had someone step in when he was unable to supervise you years ago.\n\nIf you are scared to have someone else look at your work now, remember that a good supervisor would *never* give feedback like you got here. They would give you constructive criticism and help you improve your writing instead. Keep that in mind going forward. Talk to your department and get a graduation plan and a new supervisor NOW. Your department will probably do everything they can to help you get back on track again, and give you the supervision you have not been getting for the last two years.",

You were waiting for legitimate professional feedback. You didn't get that. You got a personal attack thinly veiled as \"feedback\" on your writing. The person is a complete ass. That's him, not you. He knows he has done something truly awful (both legally and ethically) and he is on the defense and attacking you in a most unprofessional passive-aggressive way.\n\nI'm really so sorry about this. You have amazing strength and stamina to have stayed with the program and gotten as far as you have. But you don't always have to be strong. It is ok to be upset and experience those emotions. Be kind and patient with yourself.",

I'm glad you filed a report and removed him from your academic life, I would advise you to not stop there and eliminate him fully from your life. A restraining order if need be, that creep asshole sending you emails using his last chance at trying to make you feel shit.\n\nI hope he has a worse end than his partner.",

I'm sure if your dissertation writing is anything like this that problems with comprehension aren't due to style. idk about ideas though. I work on renaissance literature so I read all kinds of prose lol",

You have to salvage your situation, which might mean leaving- doing what is best for you is the metric of success. The PhD has shaped you, that\u2019s what counts.  There should be a lot of people to help tell you what\u2019s going on with your writing.     \nTo be honest, having someone want their name removed is pretty harsh. If I were you, I might consider finding a sympathetic ear to be a new advisor, start fresh with them to salvage what you have, explaining that you have been trapped in an authority power situation and maybe mastering out with whatever you can fix in 6 months to a year. Get support from the department head or program advisor and work together to find this person who will lead you out.  Don\u2019t worry about publication or IP rights, because you won\u2019t have those anyways if things go any further south.   \nAlso, know that this last part is hell and you need to be ready for it.  \nThe writing can be less than good and you can finish, as long as there is a complete story there. Chances are, few will ever read it, so don\u2019t beat yourself up over that too much.",
