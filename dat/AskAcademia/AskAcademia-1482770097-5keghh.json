  "text": "This is a little off topic, but why is it that every post I see here says they're at a top ranked university? Surely there are some people that went to shitty state schools like me. It's just every post says \"top 5 university\" or \"in a top program in the country.\" Is it people just inflating their ego? Everyone can't be at an Ivy (which are arguably not a top school anymore anyway).",

They were extremely knowledgeable and often easier to consult with than the professor. \n\nI did have two classes taught by graduate students though. The first was my introductory statistics class taught by a woman who had taught statistics and calculus in a high school (she had a MS Mathematics) for five years before deciding to return to college for a PhD in Statistics. The second was a sociology class on ethics in technology taught by a person with a MS Computer Science who had served as an ombudsman in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration for six years after he finished his masters before returning to college to get a PhD in Sociology.\n\nAs for the rest of my classes, they were taught generally by extremely passionate professors that would make themselves available at any hour for any reason to every single one of their students. There were three classes where that wasn't the case.\n\nYou don't know anything about how the large universities work. Often times teaching engineering and science can actually be easier with large classes because students come from all backgrounds and often have very relevant insights to add.\n\nThen there's the humanities where the classes are much smaller. My girlfriend got get bachelors degree in English and had a max class size of twenty with an average class size of 12 after her freshman year. And that's the norm in that college.",

Is there an opportunity to get meaningful research experience with someone who can likewise write me a letter? If I want to do an independent study or a summer at the Middlebury Language School, can the university fund that? There are structural (let's call them) idiosyncrasies that large publics have that top privates don't. Somewhere like Berkeley has some of these problems too, but is saved by the caliber of its research and students. \n\nI'm sure Ohio still offers a world-class education, on a global scale, and I'm sure lots of smart people go to Ohio. I'm not really making an indictment against you personally either. I'm sure the school produces, on average, good specialists - in engineering or in English. But relatively few, in comparison to top privates, of them go on to research or to pioneering companies in industry, and I'm sure it's not entirely due to lack of interest in these positions. ",

There was never a student turned away who asked to do research.\n\nAs for letters of recommendation, you probably know a few professors by your senior year because you don't have TAs in most classes to ask for help. In fact, I know of almost no classes that had one after my sophomore year. I knew that most classes had graders but I never talked to one of them nor knew who they were.\n\nAs for funding research abroad or at the university, yeah they will fund it. At Ohio State, 80% of undergraduate research proposals are funded by the university. The 20% that aren't? Almost all of them failed to follow the very simple requirements of the proposal process such as detailing the goal of their research and their proposed schedule and proposed work products. I was funded for one and a half years to work in a lab. During that time, all of my housing, travel, and food costs were covered. They even sent me to a conference. My last semester didn't even cost me a single penny because the university covered it. I didn't even have the best funding that I could have gotten because I missed a couple of deadlines due to personal reasons.\n\nI knew of at least thirty students just in the sciences (soft and hard) and engineering that received funding to research abroad for one or more semesters. There were probably even more that received funding directly from their group or department. Either way, we had over 2,000 undergraduate students from the university present their research at our yearly research forum every year.",

Tier 1 Research University is their highest grading of research output per faculty member, research quality, research capabilities, graduate student enrollment per faculty member, graduate student graduation rate, average number of citations per year per faculty member, and other metrics used to track the quality of a research institute.\n\nSure it's not a rating of the undergraduate program at all. And there aren't really any good, objective ratings of undergraduate programs. But the USDOE's classification system for research universities is extremely accurate in terms of being able to predict the likelihood of success (that is, the production of publications from a grant yielding new information to a field) and the career trajectories of graduate students from those universities. Additionally, there is a large mountain of evidence showing that undergrad graduates from Tier 1 Research Universities tend to be better\u200b prepared for the work force and have a higher average earning potential over their lifetime when compared to other undergrad graduates from  non-Tier 1 Research Universities.",

People who aren't from a top ranked university will not say so. People who are from a top ranked university want to point that out. From who are from a fairly normal university which is top of their field or at a subpar dept in an otherwise high ranked university like lying to themselves (I'm guilty of the latter). \n\n3) Selective Memory. People who say they're from top-ranked unis stand out, people who don't mention it just don't. \n\nAlso, given how we get posts from undergrads to profs, and the average University has more than 10k students (and we're a global population to boot!), we don't really get that many people. For all we know, we could just be the total students from harvard and cambridge combined, running towards an anonymous community rather than connecting directly with our fellow students because our impostor syndrome has ruined our chances of connecting to our peers.",

                  "text": "At the PhD level everyone will respect an Ivy in AS, but they don't really represent the cutting edge anymore. They're still among the best places for a BA in the field, due to language training and resources, though. For MH, they typically have 1 or fewer professors researching in the field, while OSU has 5+ who do nothing else. One of the ways to tell is sheer faculty count, another is to check where the alumni of the program wind up teaching. Hawaii and OSU send people in their respective fields to jobs at all the other top schools, for example. Another way is journal output, although that speaks more to research in the field than teaching.\n\nEdit: reposted because mobile is dumb. \n",

Spent a summer interning in NYC and found out I was wrong. The judgement I faced from not being at a small private mock-Ivy was insane. I hope they're all enjoying their debt. \n\nNow I'm in a ranked masters program at a large state school. To me, this school is prestigious, but to a lot of my colleagues, this school is another country bumpkin safety school. The amount people talk down their own degrees is insane. ",
