  "text": "My best friend's father is Surinamese, and he used to work at a university in Suriname before moving to the US and teaching. When I asked him what it was like working there, he told me that it was awful, and he knew he had to get out of Suriname if he wanted to really do any serious research in his field. Is it really as bad as he makes it out to be?",

      "text": "I used to be a researcher in the Philippines.\n\nI'm already one of the lucky ones as I'm in the top university and part of a project with one of the highest fundings.\n\nThis funding was still small compared to what is available in developed countries Our lab barely had any budget and equipment.\n\nIt was so hard to spend what available budget we had because of all the red tape. It would take more than a month to get a purchase approved. Sometimes orders for chemicals/equipment would take up to 6 months. I have witnessed another project take up the whole 2 year duration just procuring equipment and never get to actually get them delivered. A research project is usually 70% trying so hard to get to spend the budget and 30% actually doing research.\n\nI don't think funding is a problem but getting to actually spend that funding in a timely manner (if spent at all) is the problem. Another is it's quite difficult to collaborate with other labs because of how touchy they are with their equipment (understandable). There was this lab where I was requesting to use one of their equipment and they would've let me but it was missing a replacement part the size of a screw and they said I had to wait 3 months because their order had just been processed.\n\nAs a government-funded institution in a country with a culture of corruption. The commission on audit tries to make it hard for every bit of purchase to be approved. It is by law that every purchase above ~$20 has to have three quotations before it is approved. Imagine having to request 3 quotations from suppliers for just about every item to be purchased.\n\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that our bureau of customs for importing goods and products is one big pool of corrupt government workers on ALL levels. I mean from bottom to top.\n\nThis is why there is a trend to just go with computational research to at least have an output.\n\nBefore we even get our hands on what we ordered, it is already time to write the final report on the project.\n\nIt's so unfortunate because I have met some of the most passionate and skilled researchers in my life at our institution even compared to those I encounter now that I am a researcher in a developed country.",

      "text": "Also South American, but Brazilian here.\n\nWe almost had a good run between 2003 - 2010. More universities opened, we had more federal grants (although we made almost no money from it), more students in grad school, more international exchange programs and funding for events. Still, our unis had awful structure, from classrooms to lab materials and libraries. The older teachers said they finally felt valued, but the younger ones were still frustrated.\n\nThings started to deteriorate until 2016, when everything went sideways. A constitutional amendment capsized funding for education and research for 20 years. Fewer students were applying to universities and grad school due to money issues. Grad programs have NO federal Grants due the amendment and were not renewing the signed contracts. No new funding for research was opened.\n\nNot only that, but also authoritarian things started to happen. Bolsonaro included an ideological component in the scarce funding openings, so nothing \"communist\" would get money. This goes from LGBT rights researches to deforestation monitoring centers. Bolsonaro supporters began to walk in classes to \"monitor\" the professors, so they don't teach anything \"communist\". If the teacher do, they start to shout over and stop the class. \n\n\nMe and many colleagues took part in the brain drain movement. I live my country, but I have no conditions to do my job there.",

I actually Googled it front of her so that it showed her that millennia means thousands. You could almost see the loading symbol in her face as she grappled with her ego that she was wrong on something so simple and so easy to look up. Her response was \"change it to thousands of years so your examiners don't get confused.\"\n\nGoogling is like...what researchers are meant to be good at lol.",

The country is small and there are only a few universities so obviously there isn't a range of options for what you can study, plus universities can't attract the most competitive PIs. Some of these problems are because Croatia is in the global periphery, some because of inherited Yugoslav institutions and norms. The government of Croatia actually prioritizes research and innovation (or say they do), but on the ground it's obvious that it takes more than EU membership to develop a functioning innovation ecosystem.",

      "text": "In academia, money talks and bullshit walks. Developing countries do not have money (or money of any value that is), sure they can print their currency (but the goods produced from said currency is poor). So with mass corruption, no money and politics (both in academia and government), little money is given where it is needed and a lot of it is funnelled into the pockets of corrupt government officials, corrupt university chancellors and corrupt project investigators.\n\nSay for an example, a project got a $20,000 grant, immediately $10,000 would be taken by the government official, the university chancellor would take $5000, now we are left with $5000. The project investigator pockets $1000 and now we have $4000. A $20,000 project has to run with a fifth of the revenue and produce results, this leads to mass delay, poor retention of workers and poor output. Half the time results are fudged because there was no money to really conduct the experiment.\n\nSo with poor wages and poor output, good researchers leave. This leads to further decline in these universities, the sh\\*t stays (because they can take corruption money and they have no chance of doing reputable research) and the talent walks. Rinse and repeat.",
