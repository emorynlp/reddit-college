  "title:": "P.I. not emailing back after visiting lab for Postdoc",
  "text": "I visited two labs as possible options for a Postdoc. Both were enthousiastic about the visit and told me I could start there. I ended up picking one with the lab atmosphere that suited me the most and send an email to that P.I.. It's now almost a week later and I haven't received a reply. This has happened with the same person in the application process already so she probably just forgot to answer. How soon should I contact her again and what should I say? I can't wait indefinitely because I have to contact the other P.I. to say I won't go there but I don't want to do this before confirmation by the other P.I.. Also how should I decline the offer of the other P.I. ? The said person has a rather large ego, paid for my hotel stay and seems to be thinking it's a done deal but I'm currently still collaborating with this person for my PhD project so I cannot offend him. \n\nAdvice is very welcome \ud83d\ude09",

      "text": "If it's been a week, go ahead and send a follow up email. If they rely on their admin a lot, cc their admin. Busy PIs prioritize based on urgency and time required to respond. So, one strategy is to phrase your email as a yes or no question. Make it short and super easy to reply. A second strategy is to ask for some info that seems important (e.g. start date). A third approach is to be straightforward. Tell them you have another offer and want to confirm their offer before declining the other one. Tell them you have to respond by Friday or something.",

      "text": "It might be that they are trying to get the offer letter together through their department. I would email them again, and CC an administrative assistant if they have one, telling them that you want to join their lab and that you need written confirmation that it is a done deal so you can turn down another lab.\n\nAs for turning down the other lab, I think you just thank them for their time and for the offer and say that it was a really tough decision but you decided to go with someone else.",
