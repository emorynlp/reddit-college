  "text": "I'm just two months into my PhD program, in a different field from the one I was in for my master's studies. My PhD supervisor was aware about this from when I was still applying and they still accepted me as their student since my MSc degree is related to one aspect of the dissertation.\n\nThis was an advertised position so I know that there's a predefined project for me. It's just that, my supervisor wrote the capsule proposal and the timeline of my entire PhD studies I should have written myself as this is one of the requirements of the program. The capsule proposal included aspects of my thesis like a short introduction, research questions, objectives, materials and methods, and so on. It's a short overview of what I'm expected to do in the next 4-5 years basically. I know that they're much more knowledgeable on this topic than I would ever be (at least for the duration of my PhD studies), but shouldn't they have given me a bit of freedom in writing the capsule proposal myself?\n\nI tried to do my own version of the capsule proposal and submitted it to my supervisor, and in the email I admitted that I found writing it a bit difficult as everything is new to me. Especially the terms they usually use in writing scientific articles in this particular field. I expected that there would be heavy corrections from my supervisor, and I was right. They also pointed out that there were a lot of terms/phrases in my version that weren't appropriate (which I already admitted to them). I was told to just stick with the original proposal they've written and to tweak some parts so maybe I can add a personal touch to it.\n\nNow I feel like I'm a fraud for not submitting a capsule proposal that I didn't entirely write on my own. My other friends in other programs wrote their proposals themselves, and did a back and forth with their supervisors for the revision. But at least they owned their projects. Is this how it is for some of you? If yes, how did you deal with this kind of situation moving forward?\n\nI'm sorry if I'm a bit incoherent right now. I've been really anxious about venturing into a new field, and it doesn't really help that my supervisor isn't paving the way for me to be an independent researcher. It feels like I'm not being mentored properly at the early stages of my studies.\n\nI'm all ears and would be very grateful for any tips/advice you have for my situation. :(",

Remember part of your current role as a PhD is to learn from your advisor (and others currently in the field). I\u2019m certain that there will be room for you to express your own thoughts and ideas throughout your PhD as you learn more about this research area.",
