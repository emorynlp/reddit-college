  "title:": "Is a healthy work/life balance possible for an academic?",
  "text": "I\u2019m coming up on the end of my MA in forensic psychology and data science, and I\u2019m struggling deciding what I want to do next. \n\nI love research - I love getting wrapped up in a project, crunching data, solving problems. I also love teaching and mentoring students. In a lot of ways being a professor at a university would be my dream job. \n\nHOWEVER, between my schooling and various jobs I\u2019ve held over the time I\u2019ve been in school, I\u2019ve been working 60-100 hours a week for the past 7 years. I\u2019m soooooo tired of the pace, and am dreaming of the day I can just work normal hours Monday-Friday and actually be able to take vacations. \n\nDoes anyone in academia get to have that kind of work/life balance? When I look at the profs I know, every one of them seems to work at least as much as I currently do, sometimes even more. They\u2019re all over-committed, stressed, and constantly juggling a million things. My supervisor\u2019s version of a vacation is when she \u201conly\u201d works 30 hours in a week, or she\u2019ll turn off her email notifications for 24 hours. I had a virtual meeting with another prof I\u2019m working with last week and she was camping with her family, but was still working through the trip.\n\nI\u2019m willing to keep this pace up for a while longer, but not for the rest of my life. As much as I love my work, I love a lot of other things too. \n\nTLDR: Are there any academics out there who feel they\u2019ve got a healthy work/life balance?\n\nEdit to add I\u2019m in Canada",

      "text": "I think it's possible, but you need to be really sure of your ability to set boundaries, and also choose advisors who will respect those boundaries. I worked a 9-5 for two years and maintained am excellent work/life balance. I thought going into my PhD I'd be able to keep those boundaries for myself, but it's much easier said than done. My advisor is a workaholic, and while she doesn't state it explicitly, she expects her students to be the same way. Given that so many people in academia genuinely LOVE Being workaholics, it can get very isolating, and take a huge toll on your self esteem, to feel like you're always doing less than your peers. \n\nAnyway, I'd say it's definitely possible, but you need to make sure you choose your academic support system carefully, clearly state your boundaries from the get go, and don't let yourself fall down the rabbit hole of saying yes to more work than you can realistically take on during a 40-hour work week (no matter how desperate your advisor is for data)\n\nEdit: I'm in a biology PhD program in the US.",

If you were a factory worker that never gets tired maybe, but in reality there's only so many hours per day your brain can focus and come up with clever thoughts. If I'm writing, I can really only do good work for 4 hours. After that, I'll be editing and rewriting a lot. North Americans are deep into this culture of overworking and under paying. If you really want a well balanced academic life you'll likely need to leave US/Canada. I'm in the UK and work 9:30 to 4:30. And my best is really working 6 hours per day, that's when I do no procrastination at all, super efficient work. I work longer hours for the chitchat with my students and other faculty. \nAnd in case you're wondering, I've got a big lab currently with nearly 20 Msc and PhD students, two postdocs, and I'm in one of the UK top universities. So yes, working 7 hours per day hasn't really prevented me from getting to where i am. And I have two small children.",

The projects are very small. Whereas in NA we do the equivalent of MPhils in most programs, which in sciences requires research experience prior to admission in the MSc, getting your own funding, etc.\n\nI am also aware of UK postdocs who obtained their positions without ANY publications during their PhDs. Everyone in the UK seems to finish their PhDs on time, unlike in the US where it is common to hear of people who are taking longer. But then in the UK they are stuck in a neverending cycle of unstable associateships, no job permanence, low pay and no prospects. There are people who have PDRAs for 6+ years. Yikes.\n\nFrom the outside I wonder if the UK can afford to gave a cavalier attitude just seems like the environment just requires a less competitive attitude. The kid working 60-70 hrs per week is probably doing enough to get himself a good chance at permanemce at the end.",

But in the institution I work at, good masters students get good papers out of their MSc projects, and with (lots of) luck even in Science/Nature. But sure, other institutions have different standards. PhDs work completely different in different countries, and in the UK student cannot spend 1h more than 4 y exactly unless they had sick or maternity leave. There are also some archaic rules about self-plagiarism that means lots of students leave their PhD without publications. The academic market here is awful at the moment, money for research is harder and harder to get ( unless you work in AI or covid) but tell me one country where it is better.  I have lots of unemployed colleagues in the US , so there is certainly not better.\n\nLook, I've worked 10 hours per day before, when I didn't have a family. And working 10 hours usually means a lot of procrastination, a lot of needless interactions, a lot of work that needs to be redone. When working in the field collecting data, i would do 14 h per day. But that's a different type of brain power needed.  For editing work of students,  admin,  writing grants and papers, nobody can do high quality work for 10 hours per day. \n\nI bet most people who say they work 10 hours per day actually work 6 or 7 hours,  then go out for lunch dinner, coffee, smoke, a walk, endless walks to the bathroom, some YouTube and Facebook in the middle.",

No one is forcing them and it's not all intellectual work. I'm not trying to suggest that someone should stare at a computer for 100 hours a week. \n\nI'm trying to address the misconception that some Europeans have have that North Americans work hard for the sake of working or because we are exploited. Our work habits are in large part due to a culture that encourages working hard to be competitive, which means doing a variety of tasks (not all mental) to stay competitive. That can easily take up 70hrs per week, especially in the early years where there is a lot of competition to take up top spots.\n\nOP is an MSc student, which is why I use that example. I am not trying to suggest that MSc students in the UK don't publish, but rather saying that they do not need to do **nearly** as much to get in or out of their MSc programs and that explains the time, effort and work differential. As I said, our MScs are more on par with the UK's MPhil's and there is a huge difference in terms of admission requirements, funding expectations, TAships/RAships, primary research exposure, size of project, expectation, etc. That means more work to get in and finish. That accounts for the amount of work, not self-flaggelation or exploitation.",

      "text": "For most academics, work/life balance doesn't happen. However it is possible. Here are your two main paths to work/life balance in academia. \n\n1) Work your tail off through grad school, post-doc and then as a tenure track asst prof. Downshift once you get tenure. Challenge: you will now have worked so hard and so long that you might not know how to stop striving at that point, might not know how to have fun, etc. \n\n2) Choose a \"low-prestige\" academic path from the get-go. I don't mean this in a derogatory way; just that pressure is much higher in places that are high-status. Challenge: you will still work just as hard as many of your less-educated friends who are making much more money than you in other fields. \n\nAdditional points:\n\n\\- Even high-status university pay is usually very low until you are at a senior rank and can begin to call the shots. This is partly what keeps the tenured folks striving for more and more achievements - to finally earn what they think they are worth. \n\n\\- All along the way, through grad school (etc), there are some paths that are MUCH more work than others, mostly pertaining to the personal style of the specific labs, departments, etc. Try to find a friendly environment and you may just survive.\n\n\\- A lot of it boils down to your 'destiny' - not in a preordained way, but in terms of having insight into what you really want out of life and what your personal preferences, patterns and rhythms are (and knowing how these will change over time). You have to really want and need this path to make it work; as with acting and a lot of other career paths, there is greater demand than supply of academics and so the competition is stiff. \n\n\\- How efficient are you? If you can get much more done, much more quickly than most of your peers, this is a positive sign about your ability to pull it off. If you're not very efficient (most people aren't - burning hours per day just chatting with colleagues, etc.) then the deck is stacked against you for work/life balance.",

Tech? \n\nYes, we all know that one person who has that anomalous job where they send 3 emails from home before 11 AM and gets to call it a day, but forget the weird outliers. There aren't many jobs/professions where it's a hardship to have to go to the office 4 whole days of the week, or where you're really paying your dues having to be at work by 9. Are there a lot of Americans here with idealized visions of a Western European job? Or who have just never worked a gig outside academia?",

I work roughly 35-40 hours a week (except during the first week of the semester, midterms, and finals week), going into the office once a week for a full day. Due to covid, 60% of the college is still fully online, so I chose to teach remotely again this semester. I\u2019m done with work at 4pm when my partner gets home from his job.",

                  "text": "LOL my friend once even said to me (who worked in industry) 'I am glad I dropped out of grad school when I see you work...'\n\nEven one lawyer was like --do you not get to take time off?\n\nBut in a way it just seemed normal to work though a vacation. That's kind of how academia is...\n\nMost academics really like this because their life and friendships revolve around academia so it's not so bad but sometimes I wish it was less all-reaching. It kinda takes over your life. This is not something I have seen my professional friends struggle with in the same way--there is more distance they can create.\n\nI'm not complaining BTW...I'm just saying it is a rather intrusive kind of profession but one where you create some of the intrusions voluntarily.",

      "text": "With a newborn son (now 2 years old) and a wife who's had to spend some time in hospital, I've been forced to work no more than 35 hours a week the last 2 years. Even finding 35 hours was a struggle sometimes.\n\nIt is possible. It means not wasting time during the hours that you've allocated for work, and being selective about what you work on. I could not do all the course development I wanted to, or follow every speculative research idea. I had to pick a few things to work on and focus on those.\n\nIt also means killing your perfectionism. Academia tends to attract perfectionists, who then get things up to their personal standards by putting in huge numbers of hours. Instead, get things as good as you can in the hours available. You can always improve them next year\n\nAfter a few years of working this way, I think it might be better.",

      "text": "My mentor is super accomplished and revolutionised his field, when I went to get my MPhil he told me it would take being in lab from 9 to 5 Mon to Fri, that was enough for him. Of course my supervisor had very different expectations and was bullying me into being constantly in the lab. I think you need to do a lot of research around the PI you choose to work with. Most will be workaholics, but maybe you'll be lucky enough to find someone like my mentor.",
