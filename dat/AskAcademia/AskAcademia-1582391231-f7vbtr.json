  "text": "\\*Throwaway because this is kinda sensitive and I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet\n\nI was googling my name just because, and on the second page of the results there's a webpage from another PhD student claiming I'm an awful person, that I've engaged in academic dishonesty, that I've tampered with the results in my papers, and that the \"research\" section on my website has words that are stolen from other people. These claims are 100% false and there isn't any evidence given, this person is just claiming it.\n\nOn one hand, I want to absolutely destroy this person's academic career, have everyone know they're a liar, and see them publicly shamed for being a steaming shit of a human being. But exposing the lies means publicising them.\n\nAlso, I'm not in the US (in the UK) and I'm not interested in suing anyone. I just don't know how to resolve this since there isn't a clear place to raise non-university complaints where I am. I can think of 3 senior people at my university who I trust enough to talk to (and actually know): my PI, the institute director, and the head of graduate research.\n\nHow do I bring this up? Should I make it public? Do I message the person privately and ask them wtf the page is about? Has anyone had to deal with someone spreading nasty rumours before? \n\n--------------------------\n\n**The details:**\n\n - I don't really know this person (Hayley\\*). We both applied to the same PhD program, were both accepted to work under the same PI, but only I got funding. But Hayley and I weren't even competing for the same funding and there was room for both of us in the group, so we have no \"beef\". I met her through Twitter - *she* reached out to *me* and told me she'd applied to the same program. All of our interactions have been through Twitter and they're either pleasant or neutral, but I've always gotten the feeling that she thinks she's better than me. Despite clearly both being first-year PhDs who got into competitive programs, she has repeatedly tried to give me (unsolicited) advice on conferences and publishing even though it looks like I actually have more experience in those areas. Otherwise we just like and retweet each other's stuff.\n\n - Hayley is more popular/well-known than I am. She has tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and is friends with people who have 100,000+, and I have ~100. Edit: she has also been interviewed, advised for popular sci-fi movies, gone on TV and radio, etc. If this becomes \"a thing\" then I think people will want to side with her or try to excuse her behaviour before they believe me. I've seen people be accused of things a bunch of times, they get absolutely piled on and abused, and then there's no real compensation when they're proven innocent and people just continue to believe the lies. I don't want to be that person; I have a history of depression and severe anxiety and I don't think I could handle it. \n\n - **I think my PI likes her better.** He's talked about how great a student she is and how disappointed he was when she didn't get funding, and he doesn't give me the same praise (that I know of), which makes me feel like I was always playing second fiddle to her. He even wants us to go to the US at some point to visit her group and collaborate. I don't care if anyone else in the department/university investigates her claims just to prove they're false, but if I ask my PI for help and he starts investigating her claims as though they have *any* potential weight to them, does that mean he doesn't fully trust me? I don't think I could continue working with him if he took her word on this for even a second.\n\n - The page is hosted by Hayley's website (e.g. hayleysmith.com/street-hat-is-a-liar) but if I just go to her website homepage, I can't navigate to the page through any links or menus. It seems to only be accessible by direct link, but you can find that direct link if you google my name (I have a very uncommon name, probably unique). So maybe she didn't mean to publish it or doesn't think it's visible? \n\n - Hayley is generally pretty polished from what I've seen online, and the page is not - it's just text, and my name is all lowercase. Maybe it's a mental illness thing? Not an excuse for what she's done, but could mean she gets sympathy and a free pass. \n\n - I'm a first-year PhD who no one really knows in academia, so this could really hurt me professionally. Even if I show everyone how much of a petty, lying piece of shit she is, I'm going to look like a trouble-maker. I don't know how many people have seen the page or if she's been spreading lies on other platforms/in person.\n\nI'm no longer seeing red about this (I'm still really pissed), but now I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. I don't know why she hates me.",

Say that you found this by googling your name, you are very concerned that it exists, and you don't know what to do about it and need help dealing with it. \n\nNo statements or demands, just \"Wow, I don't know what to do with this, please help\". \n\nIt's a big move to escalate it immediately to integrity and legal, but my concern is that if you don't, your advisor will sweep this under the rug, essentially allowing \"Hayley\" to get away with it, and this will embolden her to escalate her behavior and damage your career.\n\nBecause you are a first year, if your PI doesn't support you in this, you might want to shop around for a different PI before you are too deep in a project.",

They might only liaise with the director/institute, since they say on their page they don't service individual staff members. Now I think about it, talking informally to the director first might be the best bet so he can point me towards the right offices. \n\nI really hope my PI supports me.

Otherwise it's pretty irresponsible unless they don't actually care about any of the information they're getting and just need to be able to say they hired a consultant.",

Your PI HAS to be impartial, which means they HAVE to assume what shes saying is as potentially true as what you are saying, until evidence shows either way. So what I'm saying is don't be mad at them for initially seeming impartial then coming down on your side. They HAVE to appear impartial to begin with I think. If you don't feel like they immediately take your side, don't be offended. They may in fact fully agree with you, but just not be able to openly say so without having investigated more.\n\n3 -  \"**I think my PI likes her better** \"\n\nWell maybe, I don't know. We all have favourites even though we shouldn't. OR, he might compliament her in front of you, and you in front of her. \"Hayley\" might be wondering why he likes you more than her too.

I would then ask for an apology from the person who wrote it in recognising the fabrication, and then ask for mediation if I felt like this would become an issue. The fact is, my professional standing is priority and if someone feels insecure about my accomplishments then they need to be dealt with from their end. These situations make University life incredibly toxic. It\u2019s the worst part of the whole thing, dealing with some shit like this about others egos. The smart ones know this, and learn to give up their ego as it gets in the way of discovery. At least that\u2019s how I see it. You need to escalate this because otherwise your allowing this toxic person in your immediate environment and it may affect others. I\u2019ve seen faculties destroyed because one of these types get into positions then hire their other overvalued, self important friends who publish by the synthesis of others. Academic enterprise is not far from building houses of cards. In the end it\u2019s the students who suffer. This person should be elevating you, and you them. Hah!",

It\u2019s incredibly normal and not at all surprising. The world is not so black and white though: good people do bad things. Maybe she was having a bad day and venting and didn\u2019t realize that it was public. Maybe she and you had some kind of cascading failure of miscommunication that sparked it. Maybe she wrote it as a joke or troll post. There are a lot of explanations that *aren\u2019t* \u201cshe\u2019s evil.\u201d \n\n> If it wasn't written in duress, and she didn't write it because she's awful and wants to ruin my career, the only thing left is that she wrote it because she genuinely believes it.

Even if we assume she wrote it because she genuinely believes it that **doesn\u2019t necessarily mean** you did something wrong. Misinterpretations of your actions are typically *her fault* and not yours. You are certainly not blameworthy for her writing it.\n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t think that your trichotomy at the beginning is true though I\u2019m not interested in litigating it. **The bottom line is that you are not to blame and you should not assume others think poorly of you**. This is really hard to do, but it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s totally reasonable for you to feel stressed, scared, or worried. It\u2019s difficult, but learning to move on from inexplicably bad social interactions and not letting your social anxiety ruin interactions with others is an extremely important skill to build. Everyone experiences things like this, and you will experience it again in the future. Learning to let it go is one of the best things you can do.\n\n> If it's mental illness, at least I can see it as some random thing that I don't deserve, even if I don't forgive her for it.\n\nIt is a random thing that you don\u2019t deserve.
