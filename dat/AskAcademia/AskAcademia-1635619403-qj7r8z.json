  "text": "Hope y'all are well. I am currently preparing to defend my thesis next month (PhD in molecular bio) so I am searching for employment. Doe anyone know any good resources I could check out for preparing these documents?\n  \nFor context, I am not planning to continue with a PDF. Ideally I would like to work in industry or remain in academia as a project manager or something.\n  \nI have been in school for 11 years and it has been a while since I have had to update my files for job applications. Any help would be appreciated!",

My recommendation for cover letters is to use it to tell the story your resume doesn\u2019t tell- such as more about you as a person.",
