  "text": "Tl;Dr can just be the questions at the bottom\n\nAs a new postdoc in stem in a relatively new field that is somewhat related to my thesis but different overall applications, I am feeling overwhelmed by the fact that I don't know what's an acceptable 'productivity level'.\n\nMy PI is very chill and relatively nice to work with, and I have a ton of guidance from one of the other PIs I work with. Even so, I constantly feel behind in learning and in producing actual progress. So far no one's said anything to me about my progress being slow, but that doesn't mean I won't stress out about it lol. Especially comparing my progress to other PhD students and new postdocs in the group, I feel  ...slow.\n\nI do work less than typical academic, about 25-30 hours a week of 'focused' work and meetings, mainly because I have chronic fatigue both mentally and physically and it's feeling like it's holding me back. \n\nI've taken a vacation recently to help get over post-phd burnout and I feel more motivated to get things done, but no matter how hard I try, I just always feel like I can't work as many hours and be as focused and productive as everyone else.\n\nNote that I've been this way even throughout grad school, and it was a struggle then as well. But now the stakes are higher and I just want my career to take off with more momentum.\n\nI guess my questions are \n\n1) if my PIs aren't voicing any concerns, should I assume I'm at least working up to the 'expectation' they had set for my output? Or should I directly ask if I'm making good enough progress?\n\n2) how do academics battle the mental fogginess and fatigue (especially in mornings and late afternoons for me)? That's like 4-5 hours a day where I'm just a zombie. I sleep 8-9 hours a day, I eat well, I exercise, ...I'm out of lifestyle changes to make lol\n\nThanks for reading my long post! I hope to get some support from this community because I don't have any academic/postdoc friends to talk to unfortunately.",

              "text": "My inability to work for extended periods of time, post-phd vacation in hopes that it would help my post-doc, the super chill PI who keeps saying that I'm doing just fine (or great, or excellent \u2014 it doesn't matter, he must be lying). Check, check, check!\n\nI'm useless until about 10am, and that's when all of my meetings start, then I get tired after lunch and burn out completely by 4 unless there is something seriously keeping my interest.\n\nI think part of the problem is that my post-doc work is so much more up to me. It's very free form, I just need to get stuff done by deadlines that I set myself, whereas my PhD had more structure and I was especially productive during the dissertation crunch. I feel like I'm cheating my PI out of their money by not working as hard but still meeting their expectations. Couldn't I be doing more?\n\nI had a talk with my PI about it to some degree (not the cheating out of his money part) but he seems genuinely happy with my progress ... it's bizarre. I'm concerned about work/life balance in my future career \u2014 can I get away with working this little as a PI or will I fail? Or maybe the drive to keep my job and be productive (and to see my students projects succeed) will help me stay engaged throughout the day despite my tiredness and mental fatigue.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have any answers, just confusion.",

      "text": "To answer at least one of your questions:\n\n1. I think it really depends on your PI and lab culture. Many big labs will take a \"sink or swim\" mentality, especially for postdocs. In such labs, the PI probably won't voice any concerns because it doesn't totally matter if you're succeeding or failing. So it's really up to you make progress. But it takes time to adjust and get your project going so I wouldn't worry too much about comparing yourself to others in your first couple of years.",

Given how short postdocs are, it baffles me that others I've spoken to in industry say it takes anywhere from 6 months to 2 years to take off in a new job, yet in a postdoc role we're expected to have significant results out by the end of the first year...",

Could be iron/B12/something else deficiency, etc. etc. It might not just be down to sleep and eating right, other things can cause this too. Might be worth getting it checked out if it's affecting you badly.\n\nI think it's pretty normal for people to have an \"afternoon slump\" apart from that, though. Is it possible to work flexible hours or go for a walk or something at this time so you can get a bit of a break in your day?",

      "text": "Regarding #2 - what's your lab culture like? I went from an extremely social lab in grad school where we would frequently take breaks to play foosball, go get ice cream, just go for a walk, etc. Then I did a postdoc in a lab where I was just in a random office with a bunch of postdocs from other labs and we all sat in our cubicles and stared at our computers and didn't talk to each other all day. Obviously the former is way better for breaking up the day and maintaining focus when you are working, vs just staring at a screen (or lab bench or whatever) by yourself for 8 hours. But also potentially harder depending on COVID restrictions. If you're not closer with the grad students, are there other postdocs you can talk to? Postdoc social groups/events to connect you with people in other labs, just so you have someone to go grab coffee with during the day, etc? (again, whatever is currently possible given your local COVID restrictions)",

I worked from home even before the pandemic and my wife worked out of the house - so before we had kids, there were definitely long days where it was sort of a slog/mental fog because I was just at home alone on a computer. One possibility - is getting any sort of pet an option? Just so you have another living thing around to keep you company and something you have to have some responsibility for. I got a dog in grad school and I found that it helped me transition to being an adult (e.g. had to get up and walk/feed the dog at 7am, not sleep in and not show up to lab until 11). Not that you aren't already an adult, but it could give you something else to do during the day to break up the monotony (and I don't mean that to be r/wowthanksimcured, just something that worked for me personally).",

They take planning and resources.  Most likely your supervisor is the one allocating them.  You should make sure they are aware of your plans, you should know what they expect to see happen, and you should all be in agreement that these views are reasonable.  The end of the fiscal year is coming up, now is a good time to talk to them about what's feasible to accomplish next FY.\n\nAs for question 2.  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, try talking to a doctor.  It may be a waste, but medicine can be a game of finding the right doctor.  Please, don't struggle unnecessarily.  In any event, I'll be honest, 25-30 hours a week is substantially less than I would expect is required for a successful postdoc.  Perhaps you are especially efficient.  If nothing else, try to find a motivator that works for you.  I run off spite.  I work hard so that someday I can stand behind a big podium and tell all the jerks in my field that they can go straight to hell.  You have to find what works best for you though.",
