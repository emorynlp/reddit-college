  "title:": "First year postdoc at career crossroads - how do I communicate this with my PI?",
  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nThrowaway due to wanting to stay anonymous. TL;DR at bottom of page!\n\nI'm in a predicament on where and how to take my next career step, and how to communicate this to my PI. Important note - so far they've been really supportive of me and my career.\n\nThis is my first postdoc (UK), and I took the position (a year's duration) as it aligned with my interests and I was able to work remotely at the time due to COVID. I still have 5 months left, and my current PI is happy with my work so far - in the past week, they've told me that they are keen to extend my contract and bring me onto another really good project for another 18 months. I'm at a really good university, and my colleagues are nice. However, there are a couple of issues with the job that are making me unhappy:\n\n1. I'm working in a city 2 hours away from where I live, and I'm commuting there 1x week (approx. 4 hours x day travelling). I've only done the commute a handful of times, but it makes me unhappy, and feel like I struggle to truly bond with people (especially during COVID). Moving closer isn't an option, due to the fact my partner works where we live.\n2. There is the issue on whether I actually want to continue in academia. I love the intellectual freedom, but I hate the precarious contracts and not having any meaningful job security. I have seen some longer postdocs (2-3 years) advertised in the city I'm living in, and I wouldn't be averse to taking up these positions if offered. I've also seen some industry positions in my city that could be promising - but none of these are as 'guaranteed' as the potential extension to my contract at my current place of work.\n\nAs a result of my current PI wanting to offer me an extension to my contract soon, and potentially applying for these other roles over the next month, I'm at a crossroads. I don't want to risk losing the potential contract extension if I can't find anything else and be without a job, but equally, I don't know if I could hack commuting for another 2 years. I feel like there's two options; a) I tell my PI ASAP about my thoughts now and risk losing the contract extension, or b) Sign the contract for the new job, apply for the other jobs anyway and only tell him when I've been offered a position - which could burn bridges.\n\n**TL;DR: PI potentially offering me a contract extension that I'm not sure I want to take due to location/not wanting to continue in academia. Do I tell him my thoughts, or leave it until I have another job offer?**",

So, this is something to consider, but at the same time...take your time to make the right choice for yourself!",

          "text": "Hiring is hiring managers' job to worry about, and I say that as a hiring manager.\n\nYes, in an ideal world I would be able to perfectly time a new person starting just as the old person is vacating the role. But that never happens, and we typically don't expect it to. At any time, a person on my team could become unable to work here for any reason, and I would have to replace them. It's just part of doing business and running a team.",

People leave jobs. This is how you should leave yours.\n\nLook, you don't know how long it will take you to find a job in industry, if that's what you choose. It sometimes takes longer than people expect. People begin seeking new roles while they are quietly working away at current ones all the time; people also accept promotions and other job changes right before leaving all the time. You have to eat and put a roof over your head just like anyone else, so don't feel guilty for enabling yourself to do that.",
