  "title:": "Do students realize how hard it is to become a professor at a University?",
  "text": "I find a lot of students who get into top universities such as UMich, Harvard, UPenn (Ivy\u2019s and public Ivy\u2019s)and other top schools are naive with how hard it is to actually get a job as a professor at any university on top of that, the \u201cbest\u201d universities. \n\nI remember talking to a junior who was at Columbia and her cousin got a job at University of Cincinnati as an Assistant Professor at age 29. Basically trashed talk that they were not good enough to be a professor at Harvard or something. \nNow I myself, graduated from one of the top 5 schools in the world and I\u2019m teaching my first job at a school ranking about 100-150 In the world. Some may find it off, but honestly there was only 1 job available for my field for 3 years now. \n\nWhat are you experiences? \n\nDo you think students who go to top colleges have unrealistic expectations about where their first job might land?  \n\nMany who go to top unis like Harvard think their options to teach mean only other Ivy leagues or top public ivys, what is this snobby attitude?",

They heard it was hard to get As, to win academic awards, to get into the best schools, but they did it anyway and figure that a tenure-track position is also available given enough hard work. They don\u2019t realize how fine the filter is. I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/hi98zv/comment/fwey7vw) about the *particular type* of smart, driven person who moves successfully through grad school at a strong launching point such as MIT, for example. To this we must add a substantial amount of luck before we reach a tenure-track job offer.",

Despite Stan being right, his research on blind obedience to authority was over shadowed, perhaps even drowned out by all the bullshit Stanford was up to, specifically Phillip Zimbardo... but that\u2019s another issue. Milgram didn\u2019t get tenure at Harvard and sometime after the experiments, he left/transferred to a NY school and became obsessed with photography if I recall correctly. So if the most illuminating research out of the 60s coming from Milgram, top notch researcher was not awarded tenure. His experiments radically altered human understanding of psycho-social dynamics and despite his findings, there significance, he sort of faded away into obscurity. \n\nEdit* some inaccuracies in my post, but hopefully I made the point clear",

There's literally studies that show that where your degree is from is the most important factor in getting a faculty job. I get that they want to keep their hopes alive, but it's painful to see prospective PhDs getting terrible advice from PhD candidates who have no clue what the job search is like.\n\nUndergrads, though... Who cares about their perception? They have no clue what it even means to be an academic. I mean, I barely understand what it means to be an academic in the humanities because it's so different than stem, and I'm sure I don't know what it's like to be a humanities professor at an ivy league. I mean, my engineering research is pretty simple: identify something another scientists wishes they could do, design a thing to do it, publish and repeat. I can't imagine trying to contribute some novel idea about 500 year old philosophy that's been studied extensively.",

For one, \"if I had different information and were a differnet person, I would have made a different decision\" is certainly true as in tautological - but it is also useless in terms of learning how to make better decisions. You know, knowing that I wouldn't comfort eat if I had no inclination to helps me exactly not at all in curbing my comfort eating. Secondly, at least my cohort had ample access to information about how bad the job market was etc, and people still went in droves - and I see this repeated in the matriculating cohort of today. imo firstly because being told something is not the same as experiencing it for yourself, secondly because a lot of people starting grad school have a hubristic view of themselves or an unreasonably bullish view of hte profession, and thirdly because most of us at 22 were not the same as we are today, at 32 or 42. Today, I care about stuff like being able to afford a home, helping my parents afford medical care, building a retirement, saving for my kid's college, etc. For me today, sinking time into an endeavor that leaves me an adjunct does not make sense. For me at 21, who cared about big ideas, doing important work, having cool friends, and whose time horizon was something like the end of the semester, making 30k a year and living with 5 roommates was no problem at all.\n\nSo I guess to tackle your other question,\n\n> \nSo should kids have to be aware of these things when they\u2019re figuring things out? No. Do they have to be? Absolutely. The game is different now.\n\nI think this is the same question, and the answer to it is yes. I don't think you need to know the intricacies of why the job market in a field is bad to know in general that the job market in a field is bad, or what the salary expectations should be, or what general drawbacks and opportunities it has. When I was a kid I was interested in working in a creative field, and all of these things were explained to me when I was about 11? 12? We can do the same for academia.",

I am an anxiety riddled loser so I was acutely aware at every stage the realities of the job market.\n\nAs a result I worked my ass off (which doesn't always work) to make sure I was constantly teaching as an instructor of record, publishing, networking, joining collaborations, attending conferences, inviting myself to give colloquia, etc etc etc. As a postdoc I got a grant to be self funded and ended up receiving another grant so I hired a postdoc as a postdoc which really helped my publication output.\n\nWhen I went on the job market it was at the same time as another postdoc in my group. I was from a small R1 state school but got a really good postdoc and then a named postdoc. The other guy in my group went to an Ivy for undergrad and grad school but....that's it. Just a few publications and only worked with our supervisor.\n\nHe had no idea that wasn't enough. Sure...he should have realized by looking at other postdocs CVs...but how would he? He did all the right  tings to get a good professorship...in 1970.\n\n\nI especially think this hurts the children of professors who only know the experience of their parents sending a letter in the mail in 1978 to Stanford asking for a job and getting it.\n\n\nSo now, I have a job at a very small R1 in the midwest. I warn all my students: if you want to be a professor you need to master out and go to an Ivy. You need to teach courses. You need to network. You need to publish. Compare that to a colleague who has 15 grad students and laments that the 'only thing stopping him from taking on more students is the lack of grants.' Like DUDE, how are 15 amo physicists graduating from the University of Missouri* going to get postdocs? Does he tell them that they won't get postdocs? Or is he just taking more and more students to improve his CV and then say 'see ya' when they get their PhD?\n\n\n\n\n*Not my real University",

              "text": "There are two main \"tracks\" for faculty in academia. One is Tenure Track (TT), and it means that you have a possibility of getting tenure (a position for life, assuming you don't like murder a student _or_ the university doesn't run out of money and defund your program or itself). The TT job track is Assistant Professor (not-yet-tenured), Associate Professor (usually tenured, but not always), and Full Professor (tenured). It varies by school but you tend to be at the Assistant level for 5-7 years, and then you submit a huge dossier file of everything you've ever done (it's like a small book; mine was +90 pages and historians don't even publish that much compared to a lot of fields), and a series of committees evaluates you and _either_ they promote you (usually with tenure), _or_ they tell you to take a hike (your contract will not be renewed, you have to leave the university and find another job). So it is an \"up or out\" sort of system and hence a lot of griping on here and everywhere about how anxiety-producing the process is. The track from Associate to Full doesn't change your tenure status, but being promoted to Full gets you a higher salary and the \"opportunity\" to do different kinds of service obligations (for example, the only professors who can serve on our university-wide Promotion and Tenure Committee are Full Professors, so they have a huge influence on the future of the faculty). If a tenured professor changes university, their tenured status usually moves with them (or, to put it another way, it would be really foolish to not arrange to be tenured where you are moving, but it probably happens in some extreme and unusual situations).\n\nThere are also some additional titles in this category (an Emeritus Professor is a retired professor who no longer draws a salary; an Endowed Professorship is a job that exists because somebody put up a bunch of money to pay for it, and is accordingly considered very fancy) but these are the main ones.\n\nThere is also the Non-Tenure Track (NTT) and these are jobs that have no possibility of tenure. This means, at a minimum, that they can usually be fired at will by the university, and so they are considered to have a lot less job security than someone who has acquired tenure. But there are a lot of different kinds of jobs within this definition: \n\n* Postdoctoral Fellowships (postdocs) are short-term jobs for people who have PhDs. They are meant to be very temporary. Their exact duties and length depend on the fellowship in question. Some are very short, though my sense is that most are for a few years (2-3 years is pretty standard). Most are research focused but sometimes they are teaching focused. Either way they are meant to be a \"stepping stone\" in an academic career. In most fields it is pretty common to spend several years doing at least one, sometimes two postdocs. In my field people spend an average of 5 years doing postdocs after grad school (I had a 1-year fellowship and then a 3-year fellowship, just as an anecdote).\n\n* \"Adjunct\" (Adjunct Instructor, Adjunct Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, etc.) is a very vague term that can mean a lot of different kinds of positions. These days when people say it they _usually_ mean very short-term teaching positions. These can have a lot of different titles, some more euphemistic than others (\"Visiting Assistant Professor\" \u2014 VAP \u2014 is usually a type of NTT adjunct these days, and a very misleading name since \"Assistant Professor\" usually implies it is TT, but \"Visiting\" almost always means \"not tenured or tenure track at this institution\"). These can be contracts that are only a semester or quarter long. These are sort of the worst of the worst because they combine low pay, high work load, no benefits, and no job security. Getting stuck in positions like this, where you are teaching 6 classes at two universities, is what we sometimes call \"adjunct hell,\" and it frequently \u2014 but not invariably \u2014 is a recipe for leaving academia since it is very hard to be productive as a scholar under these conditions and it is very low-prestige. \n\n* There are other categories of NTT professorships which are technically adjuncts but often have better conditions than the above. They come with a variety of names that give some hint, usually, about what is expected about them. A Teaching Professor is a NTT faculty member who is focused on teaching. Often this has more job security than the adjuncts above; it might be a 3-year, renewable contract, for example (the \"renewable\" part is what makes this different than a postdoc). A Research Professor is a NTT faculty member who is focused on research; they might work in a lab, for example, and be paid with grant funds (\"soft money,\" as opposed to a position the university pays with its own funds). These kinds of professorships can sometimes have a promotion track (e.g., \"Teaching Assistant Professor\" and \"Teaching Associate Professor\") but these do not correspond with the granting of tenure, they mean different pay scales, lengths of contracts, ability to be on certain committees, etc. An Industry Professor usually means a NTT faculty member whose major qualifying experience is not from within academia, but from work they did outside of academia first (\"Industry\" here is just a catch-all term for \"not academia,\" and can be a little different from our standard understanding of what the word means \u2014 at my school, for example, there are musicians who are \"Industry Professors,\" because they made their successes in the music industry prior to becoming a professor). \n\nOh, and a Teaching Assistant, Graduate Instructor, or Teaching Fellow \u2014 these terms usually mean someone who is a graduate student still, and doesn't have a PhD (or whatever terminal degree they are working for). \n\nAnyway, that's the basic outline. Almost any title that you'll find in American academia that is \"Assistant/Associate/Full Professor\" (with no qualifiers in front of it) are Tenure Track positions, and anything else is some form of Non-Tenure Track position. This division is usually built into the fabric of the university and faculty governance, and as a rule there is usually a bit split in pay, responsibilities, and power between the two tracks. (But like all rules, there are some exceptions, depending on circumstances. E.g., we have some Industry Professors who make more than some TT faculty because they could easily leave for better pay elsewhere and the university sees a lot of benefit in having them attached to it.) The category of TT is pretty straightforward in terms of names and career progression; the category of NTT is not.  Over the last 30 years, universities have been shifting more and more of their faculty positions into NTT positions, because they are a lot cheaper and require less commitment. \n\nNone of this is codified in law or anything, so there is variance across different universities, even within the same university. And the terms and assumptions change dramatically at times if you are talking about a non-US context (which I know a lot less about).",

      "text": "Yes, FFS, students realize it. \n\nA HUGE barrier in grad school is precisely the feeling of existential dread associated with leaving Uni with a \u201cweak\u201d CV. I don\u2019t know what rock people \u201cthink\u201d institutions are living under, but for the past decade at least, grad students have been given this \u201ctalk\u201d the moment they step into their programs. Maybe your discipline or school is different, but if I had a penny for every time someone brought this up or discussed it on Reddit, I\u2019d have no more need for external funding.\n\nAs you are probably aware, the pressures to teach, publish, AND commit to finishing your graduate degree with limited funding make it all too real of a difficult task to get through, which is why many are suffering from burn out and graduation rates are declining. \n\nCouple that with the \u201cknowledge\u201d that many are going to graduate and be no better off than a Masters (on their CV in the non-academic job market) and this narrative becomes the breeding ground for imposter syndrome and negative self/perceptions of one\u2019s place in the world.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m getting more and more disturbed by the frequently present discourses being thrown out towards students (similar to yours) on the hopelessness and meaningless of their degrees, as if it\u2019s a revelation they should all be warned about incessantly to prevent them from making a \u201cmistake\u201d the narrator feels they had made (who ironically is usually a tenured faculty member at a decently ranked University).\n\nRather, should we not be selling the degree for what it actually is?  Rather than a ticket to tenure - you will sacrifice your life for 4+ years and come out (hopefully) more educated and skilled for the workplace - wherever that will be. If you want an academic position, you will have to be patient, flexible, and persistent. If it\u2019s your dream, you may take concessions, but it will be worth it. \n\nIf it turns out that it\u2019s not your dream, or your priorities change, FINE. But, recognize that the degree is what it is - your opportunity to throw yourself into learning and advancing knowledge in a field for 4+ years to better your skills and knowledge in an area you want to work. It doesn\u2019t mean that the degree is useless or that the only career with a PhD is academia.\n\nIt may be unpopular opinion, because of the frequency of these posts, but by god, please limit these posts. It\u2019s like telling someone they should never play sports because the only way to make a career in sports is being a professional athlete (which is now unattainable). To those who want to be a professional athlete, you\u2019re preventing them from trying. To those who want a career in sports more generally, you\u2019re discarding the value that formal training might have to finding a career outside of a professional athlete.",

I\u2019m EXCITED to do it. It\u2019s meaningful and fun and exciting to me. My last internship I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in the lab alone so I couldn\u2019t work as hard as I wanted to and I really regret that.

Oh well life goes on and that\u2019s that.\n\nEDIT: and this is not to say academia doesn\u2019t have problems and that academics aren\u2019t needlessly burdened by a plethora of BS.

              "text": "To not be misconstrued, I would say that my sentiment is less in drawing lines in *who is and is not worthy and/or capable of making the adequate sacrifice to become a prof at an Ivy League school* and more in acknowledging that *even if you don\u2019t become an Ivy League professor*, grad school might still be worth it for you.\n\nThe problem with the discourses of the above, is that often graduate school is conceptualized as a *means to an end* with that end being R1 tenure track. And, the reality that less than a few hundred will every achieve that, leads the rest to scream back at those doing grad school in a myriad ways - some less helpful than others.\n\nOne of these is to point out all the barriers to achieving these dreams. This can be useful to really acknowledging limitations in the structure of academia. \n\nAnother, is to basically disparage graduate school as a fickle experience that is a waste of time for the majority of those who won\u2019t achieve the coveted tenure track professorship. \n\nOn the latter, I just want to reiterate that this is not the end-all-be-all, and I\u2019ve seen a NUMBER of private sector PhDs make substantial contributions to society without \u201cgracing\u201d tenure academia. Also, I know a few well-respected Profs that have clearly stated to me that \u201chaving done this career for 30+ years, I don\u2019t know that I would have done it again.\u201d \n\nFrankly, academia isn\u2019t all its cracked up to be, and though many pursue it, it\u2019s not the only option. Selling our grad school as of academia is the golden goose is both a mythologization of academia and an undersell of the value of grad school. \n\nWhat I am trying to get across with all of this is probably pretty simple: *don\u2019t pursue grad school for the \u201cjob at the end of the tunnel\u201d; do it because you love the material and want to learn more*. \n\nIf you finish the degree, you will gain so much more in skills and application than you realize and all of this can be applied in a number of ways in your area of passion. \n\nIf we keep on telling people not to do it at all because of drying up jobs, what we are saying is that SOMEBODY\u2019S PASSIONS should be inherently tied to their JOB PROSPECT. And that the declining job prospect means that people should just disregard their passions for more \u201cfruitful\u201d pursuits. It might seem like valuable advice, but I think it reproduces the problem that meaningful work only happens in academia.\n\nAs a whole, I think this is generally bad advice, for a number of reasons (stated above). For you, I think the passion should come first - you want to do something, and you\u2019re sure? Then go for it. But, once you start thinking \u201csome are cut out to succeed and some aren\u2019t\u201d you\u2019re feeding into the same (inverse) logic, which I think is toxic - blaming yourself vs. blaming the market for jobs that are incredibly scarce.\n\nI think seeing grad school in much broader terms allow us to recognize the value of the sacrifice better, and honestly truly highlight the personal assessment of desirability better. If you ONLY want to do a PhD to get to Harvard, then ya, maybe reconsider, or be realistic in your expectations if it doesn\u2019t work out (the same you\u2019d say to a child going into hockey). But if you want to do a PhD to pursue knowledge and advance a career in a broader area, then that\u2019s more than possible.",

Doesn't make it any less frustrating or annoying for the rest of us, though :)\n\n> I don\u2019t think this is reserved to Ivy League undergrads, though probably more prominent.\n\nI'd argue it has nothing to do with Ivy Leaguers at all. I teach at a 'competitive R1' that is a 'top school'. I get these sorts of students all the time, and I even see them in other fields in my GE classes. \n\n> And, what\u2019s to be gained by OP\u2019s narrative anyway?\n\nI think OP is merely talking about the difficulty in engaging with these students meaningfully about what pursuing a PhD is and what potential blockers a student should rightfully be made aware of. In /r/linguistics , we have a 'Higher Ed' post every week. I'd say there is typically at least one post there that falls along the lines of \"I want to do a PhD because I can't think of what else I want to do, so I'll just become a professor!\"\n\nAnd, like, great. This sounds like something you're maybe interested in! But do you have a back up plan? Do you know what to do if you don't get in at all? How about if you get in but struggle? Complete it and don't land a job because of the prospects?\n\nIt's the same story told to students pursuing most things, right? If you're applying to medical or law school, you're told to have back up plans. The difference here is that, for most, there is no vocational training aspect to a PhD, and a lot of students are absolutely shattered when they reach the point of completing a PhD and realizing - oh shit, *this* is what it's like trying to get a job in this field?\n\nI don't want my students to be in a bad situation, regardless of how they behave. I want them to be, at the very least, equipped with options and knowledge of the situation. What they do with it is their own decisiion, of course.",

I do not mean they're *all* like that, but a much larger portion of them than what I encountered at my last institution.\n\nThe students at the state school (it's in the California State University system) often do not have the privilege to \"connect\" with their instructors, given the much larger class sizes and that the students often have many other factors in their own lives: jobs with difficult hours, long commutes, and other outside commitments like helping with their families.",

Coming in from a less prepared background than most, I especially found it difficult to engage even with other graduate students who had greater command of my field's jargon than I ever did.\n\nSo I mostly focused on classes and trying to catch up.  I knew early on that the academic market was getting tough even for STEM, but at least I could eat alright if I kept my career options open.  I was successful at that and my research output turned out to be rather good for my subfield, but my teaching and outreach were more on the average end, and I graduated with few connections, while others who, as far as I could tell, seemed more confident, we able to get involved in all sorts of other activities that could boost their academic profile.  That, and unlike most other students, I was already married and considering starting a family, so I had to be more practical about my chances and how the constant moves would affect my husband and future kids.\n\nI'd say I was lucky in that as soon as I entered grad school I decided to do internships over the summer as backup and began to see the writing on the wall three years into my program and used local connections from my hometown to get my job in industry this last year.  It's a very good job in my hometown, and I'm probably going to be making more than my peers who are mostly going to postdocs are VAP positions while still having some flexibility to work on my research for the fun of it, so I feel like opting out of that rat race was a win for me more than anything.",

As I discovered when applying to jobs for the 2020-2021 AY, it is hard to get a job, but even harder to get the job you want--no matter where you go to grad school. This is because there just aren't that many  jobs available, at least in my field.\n\nI did my PhD at an average public university, basing my decision more on fit than on prestige. I am now an assistant professor at a regional public university in a town and state that I couldn't have found on a map prior to applying. I guarantee you haven't heard of the university where I'm working, unless you're from that state or an immediate neighbor. It is also hours away from any city that I could be sure you've heard of.\n\nWhen I look back at the 50 jobs to which I applied, some of which were reaches given the specialization, there were only 3 R1 jobs (only one of which was top-tier), 3 R2 jobs, and a handful at good liberal arts colleges (only one of which was top-tier). \n\nThere were no TT jobs in my home city--a top-ten US metro with 100s of colleges--and the few jobs in nearby metros and other places I knew I liked/would like were all reaches due to the requested subfields. Given the plethora of colleges in my city and other nearby metros, I always thought I would get a job in the region. I thought I would never go to a random, far-flung place in search of a job. As it turns out, I was wrong. I don't remember anyone preparing me for this possibility, but  maybe I just forget...\n\nI definitely don't have the job I want, and I hope I won't spend my whole career here (rural life just isn't right for this queer, non-religious, single city boy), but I guess I can consider myself pretty fortunate, given the jobs that were available when I applied. I may not like where I \"live\", but I am at least acquiring valuable professional experience. I realize there is a little bit of negativity in here, but the point of my post was not to complain, but to share the real experience of someone who recently went through the job-search process.",

I mean, obviously they do get the vast majority of the jobs, it makes sense, but aside from that, what quantifiable attributes do those candidates have that candidates from lower ranked universities don't? If you're aware of the inequality, what happens when you don't look at where candidates come from?\n\nI don't necessarily mean you specifically, just in general. I'm wondering if there are advantages these places give the candidates that actually make them better or if it's purely prestige",

The point is that top schools make much more graduates than they can hire, and so the rank 100-150 schools are also staffed mostly by people from top schools. Of course some fields are exceptions, and sometimes you have to localize the rankings (so instead of top-X worldwide, it'll be top-X in country or top-X in region).",

But it's not impossible to get a job as a professor coming from a lower ranked school.\n\nIn the end, like you've noted, this speaks to the inherent elitism of academia that manages to survive to this day, and while that's field-dependent in many cases, it's still one more systemic problem. If it were me, I'd still encourage students to go to universities that are most affordable, that are comfortable, that are located in areas they want to be, and, if we're talking PhD schools, that provide the best funding.

My friend ONLY wanted a job at U of Top in the World. That didn't work out.\n\nI'm in a field that actually has a good job market.

I luckily have been successful beyond I could ever hope for and got a job outside science, but I regret getting my degree every day.",

      "text": "As a sidestep to a lot of the discussion in this thread - being a professor at a \"top\" university is a personal life choice as well as a demonstration of competitiveness. There are lots of reasons people choose academia and lots of reasons academia chooses them. There are lots of reasons people want to participate in academia at different levels and lots of reasons they are appealing as job candidates at different. This is true for most jobs, so why are academics surprised? If you survey general populations the general response is that we live in the ivory tower and don't consider different work situations. \n\nThe competitiveness of specialties in academia (which is multilevel) definitely leads to the exclusive mindset you describe (\"if I am not part of the exclusive group then my personal value is diminished.\") Transitioning from student to faculty inherently requires a change in mindset about knowledge and skills. When people and programs focus on competitive ranking based on success under the \"previous conditions\" we end up with the Peter principle impacting multiple levels of academia.",
