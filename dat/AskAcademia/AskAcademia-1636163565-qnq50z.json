  "text": "I'm not an English native speaker and I was told to avoid the use of passive voice in my academic writing. However, many texts I read (in Humanities) from American and British authors use passive voice A LOT.\n\nRecently I was watching a class online where the professor was analyzing a text and a student complained about the passive voice in the text. The professor said that it was not a problem for him.\n\nBut I assume it's a problem for some people. Why?",

      "text": "It depends how you use it. When writing academically, you will certainly use it from time to time, but a whole essay written in passive voice will generally struggle with clarity. \n\nThe usual problem is students attempting to avoid writing in first person so they default into the passive voice as it seems scholarly. This often means it is unclear who or what is the subject leading to confusion. Active writing is more precise in this regard.\n\nA classic misuse is when students hide their lack of research by using phrases such as \"studies have been done\" or \"research has shown\" because by removing the subject you don't have to attribute your claim to anyone or anything. \n\nAppropriate use of passive voice is always acceptable, particularly in scientific writing, but clarity and proper attribution are paramount so therefore active voice is generally more appropriate.",

However, is that the case in english?\n\nIs there any difference in clarity between these two sentences?",

              "text": "Yes, it is the same in English. English comprehension is very dependent on word order so your first example is appropriate use of passive voice. \n\n\nYour second sentence is grammatically correct, but by separating the logical progression of words you are making it more difficult to read. However, it is not technically wrong, just clunky. \n\nIt sounds like you grasp the concept fine, but don't feel confident about it because English is your second language. I'd suggest rereading paragraphs you are unsure of aloud to someone or even yourself. Consider how it is difficult to keep a concept in your head when someone is talking about something when they haven't identified that they are continuing to talk about that thing from the outset. \n\nOtherwise, I think you'll be ok. Don't get too hung up on this\n\n\nEdit: English is fundamentally a subject-verb orientated language so deviation from this structure should be done with specific purpose",

Neither the fact nor the food are active, but the dog is. Consider this example instead:\n\n\u201cThe food isn\u2019t liked by the dog. This is evidenced by the fact that the food is still on the plate. Disappointment is felt by its owner. Hunger is felt by the dog. Money is wasted by the owner. Frustration is felt by all.\u201d\n\nWhen passive voice is used too much, it makes the writing stagnant. It\u2019s almost like a description of a still life painting, lacking any movement.\n\nCompare that to:\n\n\u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t like the food. That is clear because she left it on the plate. The owner is disappointed. The dog is hungry. The owner wasted her money. Everyone is disappointed.\u201d\n\nTo a native speaker, the second version feels clearer, more direct, more active, and even more vivid.\n\nAs others have noted, in scientific writing it is often appropriate to use passive voice to remove reference to oneself.",

The second sentence of the first form is also pretty bad, but not as bad\n\nOne important thing to realise is that most native English speakers don't get taught formal grammar. So if someone tells you to use the active voice, what they really mean is be more direct, and insert yourself as the author where it's appropriate. They're not really talking about grammatical forms .\n\nSo, \"the dog doesn't like the food\" is fine. \"This is evidenced by the fact that the food is still on the plate.\" Is ugly. You can change it to \"we can tell this because the food is still on the plate.\"\n\nIt sounds juvenile and less academic, but that's mostly because of the topic, when you start writing about more complex things, saying things like \"we find supporting evidence\" instead of \"this is evidenced by\" is much clearer.",

Academic writing prefer clear language, but the sentence can be more simple: The dog doesn\u2019t like the food, because it\u2019s food is still there. \u201cBecause\u201d should be suffice for causal claim. Your post made me thinking. I\u2019m not English native too. Another active voice translation I can think of is: \u201c The dog doesn\u2019t like the food. It is evident that the food is still on that plate\u201d. By removing \u201cthe fact that\u201d, you don\u2019t have to worry abt passive voice. Passive voice often indicates an action performed by a subject. The \u201cfact\u201d doesn\u2019t do the \u201cevidence\u201d. As with citing past research, passive voice is used to indicate the people who did the research, without making these researchers the focus of the sentence. If the paper is a research paper, using passive voice gives an impression of objectivity. It is abt the result and not the people who found the result that matters. The result stands on itself, regardless of who did it. I\u2019m also a philosophy major, and all of my professors told the class to move away from tedious long sentences often seen in older philosophy texts. Shorter is better. Talking is different though. Saying \u201cit is evidence by the fact that xyz\u201d is good for emphasizing an important point.",

Using passive voice can actually be used to convey this important distinction - it permits you to posit an association between two items/events without making or implying unwarranted causal claims. This is to say, sometimes it's not necessarily about objectivity, but about a sort of epistemic modesty that much scientific research should be employing.",

      "text": "OK this is a tough one because it is hard to pin down a perfect rule.  In English, \"passive voice\" is bad in most types of writing.  In academic writing, passive voice is acceptable much more frequently than in other circumstances.  I can't necessarily speak to use of passive voice in humanities where convention might be different, but I will try and untangle this a little bit using my own field of biomedical science as an example.  \n\n\nSo, in general passive voice is \"bad\" because it places the subject of the sentence in a wrong location.  Example \"The apple was eaten by John\" is a bad use of passive voice.  The subject is \"apple\" and the verb is \"was\".  In this sentence, the verb belongs to \"apple\".  The apple is a passive object, and really John is more interesting in this sentence because he is doing something.  This is appropriate most of the time for most types of writing.    \n\n\nIn academic writing, the object of an action is more interesting.  For my field, I might want to describe how I prepared a blood sample.  I could say \"I collected blood by centrifugation at 5000xg for 10 minutes,\" and there is nothing grammatically wrong about this.  But my readers don't care what I did, they care about how the blood was prepared.  \"Blood\" is a more important subject to them than \"I\".  So it is appropriate, and even preferred by convention, to say \"Blood was collected by centrifugation at 5000xg for 10 minutes\". My readers don't care what I did, they just want to know how they should prepare their blood samples if they want to copy me or to make sure I did the right thing!  In academic writing, passive voice is also OK because it is a very neutral way to state an observation without making any assumptions.  Instead of saying \" The immune cells killed the bacteria,\" we might say \"bacteria exhibited 90% reduced survival when incubated with immune cells as compared to incubated with media alone.\"  Maybe my test for killing bacteria is not precise, and I can only infer killing activity by comparing death of the bacteria in 2 different conditions.  My test might not be totally perfect, so I just state in plain words what I see rather than assuming that one thing directly caused another.",

      "text": "Others have already provided some good answers, but I\u2019ll add my two cents. Many people treat writing style as a set of inviolable rules instead of as, well, style. Sure, in a practical sense, a style guide might be enforced ? you might be graded on your adherence to it, so then you should follow the rules. But style guides in general provide preferred usage and it is okay to break the rules every now and then. \n\nFurthermore, I personally tie the American disdain for the passive voice back to a text called Elements of Style, more commonly referred to as Strunk and White, referring to the book\u2019s authors. I\u2019m no fan of this text, but it is certainly taught to or familiar to many Americans. It includes a diatribe about not using the passive voice and incorrectly identifies some examples as examples of the passive voice. And Americans in general have kind of taken this same tact of being against the passive voice but also not being good at identifying it. The passive voice can be used responsibly.\n\nAnyway, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. If someone says something about your writing, deal with the necessary revisions at the time. Finally, Watch out for using the passive voice but don\u2019t feel stuck if it\u2019s the only way you can construct a sentence that makes sense.",

Do they not care that they are being unclear?  Do they not know what the subject of the sentence should be?  Do they know what the subject could be, but they are unwilling to make it clear for some reason?   Are they intentionally obscuring the subject?

Out of habit (I guess) only few people swith to active voice in english. As academic work is supposed to be objective, it is not you as a researcher who personally did a thing, but the research is the outcome of a (objective) reseach process and the results have little to do with you as a person. Unless they do, as for example in qualitative works it makes sense to use active voice, as the researcher has to be factored in (for example in ethongraphic research or interviews and experiments). \n\nIf you make a decision that could have gone the other way as well, its about you as a person, here you can use active voice. Everything else has nothing to do with you as a person and therefore is passive. That is what I go by and so far it works.

Complexity and dense writing can be extremely useful, and it is a good skill to have for conveying technical information in a very succinct way, especially to other people in your field.

When I am preparing a scientific manuscript or an introduction intended for colleague, I might say \" CAR-T cells armored with constitutive IL-2 effectively controlled MDA-MB-231 tumor metastasis\".  In my field, that sentence makes perfect sense and conveys a lot of very specific information in a very short space, but it means nothing to most other people.  Now if I were writing about the same study on a scientific blog, I might say \"White blood cells that were genetically engineered to recognize cancer and continually produce survival hormones stopped tumor cells from metastasizing to new sites.\"  The second sentence is easier to read and gives the scientifically interested average person an idea of what is happening, but it lacks huge amounts of information I might want to communicate to my peers.  \n\n\nEDIT: I realize this is probably a bad example for this thread because both examples I gave used mostly active voice, but it is just a sample of how that dense writing serves a purpose.

People make this claim because they think that active verbs are more clear and direct than passive voice. While this is generally true, there are certain situations where passive voice is actually useful and illustrative an idea that the writer wants to get across. For example, passive voice is a great choice when the subject doing the acting in the sentence is of less interest than the thing acted upon.\n\nExample (passive): *Her business--an empire constructed over a period of two decades--had just been dissolved at the stroke of a lawyer's pen.*\n\nIn a sentence like this, one is trying to keep the thing acted upon as the focal point of the sentence. To restructure this into the active voice would empty the statement of the dramatic effect:\n\nExample (active): *The stroke of a lawyer's pen had dissolved her business, an empire constructed over a period of two decades.*\n\nHere, the active voice makes the stroke of the lawyer's pen the subject of the sentence, even though the reader is supposed to be wrapped up in the drama of what has happened to this poor woman's business. The result is a sentence that is more mundane than the previous.\n\nTo be sure, there are many cases where writers use passive voice unnecessarily, leading to ugly, muddy sentences and, in most cases, active voice is the way to go.
