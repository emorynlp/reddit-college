  "text": "Hello community. Please remove if not appropriate. Thanks.\n\nI'm an international MS student looking to apply for PhD programs in the US this round. My advisor called me in and showed me what he wrote for my LoR and asked me if I wanted to change anything (I don't think this is normal or \"ethical\" but who am I to say no to a kind gesture).\n\nI'm not originally from my current major (CS) and I did a double major in undergrad. My grades suffered because of my unfamiliarity and, to be honest, immaturity. My advisor mentioned it in the letter and said something like (from memory):\n\n>Although I admittedly had concerns as to whether Joe would be able to keep up with graduate courses and conduct research due to his unconventional background and his undergraduate record, he immediately proved that my concerns were silly as he was able to maintain a near-perfect GPA and was able to successfully participate in research.\n\nI'm honestly extremely flattered that my advisor thinks so highly of me (he's not the expressive type), but at the same time am conflicted because I've heard that anything critical or mediocre on a letter is going to be viewed negatively.\n\nThis has led me to wonder if I should bring it up and suggest that leaving out the part about concerns may be best.\n\nI don't really have anyone around me who's experienced higher education (my school doesn't really receive international students/faculty and no one really goes abroad either, I'm also the only one of my friends or family to have went to college) and so I decided I'd try to make a post here. Thanks for any feedback.",

They will obviously see your grades, and notice if those grades are poor. \n\nThe prof's letter sounds like a great way to make an \"issue\" into a *non*-issue. \n\n(think of the whole admissions application as sort of like a research paper itself, where the larger argument of the paper is that they should accept u/chuckecheese123 into their program.  If there is a \"weak\" part of the paper--undergrad grades--that weakness is going to be obvious to experts trained to spot weakness, and pounced on.  \"Aha!  We found a flaw!  Let's discuss it!\"  \n\nWhereas your professor grabs those grades, holds them up, and says \"but, gentlemen, I ask you:  what of this supposed counter-argument???!  Well, that is easily dispensed with! (flourish)\"  Dealing with a flaw in an application, just like dealing with a counter-argument in your research paper, is a way to totally sap the energy out of it.\n\n\nAlso, he should not have showed you the letter, NOT for ethical reasons, but because most non-professors are not familiar enough to even recognize what the letter is actually trying to do...   it's just stressful for students to see that.",
