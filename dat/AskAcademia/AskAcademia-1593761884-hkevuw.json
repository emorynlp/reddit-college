I would think that development takes different routes and although postdoc > phd I think you can equally learn more from an RA position for example. Progress is relative and as long as your learning something new or challenging yourself, I think we agree it's a good thing.  \n\nI guess theres a fine line between continually challenging yourself in a healthy way and being continuously competitive in an (as I see it, unhealthy) academic way.\n\nI feel like its easier to work to your potential outside of academia and you'll be respected/admired for it, where as I feel like you're always expected to work to above your potential within academia.

I often refer to that as \"the year of suck.\" I think I had a rosy view that getting the PhD would suddenly make things better. In psychology, you cannot get licensed until after practicing at least a year (usually two). You need a job to get the experience to get licensed, but most jobs will not hire you without a license. I thought a PhD would come with some respect, but, uh, that does not really happen for awhile. The transition to actually knowing I am an authority took years, and I never was really aware of when it happened. It crept up on me. I am quite confident in my competence, but also very comfortable with the bounds of my knowledge. There probably was a point where my focus switched from being concerned about the things I do not know to doing the best I can with the things I do know well, and realizing that I really am doing better than most people I work with. Long term, I definitely feel way less dumb. It was a great step. I just don't know when I really took it.",
