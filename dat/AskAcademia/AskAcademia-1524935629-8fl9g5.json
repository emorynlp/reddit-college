  "title:": "Don't upvote - just wanted to write a short \"thank you\" note to this sub and all of its wonderful information and support",
  "text": "I got the job.  \n\nTenure track, Assistant Professor at a wonderful university with *truly* wonderful people in a wonderful part of the country.  \n\nIt's official, signed and confirmed and everything, but it still hasn't sunk in.  After years and years of adjuncting, freelancing, and wandering all over the unbeaten path doing all sorts of crazy things to make ends meet, the dream of actually having a full time appointment has almost dulled itself into a blurry background, safe behind a veil of reality checks and self sabotage.  I've probably read the official announcement a hundred times, to the point of having to double check to make sure it was *my* name they were congratulating.  \n\nThe interview went really, really well.  The faculty, the students, everyone I talked with was incredibly nice and warm and welcoming and kind, the \"big scary interview-trial-by-fire\" was a fun, enjoyable casual conversation (that I was *way* too prepared for, even garnering a bit of a joke from one of the committee members!) and all in all I had a great time there.  It felt like *home*.  But, being well practiced in many years of not hearing anything back after a campus interview I thought went well, getting the call with the offer was a complete surprise (during which I kept cool and politely excited, but may have had a mini-happy-cry afterwards). \n\nSo, without turning this into an unsolicited happyrant, I wanted to say *thank you* to all of *you* and all of the wonderful advice, support, perspective, and information here.  I ~~stole~~ utilized several creative ideas for my interview that I read about here, was able to develop an appropriate rhetoric for the particular type of school/position in question, and really just went into the whole process feeling confident and well equipped.  This all might sound (and be) redundant or obvious to most of you, but little things like writing personalized thank you notes the day after, knowing how to phrase your questions and requests to communicate that you have the students/program in mind, or having a frame of reference for the contract offer phase are all incredibly helpful and relatively unknown to many fledgling academics who may not have personal support to spell anything out for them.  This has been my dream for as long as I can remember, and *you* all played a huge role in helping achieve it.\n\nAnd for anyone who may be reading this who finds themselves still stuck in \"the pit\" (which I know all too well), might I offer my own few words of encouragement?  Believe in yourself, in your future, in the fact that you *know* you are meant for this, and believe that the right place with the right people will come along at the right time, as unlikely as that may seem at the moment, as much as I know we all want that time to be *now*:P  Don't let the system get you down, because it can and will if you give it that kind of power.  I hope my own little success story might inspire someone else to stick in there, keep giving 120% with a smile, and keep fighting for next year.  And, since you're reading this here, you already have and know a wonderfully supportive, helpful place with a lot of people much smarter and more experienced than either of us ever will be who are happy to give advice or share stories or just help the whole process seem a bit less impossible.  \n\nNow, of course, the real work begins, and I'm excited for the challenges the future will hold (and am not approaching anything as naively and doe-eyed as this post likely implies, don't worry!)  I'm *sure* I'll be bugging you all soon with plenty of noob questions, but for now, *thank you* for being here, and for helping at least *this* professor find their place in the world.  ",

In that time, I had since moved into some part-time adjunct work at a local university, did a lot of freelance teaching on my own, and was involved in numerous varied projects with varying degrees of relation to my field/academia.  \n\nIt was certainly a challenge to \"stay relevant\" and, moreso, to be able to communicate that, both in writing (cover letter/C.V.) and in person (interviews) as, depending on how you looked at my application material, it could easily seem like I dropped off the face of the planet for 4 years and was a huge liability.\n\nLuckily, the university in question was actually *excited* about my varied interests and involvements over the past several years and saw it (as I do) as advantageous experience to pass on to my/their students (which I agree with, but again, realize that most other schools would have simply passed on my paper round when they saw I didn't currently hold a full time position).  In short, it was all as it was meant to be, and as sure as I was that I was wasting away just trying to make money, I was building precisely the unique skillset and breadth of interests/exposures the right school was looking for all along.\n",

Unfortunately, I had a victorious \"purging\" of all my interview/research related folders and bookmarks and likely couldn't tell you which specifics posts (here and elsewhere online) I found particularly helpful if you paid me...\n\nI'll say that I did a *lot* of excessive and exhaustive googling, just to get as many perspectives as I could.  In that much volume, you'll find things that speak to you, things that resonate well with who *you* are, and plenty of things that rub you the wrong way (a particularly popular and highly opinionated blogger comes to mind, whose thoughts, while helpful for perspective, I found mostly annoying, grating, and unhealthily biased and am glad I chose not to assimilate).  Finding the consensus in what *everyone* agreed on was helpful.  \n\nBeyond that, there was really little specifically related to my field, so everything then had to go through a fine-toothed comb, but the few articles/posts that were I found extremely helpful.  Really the biggest thing going in was just having a sense of perspective, what to expect, what to look for, etc.  I mean at this point it's all just a giant blob of months of researching and reading and prepping, so I'd just say do the digging work yourself as seeing what *doesn't* fit well with you is as valuable as having a list of links to things that *do*!",

Then I quickly realized I had a lot to learn about being a professor. I already had publications and had already done some teaching but I am still learning about both. Of course, service was essentially all new. I feel like I've barely started but I've already been here two years and I feel some natural pressure now. \n\nI would also be carefully thinking about how you are evaluated. I made some assumptions about how my research and teaching were evaluated that I found to be incorrect. You absolutely must play the system. I'm observing some new faculty who got here a couple years ahead of me. Those who are shrewdly playing the system are doing better than those who don't. Some of my colleagues who are objectively publishing and teaching better aren't playing to administration as well and don't seem to be regarded as highly as those who are smartly playing the system.  \n\n",

          "text": "Great questions, and very fresh in my memory!\n\nActually, this is one area where I'm glad I *didn't* listen to all of the prevalent advice (i.e.: negotiate *everything*, negotiate *hard*, push for every penny you can push for, and don't let them talk you down no matter what) as mine was not at all like that (I'm assuming these mostly come from the hard sciences where 7 figure lab startup packages are common).  Mine was from a state school where salaries are publicly available, so there was no wiggle room there (nor would I want to be *that* colleague who thinks they're worth $500 more than everyone else, just because, and would cause some degree of contempt upon arrival) and there was little leeway in terms of teaching loads/equipment/etc. either (it's a *teaching* position, which is what I *want* to be doing, and I felt asking to do less of the thing they're hiring me to do would have been an ugly first foot to start on).  So I wrote out a (small, polite) list of things I'd want to make sure I had access to, framing it as wanting to provide my students/program with the most successful environment as possible (which is entirely true) and was assured that this was all already in place and didn't need to be included in the contract.  \n\nNow, saying this will automatically make certain people start foaming at the mouth, aggressively insisting to get *literally everything* in writing in some monstrous 9 page contract agreement, but you know what?  I thought the offer was fair (and exactly where I had expected it to be tracking past hires' salaries) and don't need some crazy startup budget for my discipline, so I accepted once I was assured of the few things I had asked about (equipment/travel/space).  Could I have fought for a few extra hundred bucks for this or that, or even argued for a month or two of free summer salary?  Eh, maybe.  But I was happy with what was offered and didn't want to start what I hope to be a lifelong relationship and rapport on *that* foot.  Money only goes so far, and for me, personally, it's never worth needlessly straining relationships and reputations over.  \n\nYour mileage, of course, may vary (and likely should, depending on so many factors), but for my first TT offer, I was happy with what was put on the table, had a nice talk about what wasn't explicitly in writing, and have no regrets whatsoever about taking it.
