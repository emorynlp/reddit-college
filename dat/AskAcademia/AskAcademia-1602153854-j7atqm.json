  "title:": "Will my lecturer think I\u2019m stupid if I ask her to explain her seminar?",
  "text": "I (22f, uk) have just started my Masters degree and it\u2019s in a subject that I haven\u2019t really studied in an educational setting before, so everything I know about the subject is material that I\u2019ve taught myself. I have my first seminar on one of my modules tomorrow morning, and we\u2019ve been asked by our lecturer to do some recommended reading and watch her introductory lecture before the seminar. I\u2019ve done the reading and I\u2019m halfway through the lecture now. \n\nI was hoping her lecture would go more into detail about the reading, as there were a few sections I struggled with. She is discussing the essays we were told to read, but instead of really explaining them or breaking them down, she\u2019s kind of just...reading quotes from them and giving like a sentence or two of \u2018context\u2019 (couldn\u2019t think of a better word for it but it\u2019s very vague) and then moving onto her next quote. This would probably be fine if I was someone a lot smarter but if I\u2019m honest it isn\u2019t answering any of my questions and I actually just feel more lost. \n\nI\u2019m a bit insecure in my position as a student because I feel a lot of the other students will probably have a much more extensive background in the subject than I do and I really don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m stupid or that I\u2019m being rude to her, but honestly this lecture is basically useless to me right now and I\u2019m worried this is what the entire module will be like. Would it be rude of me to ask her to maybe go into a bit more detail in future lectures? I believe we have to watch one of these every week and I don\u2019t want to be lost for the entire time.\n\nEDIT: thanks for all your advice guys! I ended up emailing her to explain what I was having trouble with and I asked if she had any notes or recommendations for further reading I could do to help me get a bit more clarity on those parts. It\u2019s reassuring to know I\u2019m not the only one with impostor syndrome haha! Thanks again",

You might be right, but you may well also find that everyone else is also struggling with this material.  \n\nIn terms of asking for further explanation, as a lecturer I'd say go for it - I would never be offended by a request to explain something in more detail, or simply differently.  BUT, make sure you're quite specific in your request - don't just ask for \"more detail\" - be clear on which sections/themes/topics you'd like more detail on",

Especially if you are feeling really lost.  Even if you feel underprepared ask the students around you (if u have in person classes) or if someone asks a question in class followup with that person .\nAlso perfect time to go to office hours but do some prep work on what u exactly dont know or where u get lost\nOr post on discussion boards or in chat rooms or in your university specific reddit lol",

      "text": "I'm going to give the other perspective. while you can ask (and if you do, do so politely and I agree - be specific), it's not a great look at this level. Just being honest. I don't think anyone will judge you for wanting to learn more but.... graduate work is where your professors stop spoon feeding you information and expect you to start being a scholar. So if you don't know something, it's expected that you will go dig through the research that is out there to find out. Critiquing how much information your professor includes (even if it does sound like it's not a lot and definitely would have frustrated me too) may not go that well if you haven't shown them that you did that first. I would start there. Find some youtube videos that explain it. Find some other sources. Find some commentaries on the material and see what they say. If you can't find it, *then* ask. Ask for other sources you can read because the material isn't clicking with you. Or if you find some other sources and it's still not clicking, then ask specific information and reference the fact that you tried to look up the information. Show them that you are willing to do the work and took the initiative. At that point, I don't think that's inappropriate at all but when I think back to my grad school professors, if I had emailed them and complained that they weren't explaining enough in their lectures, they would have sent me a list of books to read for further clarification and implied that I'm lazy for not having looked them up on my own. just my experience. \n\nPS Everyone in your entire class probably thinks that everyone else knows more than they do as well. Impostor syndrome is real. We have all had it.",

The gap in knowledge is huge, and as a teacher you're constantly aware of how shockingly little students know about the topic. Even master students.\n\nWhich means that you're not judged on your knowledge and expertise. You're judged on your attitude to learning. Work hard, learn diligently, ask relevant questions.\n\nSo in your case, just ask the teacher specific questions. Or tell her you didn't understand it very well, and ask for further reading to catch up on the topic.\n\nIt will show you are driven, curious, and eager to learn. That's all you need to convey for now. You'll be judged on your actual knowledge at the exams.",

That being said, if the readings are still difficult even after the seminar, I would personally think that it is fully legitimate to ask whether the lecturer could focus somewhat more on explanation in the next lecture.",

Book reviews can be helpful. Other commentaries. Cliff's notes. Or ask another student in the class if they were also confused by a certain part and, if not, how did they understand it? If you have a librarian at your uni who focuses on your subject (many libraries will list them on their website), they might also help. Good luck!",

What I\u2019ve been doing is writing down every unfamiliar term and reference, looking them up, and putting those notes in with the outline I make of each reading. Honestly if you have the gap of not having studied the subject for 4 years, asking the professor to explain the lecture isn\u2019t going to illuminate you. (And for those who said they wouldn\u2019t mind explaining, you\u2019re a nice person but I\u2019ve definitely had professors that embarrassed me for asking what they considered a dumb question).

Perhaps there is even an 'introduction to [whichever field this is]' book available online or in your library. I don't think your lecturer will think you're stupid, especially if you explain the situation, but if you're the only one who is struggling and the lecturer decides to also explain concepts and theories in their lectures that are basic for the rest of the students, that might bring down the level of the course and make it less in depth for the other students.\nAsking other students can never hurt! Maybe they are struggling as well and you asking the lecturer helps many other people, and if you do find out that you just need some extra background info to really get into it, I'm sure that your lecturer or other students can recommend you some extra background reading. Good luck!",

And she didn\u2019t really elaborate or break down any of the points, she just kind of listed off quotes in the lecture without really explaining them. I\u2019m kinda like yeah that\u2019s great, I can also read, but I need help understanding :( and yeah I definitely don\u2019t want to slow classes down for the rest of the students!",

      "text": "Don't worry about it; these things happen, especially so in postgrad (because you're taking more specialised subjects that might not be in your specific subject area).\n\nWhen I used to lecture we frequently had postgrad students who came from different backgrounds or educational systems. This is particularly pronounced in the UK where it's just a 1 year programme.\n\nI can imagine online classes (which I imagine you're doing now) would be even more challenging for the lecturer, as she might not have the same sort of sensory feedback she'd typically use to recognise that she needs to explain something in more depth.\n\nPersonally (and I think most educators are the same) I loved it when students asked questions. Partly because it shows they're engaged, but also because it gave me a little break for blabbering away. It would only annoy me if it was asked out of laziness, but as this is specifically about readings she's assigned it's clearly not the case.\n\nSo don't worry about asking about the material, but try to be specific about your questions and to frame them around the material she's assigned.",

      "text": "Much depends on the requirements of the seminar. Are you expected to provide an analytical reconstruction of the argument of a text? Are you meant to put it it historical context and address how the text was pivotal in a particular debate? Is the goal to show how a text shaped cultural practices in later years; or show how it well captured the mood of a moment? Each of these tasks have different intents and purposes. Also much of what can be accomplished depends on the time given to you. For instance it would be very hard to do all of these things well, that is at sufficient depth to be meaningful, in 20minutes.\n\nFWIW, if there is little guidance, do one of these tasks, but preface it by saying that you are doing in the spirit to help generate informed discussion on some of the other items I mentioned.",

          "text": "I agree here, and also want to add: Master\u2019s level courses, particularly in the humanities and social sciences \u2014 and most especially in seminars \u2014 is where you begin to make the transition from undergraduate-level analysis (primarily what do the _authors_ say) to graduate-level analysis (what do _you_ think about what the authors say). \n\nHere, you will learn to identify the core theses/arguments in the works, how the authors chose to support them, and how well the evidence that they bring to bear on their arguments supports them or falls short of supporting them. You\u2019ll make the transition from just knowing _what\u2019s in_ a book or article, but also _what you learned_ and _what you think_ about the work. And maybe most of all, do you agree or disagree with their thesis? Have they persuaded you? Why or why not?\n\nCareful here of doing the knee-jerk thing that some grad students do, which is to simply and _a priori_ dismiss the works outright, and saying in effect \u201cthis article/book/author is bullshit.\u201d All you do is risk coming across as unteachable and above it all. Always be open to learning something new, even if it\u2019s from a work whose author\u2019s argument you disagree with. \n\nThink of your reading assignments and especially a seminar class environment as an incubator where you begin to develop a foundation as not only a knowledgeable scholar but an independent and open-minded one who is able to contribute new knowledge to your field in a solid and persuasive way.\n\nSo, in answer to your question, should you ask her to explain? I would say, if you\u2019re struggling, then yes. But not in the context of \u201cWould you please go over everything in more detail so that I can understand better what was said?\u201d\n\nTry and begin to shift your focus from _facts/terms/concepts_ (undergrad student thinking) to _ideas/theses/arguments_ (grad student thinking). I suggest, try and identify the key terms and concepts that are mentioned, which your cohorts already seem to know, and look those up yourself or even ask your cohorts to explain, as other commenters here have suggested.\n\nInstead, take some questions to your lecturer that are more specific to the quotes that they pulled from the readings. My suspicion is that those quotes are related less to the facts in the lectures, and more to the key ideas and arguments in the readings.\n\nSee if you can tease out those theses/arguments first, on your own, or if you are struggling with _that_, then take some questions to your lecturer such as \u201cI understand this quote, but I\u2019m not sure how it relates to the authors key argument because I am having trouble identifying that. Could you help me?\u201d Or, \u201cl understood the article, but I\u2019m having trouble seeing how it specifically how the ideas in it tie in to the lecture material. Could you explain that?\u201d\n\nSee how the questions are much more specific and less about facts and more about ideas than \u201cCould you explain the lectures better?\u201d\n\nHope this helps.\n\nWelcome to grad school \u2014 jump on in, the water is warm!",

      "text": "I\u2019m also in a humanities masters program and feel the same way all the time. One strategy that I\u2019ve found to getting the clarification that I need is to ask pointed questions rather than an overall question and then follow it up with how you\u2019re currently interpreting it so that your instructor knows that you\u2019re trying to understand the material/can correct you if you stray too far from the actual concept/can relate their explanation to your framework. So for example if I\u2019m unclear I\u2019ll ask something like: \u201cI\u2019m having some difficulty understanding ***. I\u2019m currently reading it to mean *** but I\u2019m not sure if that captures the nuances of the theory. Would you mind going into some more detail about it?\u201d Hope this helps!",
