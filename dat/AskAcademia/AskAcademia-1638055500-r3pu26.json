  "text": "Hello r/AskAcademia,\n\nI'm slated to be a teaching assistant for a class next semester which requires leading a recitation. I am dyslexic and autistic (level 1, or \"high-functioning\"/Asperger's). Although I'm comfortable with the material and have worked hard to get here, I'm nervous because the way I learn is unusual and I can't personally relate to what are described as typical effective teaching strategies. I learn very poorly from lectures, even supposedly great ones, so don't have much of a pre-existing internal framework to draw from.\n\nI'm planning to pursue a PhD after my Master's, so I will need to overcome this barrier sooner rather than later. \n\nIf anyone here has successfully conquered teaching while autistic, dyslexic, or both, I'd love to know what tips you may have! Thank you!",

      "text": "I'm not autistic or dyslexic, but I have ADHD and an anxiety disorder, and I find that that maybe makes me learn in an 'unusual' way also. A lot of people with ADHD have issues processing auditory input; I'm one of those people, so lectures are *really* hard for me to learn from as well (especially in classes where the slides have little to no written information or notes); I don't retain spoken information well.\n\nI realized, though, that there had to be other students out there who felt the same way - so when I taught classes, I tried to implement different learning styles throughout the semester and within each session. So instead of just lecturing, I'd try to also include small group exercises, larger group/whole class activities, and some individual reflections or freewriting.\n\nHow and what you teach will depend on what your recitation is for - some have a specific structure that you will have to model after, and some will have specific material you have to teach. When I taught statistics lab, there was a set schedule that was formed by the professor and the students completed specific assignments/experiments in my sections. There really wasn't a ton of choice in how to deliver the material. I've also had recitation sections that were very freeform and I had to come up with how to teach the material, so it really does depend.",

      "text": "Hi. Are you me? We have identical diagnoses, but I\u2019m just further along in my career and am a professor. \n\nI feel like my neurodivergence has been an incredible asset in my career in some ways - particularly with my teaching. It has made me a very meticulous preparer of lesson plans, how I deliver my material, and how students receive that information. I tend to prepare lectures in a few phases:\n\n1.\tWhat do I need to teach, and what is the most logical way of delivering it?\n2.\tWhat are students likely to have trouble understanding and what can I do to clear up the top 3-5 questions likely to come up?\n3.\tWhat are more nuanced problems that students may have, and how can I prepare those answers?\n\nThis tends to cover everything that can conceivably come up during a lecture. Some of it is experience after teaching a course several times. Some of it is intuition, and thinking about what I had trouble understanding when I was first exposed to the material.",

      "text": "This is a little off topic, but I'm curious how old you were when you were diagnosed? I'm confident that I am also dyslexic and autistic which affects my teaching/research, and I'm hoping to have them officially diagnosed. However I read that the diagnosis is tricky for adults.",
