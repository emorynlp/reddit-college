  "text": "I been using Mendeley for several years. I use it for reading and annotating PDF documents and also as reference manager in word. \n\nI am getting increasingly annoyed with Mendeley because the link to ms word regularly breaks and requires a restart of word and an uninstall+reinstall of the extension to work. \n\nI'm now reading that most people here recommend zotero and that Mendeley was built from zotero. So maybe I should bite the bullet and switch? How would I in that case go about moving my several gb database from Mendeley to zotero? Any advice here. \n\nThanks.",

It may be a good excuse to purge your own database to see what you really need.",

I have made so many notes and comments on PDFs in the Mendeley interface and they don't actually get save to the PDFs themselves. In Zotero you can mark up directly on the PDFs and it gets saved to the native file, but that means I would lose 5+ years of markups I have already done. I think when I finish my PhD I will be less worried about losing those annotations, will do a bulk migration and start over with new markups on new docs in Zotero.",
