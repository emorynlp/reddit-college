  "title:": "Professors of Reddit: Do you think you would have been happy as an undergrad at the current university you work at?",
  "text": "I frequently wondered this while I was in undergrad. Perhaps you're happy in your department but you would not have jived with the campus culture back then. My university is a very regionally respected PUI  and has great resources and very accomplished faculty in their respective fields. While I met plenty of very smart, ambitious students, it's an 'up-and-coming' university and wasn't very 'academic' in terms of the culture of the student body (not that I'm one to talk). More students choose the university for the atmosphere and culture (campus, parties, babes, chic-fil-a) rather than a specific academic program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit: Grad students, post-docs, and adjuncts are encouraged to chime in!",

I mean, there are definitely differences -- football Saturdays, to name a prominent one -- but in my experience our undergrads find a cohort, that cohort sticks together, and there's a lot of freedom to define your own undergrad experience. That is, the kids who want to party will party, and the kids who are more academically focused have plenty of ways to do that too. That was more or less my experience at SLAC, even if the student body was a fraction of the size. So it's not really a culture question for me as much is it is, would I be happy studying here? Well, I loved having small classes, getting to play a lot of music, and the relationship I had with my applied teacher, and most of that mirrors our undergrads' experience here (with the exception of their core classes, which are high-enrollment). So the answer is yes. I might have even preferred the resources of the big school, like new tech and a much more developed music library. And a bowling alley.",

My UG definitely had a distinct culture (which actually wasn't great for me because I didn't fit in with it, but it was great for people who did). The biggest difference though was that the administration and the professoriate didn't feel as aloof and uncaring. I had a personal relationship with my dean, I knew the facilities and office staff by name, and in general I felt like I both knew where to go if I had a problem and that I would be understood and helped. Like, as an example, this past summer there was that executive order to kick out F1 students whose classes had gone online because of the pandemic, and my UG immediately set to work figuring out how to help people stay, and my R1 basically sent everyone an email that amounted to \"too bad so sad\".",

Socially the R1 is a better place to be because there are so many people that you can find a clique for anything, but no undergrad here is anywhere near as close to any of the faculty as I was at my SLAC. Maybe some research students would be with their immediate supervisor, but I had that kind of relationship with ~5 professors rather than just the one. I also probably wouldn't have been able to go to grad school because nobody would have told me that a science major really, really needs to do research.",

I would probably have transferred out of here after a semester. Also way too many business majors, vs zero at my alma mater. Basically different kinds of schools despite being similar in size. Plus my undergrad was in a vibrant city close to all sorts of great outdoor stuff and here we are...not either of those. Honestly, I'm often surprised that we get the quality of students we do here given the alternatives elsewhere.\n\nThat said, I've had a lot of contact with my alma mater in the last few years (alumni board member, etc.) and it's changed too. Social life for college students is pretty lame today compared to the 1980s...even pre-COVID they are all on screens all the time, doors closed, basically living in isolation with too many rules. Back in the Reagan years we had one phone on the hall, a single 19\" TV to share, and people generally had their doors open so it was a very social atmosphere. I talk with my students a lot (and my daughter, currently in school as elsewhere) and what they tell me makes me glad I went to college a generation ago.",

Everything administrative was so straight forward and they were skilled at guiding you to the resources or information you needed. \n\nAt my current place, the admin is bloated beyond belief. I often run in circles of emails trying to figure out which admin is responsible for what and how we can make things happen both for myself as a grad student, but also for the undergrads I work with. The entire admin process is a mystery, and the people working in these positions aren't really sure of what they are in charge of. There is just no written procedure for many basic elements of running a school (e.g., how to pay students from a grant without the process taking 8 months). It's led to my advisors suggesting that we just skip out on opportunities that require administrative oversight.\n\nI can't even imagine what kind of confusion I would run into if I were entering this place as an undergrad and this was my first experience with higher ed.",

      "text": "No, I'm at a big anonymous R1 university, with frats and huge classes and lots of binge drinking, and the students are a bit lost (and the standards are, frankly, low).\n\nAs an undergrad, though, I went to a challenging liberal arts college with small classes and a very focused (almost cloistered) academic life. \n\nI thrived there.  I never would have been able to pursue the career that I've actually had if I'd gone to the school I currently teach at.\n\nit worries me, sometimes.  but I do the best I can with my students today, even if I can't give them what I had.",

Great university atmosphere, but also can go enjoy all the benefits of being in the city (concerts, shows, professional sports, other people who aren\u2019t students). I\u2019m at a prestigious private institution now, and would have hated it for undergrad. The students here are more serious than most of the faculty! I look fondly upon all the keggers, football tailgating, and mischief of my youth. I have to remind students here to \u201cget out of the lab and enjoy being 20!\u201d.",
