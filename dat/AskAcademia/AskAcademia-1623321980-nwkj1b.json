  "title:": "Does online teaching make you tired?",
  "text": "I am a first time professor and while I taught a couple of classes in person before the pandemic, this is my first time teaching this many hours. I found that attending conferences online is much more energy draining if compared to attending them in person. I started teaching after earning my PhD in 2020, so you can imagine that I've only experienced online professoring for the time being. What I realized is that teaching for hours online is incredibly exhausting. Given what I experienced with conferences, I can imagine that if the similarity holds, teaching in person should be somewhat less exhausting. Is this true? Do you think that online teaching is more exhausting than in person teaching?",

However, the pandemic has made everything tiring.\n\nIf you are teaching live on Zoom, I can imagine it\u2019s exhausting. After a day on Zoom, I am physically and mentally drained. I\u2019m tired of looking at myself, I\u2019m tired of not being able to read cues. It\u2019s tiring.\n\nI do find in person teaching to be both exhilarating (while it\u2019s happening) and exhausting (after), but I am an introvert.",

Perhaps it's also that there's way less interaction. Most of my students (freshmen) are probably too shy to turn on the mic and ask a question (when they do they prefer the chat) so it's basically me talking for prolonged periods of time.",

              "text": "Oh, I'm positive the lack of interaction matters. I've had to run a lot of Zoom meetings in the past year and speaking to a sea of black boxes is exhausting.\n\nBut, I also do the 20 minutes of quiet staring after I teach in person. One thing that I've worked to do is plan my teaching days a lot better knowing that I need some downtime/recuperation time. I generally don't schedule meetings or anything important right after class and don't feel bad if I don't accomplish a whole lot on teaching days. It's easier for me to do because I'm generally only teaching two days a week, rather than every day, so YMMV. \n\nI should just say that your first few years teaching a full-time schedule is also a lot. I also taught in grad school, but the transition to a 3-3 was so much more than just a tripling of work. You get better at knowing how to manage your energy swings and class schedule in ways that are good for you and good for the student.\n\nIn other words, it does get better, I promise!",

I also found that my social anxiety was worse on zoom. Since I couldn\u2019t see the vast majority of my students, I didn\u2019t know if they were there, who else was there, if they understood the concepts, etc. I understand the reasons for students not turning their cameras on\u2026but it makes one hell of an experience for the instructor.",

But you also would benefit from re-thinking the material and the presentation techniques.  \n\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes is trying to offer courses that were previously given in real life as online courses. They simply do not translate.\n\nMy teaching is on workshops, so limited attendance of 24 people, and everyone has actually found the online versions are better than the live ones (with minor exceptions of course). In my case of course there is plenty of interaction, and the way the interaction works has been much better than a live course. e.g. for any questions on exercises or the material, the second teacher can constantly monitor the Teams chat and answer questions without interrupting the flow.  \n\n\nHaving said that, I still find myself tired after a full day of teaching. Do not underestimate the physical aspect of it. I find when I break up my day between sitting and standing, I keep much more energized. And make good use of coffee and lunch breaks (if you have them where you teach) to be physical. Go for a walk, a short run, or even do some push ups, seriously, it will make a world of difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck :)",

Online classroom sessions often result in really low engagement by many students, and it's impossible to walk around and see how people are getting on, challenge errors that you spot, etc. You can only see what they share, which often is very little. You can design around this somewhat, but if your university was anything like ours we were not given any resource to actually spend time re-writing our material for online format, so the opportunities to reformulate things were limited, and the module specifications/accreditations/assessment formats often have fixed requirements on what the skills and content to be covered are. \n\nIf you can't write the module from scratch for an online format, the whole thing is harder work, less effective, and frankly soul crushing.",

So, I went async and made videos, and that helped a lot. \n\nTeaching in person has its own challenges, mainly classroom management, which is also tiring. But when things go well, it's pretty energizing.",

      "text": "I taught relatively small (24 students max) and interactive classes and I found teaching online less exhausting than in person. Besides the benefits of not having to ~~put on pants~~ leave the house, I also enjoyed the actual teaching more when I taught online. I required students to turn on their cameras during the Zoom sessions, and they actually participated more actively on average than in person. It seemed easier for them to ask questions, with the chat and raise hand funtion. Also, I loved the fact that since they couldn't tell who I was looking at, they just all acted like I was looking deep into their eyes the whole time ;)\n\nHowever, I imagine it would be way more energy-draining to teach a large lecture class online. The idea of talking to empty black boxes over an extended amount of time seems extremely depressing to me.",
