  "text": "So, I\u2019m thinking of doing a conversion course for a career change, which is an MSc. I know I\u2019m not entitled for a Student Finance loan because I already have a masters degree, but would there be any funding bodies in which I would be eligible for applying for funding?",

              "text": "Research councils fund PhDs because PhDs are a great way of getting research done and in training new researchers. MScs don't offer that, so there is no incentive for the research councils to stump up money.  \n\nUniversities are ranked by their research output, and by the quality of their teaching. Providing scholarships for PhDs presses one of those buttons. Providing scholarships for MScs does not.\n\nMSc level scholarship are like hens teeth. WE offer a few each year (about half a dozen across the entire university) to improve access for BAME students. Most places I've worked have not even had that.",
