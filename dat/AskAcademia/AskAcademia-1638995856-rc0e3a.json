I am conducting a research study on academic advising practices in higher education (IRB approved). If you are or have been an academic advisor (professional or faculty) I would love for you to participate in my survey. There is a chance to win one of four $25 gift cards. The link is below.\n\nhttps://caldwell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2lrhYCzKTGTH3ee",
