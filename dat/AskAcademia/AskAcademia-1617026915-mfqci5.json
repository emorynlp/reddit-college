  "text": "This may be a really basic question, but when you're writing a series of related papers, how do you make sure your lit review isn't just repeating yourself from previous papers? As long as it's framed for your current paper, and you haven't self-plagiarised, is there any problem stating the same stuff with the same references? Do you try to avoid it? Why/why not?  \n\nFor reference I'm a (very) early-career social science researcher.",

          "text": "Yes - I have published papers with similar theoretical frameworks/citing some of the same lit, but what matters is that the empirical part is different enough that you can change up the general framing even if you stick to a particular theory throughout that you may have used in previous papers. Organize the lit review in the way you organize your different findings sections, and you shouldn't run into any major concerns with regard to self-plagiarism. I've also reviewed papers which heavily cited the author's own work and used concepts/phrases only he uses (as in, he made them up, and nobody else uses them), and while it's kind of frustrating as a reviewer, it's not academically dishonest.",
