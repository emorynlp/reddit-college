  "title:": "How do European Universities compare to each other? I already know that rankings don't mean much in Europe; however, based on your experience, would any of you attempt to make a country-based ranking or so?",
  "text": "I\u00b4m from South America, and after doing a lot of research, I\u00b4ve figured out that University rankings don\u00b4t mean much in Europe and now I understand why. However, with time, I\u00b4ve become really curious about what are the differences between the education systems among EU countries; therefore, I\u00b4d like to know if from your experience (maybe you\u00b4ve done an international exchange in 2 or 3 different countries, or maybe your brother/sister studied in a foreign country and now you have an opinion about that country\u00b4s educational system, etc) any of you would state that there are \"better and worse educational systems\" among EU countries, and If so, which ones and why.\n\nFor example, I already know that the UK is seen as the European country with the best education, but I\u00b4ve also read that studying in France is really challenging, but the French just don\u00b4t care about rankings (at all) and they could easily compete with the British. Is that true? And what about Italy, then? And the Netherlands? And the Netherlands Vs. Belgium? And I always thought that the Universities of Vienna and Helsinski were at the top of the world, but they\u00b4ve remained below the top 100, according to rankings. Have their educational level really decreased? And what about Luxemburg? And German Universities vs. UK universities? Which systems could be the most challenging (more difficult tests/more coursework throughout the academic year)? Which systems could have the best teaching methods? Which systems could have the lowest acceptance rate for posgraduate studies?\n\nHaving said this, I know in advance that is almost impossible (and unfair) to compare between countries and its Universities, but I\u00b4d really like to know people\u00b4s opinions about their perceptions in regard to this topic. Thanks!",

You can fill a room with almost 40 students, all from different universities, with just people who studied in Paris alone. This is why..even if they do merge the universities, it's just too many of them to have any effect short to medium time. Germany got this right with their small and focused research institutes so maybe France could look into that.",

A lot of my professors were wonderful as people, but another thing about French institutions is there is no expectation of students getting personal attention from teachers outside of the classroom until MA or maybe PhD, and they're very big on hierarchy, however.",

For a student, that doesn't really produce an effect, as most Dutch Universities are all relatively similar in those rankings. However, if you are looking for a place to work afterwards, be aware that there is the continuing idea that we should compete with Ivy League and Oxbridge, but on a tenth of the endowment. \n\nSimilarly, although I do not necessarily disagree with the \"Cosmopolitan Culture\" remark, that is very much an effect of the bubble in which University towns in NL exist. It is a consistent complaint of friends, colleagues and students that it is very, very difficult to connect with the Dutch and most people and students are (happy) in the Academic Multi Cultural Bubble (that often includes a teeny percentage of Dutch students). \n\nAll universities in the Netherlands are really good in what they do, and I can especially recommend one of the Technical Universities (that actually do work together a lot and have divided areas of expertise amongst themselves). Culture wise though, it is certain easier to live here as an expat than in certain other countries, but I would caution against wearing too rose-tinted glasses if coming here.\n\nSource: Dutch academic working in NL with a lot of experience abroad.",

New breakthrough in cancer treatment from Oxbridge is going to raise the profile of Oxbridge in general, so much so that even the political science department benefits from such a ranking boost, even though they have nothing to do with cancer research.\n\nThe place I did my BSc was not a research oriented university at all, so they are never going to produce world changing research. That is also not their goal. They are very much a teaching-oriented university. They hire staff based solely on their ability and willingness to teach. So in terms of their enthusiasm for teaching and the quality of teaching, it was really excellent. And at BSc level, that's ultimately what I needed. In some ways, it's probably better than being at a very \"prestigious\" place where some professors consider teaching to be a distraction and don't fully invest themselves in it.",

Big universities are publishing more, more papers, higher rank. The quality isn't as important.\n2. How much of your publishing is done in English.\n\nThese two will absolutely end most European countries except for Britain and a couple of countries.\n\nI don't think anybody doubts that Germany is an engineering powerhouse and a really big player at several areas. Yet, most German Universities don't even show up at ranks, That's because of how German education is structured towards both a practical point of view and the fact there are hundreds of small dedicated research institutes competing for funding alongside those universities. None of those, the institutes, technical universities and universities will ever get top 20 ranks but nobody can deny how good they are.\n\nCountries east of Germany (Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania etc...) tend to publish things on their native language. Bachelor thesis, masters and sometimes even phD is published first on their own languages. Nothing is wrong with that but the ranks don't care if you're publishing a major breakthrough at world of maths..in Russian (this is also valid for Asia but lets focus on Europe for now)\n\nFrance. France is flipping awesome. France will never get a big university. This is just how they are structured. Small department and fields focused colleges/Grand Ecoles instead of mainstream big universities. Paris alone has: 6 Groupings of Universities subdivided in 13 Universities and 30 Grand Ecoles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, just read papers, find a professor you admire/want to work with and chase him down all over Europe. Be it Poland, Portugal or Germany. It doesn't matter. If the funding is there and the research gets done. Be proud",

This encourage you to write your paper in polish. But if you write your paper in polish, no one outside of Poland will read it.\n\nIf you are an author from non-english speaking country (especialy if you are in social sciences/humanities), all of your papers invole a trade off: Do you aim at public impact or academic one?

      "text": "I see you must be overwhelmed with all the info, whether to trust rankings or to trust which ones.  \n\n\nMost ranking agencies rank US and UK based universities among their top 50 or top 100. Scattered through you will find some Chinese, Singaporean, South Korean, Japanese, Swiss, Canadian, Australian and of course some European as well.  \n\n\nI definitely agree with others that rankings don't mean much here in Europe. One reason is that European countries have a lot of niche universities. Karolinska Institute in Sweden is one of the top medical schools in the world but since they are not a university in the sense that they don't offer programs and courses in other disciplines, don't have huge intake of students and a limited number of programs, they will be ranked low overall when compared to say Harvard or Stanford or Oxford. So it matters what your field of interest is.  \n\n\nI can not say much about all fields but for engineering/tech fields most European countries have some dedicated universities. Sweden has KTH and Chalmers. Netherlands has TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, Denmark has DTU, Germany has a number of TUs and so on. These universities are among the best in some engineering disciplines like electrical engineering, materials science. Netherlands has one of the world's best agriculture research university - Wageningen.  \n\n\nRanking and even reputation of your field at that university is one thing, the cost of living, climate, weather, your goals post graduation, job opportunities and a number of other factors should be taken into account when choosing a university. Scandinavia in general is very welcoming, while each country has their own language, English is spoken by pretty much everyone and university tuition is also low or non existent (Norway) when compared to US/UK but the weather sucks and many people from tropical or sub tropical countries complain when they have to face harsh winters and months of darkness.  \n\n\nJob opportunities also depend on various factors. Right now with COVID, I have no idea how this would affect upcoming batches of students but from their reputation, I would bet that Scandinavian countries with their strong economic policies and management, will handle economic downturn pretty well and be up and running much sooner than rest of the world.  \n\n\nI don't have much experience about other countries but Italy and Spain are relatively cheap to live and have some good universities and Mediterranean weather is also great for most of the year. Germany definitely has amazing universities but job prospects would be tied to you language proficiency so I suggest you focus on learning German from day 1. Same for French if you choose France but be aware that French people frown upon English so you may have a tough time initially communicating with locals (I have heard about active frowning upon English language by the French from a lot of accounts but I am not generalizing so don't get offended). Belgium, Netherlands are also great choices given their international nature.  \n\n\nSwitzerland would be a really amazing choice if you can manage to get into one of their federal universities - ETH/EPFL but admission rate is very low and they are among the world top 20 by most ranking agencies so yes. They are the best. But Switzerland is expensive. On average twice as expensive at least compared to any other place in Europe and getting permanent residence is also a long long journey if that is your end goal.",

A random top-40 in the world American university is likely to mean less than Leiden University when applying for jobs in the Netherlands and likely to mean much less than the ENS or the Sorbonne when applying for jobs in France or the LSE when applying for jobs in the UK! I think that rankings can be useful sometimes but most often are just very US centric and Oxbridge and London centric. The universities are often just too small and structured differently to the monster American universities to do well in the rankings. My home university like to make a big deal of how well they are ranked but that is just because of marketing, I have never really heard anyone in academia remark how well my university is ranked, rather they will reference individual departments or scholars.\n\nEdit: for clarity",

      "text": "I did my BA in the UK at a University which ranks between 600-800, with an exchange year in Paris at a business school (Ecole Superieure) that is not in any rankings as its quite small, and my MA at a Dutch university which ranks in top 100. (I'm originally from Nordics).\n\nWhat can I say is that rankings absolutely do matter. They give a good indication of the overall level, of course, they should be taken with a grain of salt and not blindly relied on.\n\n\\- For the UK, it is definitely a very good indicator, I can easily say that my Uni there left me desiring for more and when I talked with others that went to higher ranking Unis in the UK, the difference in level was clear. Perhaps the most visible thing with the lower-ranking university was the other students, most were not much interested in studying,  performed badly, and the whole university lacked the atmosphere of seriousness.\n\n\\- For France, rankings matter much less because many French universities are not even in the international ranking lists, but within the country, people will know how each school is 'ranked' or rather viewed from the reputational point. Some schools like Sorbonne and Science Po (and some others) are viewed as out of this world and have immense status attached to). The school I went to was very highly regarded, top-notch teachers, guest speakers, etc. Very competitive environment, teachers were tough, but the study style is vastly different from the UK (in France they really love presentations for example).\n\n\\- For the Netherlands, it seems like all of their universities (not the applied sciences ones) are ranking within the top 100. I can say especially comparing to my UK uni, the level in NL is so so much higher, tougher and the teachers are well-known academics in their respective fields. All other students are super focused, the study is very demanding, its really hard to get good grades, and overall the atmosphere is overall very 'academic'.\n\nEdit: the rankings are based on this: [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/-1/sort\\_by/rank/sort\\_order/asc/cols/stats](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/-1/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats)",

      "text": "I can only speak for Germany (currently doing my BA in philosophy, German Studies, and education there). Your workload will very much depend on your subject. (disclaimer: I can only speak for how things are at my university. I know that things may be different at other German universities)\n\nI did maths for a while, and there you have weekly homework that you need to hand in, and you need to get 50% of the points overall for that, just to be allowed to take the actual exam. At the same time for philosophy and German Studies there's a lot of weekly readings. But if we're real here, you can get by even if you don't do all of the readings. In philosophy we usually have to do 2 assignments per seminar to be allowed to take the exam/write the final paper. Usually 1 oral assignment (e.g. a presentation, lead a discussion, record a podcast, etc.) and 1 written assignment (an essay). Same applies for German most of the time (although we do also have weekly homework for Medieval German).\n\nNow, the important thing (and I think that's different to how the US does it) is that you're solely graded on your final exam. All those smaller assignments during the semester are just a pass/fail thing. So there's way more pressure to do well in exams.\n\nWe also don't have something like Ivy League universities, as the majority of German universities are public. However, there is the \"German Universities Excellence Initiative\". Every 4 years 11 universities get elected be part of this initiative and receive extra funding. So they're kinda considered to be \"elite universities\".\n\nI am at one of those 11 universities, and they pride themselves with that, and also that they're in the Top100 universities of the shanghai university ranking (Top5 for national universities, best uni for maths in Germany). But as a humanities student you don't really profit from that :'D",

Definitely there is a larger emphasis on this one final exam than the US system, however, perhaps made more difficult by the fact multiple choice is not a thing in Germany. Everything is written form, essay based, or mathematical proofs.",

Do you want to stay in the country or go back to South America?\n\nI have studied and worked in a few countries in the EU. so here is my take. I am talking mostly about humanities here. \n\n* Belgium: very risk-averse. Also more focused on domestic students. Internationals are more used for the high tuition fees\n* Portugal: takes risks with research. A bit old-fashioned bureaucratic to start but you have liberty (depends on supervisor though).\n* Austria: well-funded, organised, but it does not seem to play internationally. Very much inwards but open to foreign students. The country is open administratively as well (more than Belgium for example) but the population is quite conservative. \n* Germany: A bit more open, but the academic job market is really hard. Only 5% of academics have tenure, others have 6ys contracts max. So it's good for a PhD and postdoc but not for later on. No tuition fees though!\n* Italy: the most beautiful country of the list probably but the University is just chaotic. No organisation whatsoever. An Erasmus student aborted her exchange after one month because the teaching and studying in general was so bad. \n* UK: actually the level if the students is not that good. Because of the high tuition fees, students are treated like customers, and they are not challenged as much as in other countries. Good for research though. On the other hand, UKRI has opened its grants for all international students so it's not limited to UK/EU students anymore. \n* Norway: very good conditions for study. I think you still get a maintenance grant. but it's Norway, not a really exciting place to live (and ridiculously expensive as well).\n* France: no experience, but they are pretty chauvinistic.\n\nEvery country has its advantages and disadvantages. I would certainly choose a place where you get a scholarship.",

For international students, some masters are between 950-1750 euros for the whole academic year, while literally every other university with such high ranking position (I\u00b4ll be going to KU Leuven, ranked 45\u00b0 by THE) charged 17,000 euros and above (I literally looked into every top 200 university, and by \"every\" I literally mean every), so I\u00b4d say that Belgium would be the cheapeast option (among not only Europe, but every other high ranked university) for international students (if you don\u00b4t get an scholarship).",

Other countries charge like 14,000 euros and up to foreigners even at public institutions, or else are taught in non-English languages.",

That's because you're likely to need your university to have a name and international connections, since you won't live in the universities country forever.\nI would avoid Germany because the classes are giant with hundreds of people in the same room, and the professors are arrogant and make people fail on purpose. In the UK you get a lot of personal connections with them and a lot of support.\nI'd definitely look into the northern countries, specifically Sweden has some very good universities.",

          "text": "I understand why you were downvoted, but for anyone who is interested why this poster made the comment he did about Germany, I would like to clarify: it is true that for some subjects you will fail. A certain percentage of the class *needs* to fail for some subjects. It\u2019s nothing to do with arrogance on the part of the professor, and everything to do with that just being how the system works at some universities and for some subject areas.\n\nThe class average determines exactly that, the average. A C. The bottom however-many-percent of the class will fail. The top however-many-percent will get A\u2019s. As an extreme (and unlikely) example, if the class average is 90/100, because you happen to be a part of an extremely capable cohort, 90 could become a C. It is an extreme meritocracy. It not only depends on how good you are, you also have to be better than all of your peers. It\u2019s like combining class rank and grade into one measure, and makes it extraordinarily difficult to translate your grades outside of the German system. \n\nThe grading scale runs from 1 (best) to 6 (worst), though 5 is a fail. Thus, a degree grade of 2.5 is Good, and implies that among those who graduated, within your subject cohort at your university, you were perfectly average. Converting your grade based on international conversion tables, however, downgrades you to something around a 3.0 in the US system. Maybe even a 2.67. Despite the fact that, in recent years, national average grades in the US have moved towards a B (3.3) for many subjects. In the German system that wouldn\u2019t be possible. The average is, and will always be, a 2.5.\n\nThis system does prevent grade inflation, indicates to employers your class rank among your cohort, and also whittles down the number of students for subjects that have no enrolment limits (Numerus Clausus), since you need to pass core classes in order to progress in the degree program. It also, however, fosters an absolutely cutthroat environment in some subjects, where collaborating with other students to study, and for note sharing, is not an optimal strategy; because your classmate may then do better than you - in turn lowering your own grade.",

Germany would be my very last option for university, only before places like Bulgaria or Romania. In Germany 100 students could get grades between 85%-100%, and the ones with 85% would still fail, as you have explained. In other school systems passing or failing isn't tied to how lucky or unlucky you are, it is based on your actual ability-- e.g. 50% will be a pass, even if nobody gets it, or all get it. Also at a German University you will never meet your professors. In other systems, you can literally schedule a 1 on 1 meeting with any of them just to ask them questions.",

In the UK your course is specialised from the beginning, and it only happens very rarely that you have maybe 5 or 10 people from another degree in your lecture. You don't have that whole foundation thing where you study stuff that's not directly related to your degree-- e.g. I study biomedical science, so I had no lectures at all on animals, plants, advanced statistics or non organic chemistry. It only focuses on topics directly related to human biology right from the start. In Germany there's only Biology or Medicine, which are both very broad and generic.\n\nThat means that even in year one (semesters 1 and 2) you can't have just a masters student explaining you anything because a PhD is the minimum requirement to know what you're telling us. If a master student taught us anything he/she would only know it just as well as we do. All of our lecturers are also researchers, and their research usally relates to what they teach. E.g. My genetics professor simultaneously does research on cancer genetics. She can't suddenly go and teach about immunology or cells, because she's only a specialist in genetics.",

There's no difference between different degrees in that aspect.\n\nI think this might have to do with highschool: in Germany in the Abitur you have pretty much all subjects until the very end of grade 12 (Math, German, English, Science, etc...) but in the British school system, there's only 1 kind of highschool and it gets specialised towards the end. All people have to pass the GCSEs in grade 10, which is the minimum requirement to leave high school (equivalent to Mittlere Reife, Hauptschule doesn't exist). If you continue, you only choose 3 subjects you specialise in in your last 2 years, which are your A-Levels (Hochschulreife). \n\nNow the key is, that in your A levels you have an entirely free choice of the 3 subjects you choose. \nYou could only take e.g. Math, Physics and computer science, or philosophy, Art and English literature, or German, Spanish and Maderin. So your A level choices influence which subjects you can apply for at university.\n\nYou have waaay more lessons, with 9 lessons (40min each) 5 days a week, plus 3 times extra curricular activities which are usally made compulsory by the school. Plus 2h homework per day, so you easily have an 8-9h day during all of highschool. This means people who aren't \"cut\" for a bachelors in e.g. math, already fail at their math A level. If you get good grades in Math A level you have to be cut for a bachelors in it by default, because you can't pass any A level without having a lot of determination and a gift for it. For example, I did an A level is physics and ended up with an F. I put in sooo much effort and extra time and sat with my teacher 4h per week after school for extra practice, but I just suck at math. Meanwhile, I did really well in Biology, where our classes best student gave up and dropped it because she never got above C no matter what she tried.",
