  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm very new to the world of graduate degrees and am trying to make an accurate-ish roadmap for myself and my employer to look through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Background**\n\nBS in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, 3.2 cumulative GPA, but a 3.5 comp-sci GPA.\n\n\\~4 years industry experience by the time I apply next year. An internship at a big investment firm, 2 years at a big bank as a software engineer (SWE), and a year or so at Microsoft as a SWE.\n\nNo formal research experience, but have written several 30-page papers in school about financial literacy programs I designed and implemented, as well as a white paper & presentation I wrote/gave at my last job that involved a lot of \"research\" on my own.\n\nHaven't taken the GRE yet, but did take the Magoosh assessment and got a 151Q / 163V, which is better than I expected given I haven't looked at math in about 3-4 years lol.\n\nMy LoRs would be from my current and previous managers, most likely. So 2 from Microsoft management, 1 from a big bank. Or I could reach out to a past professor who has given me recs in the past, who is now a CS professor at a middle-of-the-road uni.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Goal & Interests**\n\nI would **love** to get into GA Tech's ML PhD program, but realize this is a stretch without research experience. Aside from Tech, I just want to get into the \"best\" program possible (I realize that's subjective).\n\nI think I'd be most interested in researching AI/ML applications for education or productivity, or as a super-stretch, cancer research (but this seems most difficult).\n\nI don't want to ask for a list of schools I should apply to, because that's work I need to do. But given my track record, **what \"top-N\" schools could I shoot for**? If I am able to get a high (165Q) GRE score, would my odds without research be just as good as anyone else's? I see a lot of programs list the GRE as optional but... I feel like a great score couldn't possibly hurt.\n\nWould it be better for me to get a master's first so I can demonstrate some research ability? I don't see much value in a master's, tbh, aside from helping get into a PhD program. And if it were a master's, I would prefer to keep my job and do it part time, and I don't know of any online programs that offer research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a lot of text... but thank you all in advance.",

      "text": "I don't know too much about ML/AI programs, but I'm in statistics, currently doing research that involves ML/AI. What I'm about to say applies to PhD programs in statistics departments. I am not sure if the same applies to CS departments, so take what I say with the appropriate grain of salt. Still, some ML programs are housed in statistics departments, and even though this often isn't the case, the fields overlap enough that I'd be surprised if there aren't overlaps in standards. \n\nAlso, my understanding is that ML PhD programs are *more* competitive at the moment than statistics PhD programs that don't necessarily have an ML focus, so you might want to take this into consideration. \n\nOkay, so here's what I know: Some programs will take people without research experience. Usually in those cases, you want a minimum of about a 3.8 GPA to have a chance to get in. You want at least a 160 quant score-- anything lower will be a red flag so don't submit GRE scores if they're optional and you get below a 160Q. Between a 160 and 165 won't really help, but also probably won't hurt. A 165+ tends not to help too much because most of your competition will have scored in that range, but with your lack of experience and low-ish GPA you'll need all the help you can get, so a 165+ could be a nice boost to your app. The typical accepted student at an UNRANKED school that I'm familiar with has a 3.8+ GPA, 165+ GRE quant, and minimal research experience, but usually slightly more than none. Getting into a career in academia if you've gone to this school is close to impossible because of it's low rank/reputation, but this school also has a 100% placement rate into 6-figure industry jobs, so take from that what you will. \n\nOnce you have *good* research experience, the need to have that high GPA loosens a bit, but in my experience the floor is set at about a 3.5 GPA, so you may be in for a rough time. A master's degree with good grades in rigorous, relevant classes plus research experience would definitely help your application. \n\nAt a T-30 school (don't know the rank for sure, but that seems about right) I was told undergrad program reputation counts (which isn't really the case at the unranked school I talked about earlier). Also, the unranked program didn't care about verbal GRE score, whereas this program wants to see you in at least the 50th percentile, which will definitely work in your favor because of the prevalence of nonnative English speakers in this field that struggle on the verbal section. Research experience also isn't absolutely essential at this school, but more weight is placed on it and it's harder to get in without it. Again, the typical accepted PhD applicant has a 3.8+ GPA and 165+ GRE score in the quant section. Again, they do accept students with lower GPAs, but they'd be hard-pressed to accept someone with a 3.2Cum, 3.5Maj GPA who has no research experience. \n\nBoth of these departments are statistics departments that do ML research, but aren't the \"primary\" department for ML research on those campuses. It's possible that ML housed in CS departments has different standards. It's also possible that even different statistics departments have different standards. These are just two departments at two schools that I happen to be familiar with that do ML research. I'm familiar with other statistics programs as well, but ones that do less ML research so I'm leaving out what I know about them. My area is in biostatistics, and my experience is that biostatistics programs are easier to get into than ML focused programs. Even then, you'd still have a tough time with your stats.\n\nA master's with good grades in key, rigorous courses plus research experience could definitely increase your chances of admission somewhere. Also, even with your stats, if you apply to enough places there's still a chance of getting in somewhere if you know what your doing and can make it clear to admissions that you're a \"good fit\" for the schools you're applying to. It's going to be tough, though, even at \"low-tier\" schools. \n\n[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ez2prj/d_are_phds_in_machine_learning_really_that/) might be of interest to you, too. \n\nTL;DR These programs are fucking competitive.",

          "text": "I'm in CS. Basically everything you said applies.\n\nWith no research experience, a \"low\" GPA, and a sub par GRE quant, it's a hard sell for someone to fund.\n\nIt sucks, but I've gotta manage my budget and there are dozens of applications that, at least on paper, are significantly less risky. One of the worst things in the world is to roll the dice and then three years later realize you've spent $150k for minimal research output and are facing the prospect of spending another $150k to force meme a dissertation out of the student.",
