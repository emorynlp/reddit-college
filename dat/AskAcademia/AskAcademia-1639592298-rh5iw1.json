  "title:": "Is it normal to not complete everything in your dissertation proposal?",
  "text": "I submitted and defended my research proposal right when covid shut everything down, so the planning of projects and methods was thought through before the world changed. Further, my family had a few medical emergencies I had to help with (including open heart surgery). I\u2019m also a slower worker to begin with so these other things did not help. My original proposal consisted of three overlapping, but distinct, projects. But i\u2019m only done with one and a little halfway through my second project. I am already in my fifth year and my advisor does not want me to delay graduation any further. She wants me to drop my third project all together and modify the second slightly so I can graduate sooner rather than later and graduate in May. \nHowever, I am worried that this looks bad and makes me seem like a lazy, incompetent grad student. Is it normal to not complete everything in a proposal, even when there is not a world wide pandemic. Overall what I have done, while similar to other research, does look at different fields and expands up knowledge in its domain. I just feel bad and worried that I did not do as much as I originally planned.\n\nEdit to add: I have some presentation experience but no publications. I am working on getting an online portfolio set up. That being said, I have no plans to stay in academia and am looking at jobs in the private/government sector. My skill set, much gained from the research I have completed for my dissertation, is in demand. Im not sure if any of that makes a difference.",

This is totally normal.\n\nIn general, it is also better to have one project done really well instead of having three half-assed projects. During my time as a grad student, we have done so many experiments, measured so many samples - and how many have made it into the thesis? Barely a handful of them.",

      "text": "Your proposal is intended to demonstrate that you have a good understanding of the research in your area, a good research topic, and a good research plan. Your dissertation is intended to show that you have done a body of research worthy of a PhD. Nobody really cares if it is what you proposed or not and it would be shocking and even disappointing if you learned so little in the process that your dissertation reflected exactly and only what you outlined in your proposal. \n\nThe only time the proposal might come up would be if someone felt that your dissertation reflected too little work or intellectual progress. Then they might look back and note that you proposed more than you actually did and ask why you did not do all that you planned. That's not a death sentence, though, because there could be plenty of excellent reasons for the change of plans: it wasn't feasible, it became obvious that it wouldn't produce interesting results, someone else did it in the mean time, something else became more interesting, etc.",

Your advisor/chair is there to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen, but make sure. \n\nAs for the other stuff about seeming lazy, etc., no one cares. Don\u2019t use excuses because with COVID literally everyone has the same one and productivity has still varied, like it always does. Moreover no one will *ever* read your proposal. If you\u2019re not doing the academic path then it *really* doesn\u2019t matter. Just finish.",
