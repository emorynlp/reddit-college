  "text": " I'm a prospective PhD student from India. I want to do my PhD studies abroad. But my financial situation needs me to work. What are some countries and universities in which I can **save** a **MINIMUM of 300 USD a month** from the stipend I get apart from all my expenses so that I can support my family in India.",

You'll have to look up stipend levels for every program you're interested in globally, compare to COL/your expenses, and see if saving $300/month is feasible.",

      "text": "Even within the US, it varies a lot. I went to grad school in an expensive tech city, but my school had budget issues and could only offer like a $16k 9-month stipend (This was for social sciences in the mid-2000. Engineers at my school were getting double the stipend). Average rent alone was $1000 for a studio, making things very tight. I also got accepted by (and passed) schools  in the middle of nowhere (very cheap) offering $25k stipend that same year. So yes, depends a lot on the school and location. I'm sure if you choose a rural/college town school with an okay stipend, you'll totally be able to save $300 a month.",

If you\u2019re hired on a DFG project (one of the main funding agency) you can usually expect to get around 1,500\u20ac at the start and about 1,700\u20ac at the end (after taxes and after health insurance). How much you can save depends heavily on the city  you\u2019re in. I\u2019m in Munich and accommodation is expensive. But if you\u2019re willing to share a house with others I think is doable",

If this is your sole income you'll be living in poverty, especially considering that it can be difficult to make use of public transit in many, many places, meaning you may have to own a vehicle ($$$).\n\nIn Switzerland, a PhD student makes about 55,000 CHF, which isn't lucrative, but should certainly leave you with saving money if you're frugal.  Cost of living is very high, but it doesn't clearly outpace the pay difference.",

      "text": "USA edition: simple answer - **it depends on where you ended with and cheap you want to be.** \n\nFor stipends, the amount can vary significantly between programs, schools and location. I once was bored while waiting for a PCR reaction and i created a list of programs, universities and their announced stipend amounts. The disparity and level of financial acumen necessary to survive in different geographical location can be very remarkable. \n\nFor example, the graduate school in arts and sciences at columbia university reports $31,140 for 9 months academic year 2021-2022. That translates to $3460/month. Now consider the taxes, cost of living in NYC, you might need to be a bit frugal in your expenses. Even escaping the city and moving to new jersey is not a good option considering the closer the location to the city, the more expensive it can be.\n\nUmich's (Ann arbor) biomed program , on the other hand , offers 2810/month and my friends who lived there can save up more due to the relatively cheaper cost of living. \n\nStaying on campus vs off campus for international students who are starting a new chapter in a foreign country also represent a difference in the potential expenditure to be incurred.",
