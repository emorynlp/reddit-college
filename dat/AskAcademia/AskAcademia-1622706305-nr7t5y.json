  "text": "TLDR: Please tell a young aspiring academic about the positives of academia \n\nBeing a young researcher, about to do a PhD in biology, I thought I\u2019d join this subreddit to get tips about and how to navigate a life in academia. Not going through the posts might have been a mistake however, because most of the content that reaches my feed from here is about how awful academia can be/ when to quit/ how to quit. \nI\u2019m a bit jarred by all this and was wondering if the people on this subreddit who love and enjoy their lives in academia could write a few words.\nTo those who are struggling, I hope you find a career of your choice very soon \u2764\ufe0f",

I have a small start up (tiny to most) that lets me spend money ensuring my undergrads do their projects for me. If I want grants? Sure, I can apply. But my success is not directly tied to others\u2019 successes - the one fear I had throughout my grad career - not being able to support other PhDs.\n\nTeaching is a blast. Kids are dumb as rocks, and they\u2019ll complain about a lot, but they\u2019re also adults and for the most part are reasonable. Plus, I\u2019ve found that the ones who are good are the ones who approach you, leading to quick self selection, where I have five brilliant students working with me on stuff. Are they slower than I\u2019d be on my own? Fuck yes. I can run a study in a week, takes them all semester. But, my job isn\u2019t dependent on me publishing - it will be determined how well these five motivated students do.\n\nThis summer, I\u2019m writing a (wide range given) 24,000-52,000 word (about 100 pages) brief book. To just sit and write all day - the scary part is thinking of the profs who push out 300 page books a year (my advisor). I don\u2019t have that big of an ego. But still, to write all day has been immensely pleasurable. My research continues slowly, and I keep so many different projects in the air at one time that I can task switch out if I\u2019m bored.\n\nI answer to mostly me. I did a non ac post doc, and having a true boss was unideal. My work was great; but I didn\u2019t like having someone checking on me on how it was going, or getting approval.\n\nI have an amazing and supportive spouse who is changing her career based on our move. The pandemic changed the change plans, but also bought her a year of work-from-home life that made her realize she wanted a career change. She also has equal power to pull the plug at any moment, which helps keep me motivated in my own research, since I\u2019m not focused on my tenure packet (They\u2019ve told us if we want it we\u2019ll get it and research doesn\u2019t matter) but for the job market, which is both insane but gives me something to fight for.\n\nBasically, I pursue projects I like, with smart students and students who want a chance, with no true worries on grants, and have a spouse who is my rock.",

              "text": "> it has been my dream to be TT at a small liberal arts college.\n\nIt's a good gig. I went to an SLAC in the 80s and decided that was what I wanted to do for a career by age 20. Through grad school in the 90s (three degrees) I never once had an advisor or committee member with any experience in SLACs or who cared about anything other than research/publishing. They weren't opposed to the idea, but following the model of all R1s they just expected all their grad students to also aspire to the R1 market. So I was pretty much on my own in navigating career prep and the job market.\n\nI've been an SLAC faculty member for 20+ years now. It's not exactly like I'd imagined when I was a student-- the reality of academic labor has changed a lot since the 1980s --but it's still a great gig on the whole. I can't imagine myself doing anything else, and now that I'm on the down slope toward retirement (10 more years perhaps) I have no regrets about having chosen this path, save at times the relatively low pay compared to other professionals with similar levels of education. \n\nAs a department chair with a lot of hiring experience, I'll offer a bit of unsolicited advice: if you want to work at an SLAC get as much real teaching experience as you can before you go on the market (TAing doesn't count) and study pedagogy relevant to your field. Take teaching classes if they are offered in your department, if not go to workshops on campus and ideally at your professional meetings. We don't hire people without serious teaching experience and the best candidates will not only have that but will be fairly sophisticated in talking about pedagogy as well. In fact, we often look to new hires to be innovators in teaching-- we learn from them as they are encountering new ideas in graduate school and through their professional associations.",

It houses a lot of soft money labs (labs that only exist based on grant funding) while also including hard money labs (labs whose salaries are still paid by the university). They're your research institutions. This steps down from R2 to R3, with each step down having less intense focus on getting those million dollar grants. R1s, 2s, and 3s have PhD programs since they're research focused.\n\nSLAC - Small liberal arts college; PUI - Primarily Undergraduate Institution. Generally interchangable, but SLACs will argue they're different because you have that liberal arts focus. Primarily teaching based colleges and universities, focus much less on grants - here, winning a $50,000 grant would be considered large. There is generally very little graduate level programs at SLACs and PUIs, and if there is, it's typically Masters level for professional certifications.",

In the US the categories were defined long ago by the Carnegie Institution and the \"Research 1\" tag and similar are from a version of that system that was replaced 20 years ago. Note also that \"SLAC\" has never been part of that official taxonomy; in the current nomenclature they would usually be identified as \"Baccalaureate Colleges\u2014Arts & Sciences.\"\n\nThe [current Carnegie classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education) are significantly different and more complex, so lots of people just ignore them and use the old familiar ones instead.

But I would say that treating it as a back-up or safety job is exactly how you don't get the job. Every job is competitive right now, and SLACs are on high alert because of the competitiveness.\n\nThink about it this way - in a non-competitive market, the R1-goal individuals apply to R1s, and generally get their goal. The people into teaching apply to teaching focused schools, they get their goal. While of course the job market is always terrible and this is definitely in a perfect situation, we can agree that this is how in a perfect world things would work.\n\nBut  in a competitive market, those R1 people are looking for ANY job. Maybe their post-doc ran out. They're clearly the best of the best- winning NSF GRFPs, maybe a T32 or something. But they don't get it. And they say, it's okay, I'll go this SLAC for a bit, buy a year, and then scoot on over to my dream job. Or, oh, I think I'll like this... and then realize, no, you won't, because teaching a 3/3 or a 4/4 is soul crushing and your research productivity tanks and you're miserable. Miserable - but still the best application in the pile.\n\nAnd so SLACs look at that great application and go, \"Hm. Do they actually want to have a 3/3 load, or are they so into research they're going to hate it here and leave, and we're going to have to do this whole thing over again in a few years from now?\" And, they might turn your application away in favor of someone else with a slightly worse CV but looks like they'd be more able to survive at a SLAC (and would not make an R1 short list).\n\nHow do you prove that yes, I was trained at an R1, but I'm not sold on researchz life? You teach. And not just the stupid TA stuff they make you do - yes, everyone has run a discussion section of Methods. But really be the instructor of record. Design syllabi. Get a teaching cert if your college has a teaching and learning center. Teach ethics at a business school for that sweet sweet summer cash ($8k/course for me). Teach over the summer to the five med-school track undergrads who need to prep for their MCATs. Teach.",

As a department chair at an SLAC with a lot of hiring experience, I can affirm this. Especially the part about the R1 uber-researcher not being attractive to search committees. We hire to tenure and expect/hope people will spend their careers with us; the last thing we want is to bring on someone who won't be focused on the job and may leave in a few years. Ultimately *all* of the qualified applicants in an SLAC hiring pool are almost certainly capable of producing the level of research/publication required to earn tenure, but only a fraction are actually qualified/suited to handle the teaching/mentoring load that makes up 2/3 of the job.",

But that said, I've never had to worry about scheduling a doctor's appointment, or even a haircut, during the workweek and don't have to tell anyone that I will be in late or leaving early to do so. I'm now in control of schedules for my department and have overloaded my Tuesdays/Thursdays to be able to often take off on Fridays for a long weekend during the school year (that said, I don't say that I'm not available for meetings on Fridays as that would be a bit unfair to other heavy-scheduled colleagues, but if I've got the day free of classes or meetings, I'll most likely not be on campus).",

And then OP should keep track of what the funding lines are in certain areas and how much there is to go around and  what the expected load is for that track and how much your school supports that advancement track and dept because this makes a huge difference.\n\nBeing a law professor (n of 1 person whom I am jealous of) also seems like an excellent gig and does not require either the teaching , service or research load in my field.",

While those jobs aren't bad, being faculty at a private university is almost unmeasureably better.

I know everything there is to know about that pebble. I am the world\u2019s expert on that pebble. Ask me anything about it, and you\u2019ll die of old age before I shut up about it. \n\nBut no one can know everything about *all* the pebbles of the mountain. Hell, just the other day, I heard that on the other side of the mountain, there are pebbles that are a totally different color and composition than the ones I know about! Even near my pebble, there are other pebbles sorta like mine, but just different enough that I don\u2019t know them so well. \n\nThere are two keys to not letting this crush your spirit. First, of course, is to always remember that everyone else is in the same boat as you: we all know a lot about a very little pebble. \n\nEvery now and again, someone tosses a slightly larger stone on that mountain and everyone looking at that face of the mountain notices \u2014 but even that person may have only a passing familiarity with the other faces of the mountain they contributed to, and they don\u2019t even know that other mountains exist, that their mountain is just one in an entire range and there are mountains they\u2019ve never seen of out there!\n\nThe second key to not always feeling like a dunce is to always be curious, whether it\u2019s about nearby pebbles or that other face of your mountain, or hell, even that peak way off into the distance. It\u2019s miraculous that there is so much to know, and we have the ability to try to know it. \n\ntl;dr: How do I cope?

The main benefit, as noted is freedom.  No clock in/clock out, ability to set your own schedule (teaching duties allowing), freedom to do the research you are interested in (if you can sell it).  Lots of supported travel (conferences etc), which quite often are co-joined with a holiday - saving on airfares etc.\n\nThe downside is that that freedom to set your own schedule normally means you end up working more hours, rather than less.  Grants are great-  but you need to make the output.  You need to meet certain performance indicators (which can vary hugely).\n\nIt is hard work - but I would not swap it for any other career I can think of.\n\noh - and the money is generally crap.",

Your point regarding why subs like this are bombarded with negative posts is valid, but it's arguably very important for PhD students and aspiring academics to have a realistic impression of the chances that they will actually land a permanent position in academia should they want one. It's a numbers game, and generally the odds are not in your favor. It is a good career, but it's also a very niche career and it's better viewed in that sense.\n\nEDIT: I spent a while trying to think of an appropriate analogy. The best might be acting and actors. There are tons of aspiring actors out there and very few who \"make it big\". There are also a lot of very talented aspiring or under-employed actors who are quite good at what they do and just didn't get lucky in terms of getting a shot. The same can very easily be said of PhDs (lots of them, many of them talented / creative / etc enough that they would be successful academics, but still won't end up there for a variety of reasons out of their control) and tenure track professors (very few of them compared to the total number of PhDs graduating). Pursuing acting or getting degrees in drama / theater / etc can still be a very fulfilling and worthwhile pursuit and maybe even a useful major for a non-acting career, but in the same way that most acting students and actors will not be the next successful movie star, most PhDs will not get a TT job. The analogy of course breaks down when you consider that professors make a ridiculously tiny percentage of a what a movie star makes.",

                  "text": "Interesting and thought-provoking analogy! I\u2019m a professor who worked for a short time as a professional actor before pursuing a PhD in an unrelated field. One big difference between the two professions, in my experience, is that part of being an actor (at least for the vast majority) is that you are constantly hustling for your next job. That instability is one of the main factors that drove me out of acting, and I freely admit that I\u2019ve valued the stability of tenure. I know that for scientists there is a similar constant hustle for grants, but it\u2019s not quite the same as the grind of auditioning (and the experience of losing a grant because a lazy or hostile peer reviewer didn\u2019t read your proposal carefully isn\u2019t quite the same as the experience of losing a role because of your physical appearance - and nothing in academia compares to the degrading experience of auditioning for commercials).\n\nAnother difference is the sense of autonomy you have as a professor. When I began acting professionally, one of the biggest surprises I encountered was how little control I had over the creative process. I had a tiny window of freedom to create my character during the early rehearsals, but once the show opened, I was expected to do exactly the same thing in every performance. I never acted in film or TV, but it\u2019s my understanding that the film actor has even less control. As an actor, you may be the most visible part of the business, but you\u2019re just the \u201ctalent\u201d at the bottom of the hierarchy. It\u2019s different for superstars, of course, but consider how few actors can both achieve and maintain that status. Even though being a professor has many downsides (and yes, these jobs are extremely hard to get), it still offers considerable autonomy and the opportunity to be in the driver\u2019s seat as a researcher, teacher, and administrator.",

It will be extremely challenging (because understanding the universe is hard) but the people who excel are those who recognize that and enjoy the aspect of figuring things out. \n\nIt's pretty likely you can get a postdoc (probably 50-60% chance). However, going from postdoc to faculty is a pretty low chance (probably 1-2% chance). The good news is, PhDs in physics are extremely valuable in the workforce overall. There are usually some good industry spinoffs that hire our postdocs with open arms. In the 80's and 90's it was computer chip companies and manufacturers. At the moment it's data science, so if you have a chance to take some kind of coursework related to that, or using it with research analysis methods, it will be a good launch point.",

There are some obligations and stressful periods, but you can steer your research wherever you want. I am a data nerd (originally a plant ecologist), and I get to play with things I find interesting. It still requires getting money from grants and other sources, but if I have a good hypothesis, I will probably find money to go for it.\n\nAlso, I can decide to skip work one day because weather is good (or my dog is sick, which has happened often) and just make it up any other moment.

Obviously some conference locations will be cooler than others, but traveling all over the world for free is a pretty big positive. Hopefully academia returns to traveling for in-person conferences after COVID, I think largely it will (though perhaps with more virtual options). \n\nAlso, just generally academia is more international that many other fields. I will be going to a US medical school, so I will likely only ever be able to practice in the US. With a PhD, there is no reason you couldn't meet a professor doing awesome work in, say, Norway or France or Argentina and end up doing your postdoc with them in a new country.

I get to read and have discussions and debate, I'm armed with new types of knowledge, contacts, connections, training opportunities etc. \n\nI've not tutored/lectured for a while but I personally enjoy it, and don't mind not doing it full-time as it gives me time to work on practice, my main subject (arts/humanities) is something that needs to be practiced I think to stay relevant, and so far any interactions with academics in this area they've appreciated that. \n\nI've stayed fairly positive as even though it's hard, there are good examples in my field and at my institute of what I want to be doing/where I want to be when I finish so it doesn't seem unachievable. I try to be realistic as I do have some fear just based on other's experiences but generally so far my PI is great, it's tough but I'm doing okay. Much much better than when I was just doing corporate work.",

So that 2 hours I skived out of a boring session was not a total loss but I wouldnt\u2019 go there on purpose.  But I really rarely get to exploit any of the travel becasue I am already off site for days, and I have a thesis committee meeting or a senate thing or grad students that need training or a class - so I often come from the airport right back to campus before even going home first.\n\nA real reason that this sub and other academic subs have a lot of negative things that people are missing is that people who are more experienced and know what it is like to make the sausages are trying to tell people , hey , eat what you want, but you know what it is IN. A sausage , right?\n\nAnd for every person who winds up loving their life and having the job of their dreams (and great for all 3 of you), they are seriously whitewashing the many quite serious decisions and Hobson\u2019s choices you may have to make. Inducing Dr Happy, who\u2019s spouse is changing their carried for their fantastic job.\n\nLike, Ok, if you can find the perfect fit, there is a job open, your chair is an angel and your admins supportive, you can afford to live in that city, your spouse is willing and happy to change jobs / careers  and can also find a job that makes them happy - but it is still worth noting that \n\nYou probably had to move far away from your family and friends.  You probably had to chose between a city or town you like and the better job.  You have many years of long hours at low income and also many moves in order to get another job with comparatively low income. That there is indeed much job insecurity and neither tenure nor promotion are a given.  \n\nNeither clock stops when you have kids or when your mom has a stroke.  \n\nYou should also compare apples to apples.  Any jobs I did before I was fully credentialed were either entry level or mostly unskilled or low seniority.  Where you alway have less autonomy more accountability and less freedom.\n\nYou have to compare your academic to the equivalent level at a non academic position.
