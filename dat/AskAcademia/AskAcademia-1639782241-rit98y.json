  "title:": "How to condense long CV to 2-page CV?",
  "text": "I'm in the humanities (history) applying for doctoral programs and one of the grad schools I'm applying to wants me to submit a 2 page CV. My long CV isn't super long (it's 4 pages). And yes I know the difference between CVs and resumes. What should I cut in my long/regular CV? My layout is basically: education (including my MA thesis), research interests, undergrad publications (not peer reviewed), list of teaching assistant (TA) experience, fellowship and awards, conference participation, invited talks and lectures, digital projects, research experience (tangentially related to my MA thesis), academic and department service, volunteer positions, and languages. tl;dr: What should I cut in my long/regular CV?",
