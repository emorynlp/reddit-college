  "title:": "What is the best way for grad students to get their concerns heard?",
  "text": "The graduate students of my program have become fed up with numerous insufficiencies in our program. We had a meeting tonight to bring our concerns together ahead of a graduate committee meeting next month. \n\nThe concerns are our funding and hostility to those who must take outside work due to the lack of availability of TA and GA positions (only 3-4 in a year), even off-semester community college gigs are strongly discouraged. Our program at founding was highly competitive with stipends compared to the local cost of living but is now impossible. We would even qualify for food stamps except for the funding structure, for the ten months of the academic year we exceed the minimum but when that is spread over the full year, we would qualify. Numerous students have been rejected because of that gray area. \n\nThere is also a horrific lack of communication, something that is new to the current grad student administrator so those of us who are late stage remember when we weren\u2019t stuck in the dark about basic information like if we were not meeting expectations in one way or another. Others didn\u2019t even know what classes they had to take and register for. Several people in the program were suddenly placed on probation without any prior communication as to where we were not meeting expectations, and often it was due to major outside factors like family deaths without any support with possible adjustments. \n\nWe have also not been presented anything to compensate the ABD crowd for covid disruptions. It\u2019s history, and the archives we rely on were entirely shuttered for months or a year, I personally had to entirely restructure my thesis to account for that even this past summer. I\u2019m now a fifth year and am functionally where a fourth year would be, and most of the other ABD students are in the same boat. \n\nWe don\u2019t think anything we ask is excessive. Cost of living adjustments so we can live considering they except us to be full time scholars, more opportunities for work within our department especially considering the teaching requirement for our program, communication so we are fully aware of how we are progressing, and something to back up those of us in our dissertation phase who got screwed by covid. Several other departments in our university do COL adjustments and have granted an extra year to impacted dissertation students. \n\nOur immediate plan is to submit letters from each cohort detailing our complaints to our graduate board ahead of next month\u2019s meeting, and to have representatives address the meeting. We all love our field and want this program to work, we want to be scholars. But we just are not getting the input we need to do so. Is there anything we should change or do in order to make sure we are not just heard but that our concerns are addressed?",

      "text": "A few ideas:\n\n\\- Present data (including what other depts in your uni\u2014and similar depts in your field at other unis\u2014have done, esp in the direction of your requests).\n\n\\- Offer thoughtful solutions alongside your complaints, including the costs and benefits of these solutions (esp for the institution), as well as any ideas you may have for funding sources, etc. \n\n\\- Consider your framing and the difference between:   \na) presenting a list of complaints (just an example, not saying this is what you are actually planning to do), and   \nb) presenting a context and list of recommendations, including evidence for why those recommendations are good ones, as well as how those recommendations will strengthen the national reputation of the program, is on par with other peer unis, etc.\n\n\\- Find people in positions of power at your uni who will listen in a supportive manner, and who will advocate or support in other ways. Such people might include those in admin positions, senior respected profs, those in your university graduate school, your ombuds, etc. These are people who might be able to help give you insights about funding sources or other strategies.\n\n\\- Find mentors in your field who might be able to provide support and also who you can trust to be confidential, especially if you have difficulty with the previous point.\n\n\\- Connect with grad students at other unis if you know of any who've accomplished what you're trying to accomplish, ask about experiences, what worked/didn't work.\n\n\\- Maybe a last ditch effort that should only be considered after other efforts have been taken and with significant thought and reflection (including about all potential consequences): go to the press, whether your college newspaper, higher ed news, or, eventually, other news outlets.",
