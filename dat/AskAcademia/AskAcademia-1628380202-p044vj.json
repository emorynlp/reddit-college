  "text": "Hi. I\u2019m an MD doing PhD on causes of cancer (etiology). I was wondering if anyone out there ever wrote (or intend to write) a thesis with the expressed plan to turn it into anything akin to a popular science book?\n\nI ofc know this isn\u2019t standard by any means. The reason I\u2019ve begun thinking about the possibility is two-fold:\nFirstly, a close family member turned her PhD results into a book. It sold 10.000 copies and hard a major impact on the profession she studied. Ironically, her PhD opponent committee judged her work very harshly for mostly bureaucratic reasons - so not many scientists gave it much notice.\nSecondly, the way thesis-writing works in my country, you have to include a min. of 3 papers, and they really are the sole determining factor for graduation - and rightly so as they show you can communicate your research to other experts. \n\nThe thesis, however, kinda just does this once more. But what about communicating to people outside the field? Patients? Science enthusiasts? The thesis is almost like a legacy culture and seriously no one reads them, at least in my country/profession; they just read the papers. I thought it would be so much more interesting for me and potentially helpful for others to write the thesis, not for the two top experts that review it, but for a much broader audience - basically to the extend that I can \u201cget away with\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not counting on selling 10000 copies of even 10; just thinking I really would find it to be a much more interesting writing project.\n\nThoughts? Have I lost touch with reality here?\n\n(PS I realized some people have topics/do experiments that are truly too esoteric to even entertain anything along them what I\u2019m going on about above.)",

      "text": "Lots of folks in the social sciences and humanities turn their thesis into a book, it\u2019s easier with a monograph thesis than a sandwich thesis. Best way to get a sense of what\u2019s involved is to go to a major conference in your field and chat with some of the university and academic press people with exhibitor tables - part of why they\u2019re there is to look for potential new books.",

      "text": "Personally, I think the objectives are entirely different. Your PhD thesis is to show mastery of the subject area.  That you understand the background, the methodology and interpretation of you experimental results and implications for the field.  I would expect it to be fully referenced, detailed and extremely precise.  \n\nA book for a lay audience would be far less technical, and more descriptive  with more of a narrative approach, as well as a wider scope.  \n\nBluntly, in STEM, I would fail a thesis that was aimed at a lay audience.",
