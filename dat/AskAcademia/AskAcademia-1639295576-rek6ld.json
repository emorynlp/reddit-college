  "text": "I just joined Reddit. And this is what's on my mind for last few day - I've done graduation in Psychology, then MBA but now I don't wanna be working in corporate and thinking to do a PhD in Psychology, Organizational Psychology. But the issue with Psychology is that it is based on only subjective knowledge, therefore I would like to study Medicine in which atleast the knowledge is objective and there's space to provide value and gain new knowledge. What do you recommend?",

          "text": "If you are thinking of studying medicine, really, really consider why you want to do it. And the answer has to be really good. Medicine is really difficult and time consuming and will chew up most of your hobbies and friendships. Speaking with my friends and colleagues, this is something we all experienced. \nAnd there will be times you want to quit (both during study and work). So, you absolutely have to have a really good reason. \n\nHaving said that, if you decide to go ahead with studying medicine, it is incredibly rewarding at times and you learn amazing things about people, and get to be a part of the most private and difficult experiences of people\u2019s lives, and helping in these situations is just wonderful. \nJust be aware, knowledge in medicine is NOT objective in any way shape or form, and the idea of contributing to knowledge is complex, and really won\u2019t be on the horizon within the first 10-20 years of your career. Large scale studies are incredibly difficult to perform and suffer from a multitude of sources of error. \n\nNb: I got my MD after working as an engineer for several years. Have been practicing 7 years. And if I had to go back and make the choice again, would absolutely choose to do medicine.",

      "text": "Welcome to Reddit! I don\u2019t know anything about how your degrees would translate into studying medicine, but I wanted to suggest a reframe for the way you\u2019re thinking about social sciences. First, in regards space to provide value and gain new knowledge, I would say that my colleagues in psychology are conducting very exciting and innovative research. Their contributions are meaningful in helping us understand a range of phenomena, from human emotion to behavior, and so on. Their research helps us better understand ourselves and the people around us. So needed, in my opinion!\n\nSecondly, in my discipline of counseling, subjective knowledge and our lived experiences are an extremely important data point - perhaps the only data point that matters in some theoretical traditions! I can\u2019t speak to the extent to which that\u2019s true in psychology. However, in a related discipline, we find value in subjective knowledge. \n\nUltimately, what matters is what your values are because you need to believe in the work you\u2019re doing. I just wanted to point out that the drawbacks you identified in organizational psychology aren\u2019t inherent flaws in the discipline. Perhaps if you thought about them differently, you\u2019d find great purpose in the field.",

          "text": "Actually, I had studied physics, chemistry and biology at school but due to my country's harsh entrance requirements for Med School, I dropped it. \n\nRegarding your opinions on social science and subjective knowledge, I agree that they do provide important data but they lack greatly in understanding the root cause of any thing literally from emotions to behaviour. As far as I have studied psychology and few other social science subjects, they are surely important and informative but they miss the point of understanding the real reasons behind the things, as like I said, the knowledge is subjective due to which, there's great variability present in this domain.\n\nI have two options, either to do PhD in Psychology and devote my life on running after what's on the surface or studying from the beginning Medicine, Human Anatomy and Physiology and understanding the underlying causes of every thing.\n\nI hope you see my dilemma now, because as easy as first sounds, it doesn't give me enough meaning and purpose (though it might be my understanding is wrong) and as absurd the later seems, it does give me values like you said in your comment.",

My masters totally transformed my understanding of science and the relationship between science and society. It has made me a much better scientist and helps me support the delivery of science that actually changes the world rather than the kind of head up my ass science that deludes itself that it's too pure to be biased and tainted by the real world but at the same time will reveal some astounding truth that changes everything.",
