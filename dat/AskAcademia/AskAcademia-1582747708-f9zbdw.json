  "title:": "How do you structure your day in order to stay focused doing research full-time?",
  "text": "I'm a M.Sc. student in Electrical Engineering and I currently started writing my master's thesis. This is the only activity that I have and I am expected to work on it full-time. I usually start by 9am and until lunch (1pm) I am pretty productive and can maintain a high level of concentration. The thing is, when I return from lunch (2pm), I can work a little bit more until around 3:30-4pm, but the quality of the work decreases significantly. After 4pm, I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, but I usually try to continue until 6pm.\n\nI wanted to know how people that do research full-time structure their day to be able to work decently for the whole day. Do they get used to being focused for longer periods or they just accept that they can only do so much and then do other things?\n\nI go to the gym everyday before starting the thesis at 9am and I eat well. Sometimes I feel lethargic after lunch, but I'm working on that and it's getting better. I sleep properly and after I leave the lab at 6pm, I try to relax and not think about \"work\". It might be an issue that I don't have shallower activities scattered throughout the day, like meetings or a lot of e-mailing, because I feel that these would help me diverge my attention a bit to later on get back focusing on my project.",

Planning and attending meetings?  That's work.  Trying to buy equipment through a glitchy eShop system.  That's work.  All of these little, tangential tasks may not be \"research\" but they're part of the job and should count toward your \"full-time\" work hours.  Also, don't be afraid to skip out an hour early if you feel you've done all you needed to do for the day.  It'll all come out in the wash when you need to work additional hours before a deadline...",

      "text": "When I was in grad school and in my first year as a VAP, I liked to deliberately split up my day. Frequently something like 8:30 - 10:00 doing some work at home (writing or course planning usually), take a break to walk to campus, then 10:30/11 - 3:30 or so doing work on campus and having \"administrative lunch\" (emails and lunch, I get bored just eating so I have to do something). Depending on the day I'd either do my exercise thing then and afterwards do some a few more hours of work, or vice versa.  I really liked breaking up the day like that, since it gave my brain a break and got the blood going again. \n\nAnother thing to consider is if you have any work that doesn't need as much brain power, and save that for times when you know you need to get some stuff off your to-do list but don't have a ton of brain resources.  I'm in a field that has a lot of data that needs hand-marking, but does not have enough money for research assistants, so I often have a backlog of data to get through.  It's relatively time-consuming but pretty light on the brain, so even if I am tired from reading or writing or teaching or whatever I can just put on Netflix or a podcast and just churn through it.  Or even if I'm just having a Day where I can't really focus on anything, I can just be like welp here's this easy task that I know needs to be done, let's just do that today and let the brain bum out on TV.",

It could be  hours worked, words written, papers read, or some other measure that works for your discipline and/or task you're working on. Make it reasonable - you're not setting out to punish yourself - and make it a level you can attain over the long term.

Running experiments requires a different part of my brain than the other two do, so I can work longer by doing both every day. The biggest thing is to not force work when work isn't happening. Deadlines happen and sometimes you need to suck it up, but long term you'll get more done if you just stop when your body tells you to stop.",

I worked at the institute, not home, to be able to get up and do a quick lab thing when tired, and to feel surveilled by people who would call me out for watching netflix.\nConcentration span can be increased by training. I had times during uni exam periods where I could easily study 8 h straight. Now it's harder, but I can still go a few hours. That's only natural. I think most people have an attention span of 45 min, or so I heard somewhere. \nI also found that I do my best work in the morning, mentally but also physically. So maybe consider doing gym at the end of the day? Thesis has higher priority.\n\nTbh, I think what helped me most was meditation and yoga.
