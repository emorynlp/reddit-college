  "text": "Somehow, I have managed to get an interview for my dream postdoc. It's in a location I have always dreamed of living in. It's at a renowned research institution under the supervision of an incredible and famous researcher. It's a position I don't feel that I am qualified for but yet somehow here I am. \n\nThere are two positions open. And 6 people being interviewed. It is all too surreal. We went from me applying almost as a joke since I am nowhere near the caliber of the research that goes on there to finding out I got an interview to finding out that there's a decent chance of being successful.\n\nBut now, I am even more stressed. I feel I am going to botch the interview and I will feel even worse because it was such a small hiring pool. I want to do well and have been practicing answering interview questions and reading up on the project topic for the last week. But I still feel like it won't be enough. \n\nHow do I ace the interview and go on to live my dream position?",

      "text": "Sounds like you've been answering interview questions and reading up on the topic already, which is great! If you're going to give a presentation to the PI (or to the PI's group), I would schedule a practice talk with your current lab, advisor, or close friends. \n\nThe fact that you are on the shortlist is a GREAT thing. It shows that you have what they're looking for on paper. Now, you just have to see if there's a connection when you're actually chatting about the project and your previous research experience with the PI. I stress easily, so I can relate to how you're feeling, and I've also had intense feelings of imposter syndrome (still do) and feeling like I'm nowhere near qualified for opportunities that I've been given. But you've already done enough work to get (or to get close to getting) a PhD, so now is your chance to highlight your accomplishments! Try to focus on what you CAN bring to the table and also try to think of the interview as a two-way street. The researcher might be incredible and famous, but the interview is your opportunity to also make sure that they'll be a good mentor/PI for you as a postdoc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! :)",

Practice your talk, and keep in mind that now that you\u2019re almost done your PhD you are one of a handful of experts in that very specific thing. I just wanted to comment because I was in the same position, applied for a reach/a dream postdoc, actually got an interview and ended up getting hired!! It can happen!! Keep your head up and believe in your own science and your own abilities and you\u2019ll be great",

Sounds like you\u2019re suffering imposter\u2019s syndrome. Easier said than done, but as soon as you shake that feeling and start realizing your value, the less tense and more free you\u2019ll feel to talk about your passion for the science. Just remember, even if you don\u2019t get this exact position there are so many potential positions that can offer just as auspicious of an opportunity. If you\u2019ve already got this far and got this level of interest, then that means you\u2019ll inevitably land a nice position somewhere. Once you free yourself of the notion that this is do or die, it will liberate you to be more yourself during the interview. You\u2019ll begin to focus on what you think/feel rather than saying what you think they want to hear (which is a terrible trap to fall into).",

They want a person with prospects and are willing to continue your education by mentoring you. Also, the other five candidates are just as nervous as you are! And it is quite possible that none of you have that dream-level of skills that you feel you lack. You are probably all in the same boat, so do do fear them. Also, as you call this your ideal postdoc, they will pick up on that enthusiasm. Some of your competitors may have their dream spot at some other place, and the  committee will percieve that too. You may very well be well positioned.\n\nBest wishes from a retired but OK boomer, whippersnapper.\ud83c\udf7b",

Where will I live? What will I eat? I think too often candidates practice expressing the highlights of the work they have already done in the past, but the interviewer needs to know what the candidate will do in the future, in the interviewer's future. Not only that, but what the candidate will do must be what the interviewer needs. So, they must have a shared vision of the future. They both have to imagine they will work well together and be productive before the interviewer can offer the job to that candidate.\n\nAlso, the candidate must listen attentively. Sometimes an interviewer will explain the project and/or specific needs he requires of the postdoc only during the interview. This information is not written in the advertisement so the candidate has no way to prepare for it. Keep your wits about you.",

      "text": "Quick tips:\n\n1. Read up on the post-doc proposal; they tend to be highly technical, and that's only one of the parts you should extract info for. The other is: the nature of the project and the funding (private, national, international, etc); if there's a company involved, rea dup on the company; if it's an international project then follow-up on that, and so on. \n2.Prepare a couple of \"success stories\" from previous experiences related with the post-doc; this means describing them brieffly and finish by explaining how it translates to the position you're applying to. be ready to answer a few follow-up questions. \n3. Read up on the work on the lab; look for techniques, equipment, research topics that you are familiar with and bring them up during the interview (e.g. \"I read that you have equipment XX that you have used for YYY, and it so happens that I've also used one...\")\n4. Although you wil be hired for a specific project, the responsabilities of a post doc may vary widely. If you don't know yet, askk if it requires supervision work, writing proposals for funding, teaching, manage a lab/equipment and so on. Be reasy to support your competences by mentioning previous experiences, and how they may be relevant.  \n\nYou got this.",

Be sure to read about the lab, the institution and the area so that you have maybe a half dozen questions that can be answered in a minute or so. Scatter those questions around in the various meetings that you have. It will make it clear that you care enough about the position to have done background research on the place. One thing that really eliminated people from our pool at interviews were those that made statements about what they would/could do that were inconsistent with our educational mission.\n\nCongratulations and good luck!",

Look up behavioral interview questions and prepare STAR (situation task action result) answers for them, aiming to provide examples  of your past experience (research and otherwise) that shows you're a good fit for a \"manager of operations\" type role in research - I'm betting they have a substantial team so this may not be wholly your responsibility alone, but the role really is like a sous-chef of the research world.  Even if the prof doesn't hold the interview in that format, it does help to prepare a variety of quick and comfortable responses that shows the prof all you're bringing to the table.\n\nI'd be preparing answers along the lines of \"What do you do when you get stuck in your work?\" \"Tell me about a time you had to deal with someone difficult\" \"How do you deal with a lot of work and deadlines coming up at once\" and other situations in a research lab where shit can head south quick...",
