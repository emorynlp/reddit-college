  "text": "This might sound like a stupid question, but I'm studying in the Netherlands and here we have bachelor, master and after a master's programme you can get a PhD position. I often see questions regarding gradschool, is that master and PhD combined? Or only PhD (but why do I never see questions about master's then?). And is undergraduate school only bachelor?",

The first mainstream (from a major publisher) fantasy novel with an explicitly gay (male) main character is generally considered to have come out in 1989.\n\nBy the way, I'm not downvoting, but I think some people are interpreting your tone as mocking, hence the downvotes you're getting.",

For me, it's 3 years plus a 1 year extension to write up (no research activities allowed). I must submit my thesis within 4 years at a maximum. Failing that, I'm expelled and my PI would probably get a fair bit of flack for it because they're held responsible for getting their student to the finish line. Sometimes it means that our thesis are less groundbreaking or that one extra paper doesn't get included in it, but that's really not a requirement for the PhD. Some will even have to present negative results. As long as it's original and substantive, it's okay. There's no time to do another project.\n\nI don't think PIs in the US are judged so harshly (or even at all) when a student fails to graduate in 4 years - the common stated program length.",

              "text": "In the US, PhD programs typically include the coursework of a masters.  So you will take around 2 years of coursework and then theoretically 2 years to do your dissertation work, but rarely is it this fast.  You often have to complete a master's level thesis which could delay officially being your doctoral work by a year.  An then dissertation projects can easily take 3+ years.  This is how you get to 7 years in a program.  \n\nPhD stipends are usually paid one of two ways.  If you have an external fellowship or your PI has sufficient grant money, then you can be paid to be a graduate research assistant and focus on your PhD research.  However, if not, then you are paid to be a graduate teaching assistant.  During the beginning of the program you will assist a professor in grading and giving tutorial sessions or teaching laboratory sections.  Once you have completed the master's or equivalent, you will often be assigned to teach one class a semester (though this depends on the university).  On the plus side, this gives you teaching experience which helps for finding a professor job (especially if you end up applying to non-research universities), on the negative side, this distracts from your research.  \n\nAnother issue people run into is when they come into a PhD program already with a master's.  Some PhD programs are only designed for people coming into directly from undergrad (2 years coursework + 3 years research).  They don't usually transfer in classes from your MS program, or if they do, it is only a few.  So you basically end up repeating your master's.  There are a few reasons for this.  Accreditation says you can only transfer (I think) 25% of credit hours for a graduate degree.  There is often an \"arrogance\" that says courses during a doctoral program are of higher quality than courses from a MS program.  Also, you are typically still working in a lab while taking courses so a professor is going to get 5-6 years of low cost labor in the lab (plus by your last couple of years, you are typically functioning at the level of a semi-independent post-doc).  If they gave you credit for your MS program, they would lose out on 2 years of that.  \n\nGranted, all of this is mainly from the perspective of the sciences (natural and social).  It is my understanding that areas like education and business and even humanities can be quite different.  Professional programs (medicine, law, etc.) also are completely different.  Plus, individual universities can do things differently as well.  There are general standards, but it is up to each university to define how they apply those standards.",

If you graduate from a PhD program which is viewed as being more rigorous (a.k.a. on-average longer), it may be easier to get an academic role afterwards, while a shorter PhD may require a postdoc after to score the same job.",

I went to a combined program and my master's was essentially a marker of success but wasn't the aim of the program. It was all about the doctorate.\n\nIn my experience advising undergraduates in psychology, the ones with a strong undergraduate record are more likely to go to a combined program. Students who are interested in a career after a master's (e.g. earn a masters in I/O psychology and then go into HR), or who have other important needs (e.g. not moving because of family, etc.) or who want to earn a PhD but don't have an undergraduate record that will support an application to a combined program will go to master's programs. If a student who wants to earn a doctorate does well in such a master's program they can apply successfully to a doctoral program. One downside of that pathway is that not all PhD programs will accept all the master's classes taken and so a student might have to essentially repeat some classes taken in a master's program.",

Some Ph.D. programs have a master's degree as a prerequisite, but some of them basically include the master's degree at the start of the Ph.D.\n\nIn my case (computer science in the U.S.) I enrolled directly in a Ph.D. program after my undergraduate (bachelor's of science) degree. After 2 years in this program, I had completed the master's degree requirements (since it's a subset of the Ph.D. requirements) so I got a Master's degree at that time, but it didn't require any extra effort. After 7 more years I completed the Ph.D.\n\nAlso, I should point out I had a few friends who either dropped out of the Ph.D. or didn't  pass their Ph.D. qualifying exams in year 2. In these cases, they quit the program after receiving a master's degree... not a bad \"prize\" at all; it's a nice fallback option if the Ph.D. doesn't work out; the master's is still valuable.",
