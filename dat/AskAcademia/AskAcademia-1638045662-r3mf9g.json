  "title:": "Is it too late to ask profs for references due in January and later?",
  "text": "Getting mixed messages from what I'm seeing online. Couple writers I follow on social media who are also English instructors are talking about how to not feel guilty asking for references as it's reference writing season, but I also see a lot of discussion online from people saying, \"ask for references in spring and reconfirm/remind in early fall.\" \n\nFor references due in January and later, would it be rude/too late to ask now for references?\n\nIf it helps to know my student standing, I finished with honors in all my programs and had good relationships with my profs, but my contact with them has been more infrequent since graduating. \n\nFeel free also to say, \"Please don't do graduate study at this terrible moment in world history and in the history of the academy\" if you're really not feeling good about your experience or what the prospects are right now. I've been out of the higher ed loop for about two years now, and haven't gotten to hear from folks whether they feel the stress of graduate programs is worth it anymore, especially since the pandemic.",

Of course I don't get to see the letters, but I got more interviews than not so they couldn't have been too bad. It will always depend on the person you're asking and how well you know each other, but most people are happy to help if they can. If you didn't work with them closely, just make sure to remind them of who you are and send along a CV or similar to help them out and smooth along the process as soon as they confirm.",

      "text": "English Phd here and agree with the general timelines already stated. I think I asked a month before they were due apologizing for the \u201cshort notice\u201d and had professors straight up say they weren\u2019t gonna touch it until break anyway lol. Which completely tracks with humanities professors. \n\nThat said, no one has taken you up on your final paragraph offer, so I thought I\u2019d just mention that academia is struggling. Searches for how to quit graduate programs are supposedly up like 3000% and my advisor has had to talk me down from that twice this semester. The stress is bad enough in normal circumstances\u2014this constant state of uncertainty and anxiety makes it 100x times worse. Basically social distancing has eliminated the things that normally help you cope with the workload and sense of isolation in a graduate program. Not to mention the fact that many universities have used the pandemic as an excuse to continue cutting back tt hires. \n\nThat isn\u2019t to say don\u2019t apply. There can still be reasons to do graduate study, but it would feel unethical to not suggest that you sit down and seriously, seriously think about whether you want to sign up for it or not. I\u2019m also happy to speak to you more about this if you want. Above all, good luck!",
