Admins make a difference to everyone, every day. You know it when you have a bad administrator as life is shit, and when you have a good administrator your work world is generally a better place. Their job is important, difficult and requires significant skill. What difference does your daily contribution make to those around you? Is your organisation a better place for you turning up every day? Possibly not, if you treat support staff with the contempt you show here.\n\n Academia is an amazing thing that makes countries better, wealthier and healthier and I will and do fight every day for its continued support and funding. But admin are important and worthy of respect. You work in a world full of very clever people, you will never be the most clever person in the room, but you can be the kindest.",

Chances are, no matter where you are in your career, you have a pile of articles or a book somewhere that you put aside saying \u201coh I\u2019ll get to that\u201d. Ideally we should all schedule regular reading time but more often than not that leads to reading narrowly for particular projects. If you don\u2019t have any project reading to do, go read some articles that aren\u2019t entirely related to what you do but will help you understand your field more broadly. To me it feels like a mental break because you aren\u2019t reading for a \u201cpurpose\u201d other than just pure intellectual curiosity.",

I know it sounds completely counterintuitive but try just taking a weekday afternoon or something all the way \"off\" without even checking email and see if your relationship to work & productivity shifts, even just a little! I also really find it helpful to fully take advantage of taking time off during the work week when i have a really flexible schedule, as sometimes we do within academia! During the most relaxed parts of the semester I try to take a full two days off per week--sometimes this does indeed happens on weekends but sometimes its so nice to run errands or go on a hike on a random thursday while the rest of the world is at work. I think it can be really tempting to work ourselves into the ground even when there's really not that much going on, but if you're still a grad student (at least in my field) this is very likely the least busy you'll be for a good long while so try to take full advantage!",

It's hard not to feel guilty about slacking off for a day or two, but don't let that be a barrier to working now. Also, everyone needs a break now and then, you're only human. I find that the more grace and kindness I can find for myself the more productive and happy I am in my work.",

While it's not exactly similar, when I'm working in the kitchen I try to budget time for *P*rojects and less needy projects--the toggling between actively to more passively using my brain makes for more of a marathon day pace. \n\nThere's also that old, very annoying restaurant saying, if you can lean you can clean, so while I have moments between baking shifts and AH classes I try to invest time into making my home nice, playing with my cat, and prepping simple things like oatmeal that my future self will be thankful for. There are many different kinds of productive, as other posters have said.",

Literally if I have an unproductive day, at night I send myself an e-mail saying that I HAVE to accomplish <insert a few things> or I can't go to sleep tomorrow. I wake up, prioritize those things, turn off the phone and work until it's done, which is usually by lunch time.",
