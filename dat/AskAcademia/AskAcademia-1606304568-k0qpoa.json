  "text": "I am currently writing my engineering Ph.D. thesis. One of the challenges I am facing is, I ran out of sentence starters. \n\nI have used 'In addition', 'Additionally', 'Moreover', 'Furthermore', 'Therefore', 'as is evident above' and 'However' a lot. I mean, really a lot to the point where everything looks cliche and uninteresting or even annoying.\n\nSo, can you please suggest to me some interesting/unique sentence starters alternative to these words?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

It will go from a meandering walk through an overgrown path to a straight shot down a clear highway. Trust me. They are really only useful in a few situations. Most of the time they are rhetorical fluff or signs of a poorly structured argument, making the sentences longer while adding nothing.\n\nA much better solution is to structure your writing more.  If you have three points, say so, and then use words like \u201cFirst, ...\u201d \u201cSecond...\u201d etc. That gives your readers waypoints so they know where they are in your argument and makes your writing much clearer and easier to follow.",

My whole point was that meaningful structure is preferable. Meaningful structure provides a road map that lets the reader know where the argument is headed. That makes a paper, especially a complex one, easy to read and understand. When overused, words like moreover, in addition, additionally, furthermore, etc., are more like detour signs scattered throughout the paper, making it harder to read and understand because you never know quite where you are in the argument.",

(However) This can be difficult to do in the beginning and you will learn to  seldom use them.\n\n(Additionally) Most of the time we use such words are phrases because when we are writing, we are much slower than we are while reading or talking, so it feels like there is nothing connecting the first and the second sentences, while they are actually connected by the common topic they talk about and their information continuity.\n\n(Moreover) Such words, used repeatedly can get very annoying to the reader. \n\n(As is evident above) Skipping such words can help you actually make your life easy and the reader's too.\n\nEdit: I know they are weak sentences; I was just typing examples and didn't really have much to say.

[However], I edit a lot of academic papers written in English by German academics and they love to overuse this type of stocking filler.\n\nMore often than not, I find it is perfectly fine to just launch straight into your next sentence or statement while making sure that, in its entirety, it follows on from the one that preceded it. \n\nIt gives an air of confidence in your argument without having to depend on fillers such as \"however\", and, \"moreover\".\n\nAnd as has been said already, learn to write by reading.\n\nGood luck!",
