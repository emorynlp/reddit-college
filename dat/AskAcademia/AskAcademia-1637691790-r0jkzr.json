  "text": "I'm preparing an invited article for a small international publication that provides only these guidelines for citation:\n\n>List the references with the respective numbers in square brackets and in the order in which they appear in the text, at the end of the manuscript. References must information as shown in the following example:  \n>  \n>\\[1\\] Author 1, Author 2, et al., article title, publication title, volume, publication year, pages and DOI\n\nI'm left unclear about a lot of details. Do I list the author's entire first name, or just the initial(s)? Do I list last names first like in most styles, or first names first? Does the citation number in the main text go in brackets or superscript?\n\nI will probably ask the journal editor but first I wanted to make sure I'm not missing something that's very obvious to the international scholar community (I'm American and used to APA style, and I'm a bit of a disaster at implementing other styles.",
