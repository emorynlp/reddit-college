  "title:": "Birthday gift idea for communication professor starting her first full-time job this fall",
  "text": "Hello everyone. After years of adjuncting and working toward finishing her PhD, my wife managed to snag her first full-time teaching gig, starting this coming fall semester. We couldn't be more thrilled. We packed up the family and moved into a new house in a new state, and now that the dust is finally settling I'm remembering I need to get her a birthday gift.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'd like to get her something for her office or in some way related to her new job, as this is such a huge deal for our family and I'm so proud of her. So is there anything you'd recommend for a new communication professor starting her first full-time job?\n\nThank you!",

Answers: Hard to kill plant in fancy pot, A bunch of watercolor maps of places I've lived, a nice colorful mug for holding pens and pencils, statistical distribution plushies (if shes quant), a diploma in a  fancy frame (I get my advisees a frame when they graduate), a fancy whiteboard/pushpin setup. I also really love (and use every day) a very fancy laptop-sized black briefcase/bag that I picked out and my family purchased for me. \n\nBut you should also get her the massage come December :)",
