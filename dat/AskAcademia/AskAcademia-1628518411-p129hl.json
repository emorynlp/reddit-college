  "title:": "Interviewing for jobs with no graduation date in sight: am I setting myself up for disappointment (STEM PhD Student)",
  "text": "I'm entering my 4th year of a genetics PhD program and have randomly been throwing my name into job applications for consulting positions that sound interesting to me and I've just been asked to interview for at a small firm for a full time job starting next summer. It's the first interview I've landed, but I'm not sure if I'm just setting myself up to be disappointed by applying this early. I haven't talked to my advisor directly about when I should expect to graduate, but typically he wants 3 publications (I do computational sciences so slightly more realistic). I have 1 in submission, 1 in prep and the 3rd not really in sight (maybe 6-8 months out). My advisor and committee are well aware that I am not interested in pursuing an academic career, and I spend a lot of time on extracurricular activities geared towards my professional development and entering the consulting job market after I finish up.\n\nI just don't know 1) if and when I should tell my advisor this is happening 2) how thesis committees generally react to students getting job offers before they have permission to write/ a defense date planned. There's no way for me to know  if this single interview will really go anywhere, but I'm also preparing if I keep submitting applications. It seems like I might have a decent enough resume at this point to be gaining some attention from recruiters. I really just don't want to upset my advisor/committee, especially if they think I'm trying to leave too early (program avg time to degree 5.5-6 yrs, only req 1 manuscript in submission). \n\nI'd appreciate any and all advice :/",

I'm so ready to be out of here.)",

Congrats! \n\nPart of me wants to say don\u2019t jump the gun, leave yourself a little bit of room to see if things turn around. I would then suggest that you are having a classic 4th year slump and it will get better. But you sound like your work is going well. If you know you want to leave and your boss is ok with that, then you are probably safe to share. But maybe wait until (a) you think this is a sure thing and you are not the company\u2019s 2nd choice or (b) your boss is impacted by the process? (Like you need to take time off or they are a professional reference.)",

      "text": "A student in my lab is planning to defend her PhD thesis in December. She started applying for jobs in January and signed a contract last week for a job starting early October. Since she'll be trying to finish her PhD when she starts the job, she was able to negotiate starting 60% time so she can work 2 days per week on preparing for her defence.\n\nAnother PhD student in our lab was supposed to defend in April 2021, but ended up getting a job contract starting in December 2020. He switched to part time for his PhD and has recently finished a full draft of his thesis. He will likely defend sometime this fall after putting revisions on his thesis.\n\nI hope this helps give an idea of timeline for when to start applying for things and what starting a job might look like at the end of a PhD program.",

Talk to your advisors about your plans, but I don\u2019t see a way you would (hypothetically) be able to start this job without Mastering out. Sorry to be a bummer, but you should really just apply for these jobs once you get permission to write. Consider these interviews as important networking opportunities though!",

I think the timing could be good if this 3rd paper comes out quick and smooth, but I just don't know how some of these things are taken by academics. Most, if not all, of the professors on my committee will not understand how non-academic job search works, but I'm just unsure if this would be viewed as some awkward betrayal to them since I didn't \"ask\" for permission to apply to jobs.",

      "text": "So, I actually did pretty much exactly what you stated. I started applying late in the 3rd year of my biology PhD, received an offer to start working as a consultant at the start of my 4th year, and accepted the offer. One caveat- I had actively discussed graduating in 4 years with my advisor repeatedly and had already met the graduation requirements/ more (3 published papers/ 2 in review) prior to my start date. I finished my lab work while working 35 hours a week as a consultant that fall then switched to full time writing and consulting that spring before I defended in the summer of my 4th year. \n\nMy best advice: speak to your advisor and committee early and take their advice into consideration. Some were very much on board, some thought I should postpone but in the end I made the best decision for me which was taking the job. Additionally, if you get an offer and plan to accept the position, have a clear, thorough plan in place so you can show your advisor/committee you have thought through the reality of finishing while working part or full time. Good luck!",

      "text": "I knew computational genetics people who finished in year 4, which is usually faster than anything with model systems, and frankly our umbrella program acted like they wanted everyone out by 5.5, 6 at the absolute latest. People took longer, but most people did finished by may of their 6th year. (I finished in 5 years 11 months.) So you would be at 4.0 at the time you would need to start on a 4.5-5 year program. A bit early but not drastically so. \n\nI would say go through with the interview and see if they really want you before worrying about the rest. They might not want you or you might not want them. I interviewed for jobs I might have taken in a pinch, but if you are still in school you have room to wait for the right fit. If you decide to work with them, then see if they can negotiate the start date. For example, maybe November instead of June. \n\nEven if they cannot, I feel like many PI\u2019s will let you leave if you have a job and are mostly done. I don\u2019t think assuming you can finish in 4-4.5 years sounds like a stretch. As for time writing, a lot of that depends on how much you do while you write and how much time you have to futz around. My genetics dissertation was a lightly edited stitch up of some papers and some unpublished work. I gave myself 6 weeks to write it plus 1-2 weeks to prepare my seminar during peak lockdown (luckily no other work interfered since we could not go to lab). Then, there was about a month of formalities and paperwork and BS. (And paper revisions, which were actually the important part.) I probably could have spent more time on the writing. But I also could have done it in 4 weeks if I had not been job hunting at the same time.",
