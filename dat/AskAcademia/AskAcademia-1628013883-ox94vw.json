  "title:": "Life choices: Academia or Relationship (+ Industry job)?",
  "text": "I  (33 yo) have a PhD in physical sciences and experience in the academic  environment. After applying for various positions in academia and in  industry, I got offers in both environments, which is great.\n\nThe  academic position is for a tenure-track position with an interesting  start-up package and a wonderful salary. This would be the opportunity  to set my own research agenda, and achieve my scientific independence.\n\nThe  industry position is to work as an applied researcher, in a field far  off mine, where experience can be achieved. Although I may not  necessarily love this field, I could see myself adapting towards it and  eventually finding interesting problems to solve. The salary would be  similar to my present temporary position.\n\nIn  terms of locations: the academic position is far away from where I  presently live (+8h flight) so I would need to relocate to another Country. The applied researcher position is within a 40 min car ride  from where I live.\n\nHere comes the  problem: I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years, and she is not  interested to move to the academic job location. I understand her point  of view: her hobbies are here, her friends are here and the culture of  the new place will be different from the present culture we live at. It  would be certain for her to find a job in the academic location.\n\nI  can't easily decide between both positions, specially when taking my  girlfriend into account in this equation. I understand it is not fair  for me to ask her to move. But at the same time I know this (academic)  job opportunity probably won't appear ever again.\n\nHow  would you solve this conundrum? Any advice on how to ponder between the  different aspects, or how to take decisions in this regard? How should  one navigate the different scenarios?\n\nAny take on this is very much welcomed.",

      "text": "I can only speak for myself. A few years ago I did decide to stay in my country to pursue love. I do not regret anything, but I am bummed a little bit that I didn't go in the end. We are not together anymore & I didn't go to my first choice school. Would have been an interesting adventure. I have to live with this decision forever, which is fine... but... Dunno. After the break up I made the decision that I would listen to me first. \n\n You have to live with you forever, that is a fact. Perhaps it is a good idea to think about where your relationship is, what do you both want in the long run etc. Perhaps you can work something out. It is indeed not fair to ask her to move, but it is not fair for you to stay. The academic position sounds more attractive.  A once in a lifetime opportunity. If it was me on either ends, I would try to make it work. I would follow you. I want my partner to catch an opportunity like this and work it out if there is something there for me. If not, well, then we can always move back. You're still young. For a little bit, at least.\n\nA conundrum indeed...",

Are you a person who will enjoy life single and in an unfamiliar country as long as your career is rewarding? Or are you the type who can tolerate a less fulfilling career to stay with your girlfriend?\n\nWhen I finished my PhD, I was in a similar situation. I didn't have an amazing job offer like what you describe, but still had to choose between chasing an academic career and taking a postdoc opportunity or moving in with my partner and looking for an industry job in the area. In the end, I decided that sacrificing everything else for an academic career wasn't worth it. Staying with my partner and eventually starting a family are much more important to me personally.",

She ended up finding a better position and I moved with her and eventually figured out a job/career, but I knew she would have done the same for me.",

      "text": "As a woman, I have to say I disagree with the other comments and I think the right thing to do here is actually incredibly clear. In these kinds of posts, I always see the dilemma being described as the person choosing between their SO and their new opportunity. Why hasn't anyone asked your girlfriend to make a sacrifice for love instead, and choose between you and her current life? No offense, but I have never seen a relationship work out where someone turned down an opportunity for the love of their life. I HAVE, however, seen plenty of successful romances where someone took a scary leap of faith *because* they loved their SO, and moved with them.\n\nMy point is, if your girlfriend isn't willing to move and *you're* the one debating choices instead of her, I don't think this is the relationship for you. No one should EVER turn down an opportunity, especially one as *rare* as a *tenure-track job*, because they don't want to uproot someone else's life. Hun, you're uprooting your own life for this. I think it's *perfectly* fair to ask her to move with you, actually. Because that's what happens when you get in a relationship: sometimes life comes at you quick and you have to make sacrifices to support their career. The only exception I can think of is if she already has her similar dream job here, which you implied she does NOT because you didn't mention it and you did mention that she could easily get a job at the new location. She should weigh whether she values her comfort over sustaining her relationship with you.\n\nThis is not a matter within your hands, although you think it is. This is her dilemma, not yours. The right partner would *never* put you in a situation where you had to choose between them and the career of a lifetime, literally. Let me be very clear: you're going to choose your career, and she's going to choose whether that means you lose her or not.",

In this future, do you see yourself caring more about your social environment (family, friends, culture) or what you do at your job day to day?\n\nIs this academic job truly your dream or would you be just as happy working in the industry job, knowing that you could always find another industry job in the future somewhere else that pays better?\n\nIf this academic job is your dream, have you considered doing long distance for a year or whatever set time line you agree on with your girlfriend to see if you are happy in that situation or whether you or your girlfriend change your mind about it?\n\nThose would be the questions I ask myself if presented with this situation.

I am doing the cliche thing and doing a pros and cons list with the 'snow ball' method. Your job takes up alot of your time, so you have to do something you find enjoyable (especially after studying for so long).

Often when people change countries, they come to regret it, even if the initial impression is rosy. If you do end up pursuing the academic option, I would recommend trying to do long-distance just in case within the first year you realize it's not actually for you and move back. Heck, you can do long-distance for much longer if needed and both parties are into that. Remember that your first job is generally not your forever job. Good luck.",

If you move and break up, will you regret moving? The answer to these questions is solely based on the outcome of either job. \n\nIf you move and break up, then hate living there and don't enjoy the culture etc, then of course you will have regret. While, if you move and love it there, find a local woman and fall in love, you won't regret it. It's all hindsight and no one can predict what will happen.\n\nIt's hard.

Instead, it can be an opportunity for you to gain some experience while looking for a new TT job that might be a better personal fit on your terms without worrying about when your temporary contract will end. That's what I'm doing: I accepted a TT job in an area that I could never see myself living longterm so that I could gain experience and be a stronger candidate than others in non-TT jobs when applying for my next TT job. I understand your GF's hesitancy to move with you (I wouldn't ask anyone to move permanently to the podunk where I am now), but maybe she would be more open to coming with you if she knew it did not have to be forever? Or maybe you could even make long distance work for a while by using technology to talk every day and spending long breaks together? (I, for one, leave my small, isolated, far-from-home college town on long breaks without regret).
