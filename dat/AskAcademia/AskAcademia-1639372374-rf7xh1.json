  "title:": "I have to take a class taught by professor who rejected me for a postdoc next year - make me feel better?",
  "text": "I'm a late-stage STEM PhD student. In the spring I have a class I need to take. (It's not strictly required but the topic sets me up extremely well for where I want my research to go next.) Unfortunately, the professor is someone I wanted to do a postdoc with because his research area is basically the perfect fit for what I want to do next, for the same reason. Recently, he (very politely) rejected me after a very awkward interview. I am generally awkward, but this was on another level. I just found out he's the professor for the class, which makes sense in hindsight. I'm still feeling pretty sore about the interview - it was my first postdoc interview, too - and I just don't know how to handle this well. \n\nTo make it harder, the professor is brilliant, inspiring, and enormously intimidating. I'm scared about my ability to survive the class, but I realize the topic is still the perfect fit for what I want, so I'm balancing my resilience with my career goals and I want my career to win. I'm not worried about grades or anything, and he has a reputation for being kind and fair. \n\nI'm afraid of extreme awkwardness on my part, (and I'm afraid of that affecting him at all, since he's kind), plus I'm afraid of being hurt every lecture when he says cool things and I feel the sense of missing out on working with someone like that on a topic I've come to love. It will be a fairly small class (about 12 people?). Even though I won't work with him (sob), it would also help my career if I can be pleasant enough through the class that he could help me find a related job, since he's a big figure in the area, and I would like to get into a mindset where I can just absorb the class content and his wisdom without feeling bad. \n\nPlease help? I just feel stuck in my head and I'm so scared.",

Him not taking you on as a post doc says nothing about what he thinks of you. In terms of awkwardness in your interview, you can work on that. Basically all academics are awkward, so you don\u2019t have to fully rewrite yourself, but working on communication/interview skills serves everyone well. In academia, rejection is the norm, so work on not taking it personally. If you start to turn down opportunities for fear of failure, you will fail!",

          "text": "Agreed! And some applicant pools are full of high-quality talented people and you wish you could hire 6 of them. Sometimes you need to hire someone with a particular skill set or background knowledge. Just because he didn\u2019t hire you for a particular position doesn\u2019t tell you much about how he feels towards you or your work. My suggestion would be to treat him like an uncle who you were on friendly terms with. It is kind of awkward to be put on a pedestal by students. Still on the respectful side of things, but friendly and assuming that he\u2019s out for your best interest, and he\u2019s hoping that you will be successful. Most faculty are. A couple weeks into the course ask for an appointment at his office hours and bring him some of the work that you\u2019ve been working on that he hasn\u2019t seen yet. Ask for feedback. Ask follow-up questions. It may sound counterintuitive but asking someone for a favor or help is a good way to get them on your side.",

Seeing him all the time will give you infinite chances to prove your worth to both him and you. This is an opportunity. And if he is as good as you say and as knowledgeable as you say, you can't afford to miss the opportunity to hear his  material anyways.

But once I've gotten to a situation where I feel self-conscious with a particular person that doesn't really go away. And for someone more \"attentive\" or personable like him that just magnified out of proportion. On a random encounter it's fine, but it was hard when I was being judged and evaluated in the interview, and it'll be easier but still a bit weird in class - unless I figure out how to not put pressure on myself to \"perform\" when I know doing well and saying the right thing would be very helpful for me to achieve my goals. \n\nSorry for the long response- you just got me thinking.",

What has worked for me so far is to allow myself to feel awkward inwardly while keeping a rather composed front and phrase what I want to communicate in the more concise way, you can always allow yourself a 5-10 minutes meltdown afterwards were you let go all the frustration till you can point out the key aspects of the interaction you had in an objective way.\n\nI hope some of the described can help you out!",

Everyone gets rejected for jobs sometimes, and you even know why in this particular case. I'd try as much as possible to forget about the job and the interview and just focus on the fact that you get to take a class in a subject you love with a scholar you admire.\n\nAlso, not getting this postdoc doesn't mean that you will never work with this professor. Rather than being sad that you're \"missing out\" on working with him, be glad that you get the opportunity to take a class with them - and realize that taking a class with him is an opportunity to reverse or refine the impression you left on him with your awkward interview. You may collaborate in the future, or like you said, he may help you find a job in the lab of a colleague. I made some of my best professor relationships with the professors I took classes with in grad school.",

      "text": "He probably did you a favor. Staying at the same university for a postdoc is not good at all. It is not perceived well and it wont challenge you as much as moving to a new university.\n\nI am currently starting my own lab and I would be skeptical of hiring someone as a postdoc from the same institution. Postdocs are expensive, and I would say 50% of the ones I have met are not worth the money at all. Many graduate students do a postdoc because it is the most logical and easiest thing to do after graduate school. To do a postdoc in the same institution seems to indicate that you are not even willing to move to a new institution. Maybe you don't even care about the research but you just want to be able to keep your friends and gf/bf happy. \n\nI am more than certain that there are other labs in the world that do the same research. I agree with your last paragraph. Take the class, be nice, participate, and show interest. But help you find a related career? He isn't your academic advisor and this isn't an undergraduate degree. You are getting a PhD and if you can find answer to nature's intricate mysteries then you can find a job all by yourself.  He may help you find what other labs may be a good fit but if you are clever then you can find that information by yourself.\n\nI know I sound strict, but Academia is not a pleasant place and it won't be any time soon. You need to be realistic and challenge yourself and achieve things with minimal help.",

To be fair, my school is in the top \\~5 (maybe 1?) in the world for what he does, and he's in a different department with a different skillset so I felt like it was warranted and would let me grow a lot, but maybe you wouldn't agree. The gap between what he does and what I've done probably contributed to him picking someone else.\n\nI do feel strongly that networking and asking for advice rather than finding everything on my own is a better way for me to approach my career. It's one way of finding information I can't find online. I would *never* be happy in a career where I have to be a loner or expect people to be unhelpful. Life's too short for that.",
