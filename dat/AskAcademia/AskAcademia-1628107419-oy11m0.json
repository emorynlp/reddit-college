  "text": "For context, I\u2019m going to be doing a social psych program that\u2019s relatively well-known (in the field).\n\nI\u2019m feeling like there\u2019s already a bit of a disjunction between me and the rest of my cohort. Everyone is talking about getting research momentum and getting out some posters, but I kind of feel like I want to take a deep breath and actually learn some things?  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I worked for a while and it seems like most of them are straight from undergrad, but I\u2019m not so interested in just continuing my earlier research or even doing exactly what I proposed in my app\u2014I\u2019d rather take some time to find new ideas and methods for at least a little.  That last part with methods is extra important because I want to do some computational stuff that I don\u2019t really have an existing background in, which means a lot of time p-front.\n\nAnyhow, will this mentality have me playing catch-up?  How important is it to get out these little posters etc. or to immediately start study design?  I\u2019m not saying my peers are wrong or even doing this, but I feel like my interests aren\u2019t in making a career rehashing old stuff or adding like a single item to a questionnaire and I kind of feel like I would be distracted from some important background exploration if I forced research too early.\n\nThanks for listening everyone! Longtime lurker.",

      "text": "I think you have the right approach and I think you recognise that your professional experience is giving you a different perspective from those straight out of UG. Conference posters (I'm assuming that's what they are talking about) are important but you need stuff to put on them and I suspect they're all blowing smoke up each others' asses and just talking the big talk to keep up with each other. \n\nThe only thing I would slightly challenge you on is PhDs aren't about learning, they're about research. Obviously you learn a lot along the way, but \"learning\" in the \"study a book\" sense, should be done in the context of developing research outputs not just you learning more and more stuff. \n\nYou do need some pace on your PhD, you can't take too long deciding stuff but that doesn't mean rushing everything and racing. It's a marathon, taking it at marathon pace is smart.",

      "text": "I'd recommend a two-pronged approach. Spend part of your time exploring new ideas and interests - many PhD students change what they originally planned to work on after some time in grad school. But research takes a looong time from origination to publication, so hedge your bets by starting tractable side projects as soon as possible (with the marathon analogy, you actually have to run the race). Ask your PI if they have data lying around to write up or ideas in the works you could contribute to. \n\nI've often seen students say they don't want to get too specialized or pigeonholed right away, but honestly, that concern is overblown in comparison to the benefits of what you gain by completing projects. And if you want to change your focus, just do more/different research next.",
