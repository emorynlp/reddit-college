From someone who loved sports to now science, it's such a big difference!  Did anyone else go through this phase?  Anyone have a fun story about falling in love with research? :)",

I didn't have a fascination with bird watching or going to the library to teach myself calculus like you find in the biographies of famous scientists.

      "text": "My parents where hippies/outside society, no education etc. and science/formal education was just never something i considered. At teenage i feel like kids want whatever respect/recognition they can get if they are lacking it - and the obvious pitfalls of boys is of course to get respect only by seeming frightening/dangerous and for girls by only seeming desirable/pretty. I was a boy and the only respect i got was seeming frightening, so i was an asshole. I couldn't see myself being a part of the world/workforce for a long time. I joined the millitary when i was young mostly to spite my parents. Was homeless shortly after i came out at 19. I'd read a lot of philosophy/psychology by myself but knew i didn't want to work with any of those. None of it felt like something i could contribute to. I had also stopped learning math in 7th grade though and just never considered any of the hard science fields. I honestly never thought they could be interesting, i thought it was all procedural algorithmic stuff. \n\nI then randomly found out that neuroscience/medicine was interesting to me while working in a netcaf\u00e9 just watching lectures on youtube. First the lectures were about philosophy/psych from oxford/yale (back in the 00s when all the big universities started competing about who was most \"free/open education\"-minded).\n\nBut then when some of it bridged into neuro i lacked physiological understanding. Couldn't understand a lot of that because i didn't understand chemistry/physics. Tried to learn that but lacked math understanding. Found Khan academy at age 25, went back to school at age 27, started med school at age 30 and now \"paused\" to do a neuroscience research year and hopefully combine MD/PhD. Life is strange.",

              "text": "Indeed.... If you are from the EU. Most of any job, especially in Policy or International relations environment (including research or project management at private entities), are always limited to EU nationals. That is not necessarily because of \"discrimination\" by the employer but a result of either misinformation on visa processes , or the actual constrains and discrimination of the visa process. \n\nSay in Brussels, go to r/Belgium and you will be able to see the posts on people being discouraged to apply for a job in there because of visa constrains. On a personal experience, even if am a trained professional in EU affairs and research... I am unable to get any job in Brussels because the amount of bureocratic burden to hire non EU nationals. Most of the countries do have a sort of \"high skilled worker\" visa, which only kicks in when you get a really high salary or correspond to a certain industry. However, these are not always contemplated by recruiters , and these are very difficult to get when you can't even start working in the EU because of what I said previously.\n\n.... And I know, one could say that \"well then work elsewhere and then go to the EU\". Ignoring the first-world ignorance of such perspective, there is a reality that when coming from developing countries finding jobs in some industries is rather   impossible or living in the country is also not an attractive/possible option. Again from personal experience, I love the EU (toxic relationship), but in Argentina there is no work in EU affairs or in International affairs, so I am caught in a limbo of not being able to find a job because of visa issues, can't find a job in the country I had the bad luck of being born in because of lack of work, and I can't get a highly skilled worker visa because of all of the above. Yet, I am eager to work and I have a lot of passion for my area of studies. \n\n\nNow... ALL of these are basically mitigated when taking on academia because of two reasons. 1) more favourable visa schemes which make it less burdensome to take on (PhD) researcher positions, and 2) because while you are a student you don't need any sort of work permit in many countries. Thus, I am \"forced\" to get into research, even if I utterly hate academia and what it currently stands for.",

I wanted to stay but my immaturity, lack of guidance, and other difficult circumstances and too much teaching duty led me to leave the program. So, I wasn\u2019t technically forced out but needless to say I would eventually have been if I didn\u2019t leave on my own. Then on my second try I realized it wasn\u2019t like that at other places. I was encouraged and expected to finish. I wasn\u2019t being treated like a means to cheap labor but I was expected to brung back real research results and I was under a lot of pressure to make my work publishable which led me to publish in some of the top journals in my field. I got sent to meet different experts at other institutions whenever my advisor felt like his expertise wasn\u2019t enough for a particular problem I was working on. I was encouraged to think deeply and I was allowed to make mistakes.",

Took some classes in it and fell in love with the idea of studying people and how they use technology and then using that to build good technology for them (Human Computer Interaction). Then I also realized I liked school and hated the idea of a 9-5 life just sitting at a desk coding.",

I spent maybe 2 hours in school a day, and like 6 at this factory. I generally didn't care about school for much of my life, but I when I was being trained as a maintenance tech I became interested in all of these big machines. But I started wanting to learn more deeply about why and how these things worked, and I became bored of simply fixing things. \n\nWhen I graduated high school, I decided to go to college for a physics degree because of this. I loved the first couple physics classes, but I've actually since changed to majoring in math. I plan on getting a PhD now, but I probably would've graduated late and just got a boring job I hated if they didn't offer that factory apprenticeship program.",
