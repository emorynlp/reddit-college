  "title:": "My advisor was fired for repeated sexual harassment over several years. I need advise on publishing articles that they have collaborated on please.",
  "text": "I want to keep this anonymous because I'm not sure what I'm allowed to say. I don't want to get myself in any trouble. Furthermore, I don't want to \"out myself\". My former advisor is very influential and I'm \"just\" a postdoc. He is one of the most prolific researchers in the field and it could be very obvious who he is.\n\nI had a short postdoc in a foreign country that lasted for about a year. I never really developed a strong relationship with my advisor. He seemed aloof and more or less uninterested in my work. I probably spent about twenty minutes in one on one meetings with him every few weeks. I felt like I didn't have enough time to explain my work to him, let alone for him to really contribute significantly to it. He was always busy, particularly as he had a high ranking managerial role. He also had very obvious favorites who he spent more time with. This was my second postdoc and I was fairly independent by this stage and felt like I didn't really need his support anyway.\n\nThe whole time I was there I felt uncomfortable and anxious around him. However, everyone seemed to be in awe of this guy and I felt like the odd one out a bit. I more or less dismissed my feelings as I had no logical explanation for them. It was just \"a feeling\". Fast forward to March 2020 and the coronavirus epidemic was really starting to take off. My wife and I weren't enjoying living in this country, so we made a rushed decision to leave almost immediately. My advisor was supportive of this. After arriving back in my home country I continued to be employed for another month in the position.\n\nSoon after my employment ended I found out that my advisor has been fired. There was Zoom meeting about it, but I don't speak the language, so I wasn't quite sure what happened and I was afraid to ask. Recently I checked my advisor's Wikipedia page and it says that he was fired from one of his positions and suspended for six months from the other for repeated sexual harassment towards several people over several years. He never acted inappropriately towards me. I don't think he is interested in men. I do feel some guilt though that I dismissed my feelings towards him when he was probably sexually harassing my coworkers, some of whom are very attractive young women. I feel some guilt that maybe there was something I could have done.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in is that I want to publish articles from this postdoc, but I don't want to be associated with him in any way. I don't want his name on any of my articles. I don't want to support sexual harassment in any way. Furthermore, his contributions have been minimal, although probably enough to justify his name on the articles. I have another collaborator who has generously agreed to help me and I can do the work without my former advisor. I want to make it clear that I am not trying to claim credit for work he has done. I just don't want to associate with him in any way.\n\nWhat do you think I should do? I would like to just never contact him ever again and to publish articles without his name on them. Is this acceptable? Could I get in trouble for plagiarism since technically he has contributed to the work, albeit very minimally?\n\nThanks.",

What she did isn\u2019t very public, though, so I\u2019m less embarrassed to be associated with her. On the other hand, I was a victim of her abusive behavior and it was deeply emotional to stay attached via the manuscript)",

That said I see your catch 22 problem of being associated with him can also be seen as damaging. However, people know the rules of authorship and know that as a postdoc guy can't necessarily bin a PI from authorship. If you could make yourself last author or move him to middle authorship some other way that might be the compromise.",

Those \"well, he didn't actually contribute any ideas, data, or analysis, BUT he is the PI on the grant that feeds the lab so he must be given honorary authorship\" arguments are a scourge on science anyway. They need to go away. \n\nAnd if you think the work can be published without input from him that needs to rise to authorship level, that's what you should do. You may have to leave out some stuff (data produced in the lab headed by him eg.) but it sounds your work has been pretty much autonomous. \n\nI would try to find guidance with a different senior scientist - someone who can give you mentorship through this, and isn't afraid to hold an ethical line and rock the boat if necessary. You're a minor casualty of this person's misbehavior. \n\n(BTW on a sidenote, I would abstain from thinking of your colleagues who had to endure his harassment in terms of their conventional attractiveness. If you fit a predatory abuser's target pattern attractiveness is frequently not a relevant factor. Unattractive and attractive women - people - are being sexually harassed, and neither is worse or less bad than the other.)",

You should really contact the supervisor and ask to include them in the Acknowledgements. If they say no [edit: and they demand authorship] , you should contact your previous institute and they will be able to assist in your authorship dispute. \n\n  \nSource: I work in publishing, so this is how to do things by the book, but I appreciate things often don't get done that way.",

      "text": "OP, make sure you get plenty of advice from people in your specific field. Asking the institution for guidance will CYA, but it won't tell you much about how your peers will perceive the issue because the institution won't know about authorship norms in math.\n\nYou need to also consider the direction of the field, socially, over the next 5-10 years. Your peers may not care about you publishing with the fired supervisor today, but if you publish something with his name on it 2 years from now, will people 5 years from now look at that and say, \"wait, wasn't so-and-so fired in 2021? Why did /u/DiligentRaspberry506 publish with them 2 years after that?\"\n\nThe case of Geoff Marcy in astrophysics is extremely relevant here. Here is the summary:\n\n* In 2015 he was fired for serious sexual harassment that occurred over many years and a couple institutions. The scale of this became public knowledge in the field over the next couple years.\n\n* Marcy contributed to several large-scale projects in subfields that became hugely successful in the '00s and are still expanding to this day. He contributed in ways that are impossible to extract from the projects, like being a founder of the projects and writing parts of the data processing codes that are used today. Consequently, he is a co-author on a couple dozen papers since 2015, and has led a few tangential papers on his own since 2015.\n\n* A couple months ago (2021) two papers came out based on one of those big projects, and Marcy's name is on them as a middle-author among ~20 authors (in astro this author position means \"least important\"). The papers are amazing, the data set is unprecedented in the field, but this was overshadowed by everyone in the community blowing up about Marcy's name on the author list. \n\n* The grad student who led of these papers posted a well-written apology on social media and explained that the team designed a checklist for authorship and Marcy unfortunately qualified via that checklist, but the community mostly said this didn't absolve them of this mistake. \n\nThe diversity and inclusivity movement in astrophysics was already underway by 2015, but it really took off after that year. This means people became more and more comfortable talking about all sorts of issues including sexual harassment, and now in 2021 it's 100% acceptable to assert loudly that Geoff Marcy shouldn't be included on papers he contributed to. And why people exploded about these author lists in 2021. This wasn't really the case in 2015. \n\nThis is why I suggest you carefully look around the social landscape of your field today, and judge the direction it's going. Are people starting to talk more about DEI? Are those conversations happening mostly among grad students, or have they become acceptable among faculty? Are postdocs and new faculty saying things on social media about how to avoid toxic work environments? These are signs that the field is heading in the same direction as astrophysics, which means you should (1) get your publications out in the next 1.5 years MAXIMUM if they must include your fired advisor, and (2) then distance yourself from that guy with a 20-foot pole. From your comments, I think you're well on your way to completing item (2). I don't know if you NEED to include your fired advisor on your publications; that's a question to put to the other math people.\n\nAnyway, so just keep all that in mind. You can probably find many more details on the internet if you're curious.",
