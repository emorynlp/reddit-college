  "title:": "My grades weren\u2019t great, is there a future for me in academia?",
  "text": "Hiya, bit of a long & personal one here.\n\nI\u2019ve recently graduated with a BSc in neuroscience from a respected university in the UK, however, shortly before my final exams I suffered a trauma in my personal life that left me unfit for performing at my best. Long story short I was homeless for the month of my exams, mitigating circumstances fell through, and I ended up leaving with a 3rd (by the skin of my teeth).\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing hard on getting my life back on track these past few months, but now that I\u2019m in a better place emotionally, I can\u2019t help but thinking about academia. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed studying and had a passion for my subject. I intended going on to an MSc/PhD, yet after this major blow to my qualifications\nI am not optimistic about my future in academia. \n\nIt is not my intention to garner sympathy, merely to ask your genuine opinion on how badly this will limit my future prospects/ how I might bolster my chances through extra work?\n\nAny perspective is welcome, thankyou v much for reading",

      "text": "If/when you get into a grad program, your undergrad grades will be mostly ignored going forward. So the real question is whether you can get into a good program with your grades. \n\nYour grades will certainly be a hindrance in applying to programs, but your fate isn't sealed. If you're comfortable doing so, write about your experiences and circumstances in your application. If you have a letter writer familiar with your experiences, ask them to write about it. Apply to some less competitive programs. Reach out to faculty with whom you're interested in working with.\n\nIn the end, admissions decisions can be unpredictable and sometimes even arbitrary. Roll the dice and cross your fingers",

          "text": "I completely agree! Your grades certainly aren't the most important thing on your application, rather it would be your research/work experiences, your statements, and letters of recommendation. The best piece of advice I got when applying is \"don't say 'no' for them\", in the sense that if you don't apply and see what happens, you've already given yourself a rejection letter. Find recommenders that know you well, and can speak to your determination and resilience on your behalf. Your statement can also mention your hardships and how you persevered through them, if you feel comfortable doing so. Graduate programs are different than undergraduate programs, as it really is more about the person that any university is admitting into their program, rather than a list of grades. Best of luck, and if you have any other questions (or need any motivation/support) feel free to pm me!",

              "text": "Third agree here. Traditionally, in some disciplines where you can go straight from UG to PhD doing a masters is a way of overcoming poor grades.\n\nI also really reiterate physic's advice - don't do the rejection for them. It's a tired clich\u00e9 but you have to be in it to win it. What's to lose by applying other than a bit of bruised pride? \n\nI would also highlight the point to mention your hardships. You're in competition with people who haven't had your difficulties and I know students often don't want to say anything about the problems they've faced because they feel they're just getting the pity invite or cheating their way on to the course. That's simply not true and frankly academia is a better place for having people with a range of experiences. Academia likes to pretend it's too pure to be touched by the real world but often the best academics are those using their experience to shape their research or the culture around them for the better. Academia needs people like you.",

      "text": "I'm UK and as far as I'm aware all PhD programs require a minimum 2:1 for council based funding, it's not down to the judgement of the PI. \n\nTo be frank, if I got an application from you id be thinking, how come their uni didn't allow extenuating circumstances and resits? It makes one think there's more to the story. \n\nImho your best chance is to go back to the uni and appeal the decision and try and get resits for that last semester. You're going to have an incredibly hard time getting into anything post grad with a 3rd, which as we all know is effectively a fail.",

You could also apply for jobs relating to research or any clinical support jobs, which would then give you a reference that is useful to add to your applications alongside your personal statement.",
