  "text": "Hi everyone! I just found out that I\u2019m pregnant. My husband and I are over the moon, but the anxiety is starting to creep up on me. \nI am finishing up my second year of my PhD program in biology and the baby will be due in the beginning/middle of my third year. Quals are at the end of the third year. I am really lucky and I have a really supportive PI who cares about his students, but I\u2019m still scared about how he is going to handle it. I\u2019m also scared about how I will handle being a mom and a grad student. I guess I\u2019m just asking anyone who has gone through something like this for advice. What can I expect? And a bit of reassurance that you all made it through. \nThanks!",

You have a degree of flexibility around your work that is unlike most other jobs. The only downside is the money -- it can be hard to afford childcare and an extra bedroom.\n\nSome wise words from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which I wholeheartedly agree with:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*\"Work-life balance was a term not yet coined in the years my children were young; it is aptly descriptive of the time distribution I experienced. My success in law school, I have no doubt, was in large measure because of baby Jane. I attended classes and studied diligently until 4 in the afternoon; the next hours were Jane's time, spent at the park, playing silly games or singing funny songs, reading picture books and A. A. Milne poems, and bathing and feeding her. After Jane's bedtime, I returned to the law books with renewed will. Each part of my life provided respite from the other and gave me a sense of proportion that classmates trained only on law studies lacked.\"*",

Of course, delivery being just before comps is hard, as those are the hardest months in both the program and parenthood.\n\nAt least, programs that have comps in the middle of the years, tend to be more supportive and comps are not made to weed out people. Programs with comps in the first year are trying to weed out.\n\nIn any case, with a supportive environment -SO and PI-, it is more than possible and likely the best time to have a baby.\n\nWe had three PhD students in our program that had babies. It was hard but definitely the best timing, in my opinion.",

Parents are capable of making informed decisions as long as they are not prevented from accessing information.\n\nI\u2019m actually a scientist with expertise in this area. Cosleeping refers to any situation where infants sleep within sensory range of the parent, which infants have done for 99.99% of human history. The AAP recommendations, if you actually read them, advise same-room sleep for the first year of life. They stand alone in the world as the only organization that advises against same-bed sleep, though in recent years they have advised pediatricians to offer information on risk mitigation where parents insist on doing it. The same-room advice is also a recent development. Historically, their policy on this and related issues are largely influenced by formula and other infant product manufacturers, and is used as a tool for punishing BIPOC mothers in the U.S. who cosleep for cultural or situational reasons. \n\nFurthermore, blanket \u201cone size fits all\u201d advice not to bed share led to infant deaths from parents falling asleep on couches in an effort to avoid the bed, and has compromised breastfeeding which is dependent upon proximity and is especially protective for vulnerable populations. Since proximity at night is driven by strong instincts, advising against it in this way is akin to abstinence-only education, and we all know how that worked out.\n\nIn other words, human health and behavior is complex. \n\nTh AAP acknowledges all of this in their technical report for these recommendations, which is very informative. It also discusses ways of mitigating risk\u2014the vast majority unexpected infant deaths (SUID) are associated with unsafe conditions, such as smoking, parental intoxication, or overly fluffy bedding. Since formula feeding is not one of the conditions under which infant sleep evolved, no organization in the world recommends bedsharing for formula fed infants.\n\nhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2016/10/20/peds.2016-2940.full.pdf\n\nDespite important social and behavioral variables around this issue, and despite citing no fewer than 5 anthropologists in their technical report, the AAP barred social scientists\u2014including well-respected anthropologists who have contributed significantly to our understanding of SIDS and infant sleep\u2014from serving on their infant sleep task force.\n\nFor more scientific information on this topic I recommend these two sites, assembled by labs who exclusively study human infant sleep:\n\n[Cosleeping.nd.edu](Cosleeping.nd.edu)\n\n[basisonline.org.uk](basisonline.org.uk)\n\nFor simple information on how to mitigate risk when bedsharing, these guidelines were developed by an NGO in collaboration with the Durham University Parent-Infant Sleep Lab as part of a project that won an award from the Queen for service to public health: \n\nhttp://https//www.lullabytrust.org.uk/safer-sleep-advice/co-sleeping\n\nHope this helps.",

I know she was one of two women in her program (this was the 90's) and one of her professors was very rude about her being pregnant, as if she didn't belong there. Hopefully now you will have more support. I know my grad school has a group specifically for parents, and I've seen plenty of pregnant people around wet labs. And there's no shortage of successful male scientists who have many children. My mom said something like, maybe it wasn't a great time to have a baby, but there never has been a perfect time since.

It can 100% be done! For me, it boiled down to two things: 1) having a support team (partner/family/friends) who can help out while you\u2019re working on your PhD work Ann\u2019s 2) prioritizing and planning your day. The second was the biggest for me in terms of successfully completing my final year, bar passage, and lawyering (but unachievable if you don\u2019t have the support). While pregnant, I was still able to complete all my class work and extracurriculars without much modification. My only advice would be to account for the exhaustion of the first trimester into your daily schedule. Schedule some naps or down time and just know you\u2019re going to be wiped out at the end of the day (and throughout the day too). After I had my daughter, I really had to prioritize my bar prep to accommodate my work schedule and family. I would block out 2 hours at lunch (I worked it out with my Company) and 4 hours in the evening after the baby was asleep. I would pump breast milk so my husband could feed her if she woke up in the 4 hour block (which was often). When I was studying, that\u2019s all I would allow myself to focus on. I would put on noise cancelling headphones and just focus on bar prep. I knew my daughter was in great hands with my husband which made everything easier. All that say, it can be done if you prioritize your day and make good use of the blocks of time you\u2019ve designated for your PhD work.",

You figure out how to make it work -- sometimes that meant rocking him in his stroller so he wouldn't cry too much while I took scans in the library, or sitting up a pack-and-play in my lab and working off-hours. \n\nI don't have much advice other than to have the perspective that you are an adult making an important life decision -- you don't have to ask anyone's permission, and an advisor who reacts negatively to that isn't an advisor you want. When we found out we were pregnant, I let everyone know that (after some parental leave) I would be working weird hours, which would mean my communication would shift away from in-person and towards email, Slack, etc. I gave junior students and trainees my phone number, since I would no longer be as accessible. I still fulfilled my obligations (teaching etc) but with a different schedule, and different priorities. To be honest, I actually accomplished a lot more after my first was born, because I learned to use the research time I did have (which was reduced to be sure) more efficiently. Before I may have been working a lot more hours, but a lot of that time was poorly used. Don't expect to be able to work as many hours, but do plan on using the hours you do have more efficiently. During the first several months, little one will be sleeping most of time though (except of course at night when you are trying to sleep \ud83d\ude09)\n\nNow, I'm in my 2nd year of postdoc. Our second was born during my first year, and I've never been more productive, even though some days, between the toddler and 6mo-old, I only work a few hours. I think as long as the PI is seeing productivity, they're typically fine with some accommodations or weird working schedule. It took some time to get used to being more efficient (and learning to say \"no\", learning to delegate to collaborators, etc), but it will be worth it.",

      "text": "I am in the final push of my PhD (social sciences) and I had 2 kids during my PhD. I live in Canada where it is normal to take 1 year of parental leave for each child, and I did qualify for some financial support. Also I got some discount for on-camps childcare (still over $1000/month). Having 2 little kids during COVID was pretty awful and isolating, but otherwise I really appreciated the flexibility. For me, I knew I wanted to have kids, so part of the equation was also my age, my partner\u2019s age, and knowing that it was kinda \u201cnow or never.\u201d I guess it was like an \u201cask questions later\u201d type thing - I\u2019m having kids, so how do I make this work? \n\nI did have to lower my expectations a LOT. The amount of things I could get done on my to-do list dropped dramatically after having kid #1, and plummeted after kid #2. I beat myself up for a long time about that, but I am coming to terms with it. Also, I may not win any awards for my dissertation, but I\u2019m also okay with that too. I want a balanced life, and the PhD is part of it. YMMD.\n\nEdited to add: Congrats!! I remember feeling nervous to tell my supervisors about the pregnancy out of fear of \u201cdisappointing\u201d them, and one supervisor did say something like \u201cif you\u2019re not a parent, your thesis is your baby; now you\u2019ll have a real baby, and the thesis is second fiddle\u201d or something \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but in all honesty they didn\u2019t care too much, and in the end it\u2019s YOUR life!! \u2764\ufe0f",

I was so stressed and became more overwhelmed than I've been in my entire life. So, I dropped a few classes. \n\nMy main pieces of advice are that you prepare yourself to be open to changes in plan, that you communicate needs to others, and that you keep track of how you're doing. \n\nEvery pregnancy is different, so you can't know if or when you'll have problems. Your baby may come early, they may need the NICU, they may need extra care. You may experience postpartum depression. There are a dozen things that could change your plan as you have it now. Be open to delaying graduation. Be open to using daycare. Flexibility is essential, so just take one day at a time and remember that you can do this! As a graduate student, you're obviously able to do hard things. You have a fantastic mind, work ethic, and a host of other skills that will help you navigate this! \n\nYou can do hard things, but know that you don't have to do them alone. As you adjust your plan as needed, always keep an eye out for people who can help. Your husband is obviously #1. Keep him up to date with how you feel and what you need. Communicate with your professors. Let them know how things are going and what you need. I don't know your family and friend situation, but let other people around you know that this will be hard for you and see what they're willing to do. \n\nFinally, keep track of how you're feeling. It seems obvious, but if you run out of gas in the middle of your sprint, you won't make it. Take care of yourself. Delegate. Adjust your expectations for yourself. Things in your body and life are changing. You may not be able to do things the way you used to. That's ok. You're making a little human! This may be one of the hardest things your body has ever done. Give yourself some grace. You've got this! You're amazing!",

I recommend talking to your PI right away and planning ahead. My PI was amazingly supportive. We worked together to make it happen. I would try to setup to be writing after your leave so you have lots of opportunity to plan your own schedule. I ran experiments double time while preggers so I had data and stuff to be writing when I got back. I also trained some summer students to finish up some stuff after I left. I had my mom and sister for childcare, and my husband fulltime dads. I graduated in record time  but I did sacrifice myself a lot. I went into labor in my qualifying exam (finished), and only took 4 months leave. I recall over three days and nights without sleep. You're going to have to really want to finish. I don't regret it though. I also very stronglu recommend co-sleeping.

I will share what I observed during her experience. She didn't have much in the way of help because her husband and family were all out of town, but she did have a few close friends that she knew she could count on to help with essential things once the baby came (like bringing over takeout!). She talked to our Grad Student coordinator in our College and got assigned a solo office so she could pump etc. and she would even bring her baby boy in on the weekends (as needed) to finish up her work (she wouldn't bring him in during the week so as to not disturb her neighboring officemates, although the little man was a saint and never made a peep!). I know that her advisors had mixed feelings about \"what this would mean for her success\" as a Ph.D. student but it seemed as if something had changed in her - she didn't pay much heed to what they thought because she was determined to make this work.\n\nAll of this to say, she found a way to get it done and I had never seen her so committed and focused on finishing her Ph.D. She graduated a semester early and landed a tenure-track job at a great school. So there is definitely something true about the RBG advice offered here. Best wishes for a happy and healthy pregnancy.",
