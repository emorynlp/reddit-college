  "title:": "At the verge of quitting. I feel like I learned nothing in 3-4 years of my PhD and start to think I am the problem.",
  "text": "Dear comrades, I am a PhD working on S-composites as cathode materials for Metal-Sulfur Batteries - since I don\u2019t know where else to pour my heart out, this is my story. \n\nSince my Masters I was interested in electrochemistry, especially in the field of (post Li-ion) batteries, and have to say that I am a \u201efamily person\u201c. I get along very well with my siblings, my parents and my wish to have them in a distance that I can overcome within an hour of driving resulted in me choosing one of the nearer universities. Despite the fact, that there are other, farer universities that have more expertise in my field of interest. A choice I regret nowadays, a lot. \n\nMy professor has a very broad scope of topics to offer for PhD students, let\u2019s call them A, B(attery) and C. The B(attery) topic is something he stumbled upon by getting a PhD from an industry company that was interested in this field. For A and C the story is different, these are topics he either worked on during his own PhD or in the course of his PostDoc. And he has a LOT expertise herein.\nThis interest of said cooperation/company in topic B was at least partly passed on to my PI, even though he himself rarely or never became actively involved in the topic and still does not do so. Nevertheless, he always claims to be an absolute expert in topic B, even though there is no publication of our research group that has been published above an impact factor of 5-6 so far. He is at a level of knowledge where, even after over a decade of R&amp;D in the field, we as students still have to constantly explain to him the elementary parameters by which these battery types are evaluated for quality and he has little to no understanding of even the elementary measurement techniques.\n\nNow to my problem: I feel like I have learned nothing in 3-4 years of PhD and also never had a network to learn or benefit from in any way. Don't get me wrong, I have put a lot of effort into my research, read papers to the point of no return, developed and implemented my own ideas (5 co-authored papers published and currently 2 first author papers in progress), co-authored research grant proposals, supervised and corrected exams, supervised 5 students during their master thesis or research internship, worked out basics on measurement techniques (new to me) myself, was at a particle accelerator (SLS Switzerland) for the first time last week for an in operando measurement on prototypical batteries, which I planned, set up as well as applied for, in some major parts, completely on my own, etc. So: With none of the things listed before, nobody ever even helped me. Not my professor, not my colleagues, no one. No one cares what I do on a daily basis, and yet, in everything I do daily in my own research field, I find that I feel like a novice compared to the \"big guys in the battery field\". \n\nHere I am, comparing myself to my supposed \"competitors\" from other universities who are really well-versed in the battery field, and I feel like I am worth nothing. No matter what job I applied for now towards the end of my PhD resulted exclusively in rejections because someone was better, more accomplished or more experienced. I will never be able to make up for what these students learned in the course of their PhD through their network and their professor. I feel like I lost 3-4 years of time for nothing. Looking at my data feels more like \"Jugend forscht\" (research program for pupils) than professional science to me. My contract currently runs until the end of July 2022, I wanted to use the time until then to round up my started ideas and topics. Nevertheless, I am shocked to see that I am constantly treading water and am not making much progress on anything at the moment.\n\nAm I the problem or should a PhD student become an expert in his own field even \"without an internal network\"? Right now I have the feeling that no matter what I desperately try to finish, it will always result in a technically subterranean dissertation. Over 8 years for a academic career and I have the impression this was a pure waste of money, resources, lifetime and nerves. Fu**.",

The thing that is frankly the thing you are meant to be able to do post PhD?\n\nThere will be a wealth of transferable skills from that. You have several papers to evidence this. The fact you got time on SLS means you can write persuasively about Science as well, enough to warrant time amongst thousands of yearly applications. On top of the rest of the stuff. \n\nSo, don't sell yourself short. The skills you've learned will take you further than the specific knowledge, so long as you actually take the time to appreciate it.\n\nKeep going, and don't let trouble job hunting trick you. Finding jobs is something of a bastard right now, especially in academia.",

          "text": "I have to admit, that I did not submit the proposal for measurement time SLS completely on my own \u2026 that was overselling from my side. I wrote the drafts nevertheless, which were, after minor corrections by our cooperation partners, submitted and granted subsequently. I hope you are right, I feel like a piece of shit atm. \n\nDoing research independently is one thing, but it has to make sense somehow, right? Regarding this \u201eno one cares anyway\u201c mentality at our Institute I am in the lucky position that I don\u2019t have to explain myself too often. With the downside that I rarely get any qualified feedback whether what I do even makes sense. This is the current state, but I mean in industry (in which I target a job) this excuse will not count. You got to provide results that are bringing monetary worth on the long run. I am afraid that I can not deliver here.",

Like the other person commented, regardless of whether you feel competent or not, I think you can safely agree that you have become a good independent researcher which is the whole point of the program. \n\nMy suggestion would be to contact the school's counseling center and talking with them. It really helps (source: me)",

              "text": "Mate, if you wrote the draft, and submitted it without major rewrites, then you still wrote it. You still argued the science coherently enough to earn the time.\n\nSame as 'It had to make sense' - You know your work does, because you've had multiple publications from it. That puts you well above an awful lot of your peers already.\n\nFrankly, I don't think this is an issue of the quality of your work. You have objective achievements to show you are capable. I think, as someone else suggested, you should go see someone in your departments counselling. Because your internal view of yourself seems wildly harsher than it should given your achievements.\n\nIf you're worried job wise, go see your departments career advisors - They will help you identify and sell the skills you have learned, which will help you.",

      "text": "This is not my field, so take what I say with a grain of salt. But it sounds like the facts of the matter are as follows.\n\n1. You have not received as much help as you might have at another university, and this has kept you from publishing papers of the maximum impact.\n2. You have not yet had success in post-PhD job applications.\n3. You have still had quite a successful PhD overall and have many concrete accomplishments to show for it.\n4. Bitterness at the three things above and \"what might have been\" are making you want to quit.\n\nTake a deep breath. Things are not so bad. It does not sound like there is anyone to blame for all of this (including yourself). Your experience is somewhat unfortunate, but it is not so far out of the ordinary and, after all, it is just the way things are. Just because you have not gotten a post-PhD job *yet* does not mean you won't.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very competitive application. Perhaps not one that is currently competitive for top universities, which you may find disappointing, but a strong one nonetheless. I doubt that you didn't get any offers \"because someone was better, more accomplished or more experienced\". How about \"a better fit for the position\"? I think your odds will be improved by networking (contacting people before applying, asking colleagues if they know of any job openings, and going up to people - perhaps digitally - at conferences where you are giving a talk) and, perhaps, by spending more time on each individual application.\n\nDespite your understandable disappointment, things are really not so bad for you - chin up.",

      "text": "Another thing to keep in mind: You can always do a post-doc to gain additional skills or make further connections. I didn't receive enough training in graduate school in a particular type of quantitative skills. This was of no fault of my program. I didn't gain an interest in these techniques until halfway through my PhD and my program did not have anyone specializing in them. When it came time to consider my future steps, I applied for some jobs (though the job market in academia is notoriously difficult) but I focused most of my energy on applying to post-docs where I would gain the skills I hadn't had a chance to in graduate school. I managed to get a great post-doc and the combination of skills I had from graduate school with the new skills I gained in my post-doc put me in a really strong position to do the research I wanted to - and eventually secured me a TT job. \n\nJust keep in mind that everyone is still learning and you can certainly learn new skills and make new connections post-PhD.",

Everyone's expertise is so incredibly specialized that you are the world expert on your specific topic. It's not that others don't care, they don't understand what it is you do!\n\nPlease look objectively at what you did over the past years: You pushed research forward, wrote proposals, wrote papers (which I assume got accepted). This is impossible to do without learning something. You learned a tremendous amount, I am certain. This is the other thing about academia: most of the time, everyone makes tiny contributions that take enormous effort. This is also normal-- very very few people make breakthroughs all the time (although with all the scientific marketing everyone has to do these days it certainly seems like that!)\n\nIt's unfortunate that this is the state of academia but at current time, this is how it is. With few exceptions (especially in STEM) we trudge along in our tiny fields and make tiny progress. I understand the frustration: I have felt it myself many times. In fact, I'm considering leaving academia for that reason (and some others). But as far as I can tell, this is how the sausage (i.e. science) is made.",
