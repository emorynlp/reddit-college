  "text": "I'm starting a research lab for my new TT position. While I have helped write grants in the past, I haven't had experience as the PI on the grants. I'm at a SLAC so I don't need large NIH K or R grants to guarantee my funding or receive tenure, but I would like to apply for some large-ish grants in the near future to buy out some teaching responsibilities. Any recommendations for books or other resources on how to apply for grants would be very appreciated. I know how to write a research proposal but I feel like I don't know all the details. For example, a grant I'm looking to apply to asks for reviewers without conflicts of interest. Do I need to contact some appropriate professionals in the field and inquire about their availability before I submit their names or do I just send names of respected professionals doing similar research? How do I estimate salaries for RAs? I have mentors I can ask for specific questions, but some of my questions may sound dumb \ud83d\ude05.",

The worst that will happen is they say no, or offer to speak with you instead which is just as valuable. This was a huge help for my career and was advice I got from a mentor.",

      "text": "I doubt you'll find many books, since the details are specific to your country, intstitution, department, and the funder and specific call.  \n\nReviewers are like suggested reviewers on papers - you definitely cannot contact them in advance.  You just make your suggestions and the organisation evaluating the grants will decide whether they are interested in using them as anonymous reviewers.  From my experience applying for grants, and reviewing a few, if you contacted them in advance that would make them ineligible to review and would probably get your grant thrown out (or worse) for trying to cheat the system.\n\nQuestions about salaries are incredibly important, very specific to your department/university/funding call, and not dumb at all.  The answers are often very complicated, because you need to account not only for their salary but things like pension contributions, whatever social security / insurance type stuff you have to pay as an employer, future inflation rate and salary rises, and any other indirects / overheads that get calculated within, or because of, salaries.   \n\nYou need to go discuss this with an experienced colleague AND your local grant support office.",
