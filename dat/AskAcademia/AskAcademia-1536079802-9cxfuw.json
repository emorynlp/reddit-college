  "text": "Here's [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/european-science-funders-ban-grantees-publishing-paywalled-journals)'s take on it, if you haven't read the news yet.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is this the long-awaited tipping point? Or will we just see new journals Nature Open, Science Open and Lancet Open with the same editorial boards as the flagship journals and really high page charges? Will researchers go for that sort of thing? (and then universities gut their library budgets to pay for it?)",

Why would it? The journal recoups its costs directly from the author, with no consideration to the readership. Consequently, less importance is placed on proof-reading, peer review, copy-editing, formatting, and quality assurance. Under the traditional format, a journal with no readers will have no subscribers, and will die a slow death.\n\nWhy reduce the number of articles per issue if it's all online anyway? Why give the authors a hard time if you'll publish it all anyway? If you get paid by the article, why not publish as many as you possibly can? The economics incentivize bad science. Contrast with the traditional model in which each extra article is an additional cost for no additional revenue, bad articles dilute the impact of the journal and reduce its attractiveness to subscribers, and it's in the best interest of reviewers and the editorial staff to only allow high quality articles of major interest to the community.\n\nI am not sure I agree with this move. There's already too much garbage being published as-is, and the open-access model only exacerbates that. Scientific journals should increase their gatekeeping mission, not abandon it.",

The OA journals run by the 'prestigious' publishers (Scientific Reports, PRX etc.) have very high impact factors - PRX is higher than PRL, for instance.\n\nWhich is not to dispute that this move is unlikely to be a net positive - I think, from the scientific side, you can certainly exert pressure, but the shake-up needs to be on the publishing side, and the issues you raise, about it potentially leading to junk science getting published, are pretty spot-on.",

In particular, I'm underwhelmed by the \"ambivalence\" towards Green OA. Maths has (along with physics and compsci) the ArXiv, which works far better than any individual institutional archive in terms of visibility (I and most of my colleagues check it daily), breadth (almost everyone uses it) and for establishing priority. Peer review in maths can be painfully slow, and on more than one occasion I've saved six months of wasted effort because of an ArXiv preprint. Most journals allow (or ignore) the final (peer-reviewed but unproofed) versions of papers to be uploaded to the ArXiv almost immediately, even before the paper's officially appeared.\n\nI have colleagues whose funding requires OA publishing but makes no funds available for it, and university OA coffers run dry incredibly quickly. Funders embracing largescale ArXiV projects would be a bigger, better and better value step towards open science than this, which I think runs the risk of driving naive researchers into the arms of predatory OA journals.",
