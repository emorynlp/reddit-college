  "text": "hi everyone! throwaway account. 4th year Phd candidate in English lit/communication studies. I\u2019ll start off by saying, i come from a working class background in which anyone in the family going to grad school, regardless of discipline/field, was met with showers of unquestioned approval/\u201cwe\u2019re so proud\u201d/etc. i fully know that nobody twisted my arm to come to a program and field where the chances of getting a job afterward are so slim, but i also KNOW for a fact that academia propagandizes itself as a way to distinguish yourself among a sea of less credentialed competitors. anyway. \n\nI am absolutely miserable in my program, and in academia in general. nothing about it makes me happy or fulfilled at all other than my own research projects\u2014but that is an increasingly lonely, unrewarding pursuit too. My \u201ctop 50\u201d program is an absolute joke. i knew i didn\u2019t really fit in super well here after just a semester but have really tried to chin up and make the best of it. But there\u2019s things going on that feel downright neglectful, and not at all a product of me just being a \u201ccomplainer\u201d: i haven\u2019t received a single word of feedback on the FIVE semester papers worth of more-than-full-time classes i was required  to take even as i came in with a masters. I also received about 2-5 sentences total of time & attention on the comprehensive exams i spent a whole semester completing. My comp exams were so insulting, i\u2019ve never felt so isolated or uncared for in my life. Working myself to the bone for all these pointless check points, producing a paper i was really proud of, just to have my advisor respond \u201cyes this looks fine.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m now trying to complete my dissertation but i\u2019ve found no mentors and have almost zero feedback over the last four years to judge how i am progressing and if the claims im making are sound. It is incredibly isolating and depressing to be working from home, completely estranged from the sorry excuse for \u201ccommunity\u201d academia can muster, and basically having to beg my advisors to pay a moments attention to my pursuits. I\u2019ve gone the entire semester now without hearing from my dis. chair, even after multiple, multiple emails both to her directly and to administrative people in my dept to make sure she still even freaking works here. \n\nSome of this might be completely standard for academia, and more power to it\u2014i just don\u2019t want to be apart of it any longer. But especially coming from an exceptionally undervalued and underfunded part of the humanities and with no savings to hold me over if i don\u2019t find a job, i feel completely trapped. There\u2019s nothing on my resume that is applicable to stuff outside of teaching and waiting tables, lol, and i don\u2019t feel adequately credentialed to be a competitive candidate for teaching jobs.\n\nHas anyone left academia/the humanities, even temporarily, with a pretty tiny resume? Is the world as cruel and punishing as i expect it to be if i leave a degree? I have 8 semesters of experience instructing independent sections (i.e i am the instructor on record, not working under someone tenured) if that helps. any responses at all are super helpful. Thank you for reading :)",

      "text": "Rhetoric/Composition person here. I know a couple of people who left academia to do other stuff. To be honest, it's hard. A lot of people I know are over-educated for what they do. One person went back for an MA in Education and got a teaching certificate, and is now in the public high schools. Another person went into copy writing and now works for a marketing firm. Another person opened a restaurant. So, you can kind of see that it's all over the place in terms of using the training/degree.\n\nThat said, to be brutally honest I would finish out the degree in your place. You might find more happiness actually working once you get away from your institution. And if you're ABD, you're really close to done. I personally think it looks better on your resume to have the degree rather than not. I don't know if either one of those factors would sway me individually, but together I think they're enough that I probably would finish out the dissertation unless I thought things were going really badly and/or I had an abusive committee chair.\n\nI'm sorry. It's a damn hard life.",

Have you tried reaching out to other faculty members in your dept or even in other fields related to your diss topic (someone who works in the same time period/region/methodology in history/theater/etc)?

I realize everyone is busy but I can\u2019t imagine people not be amenable to you making a 20 minute appointment during their office hours. You just might need to seek out more than person to get all the mentoring you need.\n\nRe: alt-ac jobs, I\u2019m in art history so there is a pretty strong grad school to museum work pipeline, so I may be biased but have you considered museums or non-profits? They always need good comms people, most of the staff has grad degrees, and they might provide the intellectual stimulation you crave. Maybe consider doing an internship at one now to feel it out?",

That either means there's something wrong with your work or something wrong with your program or both. \n\nNote that there is not really any such thing as a \"top 50\" English program -- most of the desirable jobs are going to people from 25 programs, with a lot more going to the top 10 of those than the bottom ten. And typically, there are signs early on that your department thinks you are a top candidate who will do well on the market -- you will be getting feedback, encouragement, invitations, etc., as well as fellowships to release you from teaching. If you have 8 semesters of experience as an instructor of record and are in your 4th year ... do you even have fellowship years? It sounds like you may not have the kind of funding package required to be competitive on a job market. \n\nIn terms of resume -- I think you are mistaken in assuming that white collar jobs require some sort of specialized background in the American labor market. You are presumably much better than the average American at reading, writing, and analyzing, which are all skills that you can easily parlay into an entry-level position at lots of companies.",

There's an assumption in academia that people who have more time to do research produce stronger research, and stronger research means they're more likely to find a job.

There are pretty significant structural differences between labor and consumption (even if sometimes these fields are blurred under late capitalism). Even with protections for organized labor being steadily eroded, a strike still looks different from a boycott.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not suggesting that no one should enter academia. Exploitative labor practices are certainly not unique to academia, and for some, a humanities PhD program may be the best choice given their priorities, means, and other options.

This has nothing to do with public/non-public: Berkeley, Michigan, UVA, UCLA, etc. all offer competitive stipends. Also, the idea that a program \"cannot afford\" fellowship years is a bit like a diner in an American restaurant who says thanks for the meal, but that they \"cannot afford\" to leave a tip. If you can't afford to offer fellowship years, you shouldn't be taking PhD students.  \n\nI could be wrong -- I don't even know your field -- but are most/some/any graduates of your program getting placed in TT jobs at schools you would like to work at? \n\nIn terms of why, there are 2 parts. \n\nFirst, no one running a humanities job search is looking to hire the world's greatest teacher -- they are looking to hire the world's great enough teacher. Having 0-1 classes as instructor of record is a major strike, because it means that you will likely need a lot of handholding from your colleagues and may still be bad at it, causing them aggravation and extra work. At a certain point, however, you encounter diminishing marginal returns. It makes no real difference to a search committee if you've taught 5 classes or 50, provided your teaching evals are positive (and they always are).\n\nThe second part is: you have 6 classes as teacher of record, but those come at a cost -- research and publications. Lots of searches a) want a candidate with evidence of a robust research agenda and b) need some criterion to distinguish 50+ candidates from one another so that they can winnow down the pool. (Everyone has great teaching evals, great LoRs, etc.). So they use pedigree and publications: are you in a strong and well-known graduate program? Has your work appeared in well-known journals? \n\nIf you can teach 6+ classes as instructor of record before you are ABD, have publications in Critical Inquiry and Representations, are finishing in <8 years from start of MA to end of PhD, and can talk comfortably about trends in contemporary fiction, then yeah, you're fine. If not, it's because there's a compromise involved in what you do with your time in graduate school.",

And it's a trap. Institutions look for evidence of an active and fruitful research program. \n\nI had a discussion with a younger grad student in the waning months of my MA about this exact topic. He tried to argue that a senior grad student was better prepared for the job market than an Ivy graduate who published multiple articles in some of the top journals of my field. The senior grad student had taught multiple classes, while the Ivy grad had won a prestigious postdoc and currently worked as a VAP. Well, no shock, the Ivy graduate got a top R1 job (and an offer from my own department). The senior grad student is now in her 9th year. \n\nPut another way: you can outpublish an average teaching record. You can't out teach a bad publishing record.",

(I definitely didn't take advantage of internship opportunities in undergrad, which I now regret.)\n\nThat being said, I do think that--regardless of the level of formal institutional support--internships are seen as part of the typical career/study path during an undergraduate degree. This is not the case in a PhD program. I have used my school's career office, and there are some internship opportunities available to PhD students, but many more that are specifically targeted to undergraduates. Moreover it's likely that your advisor will discourage you from pursuing inernships because they'll see it as taking time away from your research/teaching work.\n\nLikewise, none of the several humanities alt-ac workshops I've attended provided much in the way of concrete guidance as to what steps one should take during the PhD in order to identify and pursue a non-academic career path. Sure, you can make the argument that we shouldn't need to be spoon-fed...all I know is that the kind of career support I see the undergraduates I teach receiving looks very different from what my colleagues and I are getting.\n\nIMO, humanities PhD programs do a fair-to-good job at preparing you for an academic career--as long as you can get one.... But they do very little to prepare you for any other kind of career path. Whether or not they should is debatable; you can make the argument that the entire purpose of a PhD program is to prepare people for academic jobs. Personally, I think with the reality of the humanities job market--where even people getting degrees from elite institutions often spend several years and make many compromises in order to finally land a TT job (and a non-trivial number of people never find a TT job at all)--non-academic career paths should be treated as more than an afterthought.",

PhDs moving into alt-ac definitely have their unique challenges (just like all groups have their unique challenges), but the challenge of finding something you like and demonstrating your competency in it when your experience doesn't look like the perfect applicant's isn't somehow going to be much harder for you because you have a PhD.\n\n> \nIMO, humanities PhD programs do a fair-to-good job at preparing you for an academic career--as long as you can get one.... But they do very little to prepare you for any other kind of career path.\n\nBut they're not supposed to prepare you for another career path though? Like, even programs in disciplines that have robust industry opportunities don't prepare you for said opportunities, largely because the work itself borrows a lot from academic work, so the necessary preparation is mostly telling students that these jobs exist and they should apply. That's not the situation in fields without industry opps, but that's probably an argument for not getting that PhD, not for your professors to teach you how to get jobs in fields they know nothing about (not least because their advice by that token is worthless). A PhD isn't an extension of undergrad or an opportunity to prepare yourself for the \"real world\". I kind of get why you think it should also provide general professionalization services, but it doesn't. If you don't want to be a professor, just don't go.\n\nOn that note, this is why I kind of side-eye this whole alt-ac thing, especially when it's used to sell people on a humanities PhD. I remember it starting as a way to help people who were already stuck and hopeless find jobs outside the academy, but it morphed into yet another way to justify the recruitment of starry eyed young people into a dying career. The transferable skills you learn in a humanities PhD can be learned on the job or in a professional master's. If you don't get an academic position, getting paid to study some obscure thing you love is the only reward.\n\nAnyway, to answer your actual question, I think you're overstating the power/necessity of career counseling. The quality of career counseling across the board is pretty shit (source: Askamanager), and the good career counseling mostly applies to specific careers, like consulting, at specific companies, like whatever consulting company your school is a target for. Everyone else, undergrads included, is finding their own opportunities and figuring out their life paths on their own, through doing scary shit like getting out of their comfort zone, trying new things, reaching out to people, and being like, I don't know what it's going to be like and I don't know if I'll be successful but I'm doing it anyway. Candidly, a lot of the PhDs I meet (particularly K-PhD) are in their program because they were too scared to look for a job senior year. A lot of undergrads feel like you do. You all are staring down an unfamiliar environment that no type of school, K-12, undergrad, postgrad, prepares you for. And if you really like school, staring down the prospect of starting over after 20+ years of being told you're amazing by your teachers is terrifying. But ime, the people who navigate this successfully make the choice to jump into the deep end and deal with the discomfort for a while. Or they don't navigate it at all.",

There's millions of careers out there, some of which didn't exist a year ago.

Comps were graded by a field committee, so I got a paragraph back on each of four 8-page essays. My diss defense was largely a conversation about how to revise it for the book to come.  TBH, I got the most \"mentoring\" and formal feedback from a law professor I took some electives from...she was happy to have a Ph.D. student in her 3rd year law electives because I was there out of interest rather than obligation. What you've experienced OP is pretty much what all of my friends did in the 1990s-- though my chair and committee were friendly and happy to talk anytime I wanted to. In reality, I moved 1,500 miles away as soon as I was ABD, took a full-time teaching position, and wrote my diss on the weekends.\n\n\"Has anyone left,\" you know the answer is of course. In fact, of my huge Ph.D. cohort only about 10% ever finished and <5% of us have had traditional academic careers. Of that 90% who didn't finish I have friends who went in all sorts of directions...some taught at private high schools, some at community colleges, some went to work for Amazon (this was the 90s, so not in the warehouse, but at HQ), some are in publishing, many work for the government (feds especially), some went into business, etc. etc. The skills you developed reading and writing all those papers are useful, you just have to find your niche.\n\nBetter to get our now, though, than drag it along for years if you don't want to. The academic market is insane now and there's little chance someone who is halfhearted and coming from a \"top 50\" program is going to have many options in academia. If you don't want to work with college students, don't. Instead get some help (career center?) on how to pitch your fairly extensive/polished skills for other markets and get out there.",

I've spent the last several months trying to figure out if I qualify for unemployment (probably not) and how to deal with the fact that my student health insurance will end in July, with very little support, and I know that uncertainty has affected the time/energy I have to give to both finishing my dissertation and job searching. \n\nI ended up being able to take out a private student loan that gave me some excess money to put in \"savings,\" which has made this situation feel slightly less immediately dire, but it's obviously not an ideal solution. I'm planning to read through *Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide* in the hopes that it will give me some useful advice. (If you'd like a pdf, let me know and I'd be happy to send one.) I've also been working with a career counselor at my university, which has been helpful in terms of developing my resume and LinkedIn profiles--though I still haven't had much in the way of success as far as outcomes go. \n\nI have also realized that I feel incredibly out-of-place in corporate environments (probably partly a class thing, partly a disposition thing), which I think is part of the reason I went into academia in the first place. As much as I try to shake this feeling, I still have this gut feeling of not belonging when I browse a lot of company websites/LinkedIn profiles, which I don't think is helping my confidence in the job search. I also hate how much academics sometimes make it seem like finding a non-academic job is a *fait accompli*.\n\nAnyway, I really hope something works out for you and that you're able to find some clarity about whether sticking it out in your program or leaving is the right choice for you. Until then, solidarity and feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk more.",

But that doesn't mean there aren't jobs that are good fits for your skillset. I assume the MLA has resources on non-academic employment?

This is especially true in Federal jobs working on policy research (or any non-STEM research job tbh). But on all the Federal jobs I've found (and a lot since the government is basically re-stocking post-45), they're pretty specific that they care more about your demonstrated skills than degree area, and they weigh coursework completion the same as a completed PhD.  80% of people work in a field outside of their major, there's no reason you can't be one of them. \n\nBut I'm sure there are other options.

Consider also where you're located, and what industries are local to you that you could start feeling out while you teach and take advantage of whatever benefits are worth your time. I'm thinking about this all the time because even coming from a T10, my expectations for a TT job are only slightly higher than winning a three-figure sum from a scratch-off ticket (and with my background and life experiences, I'm unwilling to move to a place that will damage my soul in order to chase a brass ring just to have the rug pulled out from under me when the next round of budget cuts happen).\n\nUntil the bottom gives out, there's always admin.

Background in creative writing, and was told by my master's mentor (who is a rhet comp person), that basically Ph.D.'s in Lit, and Creative Writing aren't going to be landing anyone TT gigs anytime soon, and that because most English faculty know that, they are giving our less funding for programs, and are becoming less and less competitive. Which I believe translates to your experience: no one cares, because no one actually believes fostering either Ph.D candidates will lead to anything THEY can talk about as an accomplishment (e.g. my recent student got a TT job at an Ivy league all because of ME -- kinda talk). So, since you got into the program, they simply assume you're good a writer, and pass you through hoping you won't want actual mentorship because you should be a good writer since you got into the program. Messed up logic, but that's why I switched my trajectory and only applied to Rhet Comp programs...because more and more schools understand how important it is to hire a Rhet comp person to teach first-year composition (or handled the writing center), then it is having a Lit or Creative Writer teach it.   \n\n\nIf your goal is to stay in academia, I highly suggest trying to see if you can get a rhet comp certificate so you can mark yourself a bit better.

So at that point I scrambled and found some marketing/communications positions, though I had the advantage of previous work experience in that field.\n\nHere are some possibilities that you might consider in your situation:\n\nSince you are so far into the PhD program, it may be worth just sticking it out to complete your degree. As you finish your degree, you can also begin some professional development to help you land a non-academic job. For example, let's say you find some part-time marketing role that you can do as you complete grad school. In this role, you could amass a portfolio of clips which you could then use to leverage yourself into a full-time marketing job post-graduation. So you would need to identify what field you are interested in and a way to build up your resume in this field that isn't too time consuming.\n\nIf you absolutely hate grad school and want out now, you could simply start applying to f/t jobs now as you continue in your grad program. If/when you find an promising job, quit your grad program. There are positions out there in both private industry and academic administration that value people with academic backgrounds. In the private sector, check out various educational technology companies. Combine a targeted approach--jobs that you could conceivably excel at--with volume: the more positions you apply to , the better your odds.\n\nOverall, keep in mind that being in grad school is proof of extremely advanced skills and capabilities in writing, analysis, organization, etc. You may be able to find an alt-ac job with this alone. If that doesn't pan out for you, there are many \"low-lift\" ways of boosting your non-academic resume to help you pivot into an alt-ac job.\n\nHope this helps.

If you are close, it might be worth getting the degree just so that you don't feel like you wasted that time, even if you end up getting a \"real\" job. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are not close and your chair isn't motivated to move you along, it might be a big waste of time to keep spinning the wheels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck, I'm sorry to hear that!",

      "text": "First off, I'm sorry to hear you've had such a negative experience with lack of advising from your mentors. Academia seems to be such a crapshoot on whether or not you get mentors who regularly check in or are totally MIA. This year has been especially tough for all of us (including them) so I'm trying to be patient with my similarly MIA mentor. I've had to reach out to other faculty in my dept to get feedback on major papers for my degree. Just mentioning this to say: You're not alone.\n\nI'm not in humanities, but leaving academia is entirely an option if that's what you want. Many companies specifically seek out those with PhDs for their analytical/statistical/problem-solving skills. Maybe others actually in humanities here can recommend some jobs to look for, but start applying early (i.e. a year or so before you graduate).\n\nAlso, check out the sub r/ByeByeAcademia, lots of folks there with similar stories who may be able to lend a hand.",
