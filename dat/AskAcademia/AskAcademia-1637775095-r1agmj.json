      "text": "I got my bachelors at the age of 35, PhD at 42, then a tenure-track position. I was also single and childless, which I have to assume makes things a lot easier. It involves being poor while your peers are making money. I absolutely loved being a student. If I could wave a magic wand, it would be to ensure being single through the transitions from bachelor to PhD, and then PhD to the Tenure track position, because those involve having to move often long distances. My advice would be to leverage your maturity and professionalism to Ntwrk and get involved in experiences like research that will Improve your odds. Clarify your long-term goals and values, figure out how 10 to 15 years of school fits in, because it is a long hard haul during which One might have to grapple with Being in the strange position of a poor student at that age. Caused me a lot of inner conflict and self doubt, but it worked out for me. And of course, spend time Researching the terrible job prospects in academia, often terrible pay, little choice in where you\u2019re going to live, and that the academic life is usually not what we think it\u2019s going to be.",

As long as you don't mind some late nights. :) Oh and definitely worth it. \n\nThe advice I would give would just be to make a schedule. Work with your advisor and be open about your situation. I found my advisor to be INVALUABLE. You have to be really pro-active in moving things forward, especially when you're not living on campus and surrounded by information. The only issue has been office hours. Most of my profs and TA's office hours are in the middle of the day. But nearly everyone is willing to make an appointment for after hours when asked. \n\nGood luck to you! It's a great experience.",

      "text": "I\u2019m 30, got my BA in 2012 and worked in marketing. In school full time working on a BS to completely change my career and plan to take this to at least a masters. The jury is still out on if I\u2019ll pursue a PhD (I would be in my late 30s when complete). \n\n100% do this. Make this change. I was worried about connecting with my peers because of the age difference and have found a good group of friends. I also have a totally different approach to how I study/learn as an older student. This is the most fulfilled and excited I\u2019ve felt about my future in a long time. I burned out and had a quarter life crisis working in marketing and was so afraid I\u2019d look back at my life and be full of regret that I didn\u2019t at least try for this BS. Go for it, OP. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you have a career you can fall back on or try something else new.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m also newly married. My husband and I have been together for 5 years and are doing long distance. He is 35 and working towards his first BS back home while I\u2019m out of state. A relationship can be navigated while going back to school, if that\u2019s something you also want. It\u2019s not ideal and it\u2019s our reality, supporting each other as we pursue this shared dream. My two cents that it doesn\u2019t have to be an \u201ceither or\u201d situation. While our plans to start a family have shifted, we\u2019re also approaching children as an \u201cand\u201d rather than an \u201ceither school or family\u201d once were both done with our undergrad degrees.",

      "text": "I'm 28, currently pursuing a bachelor's in chemistry. This is my first degree and my first experience with academia. As someone with professional and (hopefully) life experience, you will be leaps and bounds ahead of your younger peers in most areas. I find that because I'm here on my own fruition, I tend to have a greater appreciation for learning new subject matter, as I'm not is some rush to get out of school and start my life for the first time like most of my younger cohorts. My appreciation for learning new things is much greater than it would have been when I was 19, which actually makes the experience so much more rewarding. \n\nSome negatives to consider. Nobody will understand why you are so old but still a fulltime student lol Others your age will often make assumptions the moment there here \"in school\"  and or \"not working full time\". Also, you will be tormented by watching your friends with comfortable jobs enjoy incredible amounts of free time and luxury while you slug it out as a poor, burdened student. Consider if this will finacially set you back on things such as buying a house. Lastly, its tough to connect with students who are 10 years younger than you (or more!) and you likely will feel pretty lonely at times. \n\nThat said, I could never imagine returning to my old life having learned what I have now. I don't regret it because my personal education really means a lot to me.",

      "text": "I did not have a good relationship with my PhD advisor. I was his first grad student and joined his lab in his 2nd semester teaching. He did not know school policies and would rather I not get paid on time or reimbursed than admit he made mistakes. I am also 3 years older (39 when I started) than him with 15 years experience working in academic labs and was a departmental lab manager at my alma mater. I\u2019m mentioning this because as a mature student, it may be best to find an advisor who is established in their career and doesn\u2019t have insecurity or dominance issues. Also, I loved my old job as departmental lab manager, I just didn\u2019t get paid enough to afford buying a home ( single at the time, no kids). I really wanted to earn my PhD. My grad RA stipend was only 19k and I worked 2 additional part time jobs. I cleared out my savings, withdrew some from my retirement, and put 4k on a credit card. I ended up leaving my program and it was absolutely devastating to me. I had a truly awesome project, a 3.9 gpa, and an advisor that made my heart pound in fear when I heard the lab door opening. On a happy note, I\u2019m teaching and doing research at a small college with my fabulous husband. I\u2019m happy with how my career has developed, just returned from a conference in the tropics, and make a little more money than I did at my last job. I recovered financially (took about 3 years) and am saving to buy a house with my husband. I took a chance, and it didn\u2019t turn out like I hoped but I am still happy with the outcome. Pursue your goals with courage! Wishing you the best of luck!",

You\u2019re motivated in the majority of subjects because you\u2019re choosing to be there and paying for it yourself. Since you don\u2019t have children it\u2019ll be easier to make this decision.

      "text": "I returned for a Masters degree in my mid-30s.... as a stepping stone to a Doctorate. I was focused / driven and determined to not commit the same mistakes I did while getting a BA (mixed bag here).\n\nIt was an 'easy' decision because I was not in a relationship and with no children. I moved out of state for my Doctorate (that was a long and winding road).\n\nSure there were moments during my Masters degree where I was much older than my peers (still made some good friends) but for my doctorate I was somewhat older but not necessarily than many of my peers. In education, with a few years of teaching under your belt, we tend to be older than in other fields.\n\nI was younger than the professors (no by much) but they were amazing mentors. I definitely relied on all of my experiences (and challenges) to put the effort into perspective. \n\nAll that wisdom gained to maintain focus and drive.\n\nBut, the writing of the dissertation was maddening and frustrating a times. So make sure you have a support network around you \\[and follow your gut that your adviser is supportive and values all of your experience that you bring\\]... I finally defended my dissertation (married and with a child).\n\nSo, it's definitely possible... good luck!",
