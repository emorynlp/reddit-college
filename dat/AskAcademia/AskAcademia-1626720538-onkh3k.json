  "title:": "Going from industry to academia",
  "text": "I am currently working as a software engineer. I have been a software engineer for more 10 years. I have a bachelors in computer science from India and a masters in entertainment technology from CMU (pittsburgh, PA). I did a course on Udacity for Deep learning and I am very interested in pursuing this further. Specifically I want to go deep into re-inforcement learning and biases in AI.  But I don't know how to apply for phd programs. I have not worked in a research lab ever. However I do have great work experience in building complex cloud based systems. I have a patent from one of my previous companies (as part of my team). Is this something I can leverage?\nEventually I think I would like to work at an industry research lab like DeepMind. I also really like teaching and would enjoy being a professor.  But as I understand those jobs are very hard to get. \nI am also a bit anxious about leaving my 6-figure salary behind lol. \nThere seems to be a lot of resources about going from academia to research. But not enough for the other way around. What is the general opinion on this?\nHow do I begin this transition?\n\nEDIT - Responses - \n1. I am mainly interested in research and going deep into specific topics. I find that it's not really possible to do in industry because of all the time constraints. \n2. I am interested in teaching, but you're probably right in that getting into a community college as a teacher is easier than the phd route\n3. Giving up the industry salary is hard, but not impossible. If I can do research in a field I enjoy, and have a living wage, I think i'd prefer that to having a huge salary",

      "text": "You're talking about at least 10 more years, a PhD, a postdoc, and understanding you can't be working in an industry research lab, and a tenured professor with their own research (which in STEM you need). Also, if you're worried about losing money academia is definitely not for you. If you want to scratch the teaching itch try getting a position at a community college.",

      "text": "I'd suggest looking for PhD programs that interest you. Then look at the affiliated faculty and see if there are research projects that interest you. Contact them for more information and to introduce yourself (including your industry experience) and express interest in their work and the graduate program. Some may get back to you and you can find out more about the application process and what might make you a more competitive PhD applicant. \n\nSome programs require that a prof endorse an applicant and agree to take them into their research group if accepted to the program, so find out about that as well.",
