  "text": "Hi AskAcademia,\n\nSTEM field at US here. I recently have a feeling that fundings will flow into those labs that has prior established publication records. Which is understandable because sponsors prefer to invest on those who have a better chance to be successful. \n\nHowever, how do labs who are new to certain fields grab funding if the sponsor only fund experienced labs? Then those experienced eventually grow more experienced and bigger, and even become capitals, thus harder for smaller/newer labs to survive \u2026.",

      "text": "I've worked at a few different funding agencies.\n\nThis is a genuine problem, but for different reasons than you think. It's not necessarily that we 'want' to invest in established investigators, it's that new investigators are at a disadvantage in peer review. As you said, they don't have that established track record, they also don't long standing collaborations, previous funding, and they tend to be weaker grant writers just due to lack of experience.\n\nThere are several approaches we take. The most common one is to make investigator experience an unscored criterion, but this doesn't really address the publication history/grantsmanship problem.  As u/ACatGod said it's common to have funding mechanisms that are only available to new investigators (for example, within 5 years of getting a faculty position), most funders have something like this. If you're a bigger agency with enough applications you can also \"tag\" younger investigators and calculate their percentile separately from the more seasoned investigators, so they rank higher at council when funding decisions are made.",

      "text": "There are a number of resources specifically for \"new researchers\", \"early career researchers\" etc.  The money is not huge, but you need to build your track record on those before you move on to the larger grants.  If you are not successful on small grants, you are unlikely to get a real shot at the big grants.  That is yet another of the learning curves to being an academic.",
