He organized all that in what looked like a tree with different branches (one for each parameter) and would gradually shrink it by making assumptions and simplifications. Ultimately, he ended up with a smaller tree with fewer combinations (over 1000) which outlined the number of experiments he did in 3 years of research.",

Less is more, most of the time. A cohesive story will often be the most impactful option. \n\nThe style I feel in love with and now use in my talks is a style I stole from a professor I really liked. She always had slides that were blank except a question. She would pose it with a pause. Then the title of the next slide would be  the answer to the question and showed you why she came to that conclusion. I feel like this style really engages the audience. And it is simple. It doesn\u2019t require added graphics.",

Then he loosened his tie and started speaking.  A few minutes in, he took his jacket off, and then tie.  He was clearly uncomfortable and fighting his cold (THis was waaayyy pre-Covid).\n\nThen he started talking about how the WWF helps reptiles....stopped and apologized again, and took off his dress shirt....revealing his undershirt that had reptiles on it.  \n\nThen he talked specifically about the birds in Europe that they are helping and took off his shirt to reveal another one with a stork on it.\n\nThroughout the talk, every time he would go into a new subject he would take off a shirt to reveal the next one and topic.  He had 8-10 black t-shirts in total all with the different topics and animals he was talking about.  It was a amusing, entertaining and dramatic effect that I remember 30 years later.",

A long time professor was retiring and the president wanted him to give a farewell speech on his research and experiences during a fancy alumni event. He is the stereotype of a disheveled, absentminded professor, so as he took off his jacket and fidgeted with the buttons on his shirt while talking, people thought he was just being himself, but started to worry where it was going.  Finally, he made his big point doing a superman style reveal of his t-shirt underneath related to what he was talking about.  People still talk about it.",

      "text": "If the subject matter allows for it, good graphics can indeed do a lot of the heavy lifting. For biosciences in general, I found the visualization building blocks from e.g. Biorender (or a selfmade library) to be really helpful. For practice, try to make a 15-min presentation just with pictograms. \n\nI once saw a presentation that consisted almost entirely of video visualizations of 3d image stacks that had the audience burst into standing ovations at the end. (It was Alain Ch\u00e9dotal presenting his embryo development work, just really cool stuff. See e.g. [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.008), his [lab website](https://transparent-human-embryo.com) appears to be down at the moment).\n \nOther than that, I think that storytelling is key, too often presenters forget that they are presenting for the audience - those people assume you care and want to care as well, but might need help with getting to the presenter's level of enthusiasm. In short, you are also presenting to tell a story. \n\nThe most succinct storytelling framework I found to date is just eight words, as follows: \n\n> You\n\n>Need\n\n>Go\n\n>Search\n\n>Find\n\n>Take\n\n>Return\n\n>Change\n\n(Via [this blog post](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2021/02/16/storytelling-harmon-vs-mckee/) at the always-excellent ribbonfarm blog). \n\nSome elements of this can be adapted for a scientific presentation as well. For good examples, I'd recommend taking a highly polished form like a science TED talk and reverse-engineer it for its storytelling elements (rather than content). That definitely helped me with my presentations, and I need all the help I can get because I consider myself a mediocre public speaker at best.",
