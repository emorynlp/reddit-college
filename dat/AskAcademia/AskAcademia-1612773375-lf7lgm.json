  "title:": "Returning full scholarship amount if discontinuing PhD",
  "text": "My university (Private, Indian) had a rule that says one has to return the full scholarship amount of the PhD scholar decides to quit the course midway.\n\nMy colleague has a horrible, horrible guide, and is in unnecessary pain, stress and distress. But now, he can't quit\n because he possibly can't pay all the money back, because he used it to, you know, survive. \n\nAny one have any ideas about what can be done in such a case?\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nThank you for all your response, we will look into all the suggestions you gave us. Especially the medical and legal aspects of it.\n\n\nUpdate: Turns out there might be a way after all. The university (allegedly) consideres the first 6 months or the time till the registration for a PhD (after presenting the PhD proposal) which ever is later, as \"probationary period\", so quitting in this phase is gonna get you into trouble and they ask for all the money that they gave you during this time. Because you were technically not working with them; it was a probationary period.\n\nBut if you quit after your proposal is accepted, you don't need to pay it back.\n\nBut this is, again, just speculation. \nIn any case, if this is true, we'll be proceeding to do this.\n\nI'll keep you all updated.\n\nAnd again, thank you so much.",

To formulate it smooth - it's a joke, we are exploited as slaves by the University and on top of that you get the wise supervisor who just goes along with the university's crap. Sure, otherwise his/her job or reputation is at risk. \n\nNevertheless, there must be some sort of office for this kinds of troubles - confidential kind of people, who you can ask for advise or solve the problem gently. Especially as both - the professor and student will benefit from a transfer as the project is doomed to fail otherwise.\n\nI clearly see the point of supervisors backing each other, but to be honest - all my academic life was pulling down my pants and bending over. This is how you become a professor, this is what they probably want you to feel: this is the take home message from your PhD. Instead of learning how to become a strong personality and follow your research ideas, you are doomed to follow supervision and comply with academia.",

Most grad school scholarships are provided by two governamental agencies, and both have a clause that states that completo of PhD is mandatory, else you give every penny left and follow a lawsuit. It sucks, yes. Some people were able to provide valid reasons for leaving and ended up not paying, others were not as fortunate.\n\nGovernment would have to go ahead and try to find the person in germany for this to happen, which I don't see it coming since they barely care about us here. If they do pursue him, if he stays there for about 5 years (or more, im not an expert) this \"debt\" will be disregarded. Plus, 1 EUR is worth almost 7 BRL nowadays. I'm a PhD in brazil earning 3000 BRL or 550 USD, while most earn between nothing and 2200 BRL.

      "text": "This does happen sometimes. The best way out is through, and that will mean developing a huge amount of political savviness.  Your friend should absolutely and definitely seek a new advisor. The issue is, they need to be clever and cautious about \\*how\\* they do this. Do *not* say bad things about the current advisor. It needs to be framed as a matter of research compatibility. It would be helpful, even if untrue, for your friend to say things like, \"I have enjoyed my experience working with X. Through my program so far, I have learned and excelled at Y. My experiences with Y, however, have lead my interests to develop in Z direction\" (where Z is the research interest of the new advisor they are reaching out to.\n\nNo faculty members want a new problem child on their hand, but they are interested in working with people who are passionate and aligned with their research direction.\n\nI cannot stress this enough--your friend needs to save face. Your friend shouldn't dig themself into a hole they can't get out of. This does mean swallowing pride and saying some things that might feel hard to say, given that their experience has already been so bad.  But it's better to make oneself say those things and succeed, than get into an even worse situation.\n\nI hope this helps, and best of luck.",

Academia won't change, even later with the PhD in the pocket... It will always be the same, bend over. The PhD is probably the Vaseline, but still you would be very restricted how much Vaseline you are allowed to use.\n\nI just can recommend to hang in there, even with all the mental breakdowns, unfairness and all the shit which comes along. Be strong, stretch your shitter as required and at some point you will be rewarded with a piece of paper, stating that some professor couldn't break you. At some point all this will be over and you can look back with pride how much your ass was able to take.",

What else is there than laugh it off?\n\nGood luck to your bud, I hope you will find a solution!",

And in spite of the relatively lower funding we recive in comparison to IITs, we have better research output.\n\nAnd not everyone is lucky enough socially, financially and opportunistically to be able to do a PhD outside.",

They worked with big bosses, big names; with no significant research skill of their own.\n\nBTW you may find very good PhDs from IITs and IISc. Yes, there are problems related with advisors being bully, funding being limited, fucking politics in academia; but you should not make generic argument that IITs are substandard in research. You can find outstanding researchers in IITs.\n\nAnd please avoid making an applicable to all statement, it does tell a lot about your ignorance.",
