  "title:": "Putting Off a Neuroscience Msc until Age 27, Too Late for a Promising Career in Academia?",
  "text": "Hi there. I'm hoping some people on this sub can give me a bit of guidance. \n\nI am currently 25 and had planned on applying to my Msc in Neuroscience in the next month or so for the Fall 2022 cohort. However, I have recently decided that waiting an additional year will be in my best interest, largely so I can travel and experience the world on a more intimate level. However, because my ultimate goal is to be a tenured professor of Neuroscience, I worry that starting graduate school at age 27 is a little too late. This would mean I would likely be 32-34 by the time I complete my PhD, and 35-36 by the time I complete a post-doc. Is this cause for concern? Are universities less inclined to hire candidates for TT positions when they are this age? \n\nAny advice or thoughts on the matter would be hugely appreciated, and I appreciate candor above and beyond comforting reassurance. \n\nThank you all!",

      "text": "One year won\u2019t be the deciding factor in whether or not you will be able to eventually become a tenured professor. I assume you already know how few neuro msc holders eventually become tenured professors so I won\u2019t focus too much on that. If you have a plan for what you can do with just the MSc or just the PhD or after a postdoc if you can\u2019t get a TT position then I don\u2019t see a big difference that a year would make.",

      "text": "A year makes a negligible different. If you are in the US, a MSc is not a very common or useful degree in neuroscience. If you are elsewhere, if the opportunity is there to go right to a PhD program, do it. It is more efficient and usually opens more funding opportunities. Also, if going the TT route, prepare to spend 5+ yrs as a postdoc in most areas of neuroscience.",
