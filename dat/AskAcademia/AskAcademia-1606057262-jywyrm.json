  "text": "Hi there :)\n\nI'm an older student (27), I've just completed my undergrad in the social sciences, and I start postgrad in February. Found out my husband and I are expecting a few months ago, baby is due in April. Do you have any advice on being a mom while in grad school? How to balance family and studies, time management, how to deal with rudeness from people who think you should choose one over the other. \n\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all of your helpful responses! I'm currently down  with a migraine so unable to respond individually to everyone, but this is so encouraging and honestly makes me feel a lot more positive about the future. Thank you for taking the time to explain your situations and experiences. You are all such wonderful, strong women.",

However, I suggest looking at grad school as your job and trying to separate it from family life. My routine for the last year has been Saturday and Sundays, my husband knows to take our son and I focus on studying all day or as needed. I study after I put my son down at night and I study at work (if I can!). It's a lot to focus on but is doable!\n\nEdit: I didn't read your last sentence. I never received rudeness from people about my decision to go back to school. It has been the complete opposite! Family, friends and coworkers have been rooting me on and seeing if I need additional help with my son.",

      "text": "I went back for my undergrad right after my oldest was born when I was 19 and was a single mom all through that and my masters. I met a wonderful man as I was finishing up my thesis and we ended up getting married after my first (his second) year of our PhD programs. We planned on waiting until we were done with school and found jobs before adding to our family... but surprise! Honeymoon baby.\n\nI'm not going to say all of it was easy because it definitely wasn't. But I was fortunate enough to have a very supportive family that helped with child care when I was single, including sleepovers at the end of semesters and inevitable term paper all-nighters. And it helped too that my advisors in both graduate programs were understanding as well. In fact my PhD advisor had had all FIVE of her children while she was in college so I knew it was possible. When I had my second I also had the benefit of an amazing partner who felt that taking care of the baby and the house were as much his responsibility as mine and he valued my education as much as his own.\n\nI guess none of that is really advice because it was more or less out of my control - I was just lucky to be surrounded by amazing people. The one thing I could control was my mindset. As much as possible I looked at my school work as an 8-5 job like any other. I'd get up, get the kid(s) fed and off to school or child care and then \"went to work.\" Sometimes that was classes, sometimes studying or writing, sometimes actually working in the lab or field. At the end of the day I was home and tried to be present as mom/wife by leaving the schoolwork at school.\n\nNow this wasn't always possible, obviously. As I mentioned before, the end of semesters were always crazy because of deadlines. There were some years I had to take night classes because that was the only time required courses were offered (in fact, the 9 months I was pregnant with my youngest I had 3 night classes a week). But you make adjustments as needed, put your head down, and get it done.\n\nI should also mention that you have to accept that you're a non-traditional student and if you have a healthy school/work/life balance as a mom, things are probably going to take longer than they would for a single, childless student. I spent a year longer in my masters than most and it took me ten years to finish my PhD while some of the unattached youngsters in my cohort got done in three. Some of the latter had to do with moving out of state towards the end and difficulties associated with that, but that wasn't really related to being a mom.\n\nAs I'm typing this out (on my mobile, sorry) I'm realizing none of this may be helpful to your specific situation. But I just wanted you to know that it's doable and you can make it work! Good luck.",

      "text": "Yep. Did my Masters as a Mom whose husband was overseas for 1/2 of it, got a divorce at the beginning of my PhD program and did the rest of my PhD as a single Mom. It's hard but doable. My tips:  \n\n\n1. First of all, whatever deadlines your professor lists, your personal deadline is 2 days earlier to prepare for whatever crisis might occur like sick kids or trips to the ER when your kid decides to jump off the top of the monkey bars. No crisis? Great! Then you have another chance to proofread your work. This saved my ass quite a few times. I utilize reminders in my phone/calendar and I don't even list the real date. I didn't want to know. I would check it if a crisis came up to see how much more time I had but otherwise, it didn't exist. \n2. Set a schedule and make it clear to your family that these are your work times. Barring crises (like the ones listed above), your family recognizes these as off-limits. They don't make plans during these times and should assume that they are on duty for the family responsibility. It's a lot easier on them if it's consistent. After my divorce, this involved grandparents stepping in to give me that study time. \n3. Self-grace. Sometimes the house won't be as clean as you want and that's fine. Sometimes dinner will be take out and it is what it is. If you are a meal planner and can freeze things, cool. If not, forgive yourself and watch your waistline. (I was a size 6 when I started my PhD program and left as a size 12. I gained 50 lbs during those 4 years that I'm still working to take it off...  it's going, but not nearly as fast as I would like it to!). Hopefully your partner respects how much you can do and is holding up their end too. Just be honest and upfront about what you can do and stick to that. If you have to get creative with solutions, do it (I hired a maid to come clean once every other week at one point). These things are okay. You don't have to carry the weight of the world. \n4. Learn how to say no to good things. Like the Mom friends who make you feel guilty for not doing playdates/Mom nights or volunteering. If you choose school, school and family are your focus, period. If you choose to do those extra things, it should be for your relaxation and mental health, not to appease people. People who don't understand and respect your \"no\"  lose the privilege of being in your life. It's harsh but you do get a good sense of who respects your boundaries and who doesn't. \n5. Find a group of friends in your program who \"get it.\" Your family won't. They may be supportive but they can't possibly understand what it looks like for you. Having your people is about the best thing I can say for your mental health. \n6. Learn how to break down work into smaller pieces so that you can utilize times when you would be sitting around doing nothing. Example: I used to meticulously outline my papers in advance so then when I had 20 minutes of downtime, I could focus on just one paragraph and take that off my plate (and believe me, these add up to having a mostly-done paper that just needs some editing). Or I could bang out one discussion post. Focus is a little harder (and I have ADHD so believe me when I say this) but if you already pre-plan it, it doesn't require a lot of deep thinking to prove what you already decided should be included in advance. And of course, revise it later. I wrote my entire dissertation at my kid's lacrosse practices. I think this was the biggest change I made. In undergrad, I wrote all of my papers in 5 hour marathons. In graduate school, I did most of my work in small chunks. I never realized how much time I was wasting \"waiting\" for things like standing beside the stove bored while I was waiting for the spaghetti to cook, sitting in a waiting room, sitting in the school pickup line, etc. I realized that if I added those up, it gave me hours and hours of extra work time. \n\nPeople who don't respect your decision can get over it. My former in laws spent every family gathering telling me how selfish I was for being in school and working in general because I guess it's my job as a woman to let my life revolve around my husband. We obviously weren't going to see eye to eye on basically anything. (And these people all have pretty miserable marriages so I wasn't heartbroken that they didn't think we were matching their standards). It took me maybe a year of that to politely say \"I'm glad that's working for you all. That's not what we chose. Now moving on..... (insert subject change here)\" \n\nSidenote: I sort of hate your headline here because why on earth don't we ask fathers the same thing? (I'm not critiquing or judging you for your wording. It is what it is. But it makes me sad to rarely see men ask these questions and we as a society rarely expect them to.)",

      "text": "I can give some perspective as a prof who leads a research group in the US. I\u2019ve been single for much of my academic life, child-free, and am now in a somewhat non-traditional relationship where my partner and I do not live together. So I speak as very much an outside observer. \n\nMost of my trainees have been in the lab during the stage of their lives when they are seriously contemplating having a family - or the timing of it. Our little lab tribe has collectively produced quite a few kids, and group members currently have a three-year old and a newborn (in separate families).\n\nIt\u2019s different. \n\nPeople have less time to devote to their work, and sometimes have to work odd(er) hours, or hew to daycare and school schedules. Oddly enough, that makes people really efficient: the time limitation means there\u2019s simply no room for mucking about. You need to get in, get it done, and get out. \n\nDo new parents do less work? Yes. But they do 80% of the work in 50% of the time. In my experience, this often results in a net increase in work quality. They become more mindful of the work they do, and as a result think it through a little more. I suspect it\u2019s related to the mindful practice ideas that are floating around in woowoo productivity land. \n\nMy advice to new parents in my group is usually to trim back their own expectations, and take this opportunity to close out side projects that haven\u2019t died yet. To focus on fewer things and get those done well. Separate planning from doing, and spend a couple of days thinking through a month\u2019s worth of experiments or analysis because they simply don\u2019t have margin for error. \n\nNot all my colleagues are like me. You\u2019ll be able to spot the assholes very easily. Avoid them as much as possible - especially the old white men who tell you how they didn\u2019t miss a day when they had young kids (because they loaded all the parenting on their spouses). \n\nGood luck!\n\nPS we have lab meeting over zoom now and the three year old insists on joining to watch labTV. It\u2019s adorkable.",

Are you funded and what are the expectations of the funding, year to year? \n\nI had 2 kids in phd program. I was largely funded so only had to balance teaching a bit and research. Adding external work would have been a lot worse.\n\nBc I had funding, I was able to put them in daycare. Highly recommend. You will not be able to do a lot of real work with young kids at home. \n\nHaving kids in grad school impacted my publication rate. I'm three years out and just starting to have serious amounts of pubs. But this doesn't matter if you're in a ma program or a field that doesn't go into academia in the same way. \n\nSome people judge, I had people assume I was leaving academia after the second. I'm actually the only person in my cohort who got a TT job tho.",

My husband took over a year of paternity leave and we did daycare, but there were still times when I felt like I had maybe 6 productive hours in an entire week due to the kids. Actually networking at conferences was virtually impossible because I needed to be home.\n\nPersonally, I would not have been able to do it if it hadn't been for my husband shouldering most of the childcare duties and housework, and even then it was hard.\n\nIf I could change the past, I would have had my kids earlier like when I was doing my MA, but alas, I didn't meet my husband until the year I started my PhD and at age 33 I wasn't going to push it into my postdoc years when I had such a great source of funding with my PhD.",

I've been going to conferences since they were infants and yes, when I brought them, I got less networking done and I def go to fewer than my peers wo kids.

Both my kids have a really silly imitation of me they do that involves hunched over, madly typing on an invisible keyboard, pausing to slug back coffee, and every once in a while being like \"sshhh, leave me alone, I'm wwwooorrrkkkiiinnnggg\".\n\nBut there's up sides too. I mean Christ, my friend had her first while working at a grocery store. She had to pump in a stall, still on call for her register. I got my own room. I'm taking tomorrow off to spend the day with my 7 year old bc I'm about to have a baby soon and want to do a personal day with each of my oldest first.

I wanted to take more but I just felt so bad earlier in my pregnancy that I was glad I followed the advice of my advisor and didn\u2019t.\n\nFor next semester I emailed a professor to ask if he thought it was feasible to take his class but miss part of it due to maternity leave. He ignored my email so that made me feel a bit ashamed for asking (though I\u2019m trying to not let it bother me). I think the best thing is to just not ask anyone permission. Take on what you think you can handle but make allowances for health and time. For example, my major involves lots of reading and one weird pregnancy thing I have is terrible headaches that make it hard to read. I have to write a lot and my normal writing process is to load up on caffeine and write for long time periods. Obviously both of those are out - I can\u2019t have more than a cup of coffee or tea a day and back pain makes it so sitting in my chair for more than 7-8 hours kills me.

Including who's stays home when the kid is sick, when daycare is closed, backup options for childcare.\n\nI would also try to start planning, as much as possible, doing things that require less of your physical presence , if possible nearer your due date.\n\nYou should also get very, very used to the idea that planning is crucial, but that no plans survive actual life.  Someone is going to have a fever, a broken wrist, a car that won't start.    If you don't have some kind of alternative universe in mind that would be an ok way to live  (including changed time lines and changed standards) you are going to be very stressed.\n\nAs to other people's opinions , they don't matter, just ignore them.  The only thing that matters is that you and the other baby parent and the baby are on the same page.",

I am studying for a Master's in Curriculum and Instruction, too. \nIt was SO hard for me to study while caring for a newborn baby, even now that she is almost one. The best time for me to study was when she slept. I would start my schedule before she woke up in the morning, and I would study well after she fell asleep at night. That is the best advice I can give you--just study when the baby is asleep. I know that is easier said than done, but I wish you the best of luck!\n\nEDIT: I have never experienced rudeness from caring for my niece. She did once interrupt a Zoom meeting, but my colleagues were understanding.",

Having kids while I was in graduate school was hard, but I believe it made me much better at time management, particularly using small chunks of time efficiently. Now that I\u2019m a divorced single mom working on tenure I write my articles this same way. I\u2019m also a part time divinity student, and I read books and write seminar papers this way. I don\u2019t even ruthlessly outline; I just always carry a book with me and bring my laptop to sports practices. I\u2019ve also graded papers during hair appointments, lol.\n\nEdited to say: it gets easier as your kids grow older and become more self sufficient.",

      "text": "So I (a current PhD student) had my kids in undergrad, and I gave my professors a heads up before they were born and they were fine with me wearing my babies to class. I also found it easiest to study after their bedtime, which I trained them to be around 6 pm as infants, since we got up early (6 am) and that way I had about 4 or 5 hours after they went to sleep to study and all that.\n\nAs for people who think you should choose one over the other, just brush them off. \"I am working to support and provide for my family long term, and timing may not be perfect, but its perfect for very few. I'm lucky\" would probably shut them down.\n\nPrepare yourself for mom guilt, but remind yourself that when people are criticizing they often don't have children, or their children have grown up and they don't remember the struggle, or their life is **very** different from yours.\n\nThere will be many people who admire your work ethic, and are supportive. Also, get on a daycare waiting list ASAP, your university may have subsidized options available to you so look for resources regarding that. (In undergrad, there was a program called CCAMPIS that subsidized 60% of daycare costs for my kids)",
