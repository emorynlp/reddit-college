  "text": "University employees/HR...were you in a search committee and the job had to be reposted? Can you tell me the reason(s)? \n\nI applied for a position for internal candidates only. Three days after my interview, they called to tell me it had to reposted because it needed to be open to all everyone, not just employees.\n\nI'm hesitant to apply for a different job that was reposted.",

      "text": "Common reasons include, not any hire-able applicants, pool was too small for their liking, messed up on the posted salary, and admin screw-ups. \n\nI would bet there was an admin screw up in this case. At my institution there are certain parameters that need to be met in order to do an internal posting (though I have no idea what they are). It could be the same at your institution. \n\nYou can contact the department/supervisor to ask for more info about the position. They might freely tell you why it had to be reposted.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t see any reason to doubt their stated reason\u2014in most cases public universities have to have a full search and can\u2019t just make a position available for internal hire. But even if they\u2019re lying, you have nothing to lose by resubmitting. If something shady is going on you just won\u2019t move forward, but if nothing shady is going on (and it was reposted for the states reason) then you\u2019re fine. \n\nThere are reasons to repost a job after having first and second round interviews if there are no qualified candidates, but that would be 1-2 months after the posting closes. If they\u2019re reposting within days of it posting there must be a rule violation (like they claim happened) or perhaps just an error in the ad that needed to be updated (imagine if they listed the wrong areas of expertise desired).",

It had to be reposted for a week, but I didn't need to re-interview. I was hoping to get an offer so that my current office could counter, but it didn't work out.\n\nThis second position posted 3-4 weeks ago and it was reposted yesterday. I wonder if they made a mistake of listing internal candidates only or not enough qualified candidates like some other folks mentioned? It's an Assistant Director position for a small office, so who knows! But I think I'll toss my hat in the ring because I have nothing to lose and it's $10K more than my current position.",

There were two obviously subpar candidates, one average, one ok and the perfect internal one who had basically been running a section of the department for a few years already in practice. For some inexplicable reason (I later heard it was because a tenured professor at the department felt threatened by this younger person's much wider skillset) they chose the ok candidate. But because she was only ok and didn't get a high enough evaluation on her teaching skills they couldn't offer her a full professorship so offered associate. She rejected the offer as she had wanted a full professorship. Internal regulations wouldn't allow offering the position to the second choice so the search was reopened.",
