  "text": "I\u2019m putting together a literature review on a topic and would like to do an analysis of my bibliography. I want to see which articles are cited the most not just total but within my current bibliography. Am I missing articles/authors that should be included? As I mentioned in the title, I\u2019m not currently part of an institution to use web of science and I don\u2019t see anywhere to get an individual license. I don\u2019t want to put my bibliography in a graph database and analyze everything manually if existing tools are available. What do you all use outside of institution-only tools?",

      "text": "Bit unclear but if you're trying to do some type of bibliographic network analysis. If you are, you can use [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/getting-started ). It's free. Alternatively, I guess you could use [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), but you'd be manually copy/pasting the DOIs into the searchbar. Which might be a bit over the top. Both use CrossRef in the back end mainly.",
