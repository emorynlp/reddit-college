  "text": "I had a faculty member ask for picture evidence of a successful outreach event I spent hundreds of hours organizing because they said they were responsible for tracking outreach. Later, they asked me how I was planning on funding the event again and suggested it probably couldn't run because I didn't have funding.\n\nIn the process of trying to find funding, I found out from our faculty fundraising team that that faculty member had already been given funding by a private donor that thought it was partially going to fund the outreach event I was trying to run again. She had used the pictures she asked for from me to apply for funding and was planning on using the funding from that solely to promote her work.\n\nIt appears to be a violation of our University fraud policy, but I might not bother pursuing that. I was mostly just shocked anyone would care so much more about promoting themselves over outreach.\n\n**Has anything like this happened to anyone else? It took me completely off-guard. What would you do?**",

You could try reporting it, but this is the problem in organisations that accept donor funds without proper processes and governance in place. Really the donor and your organisation should be requiring accounts not just pictures that could be from anything and if there's no proper agreement in place then arguably nothing untoward has happened even if morally it's corrupt.",

Additionally, I've made sure funding for organizations I've been affiliated with now goes directly to them from this office in the future. It would be impossible for her to do this again to any other party.\n\nArguably, it's workplace harassment to misrepresent the availability of funding or information that your coworker should have access to. At least, it's included as an example of something that would classify as workplace harassment in my province. \n\nIn that way, despite no agreement, it's a violation of at least one provincial law.",

I take any complaint very seriously but honestly the commonest outcome is irritation/frustration at the stupidity and sometimes laziness of people, but they haven't crossed the bar to misconduct, even if I think they're jerks.

So, perhaps it was an ACFA compliant way to apply for funding on behalf of everyone and then funnel it to only herself. Regardless, this has brought up an important piece of legislation I hadn't bothered exploring. \n\nIt really feels like they would have misrepresented this to her accidentally out of ignorance. I assume, based upon other communication and compliance problems I've become privy to that she was told she could spend the money however she wants. It's unethical, but she wrongfully assumed I would never find out. Honestly, I don't blame her - I almost didn't. \n\nIf you were told something unethical was legal, then why not lie and advance your career? Is it incredibly unethical? Yes. Would I ever work with her again or allow her to touch any funding? No. Did she purposefully break laws? I doubt this. \n\nAnother commenter noted that being a jerk isn't illegal. Even if it is illegal in this case, is it worth exploring? She won't be able to do it again. If anything, it's an important lesson to our fundraising office that we need to keep a closer eye on honouring the desires of donors. \n\nAs a donor that will continue supporting that university, I'll just directly make sure my money makes it to the right places. \n\n\" I might start with the donor stewardship director.\" *Do you think I should bother?*",

You can't openly accuse her of fraud without evidence, and the administration would be the ones to accuse her anyway, not you. \n\nDon't talk to her chair/dean without proof, and definitely don't talk to the external funder at all. That's for the university to do if this turns out to be as you say. \n\nAlso, be prepared to terminate your relationship with this person if you pursue any investigation. Whether she's innocent or guilty of it, she'll surely never want to work with you again and might actively harm your career if you give her an opportunity. Hell, you might have to watch out for the university taking reprisals against you. They protect their own. She's faculty and you're just the rabble-rouser exposing her for fraud and them for mismanagement.",

Turns out that in the final stage of my friends project, the professor tells her that she is getting fired and they decided to litteraly work weekends to get her project finished. During one of these weekends the professor tells my friend that it all started when she was applying for a new grant. Since the research team leader is more experienced and has quite a famous reputation, they decide to put his name on the application since they thought it will increase the chance of her getting the money. When it was clear that her application was accepted, accusations of poor professionalism starts coming her way which eventually leads to her getting fired (she was a Guest Professor at my university for a couple of years, which is not a permanent position). The professor and the research team leader have worked together for years, published sucessful articles together, so she had no reason to not trust him this time. Well, in the end, the money was in his name and he got rid of her. It was really messed up.",
