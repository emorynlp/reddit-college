  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI had a fiance who committed suicide when I was younger, and after that  I ended up a bit \"loose\"  on a \"dating spree\" so to speak. Although I am fortunate to not have any lasting repercussions of this, I am single and rapidly approaching the point of teaching. I was wondering if anyone would have any recommendations about dating in academic or even using dating apps? I've heard some professors claim to have blackmail attempts by students or former student and I am not sure how to navigate dating in a more \"reserved\" context.",

      "text": "I'm a grad student but sounds like our ages may not be that far off. It's unclear if you are a PI or a grad student from this but...  \n 1. Close the age range dramatically on your profile (you can probably leave the higher end high  but the low end is where you will get students) - this will do the bulk of the work   \n2. Don't date or match with students in your classes. Sure it will suck to figure out if this person is in your class but it really won't be that hard. Like see if they share a first name and compare the ID photo you are given (this happens at my school but idk about all)\n\n3. Do not behave unprofessionally on the apps. Ever. It is not like texting someone you met in person, this is a stranger and you are trying to date (it sounds like seriously). This is what will keep students from trying to blackmail you even if you match - because there is nothing to blackmail  \n4. Try to meet up in person on a date soon after matching. Make it a public place where you are comfortable and tell a friend you are going. Now you are just on a normal date. Try not to give away everything interesting about yourself on the app because you haven't met the person yet and you don't know if you will get along in person.   \n5. Not for apps but just get involved in a hobby you are interested in and you will probably find other like minded people. This of course depends on the size of your college town.  \n\n\nThere is other advice out there but from a realistic point of view this helped me a lot. You want to put your best foot forward but be careful. Someone can screenshot any conversation you text /message them so just make sure you are not sending anything worth screenshooting. It will most likely be fine.",

Recusal unfortunately doesn't happen as often as it should - and is rarely clean. \n\nI find it's often older, senior, male professors who argue that this kind of relationship is appropriate (\"we really clicked!\") and younger, female grad students, adjuncts, and junior faculty who are skeeved out by it (lots of women I know have felt pressured to, if not date, put up with the advances of more powerful men in their fields and adjacent fields). As I said in an earlier comment, it creates ugly power dynamics that often fall along lines of already marginalized demographics.\n\nSMH at \"Living in fear\" - well, yeah, that makes sense if you've been sexually harassed or raped by someone in academia (which has happened to more women - although not only women - than you probably care to admit).",

Sure, there's a huge problem of academics pressuring junior colleagues into relationships, sexual and otherwise. But you're essentially arguing that there should be no consensual relationships between members of academia of even slightly different career progress because sexual harassment exists, and that's just way too much of a far-reaching statement.",

Chill out, I'm not going after your girlfriend.\n\nThis is tone policing, and it's particularly out of place here since nothing I wrote was aggressive.\n\n>To your first point, depending where you are in academia (and this very well may be a STEM/humanities divide) you absolutely do come into contact with, and can exert power over, folks from other disciplines. \n\nPerhaps it is. On the converse, I don't think I could name a single academic that is not in my field. I have more power over the person who rings in my groceries than I do for anyone who is not in my department.\n\nThis is partly because I am not nearly senior enough to be on any sort of committee whose reach extends beyond the department. But early-career people are precisely who we're talking about here.\n\n>I am saying we should be attuned to the possible abuses of power differentials, which are rampant in academia. \n\nNo, if you were saying that, I'd have agreed with you. Had you said \"It's fine but you want to be careful and mindful,\" I wouldn't have disagreed. You're saying \"avoid it\", and that's just one hell of a blanket statement.\n\n> If you honestly think that sexual harassment is not a \"particularly relevant observation in the topic at hand\" then you are obviously coming from a very privileged position.\n\nNo, I'm simply calling you out on changing the topic. We're discussing academics using dating apps, and whether you should discount any and all academics at different career stages even if they're in the same age group as you, even if they're in different departments/fields/universities as you.\n\nI've yet to read an account of a woman experiencing sexual harassment in Academia after matching with a rando prof from a different university on Tinder, and him holding over her that maybe in a few years her fellowship application will land on his desk. When I start seeing those kind of accounts, I will be happy to triple-check my privilege.",

FT faculty are also easy to look up since we tend to have webpages so keep that  in mind when you decide whether to have your title and institution on there, anyone on the apps can find out plenty about you cert quickly. You have to gauge your comfort level about this.

      "text": "Most of the advice here has been really good.  I will say apps that are more focused on dating, such as OkCupid and Bumble, are probably a little safer than \"hookup\" apps like Tinder and Grindr.  My profiles described my personality and interests more so than any identifying features students might be able to use (e.g. \"I'm a psychology professor\").  Definitely set the age range above 23.  That will exclude most undergrads, and do you really want to date a 19-year-old?  Even if their settings include your age range, you'd be less likely to pop up in their suggested matches.  If you're younger, you might also want to set your age a little higher (I set mine at 32 when I was teaching as a grad student in my late 20s).  I included pictures, but you couldn't see my face in them.  Only once I had vetted the match, usually asking what they did/if they were a student at the university, would I send pictures that included my face.  I found dating apps to be a little safer than just meeting people out and about because it's easier to do the vetting online than to give them the third degree over the noise of a bar.\n\nAvoid undergrads like the plague.  They're immature, and you're more likely to get in trouble for dating them as a professor.  Grad students are a little safer (as long as they're WAY outside of your department), but there is still a lot of potential for a power dynamic that can be iffy.  You'd need to make sure you could excuse yourself from any situation in which you might be evaluating them, such as interdepartmental fellowships and such.\n\nAs far as blackmail attempts, just be smart and protect yourself.  Don't use snapchat because you can't prove that something inappropriate WASN'T said.  Don't send nudes.  If you have been dating a while and feel like you can trust the person, don't include your face or any identifying features.  Assume that anything you send could potentially be read by your chair, provost, and tenure committee.",

If you date 5 people you're already up to 40% chance.\n\nYou think it's reasonable for the policy to imply that for somebody who went on 5 dates, a coin is tossed and that decides the person's future employment?",

It's not unreasonable to ask how to manage my presence on these apps to avoid unpleasant consequences if a student happened to see my profile or if I matched with a grad student in another faculty.\n\nObviously if your school has such a blanket policy against dating anyone affiliated with the university, you shouldn't do that, but provided you avoid dating students and other situations with power imbalances, I can't see how there's a significant risk of these consequences...",

You can\u2019t date outside your job site???\n\nA lot of college towns in the United States have very limited options in terms of the dating pool and some are remote enough that even driving isn't really an option. As an example, I attended a rural R2 with an estimated population in the region of about 20,000. If you do some quick math (e.g., age, gender, martial status, etc.) that leaves a *very* small pool of single people. \n\nIn some parts of the United States this actually ends up being a recruitment issue for the school since junior faculty don't want to be single in the rural areas with limited dating prospects.",

      "text": "> I was wondering if anyone would have any recommendations about dating in academic or even using dating apps? \n\nHonestly, it's *really, really, tough* if you are at rural school without even factoring the role that gender and sexual preferences play. However, if you are in a major metropolitan area the the major obstacles are going to be the usual ones involved with dating.\n\nHowever, if you end up at a rural school, what I've observed is that everyone either ends up commuting, dating others affiliated with the school, or just staying single. Dating traditional, undergraduates is still pretty much verboten, but you will hear occasional stories of someone dating a non-traditional undergraduate although it is rare.  The biggest issue is that there just aren't that many people to actually go on dates with - if dating is a numbers game, then it's easy to exhaust the number if you are looking for someone with a similar background.",
