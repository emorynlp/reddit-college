  "text": "I work in non-fiction book publishing and I am thinking of making the move to academic publishing (journals). Curious to hear thoughts/opinions from the academic community regarding publishing with Wiley.\n\nDid you have a good experience with your publishing team? Do you consider them to be a reputable and ideal publisher? What is your opinion on their open access publishing model?\n\nI'm really passionate about furthering academic research and finding readership for excellent content, and I only want to work for a company that shares my own values. So far, I think Wiley looks like an excellent place to work for, but I'd love to hear what the academic community thinks.",

          "text": "Should clarify - I am talking about journals publishing, not book publishing! Unfortunately, the University Press publications severely underpay their staff and don't have great resourcing. I interviewed at OUP once but turned them down as they were offering me a salary 20k lower than what it should be. It's not a sustainable pathway for mid-level career professionals who have a family to look after.\n\nCurious to hear more about your thoughts on how they represent what is 'wrong' with academic publishing. I'm new to the world having been in non-fiction/trade publishing, so still learning about all the debates/discussions going on in the academic world.",
