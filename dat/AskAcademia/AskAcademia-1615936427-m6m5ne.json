  "text": "I've been using Scopus to compare publication records of academics in my field who have received early career grants to get an idea of what I should be aiming for. In doing this I've noticed that most people have a similar number of publications - usually 1-2 first author papers per year, plus a more variable number of co-authored papers further down the author list. \n\nHowever, there are some people who are comparably prolific, publishing upwards of 4 first-author publications a year multiple times in the first 5 years of their career (highest I've seen is 7 in one year), usually alongside many more co-authored papers. These authors are publishing in reputable journals with solid citations so they aren't just targeting easier journals.\n\nI've noticed that this usually occurs when the authors sticks closely to the same topic, sometimes even the same dataset (cohort studies in public health/psychology/psychiatry), or studies of different cohorts testing the same/similar research question.\n\nI'm curious about some less obvious differences that might be present. Writing on the same topic/data over and over of course is going to make writing faster and reduce time spent collecting data, but I don't think it's the whole story. I assume there must be other contextual factors at play, as well some differences in how these authors work.\n\nIf you are someone with a lot of first-author publications (in a field where that matters) compared to your peers, or you know someone like this, what do you think allows them to publish twice as much as their peers?",

He had his own institute when I knew him, with loads of contracts with companies that provided data in return for consultation and money to pay an army of research assistants and students (he was in marketing). He worked a lot, and his wife worked in the same institute.",

And if coming up with new ideas is your issue, then find someone who is good at it and be a closer so that they want to work with you. I know a lot of people who over time start publishing with similar names, and it\u2019s usually because they develop specific roles within the research process that works well for them.\n\nOne of my old professors, for example, didn\u2019t own any statistical programs on his computer. Yet he put out 5ish stats-heavy pubs a year. How? He worked with 2 other people who were both amazing with stats so he focused on the ideas, framing, and writing of the papers. All his solo papers were more theoretical or historical, with basically no statistical analysis. But it worked for him.",

          "text": "What amount of \u201cunique\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d research goes into this though? I would argue strongly that nobody can publish \u201c100 books in their life time\u201d or \u201c20 articles a year\u201d of unique or original research, no matter how few kids they have, or how many \u201cjust write four pages a day\u201d mantras they hand out to new academics. \n\nNot that publications that aren\u2019t exclusively unique or original research lack value, but this is a key distinction here. A lot of people who get published often are heavily recycling / reframing existing research and submitting for publication. Don\u2019t believe me, simply follow the breadcrumbs of your favourite academic and read every paper they\u2019ve published in the past 5 years. \n\nFurther, late career scholars are often heavily incorporated within research networks that ASK you to publish a contribution in an edited volume / special issue with little oversight. This can help to pad your CV, where one or two unique articles a year can be supplemented with one or two summaries / reframings for the purpose of the volume. \n\nI think the above and the quantity/quality aspect is an important dimension to recognize when assessing how much someone publishes. A lot of the other comments seem to correlate publishing rates with a capacity to \u201cwork harder\u201d (more hours, more disciplinary writing techniques, less social life), but often it\u2019s \u201cwork smarter\u201d (reframing and collaboration with networks). \n\nIn some fields (think lengthy field research), it would be absurd to imagine publishing a book every year, let alone multiple.",

                  "text": "I think I left out recommendations for OP. Lol. \n\n1. Focus during your early career on establishing good research skills, and pushing forward unique and original research as much as you can. Develop your niche. Develop your angle. Get an overview of the land that you wish to contribute to.\n\n2. Use #1 to get engaged in as many productive research networks in your field as you can. Your unique and original contribution will establish your \u201cniche\u201d in an already oversaturated market for publications, and allow you to \u201cwork your way in\u201d as the expert on \u201cx\u201d from position \u201cy\u201d.\n\n3. Publish your unique and original research in leading journals / in book format. Depending on the field, this can be through co-authored or solo authored publications. In my field (a social science with solo publication gold standard), aim for 1-2 high-tier articles PER YEAR in an industry leading journal of unique and original research. \n\n4. Publish summaries, reworkings, clever reframings, deeper investigations of a concept, experimental ideas in anything granted to you via your networks (edited volumes, special issues, reviews). If possible, try to take one of the above articles in #3 and publish 1-2 variants of it in top-tier or second-tier journals PER YEAR. Take chances on developing new directions here.\n\n5. Learn time management early. Do not waste time on projects that have no output to developing your CV, even if you think it\u2019ll benefit you \u201cintellectually\u201d. This, sadly, might include extra curricular activities like teaching, administration, mentoring (and being good at these things). Spend your time exclusively on research and writing where possible. Aggressively resist anything else. This is far less realistic for some than others. \n\nIn the end (and especially in relation to #5), academia has been completely stripped down to market fundamentals. If you want to be a prolific thinker who writes one magnum opus in their life and becomes revered for their brilliance, don\u2019t count on tenure (or at least wait until you\u2019re already fully tenured to pursue this dream). \n\nPublish or perish is a sad reality, and for all the benefits of an over saturated market, it is very difficult to sit on something for a long time and not have someone beat you to the punch. There are very few unique or new ideas out there. This can be both DEPRESSING and LIBERATING in the context of publishing. On the latter, I often see the EXACT argument and evidence presented in my field by three to five different authors with only very slight variations of argument. In the same journals. It\u2019s the nature of peer review and the sheer size of information out there.\n\nHopefully the above will help a bit in terms of contextualizing how things work at least in my field. Or perhaps, depending on where you are in your career, at the least revealing a little bit of the depressing burden it is for early-career scholars to overcome in today\u2019s market.",

                          "text": "I would just think of publishing as a way to build on your thoughts, and share those thoughts, rather than a complete interrogation of a new and novel issue.\n\nThis is counterintuitive (and perhaps impossible in some fields like sciences I\u2019m not sure), because publishers like to say they only publish new and innovative research. But the standard for innovation is TRULY baby steps. \n\nAn example (not related directly to my research):\n\nSay you\u2019ve done field research to determine whether level of education / prestige of institutional training influences perceptions of class in government officials.  \n\nI.e. does a Harvard graduate in law have bias in their policymaking that favours the upper class? Is this statistically different than those in government who graduated from a lower or mid-tier university? \n\nYour first publication is on the results of your study and the data therein with preliminary directions for future research.\n\nYour second publication is applying a theory to understanding this data. You outline the use of the theory and it\u2019s previous manifestations, then you rehash the findings from your previous data to prove / add weight to this theory. Or, depending on your epistemology/ontology, you use this theory to interpret the meaning of this data. \n\nYour third publication may be in an edited volume or special issue where you contextualize your findings from #1 and #2 within broader developments in your sub discipline. Weaknesses in dominant theory, etc. This is more a commentary of how your research relates to the field.\n\nYour fourth paper can use the data to compare against other data, or to go deeper. I.e. we compared state government officials in Utah vs. New York. Or, between Canada and US. Then make some preliminary suggestions about why the results vary / are similar. \n\nYour fifth paper expands on these preliminary suggestions and applies your previous theory in paper 2 to the issue. \n\nYour sixth paper takes a chance on a novel theoretical approach or dimension you\u2019ve wanted to explore regarding that issue (now is your time to use Foucault!). \n\nThe cycle continues - you think of a new idea or you just make a career taking \u201cbaby steps\u201d on your previous research. \n\nIn the end we ALL want our research to be the paper that blows everyone out of the water or radically changes the direction of the field. But truth be told, even the most cited papers are just \u201cbaby steps\u201d on other people\u2019s work. Sometimes it\u2019s the clarity in language that makes them popular, sometimes it\u2019s simply the title, other times it just becomes \u201cviral\u201d for no reason at all. Chasing being viral IMHO is less of a chance at becoming \u201cprolific\u201d than simply just writing and writing until one of your pieces stick. \n\nWorst case scenario, a few people appreciate what you\u2019ve done in your life time but you have a good job doing what you love at a decent university. Best case scenario, you use these baby steps to build a community and get flooded with amazing ideas to contribute to projects you dreamed you\u2019d be working on.",

I like to think of my projects in terms of trilogies of interrelated articles, which are vehicles to communicate new information and perspectives while the longer-term project is ongoing. Associating myself with European and East Asian grant-funded research projects has also helped, since those often have publication requirements, which less to articles in special issues, edited volume chapters, etc.\n\nAlso, colleagues and I (at a poor institution where we had to push extra hard to get external funding and a chance to move) used to talk about the \u201cminimum publishable unit\u201d (MPU). An MPU roughly represents the amount of data and analysis necessary to make a valuable contribution to the field, such that it would be publishable as a journal article roughly 6,000-10,000 words in length. Thinking in terms of MPUs helped us restrain our natural tendency to put too much information into an article, and pushed us instead to streamline our writing and target a specific audience.\n\nFor example: If an article draft is 12,000 words and covers two related topics... maybe that\u2019s actually 2 MPUs, and ought to be divided into two articles, so the ideas have space to breathe.\n\nIf a draft uses three methodologies to examine one subject... could it be 3 MPUs, each of which ought to go to a different journal? Could each part be fleshed out? If not, maybe it\u2019s just 1 MPU.\n\n4-6 MPUs, of course, would be a book. 1-2 of those MPUs could be published separately as articles earlier on.\n\nThe idea isn\u2019t to cheapen our work, but to avoid the compulsion to say everything in one massive super-article, and instead sharpen our arguments and speak to different audiences. I\u2019ve seen senior European academics in my field do something similar.",

The view is that you're trying to artificially inflate your publication list when it'd actually makes sense to have all of it combined into one paper. Sliced papers often read like the authors were trying to pad it out to the required length precisely because their exploration of y was short and they only looked \"a little\" at z.",

Footnotes were like mini-articles in themselves, rushing to cover a whole topic in one cramped yet still overlong paragraph. The long footnotes are out of style now, but plenty of articles still append thousands of words of tangentially related material for the sake of \u201ccoverage.\u201d I think this tendency basically comes from the old Orientalist desire to write the \u201cdefinitive work\u201d on every topic.\n\nWhile there are salami-slicers in the field (I\u2019m thinking of one scholar who keeps recycling the same paragraph...), the new tendency seems to be to allow the material enough room to breathe, and to publish not the \u201cdefinitive work,\u201d but another step in an ongoing discourse.

Here are a few things I try to keep in mind: \n\n1. Pick projects that are important enough that even middling results yield papers. \n\n2. Know when to wrap up a project into a paper (I.e. don\u2019t do too many experiments). Once each of the important figures are in place, start writing immediately and finish writing in 3-4 days. \n\n3. Say \u201cno\u201d to extraneous, non-productive tasks within the university. \n\n4. Work HARD for the 9 hours you\u2019re at work (no internet, no coffee breaks, no colleague gossip, short lunch), and try not to think about work the rest of the time (nights and weekends). \n\n5. WRITE. Just write. Stop talking about writing. Stop thinking about writing. Just write. And love it. \n\n6. Don\u2019t vomit words onto paper. Think as you write, so that what you\u2019re writing can be the first of three drafts (the third ready for publication).",

              "text": "Not who you're asking, but it seems like prolific authors I've found also tended to get more citations per paper than average authors. It doesn't seem to be the case that more publications = lower quality, at least when using citations as a metric.\n\nActually, one of the prolific authors I've found is someone who's a co-author on a lot of my lab's work so I've read a fair amount of her research. I hate her methods, I think there are huge limitations in her designs (a huge bummer since she designed a bunch of the studies I'm analysing data for and writing up). But for some reason, reviewers just don't seem to notice or care. Maybe it's because she's published so much and can cite her own methods being used previously that reviewers are less critical of it. But it doesn't seem to explain why she often gets over 100 citations on her first-author publications. I feel like reputation must have a role to play - people recognise her name and become more likely to cite her work. She's pretty well networked as well, which might also help explain it. \n\nAnother outstanding author I've come across has more publications in Alzheimer's and Dementia than any other journal - A&D has an impact factor of 17. In 2020 she had 7 publications in that journal alone and she was lead author on 4 of them. Either reviewers are biased towards her, or she has a serious knack for research design and writing. Not familiar enough with the field to assess that myself.",

They collaborate a lot but also get exposed to a lot of ideas that appears to spark inspiration or debate. \n\nLastly, some scholars seem to lack basic organizational skills and that can create a gap in output between scholars.

Several times those notes naturally lead to a short paper that could be published. My record there was a paper that got from earliest notes to accepted manuscript in about a month.\n\nThe other important thing is that the perfect is the enemy of the good. Looking at some of my colleagues who are excellent mathematicians, but often we would be discussing ideas or results that they had never bothered to write up, because they didn't feel it was interesting enough or complete enough of a story to bother publishing.\n\nThe other other important thing is to not put too much crap in a single publication. The goal of an article is to communicatie new ideas and results, but the longer the article is, the less likely people are to read it in its entirety. So longer papers naturally succeed less at communicating the results.\n\nIt also helps that I quite like writing and finding the right way to communicate a new result or convince the reader that what I did is interesting to them.",

Which makes  sense, it takes an awful lot of time to become an expert in any field, and once researchers discover the magic formula, they will stick to it to produce, often times this implies changing a small parameter or applying the same methodology to endless case studies, or you name it.  This creates an overload in the literature. Who will have time to read all of these mildly different publications?  Further, what is considered 'valuable contributions' is off. A failed experiment would never get published, but would actually provide insight to other peers on what route not to explore.

      "text": "My former PI works in a hot field (structural biology) and over the course of his 25 years he has developed an instinct for publishing the least amount of data required to sell a story. As a result, he has tons of unpublished data that is essentially held in reserve. About once or twice a year, another lab will publish something adjacent to his work and he will very quickly locate some old unpublished data of interest, write up a communication or response, and send it out. It helps that many of his students, including myself, have entire thesis chapters sitting unpublished that could suddenly become relevant given new findings. His voracious appetite for literature, combined with his encyclopedic memory for the work of his previous students, puts him in a position where he is current with the field without asking his students to put in the hours implied by the lab bibliography.\n\nHere's the thing: the more current/timely a research topic is, the more likely reviewers will tolerate lower-than-normal quality data. Therefore, the data might be noisy or visually unimpressive because they are old, but if you move fast enough then the quality can be explained away by stating that \"this is urgent and needs to be published ASAP, we don't have time to be perfect\". Additionally, I get the impression that communication journals encourage this kind of responsive research as it is more widely cited than research that is more deliberate, but isolated from the broader scientific discourse.\n\n**TLDR** Sell stories, not data. Save data whenever possible because it might be useful later.",

I don't mean offence, just somewhat puzzled how on multiple threads now the most obvious answer to me is frequently not even mentioned. And the most popular answers have a texbook-like quality to them - like they sound right on paper, but only to a person with no actual first-hand experience. \n\nTo your question OP, most of my peers who have published prolifically have done so largely through **salami-slicing** the hell out of their work. You kind of picked up on it when you mentioned how their papers examine variations on the same-ish research question, often using the same datasets. \n\nI work in an area of applied economics where this is very easy to do. And if you do it smartly, you can still get each paper published in a top-tier journal. However, it does carry a reputation and impact cost. \n\nFirst, each piece of work can seem very incremental and marginal. Had they combined 2 or 3 papers into one solid paper, the punch would have been more impactful and satisfying. While the total citations may be higher from the multiple papers, the reputation of the work has in my experience usually been diminished.\n\nSecond, you could blame it on petty jealousy, but nobody likes a salami-slicer. There are literally some people in my field whose name you cannot mention at a conference without someone calling them out on their tactics. One such colleague was referred to as a 'bottom feeder' by one of the founding fathers and preeminent scholars of my field. Ouch! I genuinely hope it never gets to my colleague.",

      "text": "Within the same field, going from a high-productivity lab/mindset to a low-productivity lab/mindset is excruciating.  I will try to summarize as much as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Obviously I am striking a nerve here with people, but think about that if you're struggling with productivity.  Maybe some of the things you really believe in are not as important as you think and are holding you back.  Worth a thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently this question was a trigger for me.  I apologize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMindset of low-productivity labs:\n\n* The mindset is completely different.  There is so much questioning.  So much second-guessing.  So much *agonizing*.  So much TALKING.  And TALKING.  Oh, the talking.\n* Meetings.  Meetings.  Good lord.  More talking.  High productivity people do not TALK about doing things.  They just DO them.\n* Here's an example.  Someone had a reviewer comment about gender versus sex.  A single comment.  Came up at **2 separate meetings**.  These meetings had to be a month apart.  Seriously?  This is a 15-minute Google search at worst.  **Figure it out.**  You don't need hand-holding or to talk to people.  Just **get it done**.  For the love of God.  This is what happens when advisors hand-hold too much during a PhD.  People don't know how to just **figure shit out**.\n* \"Let's get a committee of 5 people together to work on this.\"  Why?  So we can **talk** about it more?  Jesus.  No.  **One person**.  One person who **makes decisions** and gets things done.  Stop the \"group work\".  Example: the lead author writes 80% of the paper, writing down questions as they go.  Once that is done, they send all the questions and the draft out at once.\n* Productive people have a \"ask forgiveness\" instead of an \"ask permission\" mindset.  Productive people are comfortable **making decisions** **despite incomplete information**.  Productive people understand that **getting things done** is far more important than getting things perfect.  Do problems come up sometimes?  Sure.  But in the meantime, they've gotten an R01 and just get a slap on the wrist.\n* Set boundaries.  Your writing time should be protected.  You don't let anyone - even the chair - infringe on that.  Because at the end of the year, the chair will judge you for the publications you do and don't have, not how available you were for meetings.  Block it off on your calendar.  A minimum of an hour a day, ideally first thing.  Nothing is more important.  You have to shift your mind from the idea that \"the chair will like me if I'm obedient and do what he asks\" to \"my chair is not thinking about how his requests infringe on my time, and I need to protect it.  The chair will judge me first and foremost on my productivity, not whether I finished the strategic planning x, y, z BS on an arbitrary  due date.\"\n* Think carefully about productivity.  How can you write a single IRB and get multiple studies?  How can you get other people to collect data for you (medical record databases are awesome if relevant to your field).\n* Learn how to delegate.  \"Oh, I don't have time to teach.\"  \"I need to do it myself, they don't know what they're doing.\"  So let me guess: you asked someone to work on it, expected a completed first draft without feedback, then got pissed and fixed it yourself?  No.  Have them come to you.  Look at it together, less than 20 minutes.  Meet again the next week.  Same deal.  You need to learn to leverage your time.  It is 10x faster to write when you have something to start with than to start from scratch.\n* This is maybe less relevant for a first-year, but once you start getting grants: Grad students and post-docs are expensive, distracted by too many things, and transient.  Think about hiring someone with a PhD, maybe someone who is a stay-at-home mom working part-time.  Someone who works from home that does lit reviews for you, makes powerpoints for you, drafts letters for you, starts your reviews for you so you only need to do a quick read through, formats your papers and submits them to journals.  You just need to do finishing touches.  Get time for that person in every grant you write.  Keep that person around for as many years as you can.\n* A lot of people who are less productive talk a lot about \"quality over quantity.\"  I agree with them.  But they're missing the point.  They're not producing much of either.\n* Don't be weird.  I've seen a lot of people who get hung up on authorship.  It costs you nothing to add an author.  Stop being petty and weird.  Weirdo.\n* There is a lot of conversation about teaching, posturing about teaching, but at the end of the day - I don't see a huge difference in the *quality* of teaching.  People have students coming to office hours on a regular basis.  I hate to say this, but: if you have students constantly coming to office hours to clarify lecture, there's a problem with lecture.  You are not breaking down the complicated concepts well.  You are either going too fast, cramming too much into each class period, over complicated things - or something.  Figure it out.  You're going wrong somewhere.  My teaching reviews were consistently among the highest.  Students came to me for help on other peoples' classes.\n* There's this idea that if people just notice how much you are \"doing for everyone,\" it will be appreciated.  Like getting food or plants or decorating common spaces.  Serving on endless committees.  Getting \"important\" positions on committees.  No.  If you're on more than one committee, you're going wrong somewhere.  No matter what a chair tells you, no one cares about the committee work.  No one cares about how you \"worked so hard\" fixing the problem in the department or organizing that cabinet no-one else would or whatever.  People care about the fact that you kept your head down and, at the end of the year, published papers.  Service is not important.  Service is not important.  **Service is not important**.  It is great, maybe fulfilling, wonderful.  But it is not important.  Ever.  Stop taking work time to do service.  It is an extracurricular activity and that is it.  Period.  I do not care what your tenure guidelines say.  No one cares.  (\u201cBut I helped draft the schools strategic plan!\u201d  Whoodie-fuckin-do.  The only people who care about the strategic plan are administrators.  Strategic plans don\u2019t change the focus on grants and papers.  How many publications did you get this year?). Trust me, I learned this myself the hard way.\n* Think long-term.  It is not about this publication.  It is about getting a backlog of 10 publications, then 20, until ultimately you become the person in the field.  It is about taking a deep breath, not freaking out over this paper, but instead just publish, publish, publish.\n* I apologize, because I can't write much more now as I actually have to work (be productive!) and this has turned into a treatise.  Hopefully it helps someone.",

          "text": "More:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's some teaching tips:**  \n\n* The number one thing that students care about is clear expectations.  They HATE surprises.  They HATE changes.  It is better for you to spread out content and be on-schedule than to try to cram things in and constantly moving things around on your syllabus.  I don't care what your noble intention is in trying to cover all the content. **That's just disorganized, and it will come out on your evals**.  Do less.  It is ok.\n* One of the best things you can do for course evals is simply remind students, multiple times, of what is coming up next week, or the week after, at the beginning of each class.  And make sure that what you cover in lecture is what you test on.  Don't expect students to keep your class at the forefront of their mind all the time.\n* You don't assign an end-of-term paper that you grade all at once.  You don't assign a cumulative assessment that has never been evaluated in any other format.  Do you want junk?  That's how you get junk.  And trust me, whatever you write will not be looked at.\n* For written assignments, if you find the same thing happening again and again, say so, then stop correcting it.  You can just underline it each time it happens again.\n* Have a two-version turn in policy.  What?  Isn't that more grading?  No!  Ironically, this is a lot easier.  Telling students that as long as they put effort in the first time, you will send it back so they can revise for an A not only makes them happier, but they actually learn and read from the comments, and future assignments are much better.  This is especially great for labs.  Plus, trust me, it is MUCH harder to grade a C paper than an A paper!  Tell them what's wrong, send it right back.  I like to do this electronically, getting it back to them within a day or two,  using a PDF editor on a tablet so I can just write wherever on the paper.\n* You have the students submit and grade things in smaller chunks, using the feedback to make the next section better.  Hey, you even use class time to go from one group to the next, working with them, getting to know them, and grading what they've worked on while other groups meet.  Because face-to-face feedback is the best, most valuable feedback.  If this gives you a panic attack about wasting class time, you are in the mindset of cramming info into students instead of fostering real knowledge and comprehension.\n* Do not expect modern students, many of whom are first generation and working full-time or doing sports or whatever, to find time outside of class to meet with you.  You also don't expect them to find common time outside of class to meet.  If you expect that, you'll get one who writes the intro, one who writes the second section...\n* Minimize written grading.  You can make multiple choice questions into critical thinking questions through case study-type scenarios.\n* Do student presentations, because you're not taking extra time outside of class to grade.  Space them out across the semester.  You don't always have to be the expert in the room.\n* You get your entire class (powerpoint presentations, assignments, assessments, exams) prepped and posted online *before* the semester begins. You do not spend any time during the semester on class prep.  Yes, it is possible.  Just get it done.\n* You do NOT re-prep lectures every year.  Any re-prep you need to do is done after you finish teaching class that week, because that is when changes needed are fresh.  You do not obsess about keeping things cutting-edge for undergrad classes.  If things are cutting edge, you're probably not focusing on breaking down the most important central concepts they need to know.  Stop focusing on minutiae.  \n* You have smaller, more frequent online assessments (think each week) that are automatically graded.  These are posted at the beginning of the semester.\n* You do simple midterm evaluations and make changes based on them. \n* You do NOT obsess over a single comment a single student made in course evals and redo your entire course based on it.  \n* You do not teach different courses year to year.  Have boundaries and reinforce them.\n* Don't come in with a distrustful, adversarial attitude.  I've seen so many conflicts stem from an instructor just not TALKING to students.  If a student needs an extension, get over it.  Life happens.  It isn't personal.  There was a pseudo-famous case where an instructor \"caught\" a whole class \"cheating\".  The truth of the matter was that they used published online materials to prepare.  The teacher had reused the textbook's online materials verbatim, so was pissed when everyone got the same answers.  Did he ask the students?  No.  He just walked in and started yelling.  If you're yelling at students, the problem is not with them.",

They have been very successful in finding research teams to join, have their name on articles and maybe do some writing. In the 13 years I have known them, I have never seen them analyze data. They're also not strong in theory, so all they do, really, is leech of research teams or their students.",

Maybe 1 paper a year on that metric. Which is why I focused on first-author publications when comparing research outputs.",

              "text": "I think what I meant to say is, some authors are very prolific because of their colleagues. The people I know with tons of papers, contribute very little to each one and are mainly just listed on grants. \n\nThe prof I was referring to in my previous comment has never done their own analyzes, even in grad school. They joined a research group early on and latched on (it helped that this person was older when they did a PhD, so seemed more competent than a young PhD student). Even their students have said they were useless.\n\nMeasuring someone based on their publications is really weird to me. I think academia should focus on quality over quantity \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

      "text": "I think you describe it in you post.\nMost prolific authors are able to expand their skills/work to other fields. Either by expanding a method to other fields/analysis. \nEither by working very hard, having good social skills/diplomatic, looking a bit more beyond their own topic or being lucky they are able to work on more projects fast.\n\nAnother skill I believe is to know when to cut your losses and move forward with another project is something doesn't work.\nBy working in a large variety of fields they are then also able to see new opportunities.\n\nOf course everything is multivariable and things like mentorship and funding also help.",
