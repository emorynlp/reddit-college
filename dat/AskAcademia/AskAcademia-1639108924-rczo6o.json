  "title:": "What an excellent graduate student for new opportunities",
  "text": "I am asking if there's a distinguishing feature that would make a graduate student be more desirable for a post doc, new research opportunities, lab positions, grants, etc. \\[Mostly about Engineering/Physics/Chem research areas\\]\n\nOf course, we have the usual high GPA, several research opportunities/project/publication from their undergrad and graduate years, coming from a top-ranked university for their field, etc.. But what else? \n\nSome that I can think off the top of my head includes connections, recommendation from collegue/PI, technical skills... \n\nAny other qualities? (i.e. soft skills, leadership, etc?)",

      "text": "As you mentioned, strong letters of recommendation matter a whole lot.\n\nBeing able to competently talk about research is also really important. I've encountered applicants who look great on paper (lots of research experience, lots of publications) who struggled to talk about their research or relate it to other research that is relevant. That's a red flag.",

      "text": "I agree.  Good letters are essential, but those plus grades and test scores only get you in the door.\n\n\nIn your interview, my opinion is that you need to:\n\n- talk about the field with clarity\n\n- be enthusiastic about the field\n\n- be civil to everyone you come in contact with\n\n- know what the interviewer is asking\n\n- be honest, and avoid the b.s. you think they want to hear.\n\n- be able to describe any published work you did in one sentence that anyone would understand, and state it's value to the field on another sentence.\n\n- be assertive and humble at the same time.  You're not going to be the best ever, but you're going to be as good as the people you are interviewing with.",
