  "title:": "Leave Academia at 30?",
  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI am writing here because I feel confused and I am currently searching for some advice.\n\nI am 30 years old, I live in europe and I graduated as a medical doctor and got a PhD in Neuroscience. During these years I've been focusing on the physiology of memory and Alzheimer's Disease. I had the opportunity to learn a lot focusing on various electrophysiological techniques (recording of neuronal activity), 3D design and modelling, python, and various research techniques. I also spent some time abroad (1 year) in an Ivy league university in the US. I've got a good record of publications, got some prices, and had the chance to share my results in many international meetings.\n\nRight now, I'm doing my post-doc, but I feel that this is not my path. I am gradually loosing my interest toward research also due to some personal bad experiences. My year in US was inconclusive and had a really bad experience with my boss there.\n\nPeople keep telling me that at this age I can do whatever I want, but the truth is that I feel like I have to get out of my comfort zone and try something new, but I really don't know how to proceed. I like science and technology, and I think that I could do more, but at the moment I feel like it is impossible to get out of Academia (and at the same time staying in it). I have been looking for various job opportunities, but I have the feeling that I am useless out of my field or sometimes overqualified to certain positions. To make some context I am trying to consider jobs that are reasonably close to what I have done until now.\n\nWhat I feel i could try to do is:\n\n* going back to MD path and get a residency in Neurology/psychiatry or public health (I have some experience in handling data and it seems reasonable)\n* move out from my country and try other research paths\n* try to get into industry business. I am not so convinced about pharmaceutical companies because I fear that I will end up doing exactly the same stuff I do now and feel miserable again. Therefore, I have looked into emerging companies that are specialized in brain machine interfaces etc.\n\nMy problem is that whatever I think to approach gives me the feeling that I could not do it. I have about one year of contract and I am trying to improve my programming skills and keep myself updated on medicine (this works fine because among my duties I have to teach physiology to MD students and that helps me being up to date).\n\nBut the truth is that I feel I am lost and have no idea how to proceed. I am afraid of making wrong life choices and feel unable to really commit and hold into something.\n\nI don't know if any of you have a similar feeling or have been in a similar situation, but all kinds of feedback are welcome.\n\nWhoever read this, thank you for your time in reading my story.",

It\u2019s an exciting time to be doing research but also very uncomfortable because you are inevitably part of the change you want to study. I\u2019m wondering if losing interest in research comes from the instability you feel in the world?\n\nIf that\u2019s the case then I don\u2019t think much will change by changing your career. It sounds like you have a wonderful family and a partner so perhaps it\u2019s time to look within and do some soul searching? Meditate? Go hiking? Go diving? Write a diary?

I am thinking about career change also to shake my context and get out of my comfort zone trying to find new challenges that might fuel my curiosity. I have the luck to have a good family situation and an outstanding partner who always supports me and tells me when I'm going off the rails. I've been to therapy and that helped clarify some things for me like realizing that I am not my job and my success/unsuccess in work is not a good indicator of my mental health. The latter might seem obvious but working in a very competitive field can easily get you off the track. I will definitely try some hiking and meditation. I was an amateur rock climber before, and lost some contact with nature and mountains after I quit due to an injury. You made me think how much I miss the contact with nature and simple things sometimes. Thanks for the feedback!",

I actually did it for different reasons, I wanted to get a better insight about myself, but as you can imagine, we also ended up in the analysis of my future career choices. It helped me realize that I was much more happy trying to do my work the best I can rather than trying to become a superstar in my field. It was not a delusional thought in which i set my goals to become a leading scientist or win the nobel prize, tough. It was more of a mindset pushing me to never be happy and underestimate my achievements. That was in a phase of my life in which I was not good either at managing relationships in general (things got better lately). After some counseling I got to the point in which I can enjoy doing my work as best as I can, and I try to induce myself noticing and acknowledging when I reach a personal achievement even if it is really small. Probably this also helped me come to the conclusion that this might not be my path and I have to permit myself to explore other options.\n\nGoing back to the topic, it is now clear to me that I cannot neither control or predict the socioeconomic context and base my choices solely on these factors (even if it is important to keep in mind that they exist). Generally speaking I have also valued academia over industry, but it was tough to really realize how naive I was when ignoring that academy is also a business. One of my thoughts is that I probably need to put myself on foreign and unknown grounds to see how i feel doing different stuff.\n\nHowever, I will probably go back to my therapist and try to elaborate these thoughts with him! \n\nThanks for your feedback, I really appreciated it.",

For me it wasn't that I didn't love Academia, it was just that there were literally no options in my field and I was tired of being treated like garbage. My only other option would have been to stay and become an adjunct or else to take on temporary roles. Leaving was terrifying, but I don't regret it for a minute. It's like pulling a Band-Aid off, it hurts for a bit but then you're glad you did it.\n\nIn terms of what you will end up doing with your life, I would say keep an open mind. Try to meet as many interesting people as you can and ask them about what they do, that's what helped me to find my way into working for a think tank, then public policy, then Consulting. It's been a heck of an adventure, and I meet phds all the time who are definitely not sorry that they left Academia. They are making more money, having more impact, and way happier.\n\nI wrote a post about leaving academia here https://roostervane.com/regret/ . Good luck on the journey!

              "text": "So everything is crazy right now because of covid. But I'll try to give you some sense of the structure. Bear in mind that this is a perspective from one particular person at one particular lab. This varies lab to lab, especially between the NNSA and non-NNSA labs. It also varies person to person within a lab.\n\nI'm a computational Scientist. (Meaning a domain scientist who specializes in solving problems with computer simulations.) The Labs' finding profile is congressionally mandated and much of the work they do is mandated from above by lawmakers. About 70% is my work is such stuff. Personally I focus on the numerical and algorithms work needed for engineering simulations of real world problems. This work is publishable, but papers are not the primary goal. Meeting \"mission deliverables\" is the goal. Papers are a nice bonus. (That doesn't mean you don't communicate your work. There are also internal reports, talks, conferences, etc., that you can participate in if you want to.) I have a lot of freedom in choosing my projects---the lab does a lot and so there's a lot of opportunity to jump in something different and learn something new. And my funding is essentially guaranteed. I like the flexibility in choosing the work and the immediate positive impact the work can have. After all, there's no profit motive. We're taxpayer funded.\n\nThe other 30% of my time is more basic research with publication as the goal. I chose to seek there opportunities out and maintain these connections. I didn't have to. Many people do nothing but the mission work I described above. There are internal grants and funding mechanisms for this kind of work. The process is competitive, but it's fairly painless compared to NSF, DOE, or NIH funding in the academy. There's typically a call for short pre-proposals, followed by a call for full proposals for those who make the first cut. I like this system because if I get cut early, I didn't invest much.\n\nAs such, I don't teach classes, but I can and do mentor students and postdocs. (This is also a typical recruitment pipeline. Permanent staff were often students or postdocs.) I split my time between that, doing my basic research, and doing my applied, congressionally mandated work.\n\nI find it a really stimulating environment. A big thing I love is that the labs are really interdisciplinary. Mine has over 2,000 PhD scientists doing a huge range of things. And people are encouraged to talk and interact and learn from each other. I haven't found such breadth that's so accessible anywhere else.\n\nI hope this helps!",

I was also depressed and had undiagnosed ADHD. But once I found what I liked, it was very easy to be inspired and work towards it. I will say take an inventory of the things you love to do. And then talk to people who do those sorts of things. Once you find a spark, follow it. Also get rid of old notions and just reframe yourself as someone who is curious and loves to solve problems. These problems can be in any field. You don't have to limit yourself. \n\nI suspect you feel cloistered and maybe slightly burnt out. Take some time to reset and focus on other life areas. Once you're in a good mindset, think openly about what makes you happy at work. And what makes you unhappy.",

It's a perfectly normal and valid move. There are a lot of different options for those leaving academia, but ultimately it comes down to you, your reasons for leaving and what skills you can transfer to another path. For me-- I love my field so much, but hate the academic lifestyle and lack of job stability that comes with it, so I'm going into industry. I spent months and months doing research about what kind of jobs I could transfer my skills to and apply for, while not settling for a job less than than my self-percepted worth. It took a lot of time and a load of notebooks filled with brainstorming and notes, but I finally narrowed it down more than a year and a half after I decided I wanted to leave academia, and it's not at all something that would have been obvious to me at first. Now I am SO excited to start my new career, going from a volcano researcher to material engineer.  I'm not saying it will take you this long to figure it out, but if you have the time and patience, and if you keep brainstorming and researching your options, you will find a good fit. You have a great skillset and I'm sure there are lots of options out there for you! Don't lose hope!",
