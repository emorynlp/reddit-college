      "text": "Hello there!\n\nResearch is a matter of momentum (or inertia if you will), topics will come to you by themselves while you keep reading literature. You can't find a topic by sitting on a desk and asking yourself what to write. If you ask your mentor, you'll probably end up with a topic you aren't really curious about (and believe me, curiosity is very important for a PHD thesis!).\n\nThink about a general topic in your area, even an abstract one. Start to read without a real purpose, just read what you want to read. If something catches your attention, go deeper. Rinse and repeat. Keep doing this and you'll have *more than one* topic in no time and these will not be just any topics, these will be the ones that keep you interested!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the hug! :)",

My PhD proposal is based on gaps I identified in an SLR that I conducted.",

I am from a social science background, and my research is around the social institution of marriage and family, and the role of women in those. I did my M.Phil on a topic of my interest, on a fairly new topic that was not explored well in my country. Had some great insights and started reading more on that. \n\nFor my Ph.D. (which was postponed due to Covid) whatever vague idea I had, I just kept writing it down. Then did a review of literature on those broad areas. Started finding papers around that and then Professors who were working on similar lines in their countries. (Approached one of the professors who agreed to supervise me in the UK meanwhile). Read about their work and it kept getting clear what I wanted to do, something which has potential, interests me and I can work enthusiastically on it for a few years. Most importantly that you can have easy access to participants for your research too. \n\nAlso, don't hurry. It took me seven months from the first vague idea to my final research proposal. You will get there. All the best.",

What they want is potential, and to be able to determine where to slot you. Who would you be working with? What time period? What kind of approach? That's more important to them than a specific research topic (that they will expect you to change later) or whether you have identified a gap in the field or whatever. \n\nI would try to figure out: what do you really like researching? _Why_ do you like it?

They are looking for evidence that you are intellectually mature and promising.\n\nMany of the answers here are good for people who are _already in grad school_ but that is a different sort of thing than people who are _looking to get into it_.",

Rather than finding a gap in the literature (just because there's a lacuna doesn't logically mean it needs to be filled), I recommend you find an apparently contradiction or paradox in the field of your interest--this will strengthen the raison d'etre of your paper as well as make your readers invested in what you have to say. A couple of political scientists wrote the [most useful article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41304-017-0130-y#Sec6) I've come across about how to make a puzzle question, but I think their points are valid across many disciplines: \n\n> We propose that the following formula succinctly captures what research puzzles look like: \u2018Why x despite y?\u2019, or \u2018How did x become possible despite y?\u2019 A puzzle thus formulated is admittedly a research question, but one requiring much closer familiarity with the state of the art than a \u2018why x-question\u2019. The researcher considers the phenomenon x puzzling since it happens despite y \u2013 that is, previous knowledge that would seem contradicted by its occurrence.
