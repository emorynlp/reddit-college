  "title:": "How do you organize your notes on papers? Is there a paper organizer that presents notes in a spreadsheet mode, a way to get to longer notes, and a citation manager?",
  "text": "Every time I start writing, I feel upset at the way I've organized my notes on papers. I have a Google spreadsheet where each row is a paper, with **brief** notes in specific columns (e.g. paper topic, what this paper showed that is novel, which part of the paper I've used). I like the spreadsheet because I can easily compare/contrast papers and group papers by moving rows. Supplementing this, I have **longer** notes on individual papers in Obsidian, with links to other notes on papers. It kind of sounds like a computerized version of the library dewey decimal card system to find a book -- although I've never actually even used those cards before.\n\nI use Mendeley as a citation manager. It's easy to cite as I write based on author/title, but not based on my notes in any way. I usually manually tag which section the paper is in on the spreadsheet and then cite in the paper.\n\nHowever, I would love to be able to rearrange stuff while comparing/contrasting and then **just click on** something to get me to my longer notes. I've seen this in [wikipedia articles with tables.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) I feel like someone has already figured this out, and I'm just not finding it.\n\n**TLDR:** How do I integrate my notes into my citations in a way that I can still compare/contrast easily?
