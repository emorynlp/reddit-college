  "text": "I'll be starting my Ph.D. this Fall. I've been lifting all of college, would such a lifestyle still be possible during my Ph.D.? I'd spend about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the gym 4-5 times a week (still do). Do any of you guys lift on the regular while still finishing your responsabilities? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love fitness and its a big part of my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I was in a biology field as well and every lab had its own culture, from \"show up when you want as long as you meet deadlines\" to \"you better be here from 9-5 every day and stay late with weekend work more days/weeks than not\". At the end of the day, none of those labs steadily put out \"better\" or \"more qualified\" grad students beyond the one lab that was doing super hot button research (and was one of the \"do what you want as long as you meet deadlines\"-type labs coincidentally). The ones of us that ended up in professorships and industry came from each of those types of labs.\n\nThere are types of research that absolutely will suck up more of your time: cell cultures, care of live organisms, etc. There are also periods of time where you will work ridiculous hours (for one experiment I worked over 50 hours in three workdays), but there aren't fields where ridiculous hours are across the board required, simply advisors and departments with busy cultures.",

I lifted 5 days a week for 1-1.5 hours the final 3 years of my program once I committed to it, and that was while having 1 kid plus another the last year. I worked out early and was back home by 630-7am. For me a lot of potential distractions and derailers made day or evening lifting hard to stick with, but nobody bothered me at 5am.",

      "text": "Not only can you, this is probably one part of your life when you'll be able to force yourself into a schedule that includes the gym as high of an importance as your work/studies.\n\nWorking full time means you're probably entering the office for some fixed core hours...say 9-5, plus some occasional late nights. Your PhD (supervisor dependent) will have more flexibility. One example I can give you is a former colleague of mine who shared an office with me during our PhD studies - she preferred getting in to the office later to get home later, as she preferred to wake up and spend a few hours listening to the radio or reading books when she was fresh, as opposed to doing that after a long day in the evening. She'd arrive when I was eating my lunch and would stay a few hours after I left. \n\nThere's no reason you couldn't do something similar to ensure you fit in the hours at the gym that you need, as long as your supervisor is ok with it. My old supervisor was ultra-flexible with my studying schedule. He essentially told me \"It's your PhD, it's your project, so come in to your office whenever you feel like it and we'll have a semi-structured routine of a meeting every so often\". I could therefore indulge in other passions either before or after going in to the office, or indeed if I had nothing to do at the weekend I would go in so that I earned a day off midweek.\n\nYou'll find a schedule that fits you. Don't worry.",

I think mainly because in grad school you get a nice combination of having more flexible time, at least compared to having a job (I don\u2019t need to be in the office at 9am exactly), yet you have a bit more of a 9-5ish schedule than college. The trick is to set a consistent routine. My peers who take the \u201cplay it by ear\u201d strategy to working out (and their research working time in general imo) tend to not do it nearly as much. That\u2019s because something can always \u201ccome up\u201d and push gym time out of the way if you don\u2019t prioritize it and make it a part of your weekly routine. \n\nFor me, I work out at the university gym M,W,F at 7:30am. I then shower and change at the gym, making it easy to get into my office  by 9-9:30am by problem. I love the routine!
