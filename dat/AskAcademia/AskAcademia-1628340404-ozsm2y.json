  "text": "Hey there! I am about to finish my MSc in Biology, specializing in Vegetal Ecology and Remote Sensing. Lately I've been interested in pursuing a PhD in Natural Resources or Environmental Sciences. \n\nIs it possible? Or am I \"limited\" to only choosing a PhD in Biology? \n\nThanks in advance! :)",

      "text": "The short answer is no, you're not limited, you can move to an adjacent field.  \n\nThe long and necessary answer is that only *you* can find relevant, reliable answers to this, because only *you* know your specific interests, exact qualifications, and countries you plan to apply in.  You get this information by finding and reading (a) the admission criteria of PhD programs of interest, (b) job ads for PhD positions, and the educational requirements they have, and (c) looking up current students in the PhD programs/groups that appeal to you and seeing their background.",

          "text": "Hey there u/polyphonal! Thank you for your answers, both short and long. \n\nYes, I did my research and found that some universities offer programs with a strong emphasis on remote sensing and environmental change... Currently I am specializing in that as an ecologist, but using some of the tools offered by geospatial/environmental sciences could be useful. I even found more researchers on that area.\n\nThanks again! I will consider it a little more, but now I know it's a possibility.",

      "text": "It's definitely a possibility. I'm a PhD student in environmental science right now. In my research group alone we have students with backgrounds varying from MechE, Physics, Math, Biology, and Earth Science. It's a very interdisciplinary field by construction, so you will have no problem as long as you're a good applicant. You may have to brush up on some skills more than others depending on your background, but that's what coursework is for. Best of luck.",
