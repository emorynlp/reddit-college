  "text": "Hey, all! So, I\u2019ve been really struggling with the foundations of academia and the reality that many profs seemingly only care about their own discoveries and getting their names on another publication. It seems to me that the perception of \u201civory towers\u201d is for real. There isn\u2019t any tangible connection between the work we do, here on campus, and an attempt to relate the data to the general population in\nmeaningful way. I feel this missing component is absolutely critical to furthering our cause in bettering the world. Evidence of this can be seen daily in many people\u2019s resistance to COVID vaccination.\nAnyhow, I guess I should\u2019ve noted that I\u2019m 51 and am not sure I \u201cfit\u201d in the \u201csystem\u201d anymore (or if I ever did). I left a career as a fly fishing outfitter, presumably to give something back to the precious resource. My Master's consists of researching stream restoration with respect to freshwater macroinvertebrates. It\u2019s a shame because I have a tremendous opportunity before me but, the thing is, I don\u2019t care so much about crunching the data as I do the human condition and our degraded environment. I\u2019m wondering if perhaps I should simply focus on how I can relate what I already know about ecology rather that subject myself to the rigors (and stressors) of graduate school, and potential ageism, at this juncture?",

      "text": "It sounds to me like you may be in a MS program while you may be better suited to a MA program\u2014of course, that is if you are wanting to stay. I guess I would just refocus on why you went to grad school in the first place. Why did you want the degree and what are your plans for using it in the future?\n\nI loved grad school (and stream ecology!), but I get where you\u2019re coming from. Several folks in my cohort left due to stress or the realization that they could find  some kind of employment related to their field of interest without finishing the program. Academia is another issue all together. Some places are better then others, but overall the system is not ideal. Publish or perish and funding uber alles are not my friends.",

      "text": "Not a drop out, but after I finish my postdoc I don't want to go back in. I've been overworked, teaching multiple classes in emergency situations, all to not get offered a TT job at the same institution when thr opportunity came about.\n\nYou are right about the applied stuff, and there needs to be some sort of revolution that goes beyond Extension services (for land grants). Im currently a social scientist on am interdisciplinary grant and it's very hard for me to get my ideas and perspectives heard. When we are supposed to be collaborating on projects and papers, they frequently skip them, busy with their own research agenda. We can help apply this stuff, but are frequently positioned as a way to check a box for grant funding and totally ignored in the research process.\n\nAlso, the pay in academia with rising administrative tasks (while reviewing journal articles), it's no longer worth it unless you're from a family with means, especially if you have a lot of outstanding debt. There is some creativity in the consultancy work, but its usually feast/famine with pay and opportunities. I've heard people with strong social connections to people and federal agencies do a decent job of securing multiple contracts, which might be one avenue worth pursuing.",

No matter how you look t it every activist group needs experts you know those people who can crunch the numbers and give a professional and educated opinion. At this point without degree all you can do is go and demonstrate or stuff like that. With your degree you can be the expert that shapes the change. I know academia sucks but I think in your case it\u2019s worth grinding through it.",

The missing link between crunching the data and connecting to the general population in a meaningful way is literally on your own shoulders.  Crunching the data (which you admit is not your thing), is actually the thing that someone is funding one way or another.  If that\u2019s not what you care about enough to fulfill the expectations, you should leave your position.",

      "text": "You, my dude, are 100% correct.\n\nGlad you are making this change sooner rather than later. The longer you linger the more crap is revealed and you really lose faith in humanity and science.\n\nSomeone mentioned it in one of their replies, but academic work does not necessarily need to have intent on application. We usually rely on external private organizations to advance things into practice. In my field, there are very, very few of these organizations which is assuredly why no treatments have made it to humans. No organizations even want to touch my field because there are not enough profit margins to be gained. This leaves an entire population of people suffering until death completely unknowing that nobody is actually trying to move academic findings into real world application. It's sad.\n\nTo put this into perspective, I got killed in a recent grant for \"trying to move too fast\" in my career goals which laid out a step by step process to prepare a treatment for clinical utility. This ding could have been the difference of actually getting funded (the grant was not perfect, but was on the border of a fundable score). Point being, the reviewers made it clear they have no real desire to try to move things forward and care more about academic nonsense than clinical applicability.\n\nI'm doing my part to be one soldier in this battle but the career progress to reach the point of being capable is insurmountably difficult with way more ways to fail than succeed. For me, it's worth it. Science needs change if we want tangible results and I, for one, am willing to endure the abuse of academia to try and be part of that change. It just sucks that the \"game\" 100% needs to be played before I gain enough power and opportunity to make even the smallest influence.",

I don't know a thing about stream restoration, but it sounds expensive to physically get it done? To really make a change most pragmatic thing to do is to get into politics locally and fight for funding, backing it with research data and an action plan for particular case. It is hard path to take but changes happen where money goes.",
