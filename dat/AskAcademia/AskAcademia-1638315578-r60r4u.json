  "text": "Hello! I'm writing a paper on a case that's still pending in the US Supreme Court, but I am struggling to find how to reference the Petitioner and Respondent briefs in APA both in text as well as the full reference. I also cannot find how to cite this Writ of Certiorari.\n\nI've checked perdue owl and other sources but they don't answer this specific question :/\n\nThe case is *Carson v. Makin* if you're wondering.\n\nThank you in advance!",
