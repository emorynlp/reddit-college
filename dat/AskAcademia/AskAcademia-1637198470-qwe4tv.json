  "text": "Does anyone have any recommendations on academic journals that are publishing audio versions of their articles.  I'm using a text to speech app with pdfs of journal articles, but wondering if any journals are being innovative on this front?  Thank you!",

Research scientists almost never just sit down,  and start reading in sequence. \n\nFor most papers is check out the title,  read the abstract if the title looks good,  flip through the figures if the abstract is of interest,  then read any other individual parts of the paper if they are specifically of interest.  \n\nI don't see who the audience is for audiobook versions, when text to speech already exists, and it'd be an expensive endeavour.",

Those of us who want to read an entire paper, but maybe are short on time, and would enjoy listening to the paper during a commute, etc.  It's another avenue to learn information.  I also don't think it would be that expensive if done in house -- which would also provide some quality assurance on audio quality and production.",
