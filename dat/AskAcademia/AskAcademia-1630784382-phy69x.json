  "title:": "Is copying a format plagiarism in thesis?",
  "text": "I'm currently writing my thesis and my supervisor gave me a copy of one of his previous students thesis to use as a guide, who worked on a very similar topic.\n\nMy question relates to the introduction to thesis part, where I discuss the problems I am trying to solve. Basically I discuss the same problems he did (they are very generic to the field and we both worked on the same thing, just addressing the issues in different ways), but completely in my own way. However the format of the discussion is similar. For example:\n\nIntro paragraph to problem:\n\n(1) sub heading discussion of problem 1\n\n(2) sub heading discussion of problem 2\n\n(3) sub heading discussion of problem 3\n\n(4) sub heading discussion of problem 4\n\n(5) sub heading discussion of problem 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it okay to have the same format, even discussing the same problems, if the words are 100% my own? Nothing other than the sub headings are the same. The rest of the thesis has completely different content as I solve the problems in different ways. It is just the formatting that I am wondering about.",
