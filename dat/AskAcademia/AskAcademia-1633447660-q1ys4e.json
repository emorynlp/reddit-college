  "text": "Does anyone know how long it generally takes to get a PhD in physics pedagogy? I want to become a university level physics teacher, but I don\u2019t want to spend 7 years getting my PhD after my bachelors. Someone told me that an education PhD is much faster than physics PhD, but I haven\u2019t found much supporting evidence of this online. TIA.",

I\u2019ve tried googling information about what exactly a pedagogy is, because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard that term, however all I can find online really is a definition saying it\u2019s the practice of teaching and a bunch of other unrelated stuff.",

You can always shift your research focus to science education though once you become a professor (if that's what the university is looking for).",
