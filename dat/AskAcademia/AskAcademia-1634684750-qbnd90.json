  "text": " I feel overwhelmed right now and do not know how I should start networking and what I should focus on outside of classes. People around me are doing a lot of different side projects, but all of them are pretty niche and I don't really feel like I could latch onto them.",

      "text": "It depends a lot on what you're trying to do afterward, but the one big thing I'd suggest is NETWORK. Go to office hours, meet students and professors and anyone else you can find. Those are the people who are going to be super helpful to you in the future, and for the next couple years, you're in the same place and have things to talk about. It's a rare opportunity.",

      "text": "(Assuming you want to go to a doctorate)\n\n* Write one great paper that can function as your writing sample;\n* Make good connections with three professors who can serve as referees;\n* Try to learn skills that would allow you to hit the ground running in a doctoral program (e.g., languages; archival skills; theory).\n\nHome runs are more important than batting average. A bad GPA would be a problem, but a decent GPA with one amazing paper will set you up much better from a super-high GPA where every paper is just quite good.",
