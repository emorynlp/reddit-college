  "text": "Hello r/askacademia! I hope you are all doing well.  I am applying to a PhD program in anthropology, and my prospective advisor has given me the emails of some of her current students so that I can ask them questions about the program. I am a first gen college student, so some of this is very foreign to me. What  are some questions you wished you would have asked when applying to schools? What would you ask a current student in your prospective program? Thank you all!",

Where have previous grad students in that lab ended up\u2014 post docs, industry, academia? \n\nAbout the program:\n(You may need to ask these ones... strategically)\n1. Is the grad student stipend appropriate for the cost of living in the area? Are most students living in apartments or barely scraping by in rented basements with 5 other grad students, etc. \n2. Are the students happy with their medical coverage? Dental? Vision?\n3. Realistically, how long to people take to graduate that program?\n\nMisc. \n1. What are their current research projects?\n2. Is their any social media page for the school you should know about to get a sense of the student body? (Weird question, I know, but my school had a whole Facebook ecosystem where house rentals and roommate requests were posted all the time. Without access to that, it was a pain getting settled).",

Sometimes, students who are directly advised by someone tend to be not-so-candid about their experience, so this kind of information may turn out to be valuable. For example, in my first year, I joined the lab of a faculty whose students said the supervisor can be \"micromanaging/pushy\". But I didn't take it to mean that the supervisor is a complete jerk, which I later discovered to be the case from my own experience. I also later discovered from other people in the department that it is an open secret that this supervisor was a terrible advisor and that many of their students   had switched out of that lab (and eventually, so did I).",

Or do they generally give feedback on their own?\n3. How do they phrase their criticism? Are they polite?\n4. Does the advisor encourage/acknowledge the work of their students?\n5. Does the advisor have any favorites amongst the students? (I never thought this would be an issue until I started working with my first advisor).  \n\n6. How do they react to a student's mistakes or failures (e.g., failure to make progress/to publish/to give a good talk etc.,)?",

Honestly,  your best bet is to be curious, conversational, and open-ended not to come armed with gotcha questions that probe the inner workings of the lab's day-to-day with an eye clearly focussed on how to avoid a bad experience. Remember - you're being interviewed and the PI will ask the grad students what they thought of you too. That PI will want to hear that you seemed pleasant to work with, curious, intelligent, prepared and ready to become a graduate trainee. They won't want to hear that you were hyperfocussed on the negative, that you were awkward, or that you didn't seem to care about the research.The best way to gauge a group is to ask the current grad students (1) what they're working on, (2) what their primary approaches are  (i.e. computational, certain lab techniques, field work, etc) with a follow-up of what kinds of skills you would need to bring or develop in order to be successful within that group, (3) what it was like when they started grad school with a follow-up of any advice to for a newbie like yourself, (4) inquire about how often they meet with the PI and what it's like working for him/her, (5) how much teaching they do, and etc.   \nUse, their hesitation, their positivity/negativity, their insights, and their willingness to engage with you in order to determine if you'll be happy there.",

Do they vouch for you. Do they bring you up in conversations with their peers. Do they introduce you people at conferences, etc etc etc.",
