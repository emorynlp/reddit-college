  "text": "Hello, I work in research as a technician and will be entering grad school soon. Our University has started sending out informational emails about classes potentially moving to online only formats and labs going into \"hibernation\" so the University can close campus. \n\nIf this were to happen, what would be the consequences for labs running time sensitive studies? We use animal models, so it could be a massive waste of funding and well trained animals to have to shutdown. \n\nHas anything like this happened before? What kind of actions (if any) do you think governmental grant issuing agencies and universities would/should take to mitigate the effects of shutdowns on research?",

There will be impact on experiments, but there wouldn't be a complete shut down of essential services unless it was impossible to operate. Good luck OP. I'll be curious to hear what your campus does and how it impacts your work.",

We have a lot of mice with some aging experiments going on for 2+ years already. The administrators are adding myself and another lab member as essential personnel (per our request) to ensure the well being of the animals. It'll be busy for us to take care of the entire lab's mice but we would limit it to only critical tasks.",

It\u2019s an agricultural university, so we do have a large population of research animals.",

Can't freeze them down either since there's no standard protocol that's known to work. If anyone else is in the same boat, I'm curious to hear how you're preparing, and also best of luck to everyone!\n\n\n(really jealous of pure bioinformaticians about now ;-) )",

      "text": "Since human lives are at stake, the authorities won't care about wasting funding and some \"well trained animals\" being out of training/data measurements. I'm 100% sure that a lab shutdown would mean that all experiments pause.  \nI sure hope that essential care for animals will be allowed (feeding, taking care of implants or giving necessary medication) but I am sure that training, data measurements (whatever that means in your field) and so on will be stopped. I am not sure how that would actually work. We were told that authorities might argue that every employee of the same institute potentially had contact with every other employee. Obvious contact points are shared office and lab spaces, but usage of the same canteen, bathrooms or even entries to the building could be used as an argument of why the whole institute might have to be quarantined. If every employee is in quarantine, the question of who actually could build a \"skeleton crew\" is hard to answer.",
