  "title:": "Redrawing from a medical schematic graphic from shutterstock in Thesis",
  "text": "I'm in the process of turning in my thesis in medicine, and I have included schematic depictions of the human heart. I have drawn these myself using Paint.net, however the drawing is based on a schematic depiction of the human heart that I found on shutterstock. I have a shutterstock account, and I have downloaded the license-free picture that my drawing is based upon.\n\nMy question is: Do I need to cite the original source of the drawing that my own drawing used in my thesis is based upon? How would I go about doing this? It seems a bit odd to caption the picture with: \"drawn by me, inspired by \\[original creator, shutterstock URL\\]\n\nThank you in advance, and have a nice day!",
