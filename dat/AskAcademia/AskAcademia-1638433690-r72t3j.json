  "title:": "How Often You Would Look To the University Ranking and GPA while Considering Scholarship/Grant/Admission Application?",
  "text": "I attended several talks from several Professors and Doctors who once chaired admission committees for scholarship, grant, postdoctoral position and/or university admission. They usually said that the biggest moment is to search application that are \"concise, good, well-explained, honest, not overwritten or overclaim and interesting\". Although that already implied \"we only accept the brightest and/or the most diligent worker\", I am curious since they never mentioned the behind-the-scene process, especially when it came to comparing \"the brightest and the most diligent\" applicants.\n\nIn my country, it became a public secret that in the admission of state scholarship, they prioritized those who came from well known university, with higher ranking. So when we attended talks like what I mentioned before, I will admit consciously that there are silent requirement which is \"graduated from recognized, well known, high ranking universities\".\n\nI came from a recognized, legal, accredited university, but with lower ranking, and specialized more in the study of religion, whereas I learnt in the field of Computer Science. I always amuse myself when it came to scholarship applications: If I were the brightest in my class, and the most diligent, hardworking student in my campus, I will be in the lowest class of the most diligent, hardworking student in that university with higher ranking than mine. This thought, however much I disagree with it, always true to my friends who applied for jobs and scholarships. They struggle alone, without any recommendation (since my uni only give one with requirement that the petitioner for recommendation will come back to teach at the uni after they graduated), and participated in countless scholarship bootcamp and seminars, but never get the scholarship.\n\nFurther discussions with them, I got that it caused by the rank of my university. I want to say that this is a lie, but well, it happened .I recognize the amount of work you had, and respect you all with all my heart. I recognize the time you needed to read, understand and judge thousands of applications and the pain you had when you must decide only 5 from 1000 good applications.\n\nIf you already a doctor, or professor and participated in any admission committee, what would you think? And if it is true, then does it means that the future for average student from average who tried to worked hard, will be always eclipsed by the work of more bright students from higher ranking university?",

An A from a highly ranked institution is regarded differently than one from a less highly ranked institution. That\u2019s the reality in graduate school admissions, and anyone who tells you otherwise has likely never served on a graduate admissions committee. At least in mathematics, some of the honors undergraduate courses at top ranked institutions have a reputation for being particularly rigorous, and a strong grade in one of these is far more impressive than a strong grade in a course of unknown rigor. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that this is the only factor in graduate admissions, and that coming from a lower ranked institution automatically means that you won\u2019t get admitted, but there has to be something truly extraordinary in the other parts of your application.\n\nAt the end of the day, given the number of highly qualified applicants to top ranked graduate programs, the admissions committee will be selective, so if the applicant is from a relatively unknown institution, then the letters needs to be glowing, and the grades need to be stellar. Average grades from an average institution, without letters of recommendation from professors, which is the scenario that the OP is presenting, simply does not cut it.",

It sounds like you're suggesting we ignore all the information available to us, LoRs, grades, institutional rank, in favor of the research and personal statement, which is quite possibly the easiest thing to have ghostwritten. Sufficed to say, I think that's unwise, and my colleagues would agree with that. I doubt your PhD alma mater would have admitted a student with middling grades, from a middling school, with middling LoRs, just because of the quality of the research/personal statement.\n\nAt least in mathematics, even well trained undergraduates generally lack the mathematical maturity, breadth, and depth of knowledge to write a sufficiently compelling research statement to ignore all these other factors. Except, of course, typically the only students who are able to write such compelling research statements already have extensive research experience, have excellent grades, taken graduate level courework, and have glowing LoRs, so it's usually the case that this is part of a complete package, as opposed to an outlier that supercedes all other considerations. As a mathematician, I don't need test tube washers, and I am better off having one fewer graduate student in my research group, than having one that doesn't cut the mustard.\n\nDoes your department actually practice the policies that you mention, or is this simply a pipe dream of yours? Also, is your department sufficiently highly ranked that you have more highly qualified applicants, with excellent grades, excellent LoRs, from excellent undergraduate institutions, and excellent research statements than you can handle?",
