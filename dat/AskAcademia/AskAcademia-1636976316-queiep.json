  "text": "Hi all.\n\nI am finishing my PhD soon and want to start looking for postdoc positions. I am struggling to find a good place/website to do so. Sites that I have been looking at so far are linkedIN, [findapostdoc.com](https://findapostdoc.com) and [academicpositions.com](https://academicpositions.com) (the last 2 are in the top google results). \n\nThe problem that I see here is the fact that it all seems incomplete.. I know a few interesting institutes and the vacancies they have I cannot find anywhere else so I am wondering how much other interesting things I am missing. \n\nDoes anyone have a good source where I can have a look or you have other recommendations? In case it is relevant: I am looking mostly in europe for bio-science (Biophysics, Biology, ...) related things.\n\nthanks in advance",
