  "text": "I have already sent an email to the library asking what I can do to reestablish my library privileges. I am currently in the middle of writing a manuscript, and of course I was conducting my literature research using my university\u2019s library system. I graduated with my doctorate in August and just yesterday I found out that my privileges have been removed since I am no longer a current student.\n\nWhat in the world do I do if the university does not allow me access to the library system? I am currently working in a public high school, so right now I am not affiliated with any university.\n\nPlease help!",

Ask your advisor to get you one of those appointments.  They generally come with zero pay and no real obligations.  It is expected that you will collaborate with someone at some point and perhaps interact with some of the grad students, otherwise you bring no value to the university, but as they are not paying you this is not a heavy obligation.  Usually, these appointments need only be signed by the Dean.",

      "text": "Here's the deal, in the US, for many university libraries.\n\nAccess to most databases is on a # of potential users (i.e. enrollment) basis. The more users (or potential users) there are, the more cost goes up. Costs for databases are already enormous, and go up every year. At the same time that costs go up, our budgets don't typically increase, so with a flat budget and increased costs, we have essentially a budget cut.\n\nIf we opened up access to alumni, even those who are just members of the alumni association, the cost increase would be huge.  One place I worked, the friends of the library paid for alumni access to 2 or 3 databases, and IIRC the cost approached $1 million - a decade ago.  That's not an option for my current workplace (larger school, significantly more alumni, etc).\n\nOn top of that, some databases won't license their content for alumni access. This is more often true for business and natural science databases. They want to sell their content to corporate and lab businesses as well as universities, and if alumni have access through their university, they may lose those (sometimes more lucrative) subscriptions.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n* As you've done, ask. Chances are the answer will be no. It's not about you, it's about these licenses and their cost.\n* Use something like Google Scholar to find articles you want - sometimes they'll actually be freely available. And if they're not, often your local public library will have an interlibrary loan service and can get (some) of them for you (this won't always be free at the public library level, but I don't know their ins and outs well enough to to tell you whether it's likely to be or not).\n* Figure out what you need, find out if you can physically go to the library as a guest just now (COVID has our policies more restrictive - don't just show up) to access that. Most licensing agreements allow for walk-in access.\n* Look for the author's work in disciplinary or institutional repositories.  You can find out if the university has one by googling, say \"sonoma state univeristy\" \"institutional repository\"  (fwiw, that is not where I work), and you may f[ind they have one](http://sonoma-dspace.calstate.edu/). Authors may post their publications in there (the version may not be the final published version, fwiw), and then they're typically be freely available.\n* Advocate for more scholarship to be open. Learn about your rights as an author and make what you can available through repositories. Learn about open access and why it doesn't mean bad scholarship. (Yes, there are predatory journals out there. Just because something's OA doesn't mean it's predatory).\n\n(Edit because words are hard before coffee)",
