  "title:": "I have some questions about TA/RA assistantships.",
  "text": "Hello. I am graduating this spring with my BS and am applying for a MS program in a lab with one of my previous professors from undergrad (same school). She said there are both TA and RA assistantships available and i'm not really sure which option is best? I'm not quite sure what I would do with my MS after graduation but i'm fairly flexible and enjoy a variety of things. I do not want to pursue a phD, and academia is not something i'm interested in unless it's teaching at a community college. I wouldn't mind an industry career in a science lab though so maybe RA would be beneficial for that? Can anyone give any input?",

      "text": "If you are not going academic, take the RA.  Your teaching experience won't matter much to industry.  If you WERE going academic, I think it becomes a more difficult decision, as it then depends on what *kind* of academic environment you want to end up in.  A word of caution, however: It's becoming harder for those with an MA to get a community college job in the social sciences and humanities; I'm not sure about stem.  There are enough Ph.Ds starting to apply to those jobs, MAs are getting shut out in places.\n\nBut, you're not going for a Ph.D.?  Take the RA, get all the research skills you can, and go forth to industry/non-academic!",

          "text": "My undergrad is a bachelor of science in agriculture with emphasis in soil and water resources, and the masters will be a master of science in plant and soil science but I will be doing soil bio/chem/soil health research. I feel that even if I didn't go into academic research the chemistry/microbio research should apply to other scientist lab careers. I'm not necessarily gunning for a community college teaching job, but if that's all I can find I would try it. I'm mostly aiming to work on soil health/regenerative agriculture type positions whether it is more outreach related or lab/field environment.",
