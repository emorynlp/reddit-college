  "title:": "Was sent an email saying I may possibly be in violation of student conduct code at school in california when I haven't done anything.",
  "text": "This is my last semester in college and I tried to schedule my final for a certain class at the disabilities office since I have a learning disability and need extra time. I was trying to book it over a week in advance. The supervisor said they were completely booked and that they would not be able to accommodate me. I told her if I don't get the extra time I will fail. She responded by saying well there's always next time. I told her it's my last semester so there is no next time and find what she's saying unacceptable. She apologized and said she doesn't know what to tell me. So I asked if she had a supervisor. She told me \"yes it's on the disability website and she'll tell you the same thing but would you like me to spell out her email for you\" with some attitude.  So I email her supervisor and dean of students stating what this person told me mentioning her name.  A few hours after that email was sent I receive an email stating that I am in violation of student conduct code 4 \"participating in an activity that substantially and materially disrupts the normal operations of the university, or infringes on the rights of members of the university community.\"  So I haven't done anything wrong and suddenly I need to meet with a student conduct specialist to discuss the matter but they refuse to tell me the nature of the matter until our meeting. I can only imagine and suspect that she must have read that email so she filed a false complaint against me to get herself out of trouble and put the blame on me. I haven't been able to focus or study for my finals or do my homework due to this. Telling a student with disabilities they can't get their extra time can really hinder their success. The main person at disabilities scheduled my final right away but now im dealing with a false allegation that can really affect my future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUPDATE:  It actually gets worse and the person behind all this is the actual professor whose class I requested accommodations for. Last semester she did not give me my extra time and it deleted all my answers and had to retake the test again and she changed all the math questions. She is a very meticulous person but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. In this class where she is the only one that teaches it I was going to schedule my midterm at dass and she said \"why don't you take it in class I'll stay the extra hour and if you need any assistance I'll be here to answer any of your questions\"  Our class officially ends at 1:50pm, it was noon it's a 5 hour class and once the other students left, students of other classes came at noon to discuss grades and she knows I have concentration and processing problems, how did the students know to come? So I told her that why would you have students come in to discuss grades all loud while you know I can't concentrate? She said she didn't know they were coming but didn't want to out me of having a disability. My gut was telling me otherwise and I discussed this with another professor. The thing is she's always so nice to me comparing to how she is to others so I definitely didn't even suspect her and always tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. So she makes this allegation making me look really bad and disruptive which I hardly talk in class. I explained everything to student conduct she dismissed it and said you should file a grievance but first talk to the chair. The chair is her good friend so I don't trust her. The problem is this professor brags about how she got 1 million dollar grant for the school so she thinks she's untouchable which may be true.  I have to say she played the art of war well, keep your friends close your enemies closer, strike when they least expect it and create great anxiety that she definitely did. So I emailed the dean, but this is unacceptable to me to make such false allegations. I told the dean to interview my other professors and my research professors about my character and to interview the students in class. I did nothing wrong if anything she is the one that has sabatoged my previous exams, finals week and my character. Does she have a problem with people with disabilities or different gender identities? She never said anything to think that but her actions say differently. I'm shocked to say the least.",

Find your university ombudsperson and get them involved.\n2. Find the head of your student association or student government and get them involved.\n3. Write down your version of events exactly as they happened, with dates and times, and with zero editorialization. Since she is making thing up this will be more difficult for her. \n4. Talk to your students newspaper. \n\nFinally - if none of the above work - talk to your state attorney general's office. \n\nBye - they are certainly in violation of of either the ADA or section 504 of the rehabilitation act. They are different laws, I think depending on if the institution is public or private, but it does NOT give the University an exception because they ran out of fucking testing slots. It is their responsibility to provide adequate reasonable accomodations. That office must be a shit-show, since it's not too difficult for them to figure out how many testing slots they'll likely need.\n\nAnyways, if none of that works and you're in a position where you won't graduate, come back and tell us. Message me. There is a brother/sisterhood of disabled individuals in academia who will absolutely bury your admins in emails. Unfortunately, when your university starts looking bad to the public or other academics, magically things start to happen. \n\nSource: I'm an academic with a disability. Department chair once told me to quit. I'm still here, they're not.",

I will keep you guys posted. I most definitely will dm you. This sucks I want to tell one of my professors about what happened and why I haven't turned in an assignment but I'm embarrassed I feel like they may start to see me in a negative light when I was getting an A in his class and now I don't know especially since I haven't studied for his 1pm exam or turned in some assignments that were due this weekend. I'm going to try the media too this person should not be working with people with disabilities if she is willing to let them fail instead of trying to set them up for success.",

It just makes me angry that I self advocated and it blew up in my face and now face a student conduct violation. The thing that will look bad on her part is that she had hours to file a complaint about me but she didn't until after that email was sent out in which I cc'd her.

If you have a documented disability and your school knows about it, failure to provide accomodations is an ADA violation.\n\nYou brought it to their attention (which is a protected action because of your disability) and were retaliated against with an official diciplinary process, which is another violation.\n\nDoes your school have a department for disability or student support? Do you know any professors who would be willing to go to bat for you? Can you discuss the situation with the course professor, and see if they can proctor the exam with additional time or get a TA to do it? Placing the stress of dealing with administrative bureaucracy on a person with disabilities during final week is downright cruel.\n\nBest of luck with your finals. I hope you get this worked out in time to recieve your accomodation. This story makes me so angry, if asking for what you are legally entitled to disrupts normal uni services, they are blatantly in violation of the law.\n\nhttp://studentcaffe.com/prepare/students-with-disabilities/ada-your-rights-college-student\n\nhttps://adata.org/legal_brief/legal-brief-protection-retaliation\n\n(Edit to add: In circumstances like this, a letter threatening legal involvement and detailing how they are liable can sometimes be enough to prompt action. Maybe check out r/legaladvice or contact a lawyer for help.\n\nIf you need help finding a lawyer or an assist with anything as you prepare, please DM me. I have a disability and have navigated these services with my university in the past, and have plenty of time to assist others. Final weeks suck already.

I want to encourage you to share this situation with your professors. It is understandable to be worried about going to them for fear of being seen negatively. I felt the same way when I was a student, and didn't reach out for completely reasonable leniency. Your professors are human too, and this is a ridiculous situation to be in during an already-stressful time. You deserve to be cut a break, and professors don't want students to fail. It might feel stressful reaching out, especially because you've received such an unreasonable response so recently, but don't let an asshole prevent you from getting the help you deserve. And... if they say no, so what? I've forgotten the names of the professors who didn't care enough about me to treat me like a human, but I've regretted every time I could have shared that I was struggling with something out of my control and my grades were lower than they could have been.\n\nThis is an incredibly stressful situation to be dealing with suddenly, you already have documented disabilities, and most reasonable adults will feel sympathetic to your situation. And even if the worst case happens, you can fight this legally. It is blatantly illegal, and disability rights lawyers would be chomping at the bit to pursue this case. And, because I catastrophize too, even if the absolute *worst case happens* and this is reflected on your academic record, the situation is understandable from the outside and would be written off as unjust by anyone who is worth your time to work with. I messed up as a student and lost part of an archive for a professor I interned with. I was *terrified* to ask for help and the situation got worse and worse, and I've beaten myself up for years. He just wrote me a recommendation letter, was excited to hear from me, and doesn't give a shit.\n\nYou will get through this, and your exams. Reach out to professors if you feel able, even if it's a little scary. They know you care. Take a few deep breaths. Take a break from studying and preparing for this messy situation to shower and eat. Reducing the effects of your anxiety will do you a lot of good right now, improve your ability to recall information and aid in cognitive processing speed. If your experience is anything like mine, your cortisol is spiking and you might be dealing with adrenaline. Your body is preparing for a conflict that will likely be defused easily, and it is influencing how your brain devotes resources to abstract information processing versus responding to a perceived threat. Drink some water, get a snack, stretch for 5 minutes. Give yourself the gift of some relief.\n\nGood luck with the 9am meeting. Keep your chin up. **You are the reasonable person in this situation, and you are entitled to accommodations.** Retaliation is childish, and you shouldn't let anyone acting like a child prevent you from your best chances at success. You can do this.",
