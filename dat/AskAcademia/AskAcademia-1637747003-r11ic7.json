  "title:": "[UK] How good of a uni must I do my PhD at to go on to academia?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve graduated a Russell group uni with a 4-year masters degree in physics, taking modules specifically geared toward theoretical physics. I\u2019ve got an unimpressive first (75%), and really did not network at all with anyone during my entire time at uni, just watching lectures online. Apart from a preprint on arxiv, I really don\u2019t have all that much going for me in terms of my application, and have really struggled to scrounge up more than one referee for PhD applications.\n\nI know that I want to go into academia, specifically in theoretical physics. There is nothing else for me. I know that it\u2019s a wasteland of PhD student who cannot find positions. As I look for potential PhD supervisors, I find that all of them have their PhDs from oxbridge or imperial. This is really worrying me, as I know that realistically there\u2019s no chance of me getting into those unis. So I\u2019m here to ask those who have been through it, or are on the admissions side of things, what are the chances of ending up in a permanent position in academia if I were to go to a less prestigious uni? At what point would it be better to apply to, and hopefully ace a single year masters course to hopefully get into a better uni for a PhD?\n\nI\u2019m looking mostly for honest advice, not hopeful advice, so just lay it on me.\n\nPS I\u2019m thinking of maybe applying to unis like Durham and KCL where it seems that you do not apply with a specific research proposal. In these cases, do I still contact a potential supervisor?",

      "text": "Hello. I am not sure about the job market for theoretical physics but I did my phd in economic theory (game theory) from a school outside the top 20 programs. While I am now in a tenure track position at a teaching university, I believe I was also very fortunate. Landing this job was difficult and I was on the job market for 3 cycles. My publications are not great so I do not think that I can carry my record onto the job market and land a better job. Finally, my pool of collaborators is limited. I know that mos phd's would think that these are not problems that I should even pick at, but the truth is, candidates from top unis have their pick of job offers, are trained for better publications, and network with better collaborators.",

              "text": "I don't think that matters as much as you think. I wrote my dissertation on QFT but am now doing a PhD in theoretical condensed matter at a top 10 uni. My master's grade wasn't as high as yours either (although I did do very well in the research section)\n\nRegardless, with those grades and a decent referee or two, I don't think you'll have too many issues in getting onto a good PhD course. From there, all that people will really focus on is the quality of your publications during your PhD. Doctorates aren't like undergrad degrees in the sense that people care a great deal as to where you get them from. A PhD, no matter where it's from will tend to be viewed more or less equally to others, so long as the publications are good",
