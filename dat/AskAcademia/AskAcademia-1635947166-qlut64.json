  "title:": "Deciding between two faculty job offers: prioritize salary or opportunity for advancement?",
  "text": "Hi all, I am deciding between two institutions in two very different locations. One offer is for a research assistant professor position so the salary is quite low. Other than the low pay and non-tenure position, it\u2019s a dream. Great mentorship, tons of data, amazing collaborators, lots of internal funding available, and I\u2019m told, high probability of transitioning to tenure-track within the first two years. The other offer is for a tenure-track assistant professor position with a 6-figure salary (although in a slightly higher cost-of-living area). But I would be so much more solitary\u2026there would be mentorship, but not in my exact discipline. Although I\u2019d have start-up funds, I\u2019d really have to make connections and build collaborations independently whereas with option 1, it would be much more organic. I\u2019m torn and change my mind daily. Does anyone have any words of wisdom?",

Tell them about your other offer. Worst case scenario, they back out, which means they were never going to convert to TT anyway.\n\nI don't think the mentorship matters as much as you do, but I don't fully know your situation. And it would be a bit crazy to turn down the security of TT unless there are red flags. I'd also strongly consider quality of living for each place, and things like your probable commute, etc.",

A tenure-track position with them is not guaranteed. They might even have a tt line open that they fill with someone else. One question to ask yourself is how you will feel if you take the non-tt job and it does not turn into a tt job at all, or if they string you along for more years.",
