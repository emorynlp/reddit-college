  "text": "I recently graduated undergrad. I was super diligent and got to publish my senior thesis to a conference. I just recently spoke at a conference on said paper. \n\nI am enrolled in a masters program, I know I want to be a professor/researcher and do a PhD and the whole shebang. \n\nBut with the conference, listening to everyone\u2019s presentations on small details of hypothetical scenarios ... I am just left thinking, is any of this important? Why am I spending my time on this, when the world is going to crap? \n\nI don\u2019t think that I dislike research... I think that I need to move to another field  that is a little more applied and tied to real world problems.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way before? Would love to hear stories.\n\nMaybe I just depressed at the pandemic/climate change/political environment etc.\n\nEdit: rip title, \u201cMY work\u201d",

      "text": "You are coming into the world at a very strange time. There are times of stability where people focus on themselves, and times of instability where their attention is necessarily turned outwards to the systems that surround them. America has been in the former basically for the entirety of our parents generation so they\u2019ve given us a set of expectations for life that were made for a static prosperous time. The world we are prepared for is not the world as it is. We will need to deal with much more complex and difficult and borderline dangerous work than they ever had to face. Do not hold yourself to their ambitions, they are just telling you what they understand of their world, however their entire model and understanding has been shown to be obsolete.\n\nFor your own sake, persist with your career, you\u2019re gonna need it in the times ahead. I would offer a suggestion, that your source of discomfort is not that you are focused on your work, but that you sense you need to gain an awareness of what\u2019s going on with the world. I think there are many people that feel this way right now. Please continue to explore your understanding of the world, I suggest History to give you perspective that we are not alone as people in the distant past have been in our shoes, make your own opinions, and think of ways you might influence the system for good. All while you simultaneously do your work and I assure you will feel more complete.\n\nYour feelings are 100% valid, not because your work is unimportant but because current events have become more important relatively. Our parents generation can't help us as they have no perspective. Look to our grandparents or great-grandparents generation for guidance on how to exist and be happy in a troubled world. All you need to be happy in life is friends, food and shelter, we still live in good times, we are just restless because we are pushed to ridiculous standards.\n\nYou're very lucky to have made it into a graduate program, there are many which are not giving funding for 2020-2021 cycle. This is a great time to be in a graduate program, as normally the downside of graduate school is the opportunity cost of working in the prosperous industry job market. So on the bright side, you're not missing out on anything.",

              "text": "No problem at all, I wish someone told me that years ago. I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve just been constantly gaslit my whole life by my parents generation to believe that everything is fine, which led me to freak out at the walls I was constantly hitting (I say this as a BS STEM grad with a a handful of publications with 100\u2019s of cites between them, the market is fucking hard right now). Only now that everyone seems to agree there is a problem, do I see now that the goal of our generation is not to be personally successful and learn to game and exploit the system as our parents did. Our purpose is to reject the gaming of the system which has so corrupted it, and bring the value of morality and simple reason back in spite of the system we live in.\n\n\nI\u2019d like to believe the world isn\u2019t going to crap. We\u2019re just noticing it more, and the instability we are facing is not only an inevitable consequence of recognizing the inequalities in our system, it is also an opportunity for us to influence the world and make it a better place.",

From your post it doesn't sound like you're in the humanities, but in this essay Kay talks at length about the seeming frivolity of hyper-niche research that doesn't seem to affect anyone else and the commiserate disheartenment. It's definitely worth a read, even if you're not in the humanities.\n\nEdit: The Kay article is actually called \"Academy's Extinction Event.\" \"Fanning the Flames\" is a response to it by Anastasia Berg. They're both worth a read, but I wanted to make sure I was referencing the correct piece.",

As research gets more and more niche, the gap opens up for interdisciplinary work, creating new fields at the intersection of various fields.\n\nFor example, my field is computational cognitive neuroscience. If machine learning hadnt developed to give a variety of modeling perspectives, neuroscience hadn't rigorously mapped types of transmitters, neurons, and connectivity, and if we didn't have carefully gathered behavioral data from psychology, CCN couldn't have developed.",

Why am I spending my time on this, when the world is going to crap? \n\nIt could be depression from current state of the world getting to you; but it could also be a deeper truth reveling itself to you as well. Practically speaking not enjoying the work you are doing, or seeing the value of the work you are doing is a sign that in the long run you will not be happy in a *very* demanding career. \n\nBack before I did my graduate studies a couple of my colleagues (I was a programmer at the time) advised me to avoid research into computer science since \"all of the low hanging fruit has been plucked, and most people are not happy with making an incredibly small improvement to a known solution.\" They weren't wrong and I ended up doing my graduate studies in a computer science adjacent field (computational science and engineering) where the focus is less on the incremental improvements can be more on the big problems (e.g., climate change, public health, etc.). \n\nMy experience has generally been that those thoughts don't really go away. Some people thrive looking at incredibly niche topics purely due to the intellectual joy they experience; however, other people enjoy knowing that their work has a measurable (if small) impact upon the broader world around them. If you are in the category it might not be such a bad idea to explore interdisciplinary (or even transdisciplinary) research if you want to stay adjacent to where you started. Of course, there's also nothing wrong with changing disciplines as well! I've known people over the years that started in A, got their PhD in B, ended up in C as professors, and eventually retired a couple more steps removed!",

Now I have to answer some of my questions myself and I read recent papers for others. I do not feel like I have an obligation or duty to contribute to society with my research at all.\n\nFurther, I don't think it is obvious that researches with a direct focus on social impact contribute more than \"research for the fun of it\". I am pretty sure almost none of the 19th century mathematicians cared even slightly about the social impact of their research, yet they have contributed to our society tremendously.\n\nSo I just focus on finding an interesting question, answering it in a clear way and record it in an accessible way.

      "text": "I'm a more junior PhD student and I've definitely been feeling this way all summer. I do research in STEM and my research is actually somewhat applicable in the real world, but it feels so detached from our current reality of global pandemic/climate catastrophe/civil unrest/crumbling democracy.\n\nOn the one hand I enjoy my research; I feel like it's something I can actually sustain as a career and could lead to a positive impact. Plus I can contribute to our educational institutions. But on the other hand, there are so many people struggling to even survive these major crises, so shouldn't I put my energy and skills towards more pressing problems?\n\nI'm working on fellowship applications, and it's a real existential time thinking about what I actually want to pursue in the next few years. No answers here, but you're not alone.",
