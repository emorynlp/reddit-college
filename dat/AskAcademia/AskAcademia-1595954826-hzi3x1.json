  "title:": "For us average people in academia: When in your academic career did you realize that you weren't going to be a star and what prompted it?",
  "text": "Now, if you are a star in your field or are on track to be one, congratulations! But this question isn't for you.\n\nI've spent my entire academic career at \"highly-ranked\" R1s, which means that I'm around a lot of people from undergrad students through early professors who have the expectation that they're going to be the stars of their field, and the environment promotes that. This is especially true at the university where I am currently.\n\nMost people, even from big-name R1s, do not end up being stars in their field. That's not a bad thing at all and is not even necessarily their fault - it's largely the nature of how reputations in academia are developed. I've also noticed that some are able to adjust to that change in expectation of themselves very easily, while others have a really hard time letting that go.\n\nI'm just curious for all of us non-stars, when in your career did you start to recognize that you weren't going to be a star in your field? What prompted you to realize that and what did you do to adjust your frame of mind to be content with it?\n\nI'm just interested in what others' experiences are and am not looking for advice or anything - I'm well past the point of being okay with not being on a path to be a big name in my field and am content with where I am (as long as I don't run out of funding!).",

The exact moment was when I was talking with a huge star in my field and they were describing a more junior person who is already a star at a young age. They were saying how the junior person is always working, and gave the example that even when they are in the car with their partner on the way to a date that they would be reviewing papers or writing grants or whatever. And I just knew that was not for me because I get motion sickness reading in a moving vehicle. But more realistically, I would never want to give up having a non-work life.",

I realized I wasn't going to be a star when I struggled with grades as an undergrad. That made me realize I'm actually not very smart, but luckily I also realized that I'm at home in a lab. Even though I'm not a star, I certainly intend to progress and have a respectable career at an R1, which requires me to be competitive nationally. It's a continuum, really.",

He'll be on a roll and stop for lunch, disrupting his flow and move on to whatever project he does after lunch, even if the previous project is still fresh in his mind. Or he'll have an idea for a grant, but would never deviate from schedule to knock it out right then. \n\nI, on the other hand, am one of those people who will work for 12-14 hours straight and knock out a week's worth of work. If I have an idea I will go and write it down while it's flowing. This style of working isn't always super great for my health, or for keeping commitments, but it frees up so much time that I basically just tell people my weekday availability is a little last minute, but my weekends are always free and sacred.\n\nPoint being that you gotta find what works for you, not just what someone told you was the \"right\" way to work.",

It was a real core type of competency and mastery over the field that few have.\n\nHe was my mentor during one of my postdocs and he was by far the most successful scientist I had ever worked with other than my extremely famous doctoral advisor (who, tellingly, openly admired this other guy - probably 30 years his junior). He didn't play games with his students, he knew how to be supportive and kind without doing their work for them, and he knew which students to carry for a bit and when. He was there at every coffee break in they just chatting with whomever, he always ate with us in the canteen and it never felt like \"the boss\" was there.\n\nHe's everyone's favorite colleague because he is open, honest, insightful and can see the right thing to do very quickly. People line up to collaborate with him and he is on so many papers it's ridiculous. And he's just great to be around. He has a really dry wit but is not cynical. He has a lot of interests and knows a lot about art and literature, and many other topics. He neither only talks about work nor avoids the topic.\n\nHe almost never works in the evenings or weekends, only a bit on Sunday nights, and never before the kids go to bed. He takes a month off every August, just to be with his family on some British Isle where he he doesn't have good cell phone service and doesn't bother to get internet access. He has a wonderful marriage, great kids, and seems to really like life, in a British sort of way - meaning, not exuberant, but you can tell. He keeps himself fresh and doesn't burn out. He works efficiently because he keeps work confined to one part of his life. This makes him happier and more productive.\n\nWhen I saw how effortless it was for him, and how people were throwing money and titles his way, I could see what it was to be a star. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.",

Again, everyone wants to collaborate with him because he is honest, productive, and insightful.

I think one of the secrets is that they were able to leverage their early promise into having more and better choices for themselves. Because of this, they don't have many experiences that leave them embittered or otherwise with chips on their shoulder since they can navigate away from them before they happen. They could be choosey about projects and get positions with supportive supervisors, colleagues, and departments overall. This circumstances allowed them to be more relaxed and more productive and have even more good options. \n\nPeople really do want to work with other good people and don't want to reward assholes.

But, before leaving academia, there was a time when I did find this state of mind you're describing, at least I believe so. While I'm sure others will give their own experiences and ideas of what worked for them, I'll give my take on this.\n\nI feel the path to this kind of development comes from prioritizing a patient and humble pursuit of learning and discovery with a child-like wonder. I recall a time when I'd learn because I was simply curious, and nothing was taken too seriously. I was pretty poor at the time, so there were no deadlines, competition, etc. for me then. All I had was just time to learn, old books and access to a local library. I loved mathematics and covered a lot of ground, so that ended up being my strength at the time. Eventually, I went to undergrad at a little no-name university in the middle of nowhere to be close with my family.\n\nBack then, I'd write a grant and get awarded, go to research conferences, etc. and come across many going to R1 universities. I was from the middle of nowhere, in a more peaceful environment with little competition, but noticed many of my peers in the thick of competition came out changed. They didn't prioritize what I mentioned, they were specifically in it to be a \"star,\" not to discover or learn. Many were sometimes rude and narcissistic, often oblivious of it. I haven't really kept in touch with many of them, but from what I saw through the years was that none of us became a \"star.\"\n\nI say all of this in past-tense because, for several years, this has no longer been the case for me anymore. Eventually, I became disheartened by the current system in academia and concerned myself more with money, ditching the idea of going to graduate school to go straight to industry. I stopped prioritizing what I mentioned because I no longer saw the point.\n\nNow that I'm married and have found more peace, I do feel it gradually coming back. My days of child-like learning and discovery aren't over it seems. While I am back in academia for graduate studies, I still feel academia has failed and often feeds off competitive people rather than actual discovery. This time, though, by no means will I care about the system of academia nearly as I care about life, learning and discovery. Maybe someday we all are far less dependent on the current system altogether.\n\nHopefully, this serves as advice to others. Don't let environments or systems control your priorities. You can be a \"star\" while still being a good person with a life.\n\nShort version: It all comes down to prioritizing a patient and humble pursuit of learning and discovery with a child-like wonder. Keep this and you're already a \"star.\" Sacrificing your personal life IS NOT required and is often unsustainable.",

Instead of traveling the world and all that fancy stuff, I would have made more effort to simply integrate academics into all of these things.

These are really complicated decisions that aren't black or white.\n\nIn terms of learning a particular subject for what it is, I don't think it matters much. What matters most regarding a Ph.D. is the advisor, and there are several factors to consider.\n\nYou should make sure they have at least a fair research record in your field. If your advisor has good research experience and is somewhat recognized, he should be able to provide you the kind of mentorship you need to be a good researcher yourself. I'd also mention that how well your research goes depends largely on you, no matter where you are. This is even more the case depending on which country you pursue a Ph.D.\n\nAnother thing to consider is his/her character. If they are an awful person, it really won't help you much, no matter how good of a record he has. These types often take advantage of talented students for cheap labor on their own research, or some may even try to grab first authorship of their student's work (though that's extremely rare).\n\nI'll give a general story to kind of put it all together. I remember a woman I met at a research conference in my undergrad years. She did great in university attended an R1 university in California. At the time she was seeking legal advice for being blackmailed by her undergraduate research advisor for calling him out for plagiarism...imagine what his Ph.D. candidates have to deal with. This professor is a very well known researcher in his field.\n\nI'd choose a slightly less recognized professor who makes a great mentor over a jerk any day. You need to build good relationships in your career with good people, not dead ends.\n\nNote: I'm not trying to devalue R1 universities, btw. There are good researchers there too, it's just that whether they are R1 doesn't really matter compared to a good advisor. I'd say academic systems at large are very flawed before I'd ever name R1 universities as specifically a waste.",

Maybe it's having a ton of patents? Then again, patenting something can be very basic, and tons of people in industry have patents without being academics. \n\nIs it maybe coming up with a novel or breakthrough idea or method? I'd say plenty of academics have done this, but it hasn't been the right time or place to successfully get their innovation recognized. Is it having your own research project? Getting a lot of grants, or really big money grants? \n\nMore and more stardom just sounds like a game of networking and being in the right place at the right time. A lot of it is luck. I'd doubt Jonas Salk thought of himself as a star, and people were giving up their seats on the bus for him. \n\nI'm genuinely curious about all of this, because even while I've worked with a number of different fields, I wouldn't say I've met any stars.",

              "text": "While this is... probably true? It's also a very nebulous idea, and still hinges on \"true advancement\" being sufficiently recognized and picked up by enough scholars in the field to actually have a demonstrable impact, especially in a short a time frame as someone's lifespan. This ends up, again, ends up being more an unintentional popularity metric, because even someone who publishes something that is truly revolutionary in their field, they run the risk of publishing it in the wrong venue, not having influential enough bosses or field contacts to support their ideas, etc etc. \n\nLet me give you an example. My field was generally rules by positivist theories for decades. A couple scholars said, wait a minute. You can't classify human behavior like they're animals, and proposed post-positivistic and constructivist theories of behavior. However, because this wasn't the the dominant theoretical paradigm, these scholars faced immense push back and scrutiny. Eventually, the later theoretical paradigms were widely accepted, and now are used in everything from academic research to industry research. Now, we would argue the scholars first proposing the post-positivistic theories are academic stars. Their works are widely cited and help spawn generations of researcher. \n\nHowever, when they first proposed their theories, many of them were dismissed. Would this count as something to put in the academic stardom metric?\n\nSo again: there seems to be several different concepts of academic stardom, and a lot of it hinges on the retrospective appreciation of an individual's contribution to their field. Unless they did something that had an immediate and dramatic impact on wider humanity (Salk, for example), then it's hard to argue a solid metric for what kind of work would constitute stardom.\n\nI touched on the popularity metric before. Going back to my field, we have an influx of identity politics problematizing performed scholarship. We could have people doing incredibly important, insightful work, but are dismissed out of hand because their work didn't include XYZ group. We have imperfect, overly partial, and sometimes incompetent people gatekeeping metrics of scholarship. This is only an example of my field-- I'm sure in every field, there is something like this, where if you don't pay homage to the current predominant social or academic paradigm, your work isn't published or it's stuck way longer waiting to get published.",

      "text": "I find this question to be so interesting! In my field (economics), you often don't become a \"star\" until 30 years after you published that thing that ultimately transforms the field (or part of it), or until after you're dead. I mean, sure, there are some exceptions to this, but very few of them are stars simply due to their workaholism. More often, \"stars\" in econ are the ones who get involved in policy/chair the Fed/etc. Or they write a mass-market econ explainer. \n\nIf you just mean \"star\" in terms of publishing and getting funding, sure, many of those people don't have lives outside of work, but plenty of them are just very well connected. There's a \"rising star\" in my department right now who is the laziest bag of bones I know (among other things), who is getting there by being a bro and ingratiating himself with the old boys club. He constantly pushes students to publish their term papers and adds himself as co-author, doing minimal to assist. But he's great at sucking up and is constantly getting added to things/going to conferences/helping secure funding, so he's quickly moving up the ranks.  \n\nI don't really think that guy is much of a star, but you might.\n\nMy point being that there are plenty of ways to be a star, and I think it's best to proceed as though you could be one at any time! Do your best work (which involves staying mentally healthy), and keep the creativity flowing.  I always have the mindset that everything I publish or do could be the next big thing, and if it's not, its part of the journey to stardom (for me or for someone else who uses it). I could go into policy someday, or design a massive free online class in my subject matter, or publish something for mass market to fill a gap... For instance, a new mother economist has made herself famous by publishing a empirical book about mothering! I mean, c'mon, there are a million ways to be a star. All it takes is for some people (other than mom) to think so. :)\n\nEdit: I was one of those \"people to watch\" in grad school, for identifying reasons I won't get into here. But I'm much more self motivated than I am motivated by the opinions of others, so I doubt I'm a person to watch anymore \ud83d\ude02 Give me another decade for all this wheel spinning to turn into something!",

And I am still coming to terms with the fact that being successful in academia requires you to devote 100% of your life to one specific field, and that this could never be me. \nI just hope for my future that there are still jobs for people in science without a long list of awards and achievements in their CVs...",

Am I a star now?  I guess I think it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, and at this point in my career I personally consider anyone who makes it through a PhD and goes on to an academic career to be a star.

They mine all these rocks that are 'rich' in diamonds, but the people who work outside with the big trucks will almost never see a diamond because they were so rare even in rocks they mined.  They just mined so much that it added up.\n\nThe the rocks they mined were refined and sifted, but in the process the big rocks were smashed into bits.  The narrator explained that the diamond dust was worth more to industrial applications than the chance to find a huge intact diamond was worth, so they just smashed all the rocks and probably smashed quite a few huge diamonds along the way.  \n\nThat documentary made me think of academia.  You cant just sit and think deeply about one idea.  You have to smash it into a billion little ideas and pump them out at a regular rate.  Most of the papers I read didnt thrill me, but I guess in aggregate we were making some kind of progress in my field.\n\nThis wasnt the first time I realized I didnt have what it took to be a 'rock star' in my field.  But it did close off the only avenue I even considered remotely plausible.  Maaaaayyybe if I could think quietly about one problem for a while I could have a spark of an idea?  I'd done it before on hard problems in undergrad and growing up.  But I was just under pressure to pump out stuff that I always felt behind and could never relax and think.  I was always second guessing my work because I felt that to get it right would take so much more work.  I knew I couldnt keep up by making tiny diamonds, and the system wouldnt tolerate me taking the time to try to come up with a big diamond, so that's that.",

If you're in the academia, it does not matter whether you're a star or not :) Every single contribution matters, although most people don't realize it. The paper that you push with all your efforts, thinking that is is not good work; the simulations you carry out thinking wtf is happening; little comments you make in online forums; they all matter. When someone is doing a literature review somewhere in the world, they will read your work and they will actually find it the best one out there. Trust me, I'm the last person on earth to be positive about everything, but if you're in academia, you are already a star. If you're referring to very popular and famous people in academia, that is a very delicate line to walk on without becoming a diva.\n\nSorry about the detour from what OP was talking about. I'll show myself out.",

Being an older PhD candidate and someone who excels in classroom discussions but has a hard time writing, I'm amazed I even got this far. I'm so, so grateful that people have even accepted me as an MA candidate (and now PhD) and that I've had the opportunity to talk about topics I like at conferences. That alone is already incredible to me. In my field (Translation Studies), like most humanities and letters, people who are stars go on to propose new ways of looking at the discipline and usually publish \\*a lot\\* , not just papers, but books. I don't think I'll ever be able to write a book about translation, although I have written papers. I did try my hand at theorizing about translation in my MA, and it's a neat little idea, but it's not going to revolutionize anything or send me to the top. I'm too rigorous in my thinking (which is usually good but can also be paralyzing) yet too impatient and anxious when writing, which is not a good combination. Another reason I'll probably never make it to higher ranks is that I'm a lot older, so I'm just enjoying the incredible amount of learning I'm amassing and I'll be happy if I get to do research and become a professor for a solid decade (or even two) before retirement. It's much better than \"retiring\" as just a freelance translator, a service I can continue to offer if I need to for as long as my mental faculties allow.",

It's not generally clear to me who is a star and who isn't anyway. \n\nHowever, when I was a postdoc and I was looking at other candidates who were also applying, it was easy to see that there were some really amazing candidates out there that I couldn't compete with. This wasn't surprising really; I mean, it's not as though I thought I would be the very best scientist or anything, but it was interesting to see.",

      "text": "A couple of thoughts:\n\nFor me, when I was finishing up my PhD I decided that I didn't care enough about my graduate research to continue in the same field (there were several reasons).  So I switched fields for my postdoc, but my postdoc got crushed by outside forces.  Then I switched fields again.\n\nThere are very few people who always knew they were going to be superstars.  Even the superstars in my graduate department didn't.  My PhD advisor happened to publish one of the most highly cited papers in our field as a postdoc.  I don't think their PhD work was especially interesting.  One of the theorists in our department became a superstar overnight when their esoteric research suddenly became a hot topic when another group developed a practical implementation related to their ideas.\n\nFor most people, I think academia is just a progression.  You go to grad school, you do a postdoc, you become a professor, you build a research group, hopefully your research group publishes a lot of nice stuff in a field that people care about, you build a good reputation as you go, and some people might start to care.\n\nI think the main thing is to decide what's important to you if it's not going to be fame and fortune :)",

After the first I had zero interest in being a \"star\" of any kind, because I met a lot of them (Nobel laureates, journal editors, etc.) and I wanted none of what they were doing professionally. I wanted to be a teacher first, scholar second, and planned on a career at an liberal arts college from the outset.\n\nThat's what I did-- my first full-time position was at an SLAC and now I'm 20+ years in, full professor, department chair, etc. and quite happy with that. There was nothing to adjust to because that was my original goal. I love working with students, have enough time to do the research that I feel I need to, and I feel like I make a greater impact on people doing what I do than if I were writing more or had an important role in my professional organization or was a journal editor like my mentor, etc.\n\nSo I probably made a clear decision after my first masters, when I changed programs and specifically told people my career goal was to be an SLAC professor. Luckily my semi-famous advisor thought that was still an OK goal.",
