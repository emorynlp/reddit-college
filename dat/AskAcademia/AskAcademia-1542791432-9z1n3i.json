Writing proposals with 10% success rates that are directly responsible for not only my salary, but that of my students, and trying to get way more research done, is way harder than my phd where after about my 2nd year there were things I knew would work.

      "text": "PhD to TT to now tenured. Although getting a PhD is hard, you realize afterward that part of what makes it hard is you are learning to how to do independent research As a professor, at least at an R1 or R2 university, you are expected to produce a much larger volume of research, but you now know *how to do that*, so you can be much more efficient in getting it done. In that sense now you are just worried about getting the research done, and not so much in learning how to do it, although you continue to get more efficient over time. \n\nin terms of the amount of time you spend, the first 3-4 years are very time demanding, much more so than grad school. As others have mentioned prepping new classes, doing service, and dealing with students, especially grad students, takes a tremendous amount of time, but again, that is mostly because you are still learning how to do it efficiently. For me the norm for the first few years was to work around 60 hour a week. \n\nOnce you get established, however, you get much better at the job. You become efficient with your research, you learn how to manage classes in ways that means students don\u2019t need to see you as often (pro-tip, never give make-up exams, always allow students to put missed exam weights on their finals or just say missed exams are a zero), and you learn to carefully pick which committees to invest your time into.\n\nI\u2019m well into my career now, and I currently run a research/outreach center, have multiple PhD students I work with, and have at times taken on very senior administrative posts. I still work a lot of hours each week, but I find the job to be very rewarding and I know how to manage my time very well. Just realize that the first 2-3 years you will be under a very steep learning curve, but it does get better.\n\n",

              "text": "I'll tell you what works for me, but keep in mind that a) I teach in a business school and b) others even in my own department probably do things differently. People in other fields would necessarily have to do things differently\n\nThe first thing I would say is to always keep in mind what is most important in your field, not what is \"most important\" at your particular institution. A new TT faculty member almost certainly will NOT spend their entire career at their first institution. So it is important that you retain mobility and that means focusing on what makes you marketable in your field. Once you are tenured or a full professor you can start to focus on things that are important at your institution but which do not have a lot of value across institutions (i.e. service and administrative posts.) \n\nFor my field, all that matters in the marketplace is published research. (Other fields will place value on grants too, mine does not.) Teaching has to be acceptable, but no hiring committee in my field (at least at an R1 or R2) has ever hired somebody because they were a great teacher - they hire for research first and hope the person is a good teacher.\n\nFrom that standpoint, it made my decision making relatively easy. I blocked out about 40 hours a week for research, and made everything else fit into the remaining 20 hours I was willing to work. This was a little easier for me because I happened to teach at an Urban school, so our graduate classes tended to be at night, so I could focus on research during the day and shift to teaching in the evening. I also reserved every Saturday for just focusing on research.\n\nIn terms of how to be more efficient in research, what I learned was to work with co-authors I could trust and who had skill sets that complimented mine. I'm a great programmer, but not as good at writing up text or doing lit reviews. I found other assistant professors that were good at those things.\n\nThe biggest thing is how to be reasonably good at teaching within a tight time budget. What that really meant was I had to accept that I was going to be \"okay\" at teaching for a while as I focused on being a \"great\" researcher. I accepted that once I felt I had tenure secured I could then shift to being as good at teaching as I was a research. Specifically what I did was:\na) Tried to always teach the same set of classes - never take on new preps if it can be avoided.\nb) Use the slides that came with the book, maybe augmented slightly by my own material. Do not make your own slides until tenure is assured.\nc) Minimize grading. Lots of multiple choice exams for undergrads, and math-based problems for grad students. Things that I (or my ga) can grade quickly. It is worth putting time in early to write a good exam that can be easily graded. The physical layout of an exam can greatly affect how efficiently you can grade it.\nd) Minimize students coming to your office - obviously you have to be available to explain things, but make a GA be a required first step before they come to your office. Put as much information as you can on Canvas/Blackboard as you can so that students don't necessarily \"have\" to come see you.\ne) Maintain an \"email log\" on your canvas/blackboard. When a student emails me for help with material (so not personal question, missed exams, etc.) I remove any personally identifying information and then post the question and my response to my \"email log\". This saves a ton of time in large classes because the students really do start to go there first.\n\nFor service, as an assistant professor just go along with the major all the time. This is not the time in your career to be trying to fight for policies or changes that you believe in. Every minute spent in a committee meeting is time you are not spending on research. If you think a meeting could be handled better through email, simply email the chair with your thoughts on the matter and explain that you have had something \"come up\" during the meeting time. \n\nThere are probably others, but this is how I approached things.",

That way I don\u2019t have to deal with excuses if they miss. I don\u2019t take late work on anything, but usually allow them to drop one assignment. I only accept course work on our course management software- no emailed work. If I do a review session, I do it online at night.

I'm a senior full professor and while my classes don't stress me out at all, they still take an amazing amount of time. This is due in part to the face that I've taught close to 30 different courses over my career here, so rarely teach the same course twice, and in part to the fact that we don't have TAs and our students expect a very hands-on teaching environment. But otherwise yes, what you say rings true-- over the course of your career you do learn to be more efficient. Service demands ramp up though, in my experience *especially* after tenure because there are lots of standing committees (like T&P) that require all/most members to be tenured. Moving from something like IRB or the computing committee to chairing the faculty compensation committee or serving on the board of trusees is a *huge* step, and the amount of work that goes with that transition can be overwhelming at first.",

As others have noted, you now have research responsibilities, teaching (which includes the ebb and flow of grading demands), student advising, committee work, etc. Taken together, the sheer amount of responsibilities can introduce a new kind of stress, and often requires ongoing development of time management skills. The pressure to be productive and perform well continues, but like others have noted, it can be largely self induced. I have found the transition to faculty life to be both demanding and highly rewarding. Having good colleagues and solid work relationships can make a big difference. ",

I would just add that looking back, the first few years on the tenure track seemed like they were very busy and stressful even though my productivity was much lower than it is today.

I am so much faster at writing papers and proposals, better at mentoring students, and all of my courses are prepped. I have developed amazing collaborative teams of people I adore. I rarely work more than 40 hours/week unless there is an unusual deadline (or I happen to be home alone, in which case I might work on fun projects), but my productivity has never been higher. I love my job and can\u2019t imagine doing anything else. I really like the different aspects of my job because they are each challenging and stimulating in different ways.

      "text": "I just transitioned from a PhD into a tenure track assistant prof position a few months ago. I'm continually surprised (I know I likely shouldn't be, but I am!) by how much my workload has gone up through this transition. I had assumed that job applications + dissertation was the worst possible workload scenario, but it just gets heavier!\n\nThere are a couple of notable things in the TT job. First, the number of things screaming for immediate attention is much higher (e.g., class prep, student emails, grant applications, media inquiries, service roles, etc, etc). The workload attached to keeping all these balls in the air - plus maintaining forward progress on research - is significant. I'm confident I'll keep getting better and more efficient at these things, though I imagine committee work and lab-running responsibilities will keep growing too! One big note: I'm teaching a 2:2, but all four are new preps this year. That's going to get /way/ better in the future when I'm repeating classes.\n\nThere's a major, major difference between the PhD pressure and TT pressure, though. The PhD pressure - particularly during the last year of the job search - was a soul-sucking existential crisis. I didn't know if I would get a job. I never felt good enough. I had no idea where I'd be living in a few months. I had no idea what my committee and chair thought of me. It was /awful/.\n\nThat's gone. While the TT role is absolutely more work, it's /way/ more stable and rewarding. People assume I'm competent. The media comes calling regularly and sees me as an expert. My new colleagues treat me as a peer and give huge responsibilities in building programs, redesigning courses, and shaping the department. I know I have a stable job for at least five years, and likely for life.\n\nSo, things aren't perfect, but they're vastly improved. I'm still doing too much class prep on the weekend and grading in the evenings. I need to keep working on the work-life balance. And, being an assistant prof is way more work. But, it's way /better/, more enriching, and more fulfilling work without the heaps of existential dread... and that makes it worth it.",

It's not really the classes, though. It's the committee work, the advising, the faculty assembly presentation I agreed to give... The big difference is that there's less stress, in a way. I know that I cleared the major hurdle of getting a job, and you have to mess up pretty bad to be non-renewed or not earn tenure at my school.\n\nI think part of it is that so many of us were over-achievers in school. We continue to take on too much at work, especially during our first jobs. I look around at my colleagues and see folks who happily take on too much, but burn out a few years down the road. But we keep happily volunteering for more.\n\nEven though we have an evaluation rubric that shows how much research, service, and teaching we need to do, I have no idea if my \"excellents\" are because I barely made it or because I do too much. And really, it's become a little too much like other customer service surveys: you either get an excellent or you fail.

      "text": "I went right from ABD into a full-time position at a liberal arts college, before I had completed my dissertation. (It was a sabbatical replacement in a then-tiny field; I had experience and the training to do the job.) During that first year I had to teach my classes *and* write my dissertation, which was insane. 80+ hour weeks, no breaks to speak of, extremely taxing workload. After I finished the diss and had proven myself to the school, my position was converted to TT. From then on it was basically 60-70 hour weeks until tenure.  In both cases it was *far* more work than I ever had to do as a student. Teaching three classes at an SLAC is a lot of work even without the service load (committees and advising), not to mention keeping up with one's research.\n\nGrad school was easy compared to a TT career, at least pre-tenure. Now that I'm a full professor and know what I'm doing the overall time committment has gone down, but I still absolutely think about work all the time, wake up in the middle of the night stressed about work, and occasionally have to pull (near) all-nighters to meet deadlines. It's just how the job works. In my SLAC world the largest part of my time in any given week is simply meeting with students; I typically spend 20+ hours every week in one-on-one meetings with students from my classes, my mentees, research students for whom I'm a second reader on a thesis, interns, and/or students who are simply struggling with something and need help.",

Surely being on the tenure track means you have more job stability and less precarity than a graduate student. So at least the baseline is there (e.g., a living wage, guaranteed year-round employment, a higher degree of autonomy and less vulnerability to individuals\u2019 whims), even if you have increased responsibility and culpability. I can\u2019t feel sorry for folks with more institutional power, since you\u2019re more free to encounter that spread and do that work.",
