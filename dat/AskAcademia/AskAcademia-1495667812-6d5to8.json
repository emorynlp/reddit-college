  "text": "Why is society hostile towards academics and, more generally, higher learning? I have had family members make comments to me before about the fact that I will be applying to PhD programs this fall. Usually, their questions are along the lines of, \"How is that connected to the real world?\" or \"How are you going to do research on something like politics (my field is political science)?\"Obviously, I don't let their comments deter me from my passion, research, but it is still bothersome that they feel that way.",

      "text": "This is a deep problem with many roots:\n\n- For a long, *long* time, higher education really **was** indicative of class divides. Only recent have people in many classes become able to go to college, and even now it's still far from equitable. Just look at the college loan problem.\n\n- Insecurity. People associate higher education with knowledge that they don't have, and it makes them feel insecure. Nobody likes to feel stupid, so they rally against the academy, which is seen as having sardonic know-it-alls without practical compassion.\n\n- A lot of academia is **not** connected to the real world by design. The purpose of research is explicitly to pursue directions which *might* be useful, but to be relatively unconstrained compared to industry. I think you can see why people might think this is useless. It's easy to say \"well, why should we invest in your stupid niche topic when we can't even feed the poor.\"\n\nI think if you're going to pursue an academic life, you have to admit that--like any system--it has huge problems. Instead of downplaying those issues, it's best to admit them and work within the parameters of the good that it does, just as anyone in a big system does. People say the same thing about congress, and yet it's not as simple as \"just get a congressional spot and do it right.\"",

          "text": "I think there's also an issue of trust associated with an information imbalance (and corresponding power imbalance). Much scientific data is completely inaccessible to non-scientists -- either physically (paywalls) or intellectually (papers are written for a specialized audience). We are essentially asking them to blindly trust in a system that they know relatively little about, to trust that we're not either overtly trying to screw them and that we're not just incompetent and kind of guessing. It doesn't help that there are highly publicized stories over the times that scientific claims were wrong or corrupted (e.g. the sugar lobby and research on sugar/fat).\n\nI mean, even as someone with a scientific background who's done some reading about the topic, I'm placing a lot of faith in the system when I claim that climate change exists. I just don't have either the time or expertise to read enough about the topic to fully understand why the current literature is sufficient to back that claim (and why its not flawed). I'm okay with this because I am closely familiar with the system and the checks inherent in it. But if you don't have personal experience with it, don't know scientists and don't see yourself represented amongst scientists, see stories about when science fails, and have someone telling you to do something that may negatively impact your life, it doesn't surprise me to see backlash.

While there're certainly sectors of society that are unfriendly to some academic pursuits, and to academics in general, they don't represent the majority.\n\n>Usually, their questions are along the lines of, \"How is that connected to the real world?\" or \"How are you going to do research on something like politics (my field is political science)?\"\n\nAnd you interpret *that* as hostility?\n\nAsking questions because they don't understand?\n\n",

      "text": "I've been reading a bit of the internet reactionary movement (don't worry just for fun) and they have a whole big shtick about the \"cathedral\", made up of the press and the universities, which directs american thought. The idea is that academics will unintentionally align their thinking into the ideology that is most successful at spreading among them, and then this is given to the people whether it is good for them or not.\n\nNow I don't think the typical American goes this far, but I do think the idea of undue influence is fairly pervasive, and not totally wrong. The reactionaries just take it to an extreme. I don't experience this too much in my field (a hard science), but I think the soft sciences (I'm including political science in here) do pretty often become used for policy and legitimizing lines of thought. And so I think people are a bit spooked by the idea of academics they know nothing about and didn't elect having such a say in their lives.\n\nTake for example that whole debacle over gender identity up in Canada. Essentially they've written a law that recognizes things like gender fluidity and gender being unconnected to sex. Now whether you think those are true or not, it's still a case of a position created by and pushed by academics becoming public policy without the people \"catching up\". And even the idea of the people catching up to academics is essentially assuming academics have full control on the direction of progress.\n\nSo from the perspective of a layperson it can seem like an elite class disconnected from the views or support of the people, which nevertheless controls them. You know, an aristocracy.",

That's why. It's a downside of a liberal democracy or any other regime which praises mediocrity, stupidity, \"being just as fine as you are\" or the base classes (hindouism-and-Mohand-Gandhi-personal-beliefs-rooted Indian democracy, proletarian socialism of the Soviet Union, theocratic Islamic democracy of Iran and so forth).

Out of EU/NA/Asia, I do think that Asians accept education especially in the medical field (physician, pharmacist, dentist, etc...) that doesn't really fit into the engineering/finance. Also, this breaks down by precise country as Korea (eng) is not Japan (no social sciences) nor China (medical professions OK).\n\nI agree that there is some hostility toward humanities/social science field but I think it's more extreme where tuition is considered (US/UK) than on the continent.\n\nIn addition, I find continentals much more open to the arts than those in the US/UK and much more appreciative of a PhD than those in the states.",

      "text": "there is significant empirical evidence to suggest that academics, to a large extent, serve the powerful, and not the people. \n\nTake the following examples: \n\nNAFTA hurt working people in all 3 countries it was applied to, yet 300 of the top economists supported it and said it would make things better. (you can read this in a 1993 new york times article. Economists have also recommended the policies that third world nations carry out in general. These policies are despised to such an extent that you typically have to murder a large amount of peasants to force them on the country. google these: The chicago boys, and the Berkeley mafia. \n\nAmerica has overthrown over 50 governments since 1945 yet there is very little scholarship on it, and the public is largely unaware of this imperial system because academics simply havn't written/talked enough on it. Some scholars in academia outright lie, like samantha power, who said the american government looked away in east timor when in fact they supported it directly. \n\nIn the sciences, academics have developed nuclear weapons, the internet, computers. Some of these things are useful, and some are simply services to power. But the public has no choice in what research $$ goes into or not.\n\nThen there are more extreme things like postmodernism, and identity politics. It's hardly useful for working class people that an academic writes 500 pages on abstract gibberish of social constructions\n\nThere are books like: manufacturing consent, and the politics of genocide, which model and make predictions about academic and journalistic propaganda. \n\nHere are 3 examples of academics that serve power.\n\nIf you go back in history a bit, in the 1920's there was an academic called henry goddard that 'proved' immigrants were imbeciles, and stupid. \n\nmilton friedman gave a thumbs up to chile's dictatorship for it's economic policy, which turned out to be a disaster, on top of the fact that the dictator tortured 30,000 people on a very savage way. \n\nIn your own profession the political scientist harold lasswell advocated the use of propaganda and rewritting history by academics in his 1927 dissertation on propaganda during the war. He also advocated opinion polling by political scientists so business could control the public with propaganda more easily. \n\nsome academics do really important work and try to engage with the ordinary folk, but a lot don't. So there is every reason to be hostile to academics. Until academics give a far bigger effort to bridge this gap, go out into the world and try to talk to people about things that matter, then i think the hostility will remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No one would dispute a claim i made if i said heidigger or frege supported nazi's. you can simply find that out by reading what they write and comparing it to the powerful.\n\nthere are comparative methods of testing whether academics support power or not, like in the books i mentioned. One good example has been to compare scholarship on america's foreign policy with countries the western capitalist elites don't like, and you can make predictions of that, which is what herman and chomskys propaganda model does. Although this was a study of the media, it generalizes for academia as well. \n\n",
