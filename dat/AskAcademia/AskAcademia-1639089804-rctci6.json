  "text": "Is it normal for government postdoc jobs to take time post interview? I applied for a job that had a 11/15 deadline. Got a notification for interview scheduled for today. The job is a great fit for me. But at the end of the interview they said they would ideally like someone to start asap but still have a few weeks to go in the process. That does not seem to be a good sign to me. Generally that long means they have others ahead of me or I didn't make the cut. What is the consensus on this? I think the interview went well and there was even some chit chat. But having given enough interviews to date, I am no longer sure what counts as a clincher.",

Hiring in a new fed (or even a transferring fed) is a long, cumbersome process. We're also in a continuing resolution so they may not be able to proceed without their FY22 funding.",
