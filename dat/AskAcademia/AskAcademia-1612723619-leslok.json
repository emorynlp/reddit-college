  "title:": "Should I use a pen name for my (fiction) writing career?",
  "text": "(Using a throwaway.)\n\nHello! I\u2019m a current JD/PhD candidate at a top university in the US with an interest in joining the legal academy. In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, and I was lucky enough to have my first novel picked up by an agent and a large publisher here in the States.\n\nI have a very unique name (first Google hit), and I\u2019m wondering if I should publish this novel under a pen name. I hope to continue to write fiction throughout my life and don\u2019t want it to adversely affect my academic publications or hiring. My fiction isn\u2019t anything particularly spicy (not erotica or anything) but it doesn\u2019t have much to do with my legal research interests, and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s best to keep them entirely separate. I\u2019m generally a very, very private person so I\u2019m leaning towards the pen name, but I\u2019m wondering if you all think it\u2019s necessary in terms of protecting my academic career. \n\nThank you so much!",

You never can tell when somebody who has some influence over your education or your career might decide that they don't like it for some reason and makes your life difficult. I could easily see somebody thinking that it takes too much time or it shows that you aren't committed or some other foolishness.",

It was purely to keep my personal work and professional work separate (I too have a very unique name). I was never worried about \"privacy\" per se, as anyone who knows me can connect the dots and I talked about my book on my own social media, but I intentionally kept the names separate for the sake of the internet age and ease of finding out information with one google search.",

      "text": "As you've said your creative writing isn't related to your academic studies, then yes I'd recommend using a pen name. I've been told it's common practice and writers will often use pseudonyms for more banal reasons than yours--for example, if someone wrote crime and romance, they would use two separate pen names so that their readers don't get confused.\n\nI know you've said that you write about different subjects, but just in case anyone else is reading this--if your academic and non-academic writing were related then you might be better off by writing under the same name. Let's say you were writing courtroom dramas and studying the law, then your creative writing would be assumed to be informed by your research experience, and your research would find new readers via the fans of your creative work. This would be a win-win for both sides of your career.",
