  "text": "I'm a UK MA (humanities) student and I'm deep into my first semester and have looming deadlines. I absolutely love what I'm studying, principally African/Haitian history and Postcolonial literature/politics, but the fields are so vast and complex. So much so that I often feel as though I'm an imposter scholar with no validity or credibility and no right to be making additions to this field. \n\nDid any you feel a similar way? If so, how did you overcome this feeling of being an imposter with no worthy contributions to your field?",

It helps somewhat to have colleagues who believe in you, so if you have ones who don't, then avoid them at all costs. Decide whom you trust.\n\nWhenever I'm asked to do something that I'm not sure I'm really qualified for, like when I was asked to be department chair, I told people, \"I'll do this until you find somebody better.\" And that keeps me going. I just do what I can, knowing that I'm just buying time until the \"real expert\" comes along.\n\nIt's been several years now, and they still haven't found anybody.",

              "text": "A couple of things about the dissertation itself:\n\n1. Find an adviser whom you trust implicitly and whom you think genuinely cares about you and your success. They don't have to be some kind of magic movie mentor, but they have to be genuinely interested in supporting students enough to tell off another committee member who goes toxic on you. If you can't find anybody like that, go to the chair of graduate studies and tell them that you can't find anybody who's legitimately supportive of grad students. But in my experience, somebody always cares. It's not always the full profs! Sometimes look for somebody who's been an associate prof for too many years--they're often too busy helping grad students or undergrads to play the political games that get you promoted to full prof.\n2. Try to relax! I know it's hard (I know!). But a lot of people do themselves a disservice by thinking that their dissertation is some kind of opus, and it's going to define their career or something. Yeah, that sometimes happens. Other times, the dissertation is a footnote in your larger work. It was for me. The older you get, the further you drift away from that dissertation defining you as an academic.\n3. Read some other dissertations in your \"free time\". Seriously. You'll be shocked by how bad some of them are. That's the bar you have to clear! It helped me sleep at night.",

As an MA student you're brand new into the research arena and all of a sudden you're back at the bottom of the pile in terms of experience and possibly knowledge. Just take each idea as it comes, discuss things with your peers and you'll find your path. I'm a post-doc and I sometimes feel like a fraud but when you're at the frontier you're not expected to have all the answers already. Good luck!",
