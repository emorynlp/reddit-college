  "title:": "Is lecturer job impossible to get with little experience in teaching?",
  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nAs stated in the title, is it impossible to get a lecturer job in a university in the Uk if I have little experience in teaching? A bit of my background, PhD in one of engineering fields, non-native English speaker, never taught a class by myself before, mostly just helped my supervisor in class. \nI applied to a lot of lecturer positions, but got rejected. I\u2019m kinda seeing it coming though. It just crushed me a bit every time.\nAny tips would be appriciated. thanks guys.",

      "text": "You need to ask faculty members in your professional network to look over your application material and tell you where your biggest weaknesses are.  Of course your application would be stronger with teaching experience, but nevertheless it's entirely possible that you're focusing on entirely the wrong thing.  You may need more years of postdoc, stronger publications, a better track record of funding, a far better research statement, etc etc.",

          "text": "Lecturers are appointed on a long list of criteria and teaching experience is only one of them, reflecting the fact that the job is diverse.  Make sure your application highlights, concisely, how you clearly satisfy every one of the criteria in the desirables list in the person specification. HR departments receive 100s of applications for each lectureship post and they have to whittle the applicants down to a short list of 5 or 6 for interview.  HR is looking for reasons to reject your application. Don't give them any.",

      "text": "The thing to realise is that, as a general rule, ASER lecturer positions at UK unis are advertised to fill a specific need within the host department. Usually (again, I'm really generalising here) that will be at least in part to cover a gap in existing teaching provision, or to drive the teaching of the department in a different direction, responding to strategic planning (usually around student recruitment). This might be explicit in the job advert, but if it isn't, it's worth emailing the named contact to specifically ask (politely, formally) what specific teaching needs the host department has in the immediate term.\n\nBecause teaching provision is often more important, in the immediate term, than research, you will at least need to demonstrate that you \\*could\\* teach some of the existing material, and offer some new stuff. It's one of the hardest things recent PhDs have to navigate in the hiring process, I think -- you have spent 4 years or so narrowly focussing on your own research, and now you need to demonstrate that you can become a colleague by showing you are capable of being a bit more of a generalist, teaching things to undergraduates that are not slap-bang in the centre of your specialism.\n\nIf you haven't got teaching experience on your CV, you can certainly massage those gaps by explaining how you have developed the skills needed in other contexts -- presenting at conferences, say. \"Helping your supervisor in class\" can certainly be presented as \"Occasional Graduate Teaching Experience\" or similar, as appropriate. You should also ensure that your cover letter, or somewhere else in your application, specifically mentions the courses in the current module map that you could teach immediately, and perhaps also what courses you'd like to develop which would complement the existing offer, based on your specific expertise. Many applications also require a \"statement of teaching philosophy\", in which you can do this kind of thing too.",
