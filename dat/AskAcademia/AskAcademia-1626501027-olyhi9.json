  "text": "I presented at an international conference in 2019 and voluntarily submitted a paper based on my presentation to the conference proceedings. \n\nThe conference paper was not peer-reviewed and it\u2019s only available on the conference website. \n\nCan I use my conference paper as the basis for a research article intended for submission to a peer reviewed journal? It\u2019d be using the same qualitative data.",

      "text": "It would depend on the field - therefore, the old saying is true: **ask your advisor** (I admittedly assume that you have an advisor; if not I apologize and admit confusion).\n\nHowever in most fields where conference papers/talks are not considered peer-reviewed (which is often an arbitrary difference from one field to another), it is usually expected that the content of the talk will be published as a separate paper in a journal. In many cases there will be a special issue in a specific journal for \"conference proceedings\" but this is not always the case.\n\nIn conclusion, **ask your advisor**.",

The association, while predominately industry-focused, do have a mid-tier peer-reviewed journal attached to them but they don\u2019t publish conference proceedings, just traditional journal articles.",

I\u2019d recommend planning with your supervisor how to expand the paper and prepare it for the right audience of the journal you\u2019re intending to submit to.\n\nSounds good and best of luck!",

If you want to be in the running for the best paper award, you can still submit your paper but let the organizer know that you only intend for the extended abstract to be published in the proceedings. I'm from social science so YMMV.\n\nThis way, you can just submit your paper as is/with minor amendments to a peer-reviewed journal.  I also echo other comments in here saying that it would be best to always consult your advisors about this. If your advisors are not well-versed in publishing, reach out to others in your network and ask them about the process.",
