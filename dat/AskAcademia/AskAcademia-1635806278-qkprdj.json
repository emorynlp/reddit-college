  "text": "The big conference in my field (AERA's 2022 Annual Meeting) just announced acceptances and rejections of proposals today. \n\nOnce again, I find myself not presenting my work, because one of the three reviewers didn't care for it. Honestly, though, when the submission's scores (out of 30) were 29, 26, and 15, and the conference organizers just roll with the total score without caring or even noticing that kind of discrepancy in reviews, it makes it difficult to take the process seriously.",

Repeatedly.\n\nAnd it\u2019s disappointing, because what it feels like, having been a scorer for a variety of systems previously, is that the flagship educational research organization has systems that are *less* rigorous than what working educators routinely encounter.\n\nCertainly, were a National Board certification candidate to have this kind of discrepancy in score, it would trigger a review by an expert rater. The same is true for EdTPA candidates, and even for high school students taking an AP test.\n\nAnd, don\u2019t get me wrong: I understand *why* AERA\u2019s process is so much less rigorous than those processes: the incentive structures are what they are. It\u2019s just\u2026 disappointing.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you want to make an argument in support of conference selection criteria as I have described them, with their wide variance and all, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you actually *make* that argument. It reads more like you\u2019re saying that the system is what it is, and I\u2019m just whining about not winning at it. Let me assure you, I\u2019m already a successful career educator, and will do just fine if my career in academia never takes off, so that\u2019s really not where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nThe thing is, I had honestly expected that finishing my PhD would lead me into even more rigorous work than what I was already doing as a teacher. Turns out, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, and that\u2019s bumming me out.",

Consider using some of this energy to look at patterns in the feedback on your submissions and adjusting how you market your work to this conference. \n\nAlso, if your work keeps getting rejected, consider whether this conference is the best place for your work. Other conferences might be less prestigious, but they might have a mix of people who are more open to what you\u2019re doing. Depending on the norms in your field and whether proceedings are published, it might be worth taking an early draft of something to a smaller conference in your field and using the feedback to improve your submission to the big conference.",

The harsh truth is that if someone thinks your method isn't up to scratch, or your interpretations aren't sound, or whatever, that is a YOU problem, not a them problem. If you ahve not communicated your work in a clear and robust enough way to win over reviewers, that is not on them.  It's a hard fact, and it's one I think we all struggle with somewhat when receiving feedback on works. Yes, there are some cases where some reviewers are just strongly against certain interpretations or methods, but that doesn't sound like it is the case here, and that is a *minority* of cases. I've certainly had those types of reviewers on papers and while it makes the review process tough, it's never resulted in something not getting through to publication.",

For example, I\u2019m in teacher education but there are 1000s of people in that section. So I put in an idea for research methodologies and it was accepted. \n\n2- when I applied I clicked that I would be ok with presenting a round table if not accepted for a paper presentation. So I ended up presenting at a round table. This was actually much more interesting to me as a presenter than a paper session as there was more conversation and feedback than I would have gotten for a paper session. \n\nAERA is a big deal but I\u2019ve definitely preferred presenting at one of my organizations for my field over AERA. I\u2019ve presented twice at AERA and over 10 times at the top organization\u2019s conference for my field in the past 10 years since starting my doctoral program. \n\nI know it\u2019s discouraging to get a rejection.

      "text": "I can't believe nobody has given the OP what he's obviously asking for. I'll try. OP, you're absolutely right - the process isn't rigorous, and you shouldn't take it \"seriously\" by confusing it with a rigorous process.\n\nLet's expand a little.\n\nBy  \"not rigorous,\" you seem to mean something like the following:\n\n1. If a paper is scored 3 times and the 3 scores are very different, this is a strong indicator that the underlying scoring process has high variance. This means that the average of the 3 scores is likely to be quite far from an ideal \"true\" score.\n2. Furthermore, this \"true\" score can be accessed by some other method - for example, by calling in an \"expert\" reviewer to act as a tiebreaker - that the conference organizers decline to use.\n\nYou also have the value statement: any process whose error is (1) large and (2) could be improved is not worth \"taking seriously.\"\n\nIf I understand what you mean by \"rigorous,\" I have good news. Conference ratings are not rigorous in this sense, nobody thinks they are rigorous in this sense, and nobody thinks it is remotely feasible or desirable to make them rigorous in this sense. If you previously took published research \"seriously\" because you thought this process was \"rigorous,\" I have more good news: you don't have to take it seriously. Actually, you should almost certainly *stop* taking it seriously in this sense.\n\nTo expand on point (1), which is  almost certainly correct: whatever you mean by a \"true\" score, a process with a high variance like this one is almost certainly not going to find it with high accuracy. This is also quite unambiguous - there is a large literature on variability in these sorts of processes. I'm not an expert, but the following was a fairly large study at a very prestigious conference:\n\n[http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/the-neurips-experiment.html](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/the-neurips-experiment.html)\n\nI don't have much to say about the value statement, except that I disagree with it. The primary goal of big conferences is not to come up with a very accurate assessment of every submitted paper, and it is a bit silly to try to assess conference \"seriousness\" in terms of that criteria.  Conferences do lots of other things - mostly they're about exposing people to a bunch of research that seems interesting. There are lots of *other* places in academia where people try to seriously check whether certain standards are met.",
