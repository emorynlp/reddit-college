  "text": " In short, I am applying for some competitive postdoc (pharmacy residency) jobs and will be graduating in May. My colleagues in my class are also applying for the same  competitive positions so things are a bit tense unfortunately. Lately, I  have noticed at least two different people copying things off of my  LinkedIn profile and my CV and formatting it to theirs. These two people  I've admittedly felt a bit threatened with how great of students they are  and how smart they are. I fear that they are copying my work and trying  to undermine my hard work I've put in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I handle this?",

One person copied word for word my introduction on the LinkedIn page. Of course this might seem so insignificant, but we are competing for the same position and it seems unethical. It seems so petty - but I get notifications everytime they look at my LinkedIn profile and it seems like blatant plagiarism",

      "text": "The tough part of this is that if anyone notices it, it looks bad for you as well as the copier. Because no one can easily tell that your version came first.\n\nHonestly, if you are still classmates, I'd gently confront them about it (in person) and offer help to smooth things over. Something like, \n\n\"Hey copier, I noticed that your linkedin intro is exactly the same as mind. I'm not really comfortable with that though. I think it will look bad to employers, for both of us. Do you want me to give you a hand in rephrasing it? We just need to make them not so similar so it doesn't look so weird.\"\n\nIt's not ideal because it's not condemning them for this unethical behavior, but I think that kind of collaborative phrasing would make it more likely that they actually do the changes. Even if you have to rewrite their linkedin intro for them, that's better than an employer thinking YOU copied THEIRS.",

Were I their faculty members, I would want the consequences to be just short of expulsion.  I would want graduates from my program to understand how damaging plagiarism will be to their careers.\n\nI suggest you tell your advisor without delay, with the goal of forcing them to change their application materials.\n\nTake down your LinkedIn page for the time being.  It would also be good to submit your application before they do.",
