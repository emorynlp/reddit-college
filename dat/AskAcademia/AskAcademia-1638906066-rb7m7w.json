              "text": "Foucault is a particularly unusual one. He's a hard author to cite the original works for because on some of his concepts aren't really spelled out in a single text thats easy to point too, so much as underpinning and across a few texts (like his theory of power)  There are then interpretations written by others of what his work means which are  sometimes the most useful source to point too for that body of work. But they are interpretations so may not be fully as Foucault intended (and they differ ) , and you can also argue they are developing the concepts of a foucauldian perspective. (So not strictly speaking always Foucault's ideas, but still foucualdian).  Add to all of this that it's almost impossible to actually understand foucualt by just reading foucualt. \n\nDepending on how deep you are getting into this it's really also a question of what you want to direct the reader too and why. This is why citing both sources is often needed here. \n\nBut in nearly all other cases , cite  the originally source",
