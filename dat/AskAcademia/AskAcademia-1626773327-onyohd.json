  "title:": "Focusing on one area vs. having several areas of focus within the same field",
  "text": "I am just finishing my PhD in a sociology/education related field, and starting a three year postdoc where I will have a lot of freedom to choose what I want to research. I recently wrote a couple of articles on top of my phd research in areas that are broadly within the same field but in a totally different area of the field to my PhD research. To be more specific, my research area is migration for educational purposes but I wrote these articles on different aspects of the sociology of education and on the more practical aspects of international higher education. The articles were accepted in q1 journals. I want to pursue these topics more but I don't know if it's a bad idea. I have heard it said that its best to have a strong focus, and a 'research narrative'. I can see how it might be better to become \"the\" expert in a single field. But at the same time I have a lot of interests and don't want to get bored. So basically, I am asking whether its okay to pursue some totally different but vaguely related topics during my postdoc and beyond, rather than focusing on one narrow area.",

      "text": "Having a research focus is important, but what is probably more important at your career stage is publishing at high-level journals, and demonstrating that you are a capable researcher. It is ultimately the latter that will get you interviews from search committees once you finish your post doc.\n\nYou seem to be doing great publishing, so I recommend you to not stop. When you are writing your research statement for your application package, you can perhaps try and (at least loosely) tie all your work together.",

      "text": "There's an old adage that you need to put in 10,000 hours to get a solid proficiency at something.  Additionally, I had a colleague change research focus every seven years. He even identified it as such, and was transitioning into #3 when I met him, during which time I published a fair bit with him, then he moved on to #4 elsewhere about seven years ago.  Together these anecdotes highlight that, yes, you can certainly have multiple interests and research streams, but there is a trade-off in time (at least until your mastery is recognized).  \n\nPersonally I have about three separate but related research foci going, with funding in two of them.  I am regularly requested to review manuscripts in all three areas, but have only been requested to write review articles for my oldest research stream (I'm mid-career).  \n\nAs an early researcher, you can pursue multiple streams, but expect to get most of your notoriety from only one of them.  Keep one that you do much of your work in, but have your side interests always developing so that you can eventually expand beyond the \"main\" research area.  This keeps the support going, and provides a good batch of side projects to get into when the main project starts getting boring.",

      "text": "I can speak to this in some ways. I'm in education. My dissertation was is one area in my field; my general research experience was in another; and my post-doc was also open, under a PI with broad interests, so I straddled a few areas. I chose areas in my post-doc based on satisfying my PI's desires for the position and based on the most marketable areas of my research when it came time to find TT positions. I also had multiple research statements that I used depending on the prospective position, department, and institution. \n\nWhile interviewing, I had search committees pointedly say that it would not be possible to pursue my dissertation research topic at their school, and I was prepared to speak about my multiple research streams and their importance while minimizing my dissertation research.\n\nI landed a TT position. It was not an R1 though, and I can see a single research stream being more important there. But I still advocate for choosing the one that would be the most enticing to search committees and/or external funding agencies. \n\nSince, I have continued to publish in all of my original research streams, some more lightly than others.. Buy, I am also sunsetting the research area of my dissertation. It is difficult to maintain expertise across multiple areas.",
