  "text": "Hi, \n\nI am an international student who has just completed a bachelor's degree in electrical and electronics engineering. I want to pursue biotechnology but I lack the prerequisites for grad school and my gpa is also low. \n\nSo I was looking for post-bacc programs in the US where I could take the required prerequisites and try to get any LORs, if possible. I could only find UPenn and Columbia University which offer these post-bacc programs, but both of them are very expensive and since I have a low gpa, I'm not sure if I can apply. \n\nDoes anyone know if any other universities offer similar post-bacc programs?\nI have also looked into second bachelor's in US/Canada but since I'm an international student, I believe it'll be hard to get the student visa. \nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has any idea regarding this, please do help.",

Check some private institutes? If you can legally work, I\u2019d skip the program and get a tech job. Not sure what you can legally do.",

      "text": ">since I'm an international student, I believe it'll be hard to get the student visa. \n\nIt's not hard to get an international student visa. Universities literally fight to attract international students due to the undergraduate student tuition fees that they pay. Many will help their students through the visa process or will redirect them to external organizations that will guide them through it.\n\nWhat is hard is finding the money to pay for those tuition fees as an international student since it's not funded. f you think post-bac programs are expensive, imagine American undergraduate tuition for 4 years.\n\n In my opinion, going back to do another bachelor degree should not be an option. Is there any way that you can do the prerequisites in your home country or in a nearby country with cheaper tuition fees than the US? Or any way you can work in biotechnologies without needing grad school even if it's not in the position you are aiming for? With relevant work experience, some universities might consider you for a master or PhD program even if you have a lower gpa",

I've heard its harder because I already have a degree. \n\nRegarding the tuition fee, I just feel it's the post-bacc tuition fee per course at Columbia and UPenn is a lot. Do you know any other universities which offer similar post-bacc programs? \n\nAnd if I'm doing a second degree, it won't take four years right? Since some courses can transfer. \n\nNo, there's no way of doing prerequisites in my country. And I don't have any relevant skills to apply for a job in biotech.",

And even if some courses can transfer, it's usually not all of them and you still have to redo most of the courses since the teaching between each university is different. That's how it works where I live at least",
