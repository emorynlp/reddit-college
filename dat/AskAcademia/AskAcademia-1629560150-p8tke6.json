  "text": "Hi, I am a foreign student in X European country but doing my master thesis in Y European country. The supervisor in X European country wants me to travel from Y country for my 30 mins defense presentation which takes 6 hours flight. Now I have applied for a residence permit in Y country and I can't leave the country to do so, I told him that and his reply was universities are not concerned with personal matters.",

You are being legally restricted by country Y to not leave its borders for a period of time, breaking that legal imposition will result in the cancellation of your visa. If your supervisor does not want to listen, then start climbing the chain of command. I assume you are currently staying in country Y with a student visa, if so i'm sure there is an office that deals with immigration issues and they need to be made aware of this.",

So being elsewhere is your problem, not theirs.",

On the one hand, thesis supervisor shouldn't care about your personal issues (even if it means they're being awful people for ignoring that you just got evicted, or that your mother died). On the other hand,  if the country were you reside won't let you out, and therefore,  there is a legal reason, the supervisor must look at it as beyond personal and figure out a way to do it. Most importantly, I've evaluated about a dozen MA and PhD defenses via ZOOM (like 100% of aupervisors this year): why is your supervisor an asshole?",
