  "text": "I recently got the opportunity to join a research lab after inquiring about open positions. Over my original talks with the professor he really sold me on the topic and future of the project, however upon speaking to other people in the lab I now want to drop out of the research project and go into a course based masters program. \n\nThe semester starts on Tuesday so it is very last minute. But how would you approach speaking about this with the professor? \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "text": "Do it in person, not by email. Thank him for his interest in you, and if you want, you can briefly explain why you feel the other program better suits your current needs. Apologise if this creates any difficulties. Let him know you are still interested and inspired by his work and hope that you can still collaborate one day soon.\n\nSo: 1 part genuine explanation, 2 parts gentle ego stroking (if you want to try to avoid burning that bridge).",
