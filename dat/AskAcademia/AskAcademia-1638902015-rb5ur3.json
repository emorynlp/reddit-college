  "text": "How would I know how to decide which researchers are good and to be trusted on? I usually use h index (excluding self citations) and anything above 30 is really good according to me, what is your take?? I saw this researcher, he writes papers on brain and physics and he absuses the amount of self citations , like this whole year he has 173 citations out of which all 173 are self citations? Moreover his most cited paper consists of 130 citations out of which 80 to 90 are just him citing himself? How would I know if what these kind of people publish is scientifically good or not? Considering he works with another researcher whose h index is around 40???\n\n\nRegards",

If my math holds up that is a tad under 40% self citation.\n\nHis publication count does not match up with what you said.  Scopus has him at 9 publications for 2021 (including 2 in press).  Google scholar has 18 for 2021, but about half are \"preprints\", so not real \"publications\".\n\nThe high level of self citation you comment on would definitely be considered possible citation abuse.   If I recall, I saw once that anything above 30% self-citation is indicative (but not conclusive) of citation abuse.  All in all I would rank him as a resounding \"Meh\".",

I wouldn't tell you the name because I don't want any conflict with them or don't want to spoil their name.

If you use scopus and check his index without self citations it drops down from 16 to 11.

I can say it would raise serious questions when either a tenure decision or tenure review came up.   The system does have a way to sort these things out.
