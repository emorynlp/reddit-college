  "text": "I understand some professors and students establish close relationships (not talking about romantic or sexual ones. I\u2019m thinking more along the lines of a mentorship). But does the professor-student relationship (and all its ethical boundaries) exist after the student leaves the college? For example, a currently enrolled student shouldn\u2019t talk to a professor about a personal issue unless there\u2019s a serious reason and it impacts their class performance (e.g., an illness is impacting their ability to complete an assignment). But, after they leave the college, is it fine for a former student to turn to their professor for personal advice? To become their friend? \n\n\nEdit: None of this post is referring to any type of romantic or sexual relationship, even after a student leaves college.",

      "text": "> But, after they leave the college, is it fine for a former student to turn to their professor for personal advice? To become their friend?\n\ntechnically, yes. However, my experience is that, once the student leaves the college, their relationships with professors move in the opposite direction of friendship, because they have no reason to interact anymore and so lose touch. I think cases where profs and students become legit friends mostly fall into situations where they are of similar ages (ie the student isn't the typical 18-22 undergrad) or where the student continues on in the field and they become friendly as colleagues.",

      "text": "You know how if you were to, say, run into your high school teacher at the grocery store, you'd likely address them as \"Mrs. Smith\" or \"Mr. Johnson\" and not \"Lisa\" or \"Bob\"? You still see them as a teacher, even if they're not in that moment your teacher. In many ways, the same is true of professors.\n\nI'm relatively early in my career, but in general, I've enjoyed opportunities to keep in touch with students after they graduate. In most cases, those conversations are primarily about supporting a student's next steps (e.g., applying for graduate school), and we may catch up a little bit, as well.\n\nMy advice to you would be that if there is a reason for you to keep in touch related to mentorship--for example, you're pursuing a career in the same field as your professor--keep it to that at first. You can certainly talk about your own life a little bit, and you can certainly ask for professional guidance, but I would definitely avoid asking for the kind of personal advice along the lines of \"should I stay in my relationship\" or \"how should I navigate my family drama\" and so forth.\n\nThere are cases in which, over time, what starts as a professor-student relationship may have more elements of a friendship than before--for example, you may share more of your personal lives with each other. This can especially be true if the professor and former student live in the same community and happen to be part of some of the same social circles, or in the context of a wider professional circle if you are in the same field. If this happens, expect it to evolve from something naturally rather than forcing it. I would not begin with the expectation that a mentoring relationship with a former professor will evolve into a friendship.",

I will always consider myself their mentor and be happy to discuss academia. As for something personal, I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable giving advice beyond my area of expertise but I would be happy to listen and refer them to more appropriate services, for example a counselor. I wouldn't prefer to become friends with former students just as perhaps a therapist wouldn't become friends with a former client. It is creating a dual relationship, in my opinion. But I'm sure there are other professors who are more comfortable with and have different preferences and boundaries, and I don't really speak for anyone but myself.

      "text": "I have two past professors that I'd genuinely consider my friends, one I think if I ever got married I'd ask to be in my bridal party. They're both people who were very open, honest, and supportive of me, and where (because of some unique circumstances) I was able to mirror that and be supportive of them in very diferent ways. \n\nTo me there's two critical things that made that possible: \n\n1) There were clear ways to not be under their influence if anything went wrong. For example, one of these friends was a co-supervisor in my research lab. The other supervisor controlled the funds that paid me, was the original one to hire me, and could be my only contact in lab if anything went wrong.\n\n2) There was actually something unique about our relationships. Professors meet hundreds of students every semester and they don't have the time or interest in developing a relationship with every student. Sometimes things click and sometimes they don't.\n\nA more direct answer to your question (\"But, after they leave the college, is it fine for a former student to turn to their professor for personal advice?\") would be that if you don't have that relationship, springing personal questions on a professor could feel really invasive. That said, you likely have common interests and experiences with your professors, and it's natural to continue or expand on that sort of communication. If you see things they might be interested in academically or personally (eg your professor made jokes in class that they're obsessed with... shetland ponies, and you see there's an expo in their county) it's nice to send a note and a \"thought of you!\" just like with any other person. In my experience sometimes that can develop into a more casual mentorship/relationship.",
