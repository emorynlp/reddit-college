  "title:": "How to go about studying the intersection of Computer Science and Philosophy?",
  "text": "I am in the beginning of my freshman year doing a dual degree in Philosophy and Computer Science (both as part of the Honors program).\n\n**My dream is to go into a field where I can research, explore, and converse about the intersection of technology and ethics.**\n\nAI seems like a huge opportunity for this, and it also appears to me that a lot more discussion is needed around technological topics in order to refine our legislation for the ethical use of new software and hardware. Additionally, though I have very little education in it, I'm very interested in neuroscience.\n\nI'm not trying to plan my entire life right now, not trying to get ahead of myself, but I would love to have more of an idea of HOW to get where I want to go, and what job opportunities might exist for me to do research in this field.\n\nMy school offers a 5-year Masters program in Computer Science and Information Systems, which would tack on an extra year to my studies in order to graduate with a BA in Philosophy, a BS in Computer Science, and a Masters in Computer Science/Information Systems.\n\n**I'm just curious whether a masters degree might be for me in either field, if a PhD would help me with doing more specialized research in the combination of them both, if there are jobs out there for this, etc.** Any advice you might have would be amazing! Thanks.\n\n**TL;DR: What type of education would help me with pursuing technological ethics? What types of jobs exist in this field?**",

      "text": "It's great that you're thinking about this so early.\n\nOne thing that you should do at this point in time is try to identify academic papers on topics that interest you to get a feel for the language, topic areas, and people in the space. In addition, try to identify any related labs or professors at your school who research/publish in those areas. Take a look at some of their papers too. Then I would suggest reaching out to them, telling them what interested you about your work, what your ambitions are, and ask if there are ways to get involved in their labs or with their research as an undergrad. This is how you start to build connections, work experience, and eventually open up doors for whatever you decide your best path is.\n\nOne place I would suggest starting with for papers at the intersection of ethics and technology is the[ ACM FAccT](https://facctconference.org/) conference.\n\nI would suggest that a PhD would be your best bet if you are interested in research in this area, but it's still super early days for you to consider that, so start with reading papers and dipping your toe in the work and then see how you feel in a few years!\n\n*edit* Also, since you asked what kinds of jobs exist in this field, I think a lot of us on this sub can speak to the academic opportunities more than others, since this is /r/AskAcademia, but big tech is also hiring ethics researchers at this point in time, so you would likely not be limited to academic jobs if you studied this. However, I do think it's common to have a PhD to get hired in tech for this kind of thing.",

      "text": "There are masters degrees in AI and Ethics, Cambridge through their Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence offer one in [AI Ethics and Society](https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/course/mst-ai-ethics-and-society), there are probably others (MIT probably has some similar programme, I know there's a sizeable AI and tech ethics group at NYU), I'd reccomend doing your 5 year masters to get the technical background and then perhaps doing one of these masters degrees (although they tend to be *super* expensive and not really worth it, I'd actually reccomend an MRES unless you're open to doing a PhD). You might also want to think about law. \n\nAs for jobs, AI and tech ethics is a growing field, an increasing number of companies and institutions are recognzing that they need people on staff to consider these issues, there are some issues (there's been a whole to do with Google in the past year) but there are jobs! Similarly its a growing field in academia. \n\nAs for plans you need to think about which academic silo (or methodology) you primarily want to approach this from, are you a CS person who does ethics, or an ethicist with a CS background. Don't want to plug 'go to law school' too much but as someone who works in 'tech ethids' I've found being situated in a law school to be a great advantage, if for no other reason that people are more willing to talk about 'law and policy' than 'ethics' even if once they've made the mistake of letting me in the room I point out that ethics needs to be the foundation of any law and policy!",

Early AI research really strattles this line. There's also philosophy of science and ethics perspectives. Esp. With grad school you have discretion on how to shape your research. IMHO a home dept in IS/CS will have a bigger arc of opportunities. All BS from someone with a data centric social science degree with who always winds up at Aristotle.",
