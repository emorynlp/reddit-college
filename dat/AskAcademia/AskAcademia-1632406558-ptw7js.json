  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nIn March 2020, my university advertised for a voluntary research assistant to analyse some data in return for a publication with a full Professor and a Research Fellow who recently completed her PhD. The data is from her PhD.\n\nI put my hand up, and I analysed the data within the required time-frame. The topic was outside of my  field (nursing, as opposed to psychology). I was then sent the introduction and method, which were poorly written, but salvageable. I was then asked to write the discussion based on the data. I didn't have time to learn about a whole new field, and I was also working on my masters degree, so the paper was left for quite some time. I have also recently begun a PhD.\n\nThe Professor has said that she only wants an active role in the paper once it's a full draft, and the Research Fellow then went on maternity leave. We have organised a couple of meetings to discuss the paper, but we haven't made much progress.\n\nThe Research Fellow is returning from maternity leave in a few weeks, and has said that the Professor has told her that she will allocate some of her working hours towards the paper, so that she will have more time (and $$) to work on the paper. I don't know what the Research Fellow's expectations of me are, but I gather that she would still like me to contribute substantially.\n\nI feel a little slighted that she is getting paid and I'm not. Am I justified in feeling this way? What would you recommend I do?\n\nMany thanks!",

She agreed to employment in exchange for a salary, you agreed to volunteer so that you'd get a publication in return. So no, this aspect of your feelings is not valid.\n\nNow, if your complaint was instead that you originally signed up for data analysis and then a load of new work was given to you, that would be reasonable. But when you were given additional tasks you should have tried to change the terms of your arrangement. By continuing on you accepted maintaining your unpaid voluntary role, and it is a little ridiculous to now get salty that a research fellow is being paid to do research.\n\nWhat you can do now is try and negotiate terms or scale back your involvement, but you'll want to make sure that you have authorship matters settled and in writing before doing so.",
