  "title:": "I found error in my methodology part of Master thesis one year after I graduated",
  "text": "I'm currently a PhD student and my research project is a continuation of my Master research, so I refer to my Master thesis a lot. I only recently realized that I made a mistake in study design. I meant to write \"descriptive laboratory\" (I found this in my notes) but instead I wrote \"prospective observational\". I don't know how I came to write a completely different word, maybe I got mixed up at the time. I only clarified about the study design after thesis defense, it was a correction requested by the external examiner but all corrections made after defense were only checked by my supervisor and internal examiner. I guess they missed that part maybe.\n\nAll the results and conclusions are not affected, and I didn't include about study design in my published paper. I wonder if I still should make some kind of correction? Will it affect me in the future? I'm thinking no one really reads a Master thesis but I'm not sure. Any suggestions?",

      "text": "You most likely can't change your masters thesis, especially if it's already lodged with the library. If you build on that specific method in your phd thesis, you could cite your masters thesis and note the correction very briefly in your phd thesis. Otherwise I wouldn't worry. I made much bigger editorial stuff ups in my phd thesis.",
