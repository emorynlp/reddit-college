  "text": "This is a tough time for everyone, especially those on the job market.\n\nFaculty - do we think normalcy will return this following academic year? I know a lot of this is speculative but any inner anonymous conversations and insights you can relay would be appreciated.\n\nSadly, one of the positions I applied for cancelled their search due to Corona. What do you suggest I (and those in the same situation) do? Unfortunately post-doc positions are tough to come by due to lack of funds for programs. I can live with a family member and publish while working a part time job. \n\nWill this hurt me though if I don\u2019t have these papers to count towards tenure somewhere? Should I just aim high and ensure the acceptance process drags out while getting some coals in the fire? Or should I instead try to get as many pubs as I can in the meantime?\n\nThis situation is unprecedented to be sure, but seems to have some parallels to 2007-2009.\n\nAny advice would be welcomed. Any other grad students or newly minted PhDs like myself please feel free to chime in as to your strategies and thoughts during these trying times.\n\nBest wishes and good health to you and yours.",

But universities seem to chase fame and glamor, and the pandemic has certainly changed what is \"fashionable\". I wonder if there is a chance that all the R1s in the country decide they needed their own computational epidemiology programs (\"epidemic modeling, so hot right now\") to emulate Neil Ferguson / Imperial College.\n\nGiven the fact that I am on the verge of finishing a postdoc in that very field, I am just going to keep pretending that is the case for the sake of my mental health.",

A couple of days ago Oxford had a paper in Science about how apps can be used to trace Corona infection chains. Which is literally what South Korea has already been doing for two months. It is really depressing to see how western \"prestigious\" universities are trying to cash in on Coronavirus by publishing the obvious. It also shows the bias of journals like Science towards western scientists. I mean, the Chinese and Koreans showed that restrictions and apps work. We don't need western scientists to tell us that for us. Depressing.",

My problem is with my academic colleagues who have decided to outsource huge chunks of the academic evaluation process to Nature Springer.

Biggest profit margins outside of tobacco, I read once.\n\nI don't think we can blame post-docs etc. for chasing that particular dragon when it's all they're told, or can be blamed for perpetuating it. It's the job of folk with real power and security to encourage people away from it with concrete alternatives. For example: Wellcome using it's 'Wellcome Open' journal format which basically eschews journals completely, or REF panels which hide the journal the paper in question was published in. I think that's hard because a lot of the rules we play to (at least in the UK): get published in a top journal, get a big RCUK (now UKRI) grant, be a LEADER PERSON who only publishes IMPACTFUL work which has SYNERGY (etc. etc.), are made by people who \\*did that\\*, and don't see that they're in the minority who worked 24/7 and cared about nothing else.\n\nI think not having a problem that some journals like big fat headlines over (sometimes boring, minute) rigour is what got us reproducibility crises in different fields (which never even really hit wet-lab stuff where it is/was probably worst).",

That's pure hypocrisy.\n\nI disagree on some aspects. I'm a tenured lecturer, who wants to do the genuinely best science. I'd happily publish anywhere, really - pretty much everything goes on biorxiv now anyway - but my promotion criteria and indicators are all about esteem, funding and 4* papers. If they became about collegiality and markers of robustness (e.g. publishing in PLOS; evidence of data sharing etc; mine actually *is*) then great, I think people would go down that route. \n\nBut it's only really the people in a good position that have the privilege of deciding what we make people chase, and that includes promotion criteria and grant applications which ask reviewers to consider the journals you've published in. I don't think it's right for me to tell a PhD student 'don't bother with a top journal: your chances of a good job go down, but you'll not be perpetuating a system'. I mean, I could explain the situation and let them decide, but I'd also tell them that the system is not out to save you, and martyrdom is daft.\n\nI think what would benefit us all:\n\n1. REF is 100% blind to where something was published.\n\n2. promo criteria ignores journal impact factor. \n\n3. badges like Athena SWAN for markers of robustness, e.g. data sharing.",

If it was going to happen, it would have all happened 20 years ago when the internet made cheap publishing possible. I don't see how will the system will ever change. The system currently selects for impact, meaning that the vast majority of the next generation of senior scientists will be people who are skilled in the dark arts of peddling perceived impact. And they in turn will perpetuate the same system upon the generation after them. The EU tried to force change with  Plan S, but the senior scientists screamed blue murder. That was very eye opening for me. It became clear that senior scientists pay lip service to open access, but actually have no real interest in it. For example, in my field, the primary cheap open access journal that I regularly publish in has recently had its editorial board filled with high profile scientists. None of them actually publish their best work open access themselves, but they act as editor at an open access journal because it looks good on their own CV. It's all about being seen to do the right thing, but not actually doing the right thing. Every now and then they might publish open access, but only after being rejected from glam mags.\n\nI'm not really trying to be a martyr. I just do what is right by my own work. I came to the conclusion a couple of years ago that if academia does not want to adhere to the principles of scientific integrity and open access, then I don't really have an interest in a permanent career in academia. It is not a prize within itself. A martyr dies for the cause. Leaving a rotten system is not equivalent to dying, it is moving on to something better. I have many colleagues from my PhD cohort, who are much smarter and skilled than me, who came to the same conclusion years ago and didn't even bother applying for their first postdoc. They now have successful and rewarding careers in data science.\n\nI'm not being negative here, just making a cold, hard observation.",

But if they do, there's a good chance that they will have to do it online which means colleges will be unable to charge room and board to maintain their physical campus infrastructure.  Related to cost is the abysmal financial situation of most schools.  Without a steady flow of students paying to actually live on campus and attend class, many schools won't be able to afford staying open and will have to close.

Smaller and struggling colleges have outright closed. This means shit is going to be dicey for 2020/21, and probably a year or two after. There will be budget shortfalls  20/21 that will have to be made up the next couple of years.\n\nEven if you can't get a job somewhere, you might check at your PhD-granting institution (or a nearby university) if you can get some sort of \"visiting scholar\" status. Usually, this only amounts to a library card and getting on some mailing lists for events. But it can be something on the CV. But as /u/phonograhy said, people know this is a shit market, and they're not going to hold it against you.\n\nI'm not sure from your post, but finishing your PhD is the most important thing.
