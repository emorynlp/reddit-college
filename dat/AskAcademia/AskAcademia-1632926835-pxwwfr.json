  "text": "I've been working with my PhD advisor for almost four years and it is still hard for me to deal with the fact that my advisor is just not good at managing students. He is by no means the worst - I've heard a lot of horror stories - but I just don't think he has his students' best interests. He has advised against me attending workshops and conferences, publishing papers earlier in my PhD, and applying for fellowships (which I did on my own and received) and jobs. He is also usually pretty bad at providing constructive feedback - it ranges from vague critique that doesn't help at all (something like one comment that says, \"this is not good. need to improve\" for a 10 page document) to nitpicking and telling me that edits (that he requested and made) don't make sense because he deleted important sections of the manuscript. He has done the same with his other students, so I know it is not something personal. \n\nBefore I was able to stop taking it personally, I was really struggling, both in terms of my mental state and my actual research progress. Honestly, I probably would not have lasted this long in the program if I didn't get support from a therapist and loved ones in addition to finding other research mentors. \n\nI know that his behavior may be the norm for some PhD programs, but I am feeling more and more frustrated that students have to deal with this, even if it is common-place. All of his students at this school so far have been young women who he himself recruits straight from the undergrad program that have little to no research experience. He apparently does this because he likes 'molding' students' work'. I am frustrated that he finds us, persuades us to take the opportunity with little experience, and then spends 4+ years providing little to no mentorship and actively recommending against pursuing academic and professional development. I'm not even going to mention how often he makes comments about our physical appearance. \n\nI know that I shouldn't expect anything new at this point and grad students have little power to change anything, but I am getting increasingly disappointed about the fact that there are so many mediocre advisors in academia, even among those who champion for their students. It is one of the reasons why I would like to stay in academia if I can - to actually help students flourish and develop themselves. I wish I could tell my advisor point blank how unhelpful he is, but I don't want to risk any repercussions, especially because he hasn't done anything blatantly wrong and is tenured/department chair. At this point I just want to finish and go, but if he continues to recruit students, I don't see anything changing for them. \n\nI apologize in advance if I sound naive or entitled, and I guess I am looking for commiseration more than anything else.",

      "text": "Think of it this way: *why* should you expect a prof to be a good mentor? There is literally nothing that prepares those following the academic path in mentoring, it's not a quality that is selected for in the TT search process, and if a prof is a shit mentor, they don't have to deal with the consequences. Frankly it's a miracle there are any good academic mentors at all.  \nIt's the peter principle. They've finally been promoted to a level where they are incompetent.",

              "text": "They do care about it. There is just no good way to screen for good mentorship skills as other have mentioned it isnt trained or selected for in recruitment. \n\nUltimately students need to vote with their feet. If a prof graduates no students they will not get Tenure. If they have tenure and cant find students their high risk projects are in jeopardy as postdocs quit unexpectedly and are shorter duration.\n\nIf it is a big lab with a bad mentor there are usually future PIs of America there as long term postdocs that are a resource.\n\nI commiserate with you. What we can do now is 1. Warn future students from joining. 2. Teach others to due their due diligence agressively. 3. Teach others to ignore the sunk cost feeling, and bail at year 1 or 2 when things feel bad for you.\n\nI will end in that my postdoc PI was a terrible PhD mentor but a decent postdoc mentor, so mentorship is a bit different depending on where you are professionally.",

      "text": "I hear you so much. This unfortunately is not unique to academia, it's just particularly acute because you have so many early career researchers whose careers are reliant on their managers in a way that doesn't happen so much elsewhere.\n\nYou sound like you really have your shit together and your observations are very insightful for someone so early in their career. I realise it's little consolation right now but such insight and the experience you've had may turn out to be a strength later in your career as you start to manage people and move upwards in your career. \n\nLastly, if this is something you truly care about there are increasingly jobs aimed specifically at improving research culture and management and mentoring. Lots of funders (particularly the charities and foundations) are taking this on. Wellcome in the UK have a few jobs going right now and I'm fairly sure Gates and CZI both have initiatives which touch on some of these issues.",

Thanks for the references, will look into those!",

With a bit of luck there's a place out there where you'll be able to improve research culture AND get credit for it! \n\nBut if nothing else use this experience to shape how you want to approach management and leadership. I've had awful bosses, I've had amazing bosses, and I've been bullied. I've taken something from each experience and while I'm obviously not a perfect manager I do try to consciously consider my management style and approach and I think about my team and what they need.",

      "text": "Uggh, If your advisor were the female cis gender I would assume it was my former advisor. It is a common trend to have advisors who care more about their own interests than their grad students. I'm just going to say it. I apologize if I offend the truly dedicated, good mentors out there. You are gems, all of you. But a lot of the PIs I have met in grad school are rotten. They go after their own grant money to the expense of teaching their students who to grow independently into researchers. They cannot give balanced critical feedback. They are out of touch with what it means to be a grad student in this day and age. Even just acknowledging the broader life changes that most of us go through during the time of life that we generally enter grad school is a massive undertaking for them. It's like, do you have amnesia??!--damn. Amnesia at least is a tractable disorder. Working with a lot of PIs, I wonder if they aren't just checked out but suffering massive delusions. \n\nIn reference to your experience:\n\n1. How can you show that you are working efficiently and developing deep expertise without publishing?! It's delusional to think that in this day and age a student can enter the job market competitively without pubs. Stop blocking students' success. Sometimes I think this boils down to PI ego, and not wanting to release work until they scrutinize it to the nth degree. Well, timeliness is essential in today's market. If your ideas are any good, watch out-You will get scooped.  Piss or get off the pot, PIs!\n2. Securing your own awards and funding is a big deal. Why don't they support you in that?!  It helps make things efficient for their lab too. They can bring in more students if they don't have to continuously fund each one on the department funds or their personal grants.\n3. I find it very counter-intuitive that individuals who can earn tenure-track jobs cannot provide constructive feedback on 10 page documents. These are people who are often asked to serve on panels to determine high-stakes grant awards!! I think it may be a prioritization issue. If that's the case, you can try to manage up, get other people involved, but it still may not help. In the words of Busta Rhymes- Light that ass on fire.\n\nAny time you escalate and signal some wrong-doing by your main PI,  you are making yourself vulnerable as a student. However, ask yourself if you are self-sabotaging by staying in this situation. If you graduate with no prospects you could spend years trying to get your life on track. You owe it to yourself to advocate. Have a back up plan. Is it too late to try to find another lab in your department? You are in the 4th year and many would vehemently say don't switch labs this late. HOWEVER-I know a few students who did this BEFORE THEIR DISSERTATION PROPOSALS because of toxic relationships with their primary advisor. It is not easy but I have seen it work out. If you haven't proposed yet, there may still be time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me what helped was securing my own NSF and NIH scholarships and getting the research done. I managed myself pretty independently except when it came to the writing. I was always being blocked by my PI and I wasn't the only student who experienced this. We all did. I just focused on getting my dissertation done and hoping to publish in my postdoc. Happy to talk on chat here in Reddit if you wanna discuss more.",
