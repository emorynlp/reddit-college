  "title:": "Why is it so difficult to get a job in academia?",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have been a casual academic since 2013, when I undertook my PhD, which I was awarded in 2017. I wasn't hired back at my university last year after first semester, and have been on Jobseeker ever since, applying vigorously for whatever academic roles I can find in my area (including casual roles at whatever uni is hiring them), and an assortment of writing/journalist jobs. But I cannot for the life of me land a job.\n\nI am 31, I have published two books with Palgrave Macmillan, and have a good publication record in media and cultural studies (several book chapters, articles all in reputable journals/books), and a good teaching background with great reviews. My parents (who I still live with since I can't afford to rent in Sydney) keep suggesting that I retrain to be a high school teacher, which I am now pretty much thinking is my only option.\n\nI realise that Covid has made what was already a notoriously difficult industry that much harder to get into, but can someone please shed some insight into the academic situation in Australia at the moment? I get good feedback from employers but I never even progress to the interview stage. It's very disheartening going from a promising PhD to someone dealing with Jobseeker providers and having essentially no future. Any words of advice/wisdom would be very much appreciated, thanks.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you to everyone for your kind words and fantastic, invaluable advice. I really appreciate all of your responses and the time you have taken to reply. It's amazing (yet quite despairing) to see how many people are grappling with the same issues!",

The position was up for the university minimum two weeks. Advertised no where. We got almost 40 applicants, all with at least a MA, some with PhDs ranging all over the humanities and all over the world. It\u2019s grotesque underpayment for a hell of a lot of work. And yet in my department we were so relieved to be able to keep the full-time line, so that we wouldn\u2019t have to hire adjuncts for our classes instead - they\u2019re allowed to make a max of $18k/yr with no benefits or security of employment. It\u2019s fucking depressing.\n\nUniversities are businesses that happen to educate, profiting off the exploitation of the many teachers and researchers who believe in that mission.",

It does not guarantee anything; I've had to not hire friends before, because they just weren't the person the committee wanted the most and didn't fit the job as well as others, and it's super hard to choose among really good people. But it definitely can help get the foot in the door, and that's super important. \n\nSometimes this is about networking, sometimes this is about doing the kind of work that gets a lot of attention, sometimes this is about professional service (having a role in your professional society can be a way to get a lot of exposure as someone in your field), sometimes it's just about having a very well-known Twitter account, etc. \u2014 but being a known quantity before they read your cover letter can help a lot at making it past the first cut.",

In fact, if you are open to teaching at a PUI then that \"famous\" advisor probably won't matter at all. What will is having lots of teaching experience and an *extremely* well-chosen set of primary and secondary fields. These days when we're hiring at an SLAC or CC or most comprehensives we're looking for people who can immediately hit the ground running-- i.e. they should have courses *we need* in the bag --and who can cover multiple bases. As hiring is cut and we're all \"doing more with less\" we need any new hires to be able to teaching in a couple of subfields, or ideally even in more than one department. So a great scholar who does only one thing really well may be passed over in favor of a great teacher who can demonstrably do two or three or four things acceptably well.",

But we aren't hiring those people because of their advisors at all, it's because they are getting better teaching experience and have more potential for success. In most cases nobody on the search committee will have any idea who Famous Advisor X is, and of course many of not most of those candidates didn't work with Famous Advisor anyway, but likely some ambitious assistant or associate instead.",

Hiring is decent in some areas of the US, but if Biden admin can get some of the funding through that they've discussed (e.g. family plan infrastructure), jobs will increase in that area. \nWhile some of the \"you can't get hired if not lucky\" is true, I'd argue that a good portion of that is people 1.

The job market is not great anywhere but the unis who were less dependent on international students were not hit quite as hard. With all the unis though, always be keeping your eye out for job ads - the redundancy rounds go in cycles. They fire a bunch of people (awful to lose a lot of the institutional knowledge) but then they still need people to teach so hire back at more junior levels. There is still a big element of luck to getting an academic job - the uni and the school has an idea of what strategic direction they want to go in and the person they hire needs to fit into that. Don't feel too disheartened by not getting a callback in the past. \n\nThe other thing is if there are any \"transitioning to non-academic roles\" courses you could take? They can help you orient your CV differently - emphasis on skills, rather than publications, highlighting how you've worked independently and produced high level work and in teams, your creativity, communication skills, project management (PhDs are project management) etc. Industry don't know that what they actually want is someone with the skills of having done a PhD, so you have to lay it out for them. \n\nI used to view networking negatively. It didn't come naturally to me if it felt arbitrary. When it comes to talking about my area of research and hearing about other people's work that I find meaningful though, I love doing that, and that's how I built my networks. Make genuine connections with people, tell them what you are doing and that you are looking for work. Are there any senior academics in media and cultural studies in Australia who you've had some brief contact with before? Or whose work you really love? Contact them (maybe ask your old supervisor for an intro email). The worst thing that can happen is that you don't hear from them.",

No one's hiring.\n\n[https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-australian-government-letting-universities-suffer-138514](https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-australian-government-letting-universities-suffer-138514)\n\nInternational students were a huge revenue maker and they *won't* be coming back. Our two biggest markets were China and India. China's not speaking to us and the Indians can get PR much easier in the UK post-brexit, so even when borders open, they are not coming.\n\n[https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/more-than-40-per-cent-of-china-students-heed-beijing-s-warnings-20200708-p55a3o](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/more-than-40-per-cent-of-china-students-heed-beijing-s-warnings-20200708-p55a3o)\n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/uk-opens-new-post-study-work-visa-route-for-international-students/articleshow/84014339.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/uk-opens-new-post-study-work-visa-route-for-international-students/articleshow/84014339.cms)\n\nThe strategy of the G8s (Monash, UNSW) seem to be to grab as much as the local market as possible i.e lowering ATARs, which means your Tier 2 Unis (RMIT, Macquarie) are going to suffer even more as their pies get eaten by the big boys. The agile unis are expanding overseas to Tier 2 countries instead of trying to grow domestically, so forget about local hiring. RMIT and Swinburne are establishing presence in Vietnam, Wolongong went to Penang, etc.\n\nIn addition, another reason Unis are not going to be hiring soon is that they're waiting to see what the new funding metrics/ KPI are from the government.  Before COVID there was already that reduced contribution you mentioned for social studies, but behind that there's the bigger issue of the 'job ready' program that Tehan et al pushed,:\n\n[https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/government-funding-tied-university-funding](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/government-funding-tied-university-funding)\n\nBasically, the game for AUS uni used to be:\n\nGet published -> increase in THES/QS/ARWU ranking to appear shiny to Chinese/Indians -> more money from int'l enrolments-> hire more staff to publish moar -> repeat step 1.\n\nTherefore, Unis prefer to hire PhDs who have 2-3 pubs out of the gate. Nowadays, that game is mostly gone, so research output seems to be not so important to get money. Problem is, govmn't haven't really finalized what the new KPIs are, so Unis aren't sure what kind of people they should be hiring.\n\nSo for your case, it's doubly hard because you don' have a job plus there's no clear direction on how to make yourself more employable. Should you pursue more pubs? get more teaching hours under your belt? or establish industry-relevant skills transferrable to the classroom blah blah blah? I tell my PhD students to forget about getting hired domestically in the next 2 years. Best I could do is to keep them published, hire them on sessional/casual roles and get them 'unit coordinating' role whenever I can so that in case the hiring gods decide one way or another, my babies stand a chance. What does your supervisor advise?",

The lecturer roles or permanent roles that weren't cut with many of the recent Aus uni restructures have all been given to \"big name\" researchers, many of which were from overseas. The rest of the positions were lost once Covid heavily reduced our international student body and due to having a Government who fears the educated, among other reasons \n\nI do not, will not, have the publication record to ever hope of competing with hundreds of other stellar applicants in Aus academic roles. The veil was lifted for me when I started my PhD at the same time as a University-wide restructure, and I had to form a realistic career plan after witnessing the aftermath. Stability and work-life balance became huge motivators for me so I made my plan early in my PhD to move into alt-ac (was aiming for public service primarily). Earlier this year I was extremely lucky to get a fulltime, permanent consulting role in a related field before my thesis amendments were signed off. Luck is involved everywhere, but in academia it feels completely unachievable.\n\nEdit: also the Vice chancellor salaries at Australian unis are fucking insane",

The real kicker is that even if you get a DECRA, there is no guarantee of landing a permanent position after that, which is wild to me.\n\nThanks for the kind words - I don't know if I'll stay in cobsulting long term, but so far it has been enjoyable. I do miss colleagues and aspects of academia but I remember how it made me feel overall and I won't look back (maybe except for guest lecturer gigs). I'm still writing papers from my PhD and I get such dread every time I open the documents, nothing short of PTSD. \n\nNo matter where you end up in your career, remember you have skills companies/orgs want and you can help with fulfilling research in many industries.

Consulting sounds fascinating, and at least you can show future employers that you have industry experience. It's phenomenal that there's going to be a generation of PhDs who will be pouring into other industries while academia becomes an ever more fickle world. \n\nWhatever you choose I hope it works out for you! :)",

Some of them knew that they would fail, since those jobs require a lot of skill and hard work. But some of them still went on to be researchers in industry. Some got jobs as technical support specialists or analysts in healthcare or consulting positions. Some went into scientific sales or recruiting. One started his own small biotech company. In all of these situations, the individual with the PhD went out into the world and said, \"I'm going to enter a part of the economy that needs my skills and knowledge and find a way that I can add value to an organization so that I can justify a good salary.\"\n\nIf I got a PhD in Archival Science, there has to be a way for me to add value to an organization. I just need to find the right one. But if there are 1,000 surplus Archival Science PhDs being awarded each year, I would expect to have a hard time, the same way I can't count on an NHL hockey team hiring me to be a goalie.

Continue involvement in casual teaching, but industry experience will be a sought after trait for most universities.\n\nUniversities in Australia need are at least 2 years from reaching a point where it may be possible to start significant hirings, for the time being it will just be attrition.",

      "text": "It's an open secret that most jobs in academia are already taken before they are advertised. Positions are made for a candidate, and then advertised. Universities are obliged to externally advertise the position, so they do that, but the academics have literally no intention of hiring anyone other than their chosen candidate, who in many cases, is their own student or someone who they've already met at conferences, arranged a project with and secured funding. The job advert is \"merely a formality\" (I hate that term). \n\nI knew someone who saw a position advertised in her field. It position required candidates in a specific research area (small), with knowledge of a specific set of analysis techniques and software (smaller), contacts with various local agencies, and knowledge of 6 (not exaggerating!) languages (basically nobody). She had all of the above, and was **fluent** in 5 of the 6 languages and could get by in the 6th. Result: not even a response to the application. No interview. No rejection email. Nothing. Just silence. Eventually she called up and was told \"You were not a suitable candidate\".\n\nIf you see an advert, it's worth calling up the PI and asking \"do you already have someone in mind for this position\". 50/50 they will answer truthfully. It will save you some heartache. \n\nSpecifically in Australia, Universities are being hit SO hard by COVID that nobody is really hiring. They are shedding people like there's no tomorrow. Any job adverts you see are almost certainly internal transfers which are being advertised \"as a formality\".",

      "text": "In the humanities:\n\n1. Diversify your teaching as much as possible. Don't just teach at your own institution. Adjunct often. People who rely just on teaching spots at their own institution often don't have enough experience. Most jobs you apply for will be 4/4 or 5/5 teaching loads (sometimes more) so showing that you can already do something like that WHILE finishing your degree is more than useful. The last thing you want to do is look like you took it easy while in grad school.\n2. Teach a variety of styles. Teach online. Teach traditional classes. Teach regular college kids. Teach adult education. Show not just that you can do anything but that you HAVE DONE everything. Often.\n3. Present and publish on a regular basis. In the humanities, some people will advise you only to publish in the most pretigious journals. That's only true for folk who will end up at top tier places. By asking for advice here, you're probably not one of them. (No offense, just kinda true -- see all the talk about networking in these threads? If you have to START now, you're already a bit behind...) But showing consistent and regular presenting/publishing WHILE teaching a large # of courses shows that you're a workaholic. Which leads to...\n4. Be a workaholic. If you were one of those undergrads who just kinda \"got\" things and could write good papers without much stress, that's wonderful. Now it's time to stress yourself out. Devour journals. Find some way to intervene in what's being written. Go write it. Don't be one of those people who's like \"I need to spend a few months 'researching' to know where I might be able to start thinking about a topic.\" You need to think about your research as a production process. I hate to say it, but the idea that the humanities involves a very humane pace where you let ideas \"mature\" until you have some unique and thoughtful perspective is quaint but unrealistic. There's always someone out there who's published three papers on your topic while you were worrying about the subtleties of one dissertation chapter. And, fair or not (even if their papers aren't as subtle and insightful as your chapter), they're going to make it to the top of the pile at the school that desperately needs to hire someone to teach a 5/5 load and show that they won't sink or burn out.\n\nFor whatever job someone gets, there are at least 20+ (probably way more people) who will have to leave academia or fight for one composition class just to keep their CV current. You absolutely must stand out, and the one way to stand out if you're not a natural genius is by volume of work, both teaching and publishing. And even then, that just gets you higher on the stack. After that, be lucky. Be likeable, collegial, and seem like someone they can live and work with forever. And hope they like you. The market is simply so vastly oversaturated with people, all of whom are doing the same things you are, many of them better, that you have to control what you can. Never, ever, ever hope that your \"natural intellect\" or \"potential\" will simply shine through. ;) Work your ass off. At this point, hiring committees can sniff out someone who went to grad school because they thought it'd be an easy life or a way to avoid having a \"real\" job from across an ocean. And, still, a lot of people who go to grad school in the humanities act like that. So don't be one of them, and make sure you don't LOOK like one of them.\n\nIs that cynical enough? heh heh\n\nAnd as for everyone saying \"Be lucky!\", cheers to that! I taught a lot of online classes in grad school just for the extra money. While I was watching rejection after rejection roll in for traditional T-T positions, I saw an ad for a newish school that wanted someone with a ton of online teaching experience. Not T-T, but permanent, so no adjunct hell, complete with benefits, security, etc., and it's not one of those for-profit, exploitation places (which usually don't hire full time faculty, anyway). Now over a decade later, I'm one of 4 people from my PhD class of 8 who are still in academia. I don't have tenure, but this job seems to be as good as that, and my salary is commensurate with (and in one case higher) than my tenured classmates. I also didn't have to move, so my wife's career didn't get disrupted. I didn't even know a job like this existed when I started grad school. So keep your eyes open and look for opportunities beyond the usual suspects.",

But those are always scarcer and also not what the majority of people are trying to land in reality.\n\nI went to a program where the medievalists were the stars, for example. They went on to teach at Berkeley, Stanford, Ivy Leagues, etc. But when we'd have full graduate student meetings, the advisors were always very clear about the difference between them and the rest of us. And it wasn't mean-spirited at all. It was honestly refreshing because they tried to make the rest of us as realistic as possible about how we should be creating our profiles for the kinds of jobs we were likely to get.

The main reason I keep looking at academic positions in Australia is that the salary is really competitive (and the super contribution is also very generous, usually around 17%) But as everyone else has pointed out, the number of candidates outweigh the number of positions! While for high school teachers it seems to be the other way around...",

Some teachers I had were fantastic and I remember them fondly, but others...I don't know. I just don't think an education degree guarantees that the best minds will be educating the next generation!",

      "text": "Just wanted to say hello as a fellow 31 year old Australian academic with no permanent job! I finished my PhD in 2019 and don't have a book out yet (starting trying to publish just as covid hit and have had three rejections now). I have had teaching contracts consistently for the last 5 years (except 2020) and research assistant jobs on and off as well. \n\nI would definitely recommend research assistant/associate jobs if you want to stay in the loop at your institution and hang in there a bit longer while you apply for things overseas. There are really no jobs in Australia, unless you want a 3 year teaching only contract which will offer you zero security and prevent career progression. Unfortunately, I'm not in the position to move o/s due to my partner having an awesome job here. I'm planning to leave when my current contract ends - trying to find a job in the real world with some benefits and rights, though I will really miss teaching and research. Feel free to DM me if you need a pal to complain to, I feel for you.",

It's especially bad timing with Covid, but hopefully once things start opening up, an overseas job would be great. I did recently read that Australia is in for an 'ugly 2022' regarding academic jobs since international students won't return in the same pre-Covid numbers. Quite sad, really. \n\nThanks so much for your support and your helpful words, I really appreciate it. I hope everything works out for your too :)",

I'm sorry this won't help you, but never do a PhD in Australia unless you're independently wealthy and just doing it for a lark. Or maybe if you are from China or some place like that, and it's worth something back home.\n\nTry Asia, people may be more accepting.\n\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news. Tough situation, for sure, and a lot of people don't know about it when they start a PhD program.",
