  "title:": "How to cope with fear of failing a PHD?",
  "text": "Hi everyone!  \nI am about to start a PHD in a field of machine learning and bioinformatics.\n\nThe thing is, the doctoral topic i chose is not entirely within the field of my current study. Machine learning and neural networks are quiet new for me, as i've only started studying them a year ago. I am allowed to pick subjects during my PHD though.  The reason i chose it, is because i genuinely like programming, and stuff such as machine learning interests me a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Still, i constantly have this fear of failing , that i would not be able to accomplish what i signed up for and by now its driving me mad. I really enjoy doing research, but  i often keep asking myself questions such as: 'What if i get stuck?' , 'What if its impossible?', 'What if i won't be able to publish enough/ at all...?'.  I have no idea how to cope with it.     \n\n\nCan someone give me advice on how to approach this? Thank you!",

I don\u2019t mean to be rude or anything but you might want to seek out therapy if it is bad enough. Failure is the best way to learn. When you fail you gain the most valuable learning experiences. In a sense you should fail a lot in order to get good at whatever you are doing.\n\nIt\u2019s also always good to think about a backup plan and worst case scenarios so you don\u2019t starve.",

          "text": "All this. I\u2019m generally an anxious mess unless I have it under control, so had to figure out systems for dealing with fear of catastrophic failure. First, realize that small failures are all a part of the game. You will fail, but hopefully you\u2019ll also win some. Second, having backup plans for the worst case scenario is helpful in alleviating at least some of the fears. Third, turn the fear and anxiety into motivation to do the work, and to go above and beyond what you need to do to be successful. This is where I think I was able to score some of my best wins - by pushing a little harder, by being paranoid enough to make sure faculty I was working with were happy with me, etc. \n\nI\u2019m a TT AP at a top university now, and I still have a healthy fear of failure that drives me to keep going. More common failure (rejections, failed projects) you just get used to and expect.",

I had very similar motivations as you - I love programming and saw the power of artificial intelligence/ML. I failed my qualifiers. In hindsight I certainly could have passed them, but honestly I was super unmotivated by my program at the time. I did some soul searching and realized I really want to get my PhD, but in a field that I was passionate about. I talked to some professors in other adjacent fields, did some trial work, and found a professor (who is at the forefront of his specialty) that was a good match for me in a different department that really excites me. I'm going to graduate with my MS in my current field and switch to PhD in another. \n\nSo worst case scenario, you fail out and get a master's. You get an opportunity to be paid to learn what you want to learn about. I know that even if I didn't end up with a PhD, I would be happy with my time in academia.",

Both my bachelor and master were in biomedicine, and I had not done any programming or machine learning courses before my PhD. Also, since over here you get a master before your PhD, there's not a lot of course work in the PhD. So I'd say I was definitely not as prepared as you are right now.   \n\n\nAnd to be honest, the first year was quite hard. Very steep learning curve. But you just have to stick with it. The good thing about bioinformatics is that by definition you need people from biology and people from informatics (and some other fields, ideally). So I got to teach the computer scientists in the department a lot of biology and in return they taught me a lot about machine learning and programming. You have something to offer or you would not be there. Just keep that in mind, read a lot and be willing to ask for help and you'll do just fine.",

      "text": "Your situation is a bit similar to mine. I come from a biology background and I pursued masters in biostatistics I didn't know anything about machine learning or even basic statistics. My first year was scary and I thought about failing all the time. I was depressed and I felt I'm stupid because everyone is good expect me. However, I did my best and passed all classes with excellent grades except a C+ in one class and I'm retaking this one. C+ is a fail grade in grad school so I was sad. But I realized that I shouldn't take that class before I take the prerequisite. It was a mistake from my department. I took the prerequisite last semester and now I'm retaking the class I failed in this semester. I consider failing as a learning journey, I failed because I didn't understand the subject not because I'm stupid. Also, as a phd you might fail more but you should accept it. It is academia and scientist fail a lot until they succeed in their experiments. Take an example of that scientist who failed 999 experiment and succeed in the 1000 attempt.  And you are a scientist! \n\nBack to my story, I realized that I enjoy the subject and I can do it. Now I love ML and I think you are lucky you are doing phd in this subject. Believe in yourself you weren't accepted in phd if you weren't good. First year is scary because you are still adjusting with the new environment. Everything will be ok. Just seek help when you are stuck and use office hours and tutoring, build relationship with your professors.",

      "text": "One of the things I notice about a lot of comments on these sorts of questions is that people talk about what you should be thinking about or doing as if you're alone in a vacuum as an independent, disembodied brain \"doing research\". For the most part this isn't true. You will have a mentor and peers that should teach you how to do things, including easing you into doing your own work. You're not expected to just be able to do stuff right off the bat. Everyone in those situations knows you need to adjust, both personally and academically, to a new environment and way of doing things.\n\nOne of the things that has helped me so far (just starting my second year) is having a really fantastic mentor/advisor and a collection of really nice and able peers. If you're just starting out, look at all the horror stories and red flags and use them to know what to avoid in an advisor/lab (for instance, my boyfriend just wrapped up a summer RA with a professor who hasn't graduated a student in the 20 years he's been a professor, and BF is not planning on speaking with this prof ever again--turns out there's a reason nobody will work with him). A good advisor will help you find those next steps and avoid being stuck, and will make sure you stick to a timeline that matches your goals. Find an advisor that you like (i.e. you enjoy spending time with them) and that seems committed to helping YOU with YOUR path, not the other way around; so many bad advisors just want minions doing THEIR research. When you think you've found your match, try to have a bit of a \"professional development\" meeting with them in addition to regular research meetings (this was not my idea but something my university started doing for postdocs that my PI decided to use for PhD students too). Let them know what it is you want out of a PhD and what your plans are afterward; we have these annually in case these things change. During the meeting, talk about your perceived strengths and weaknesses, and what you need out of a mentor--for a while, I felt like I was floundering because I didn't know what to do next, but after the meeting I started having weekly meetings with my advisor which has helped me enormously.\n\nEveryone I've ever met that has completed a PhD has given me the same advice: once you're there, never try to think of the whole thing at once--just think about what the next steps are for you.",

I still graduated with all the accomplishments I had worked towards (publications, successful grants/fellowships, conference talks, traveling to cool places for science, etc).

Have a happy life regardless. (I'm not recommending others just drop out.)",

      "text": "I can relate to this a lot. My PhD is also outside of my educational background area (it\u2019s way more technical than my bachelors / masters). I\u2019m just going into my third year so can offer some insight. \n\nThe fact that you got onto the program means you have what it takes. The fact that you enjoy research and are motivated means you have what it takes. You care about it, your heart is in the right place, and that\u2019s 99% of getting through a PhD. \n\n> 'What if i get stuck?' , 'What if its impossible?', 'What if i won't be able to publish enough/ at all...?'. \n\nYou will get stuck, and you might come across some problems which are fundamentally impossible to solve. You might not publish any papers. That\u2019s the nature of research. We are are the front boundary of human knowledge, and we cannot be pathfinders without exploring the terrain and figuring out where paths *can\u2019t* go! Sometimes that process takes much longer than we anticipate! \n\nResilience, perseverance and overcoming those setbacks is all part of the skills you will learn and build throughout your PhD, and the sooner you are aware of this, the better. But as someone who also loves my work, I have found it to be a really rewarding experience. \n\nGood luck! :)",
