Do they go on to appropriate positions for your field?\n\nIf you are already in a low quality PhD program, you punch above your weight.  Work harder and get more productivity out.  If needed, you do a high-quality post-doc.  Post-docs at top schools are easier to get than PhD placements.  Of course, this is field dependent.",

There are some prestige chasing companies that don't want to talk to you if you're not from the top lab of your top 10 school, but in general I've seen what /u/DavidDPerlmutter said. You still need to go to a school that is good and gives you good training, but which departments any given company considers to be \"top departments\" really doesn't correlate to prestige at all. Nor do they give a rats ass about research output. It's mostly (presumably) because they hired someone from there once, liked them, hired another one, and liked them too. Now it's a pipeline.",

Employers probably don\u2019t know that, though, right \u2014 is it something I should try to emphasize?\n\nConversely, how much does postdoc institutional prestige matter? The place I\u2019ll be doing my postdoc is well regarded for its undergrad (top 10ish), but I don\u2019t really have a \u201cprogram\u201d, per se (the *subjects* of the postdoc are all top 1-10 or so). Will the postdoctoral institution supersede the grad school, as the latter did ugrad?",

(3.0) Studies of economists' career success and Ph.D. training is well developed.   What is clear is that the worst student in the best program is at a long-term disadvantaged - it damages your confidence.   At the same time, a tier-one advisor in a tier 2 or 3 institution matters more for your success.
