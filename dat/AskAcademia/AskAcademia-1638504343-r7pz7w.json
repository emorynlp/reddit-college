  "text": "Hi everyone \nI run a side business writing business plans. I gave an unpaid illustrative example of what a business plan would look like to my potential client to decide if she wanted to go with me or not\nHer business dealt with selling accessories and the plan I made was a copy and pasted food company plan as an example. We had a similar assignment in school about creating a plan and I made an accidental submission of the illustrative plan I sent to my client instead of the original work I created. I got flagged for plagiarism and I\u2019m facing the committee on the 7th. I\u2019ve tried sending them proof of the conversation I had with my client and the documentation I have of my side business. And I do have time stamps showing my original essay was created before the due date \nI\u2019m still scared of the outcome tbh \nWhat do you guys think my fate would likely be",
