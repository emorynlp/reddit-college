  "text": "So I went to this same uni for my undergrad so the staff/layout of buildings isn't a problem- I've had my introductions.\n\nThe problem is I've been made to work from home so I've never had on campus experience before.\n\nI'm more concerned about what to expect when on campus- how does supervision/ socialising work now that I'll be in a shared office of about 5-10 other PhD students?\n\nI'm a bit socially awkward and I'm feeling a bit daunted about not being able to have some alone time.\n\nAs much as I complained about working from home, I'm somewhat nervous about making a return to campus.",

      "text": "Didn't you just ask this and then deleted the post?\n\nAnyhow, my answer fin the other post:\n\nDepends on your department's culture. At the university/department I did my PhD, we had multiple open-plan spaces for PhD students. Depending on the open-plan space you were in, talking or making noise was acceptable or not. At the place that I am faculty now, PhDs tend to share small offices with just 2-3 others.\r  \n\r  \nIn any case, they have already allocated you a desk. Find where it is and then go and sit there. When you enter the office, you may want to introduce yourself. If your supervisor has other students, drop them an email beforehand. You will probably be sitting in the same area, but that is not guaranteed. Still, it will be nice to grab coffee with them. Probably other PhDs may ask you for lunch or you can just join them at the kitchen or university's PG/staff restaurant (if you are in the UK). In general, visiting the kitchen every now and then to get yourself a coffee is a good idea.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have meetings, never take them in the shared space. Do not be that person. Book a meeting room. If you have supervision meetings, they will probably be at your supervisor's office.\n\nPS: You should not feel obliged to use the office more than you need to. Unless your supervisor requires you to be there for A or B reasons, you should find the balance of working onsite and at home/coffee shops that maximizes your performance.",
