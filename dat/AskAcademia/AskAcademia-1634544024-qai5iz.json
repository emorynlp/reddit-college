          "text": "First, there seems to be a bit of a sampling bias here. Most professors like most students just fine, they just have no cause to go on r/askacademia to talk about it. So you're only seeing a loud minority. Also, there are probably a lot of profs on here who do \"hate\" their students for reasons that are ultimately irrational. That's just how it works out sometimes.\n\nSecondly - unfortunately no, I think academia is similar to all of the environments of the world, where it's not possible to learn the social rules by rote. It's just a matter of learning and adapting as you go. I would suggest you reach out to relevant services in your area to see if they have peer support groups or something like that, that might be useful for you? (I'm neurodivergent myself, so I get where you're coming from here.)\n\nTo address the example you gave - e-mailing, like many other things, can in fact be explicitly discussed. If you are unsure of what the protocol is, you can say something like, \"Hey, if I have questions about this over the weekend, is it OK if I e-mail you?\" or even \"I might e-mail you at night, but don't worry about it, just get back to me whenever is good for you.\" All that said, sending too many e-mails/e-mailing at the wrong time is totally not an offensive thing at all, and if someone gets mad at you for that, they're the ass, not you.",

      "text": "Posting here because I was told it did not belong elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a freshman student, first year at undergrad in the northeastern USA. Recently, I had a problem in a class, and needed some advice. In our class, we had a total of 10 quizzes. Initially, they were meant to be in person, but the class was changed to online. Also, the quizzes were originally all closed book, but later the professor made the fourth quiz open note. I often did not attend class (I preferred to self study the textbook, and attendance was not required), but he would usually tell us via announcements on Blackboard the format of a quiz. For this quiz, he made no mention that he was changing the format or of any proctoring, so I believed it would be the same as the previous one, which was open note.\r  \n\r  \nUsually, our quizzes that are closed book have recording. The way it is supposed to be set up is that only once we do screen recording and turn our webcams on can we access a link to a pdf for the problems of the quiz, which we are supposed to do on a sheet of paper and then take a picture and send it to the professor. However, he set it up incorrectly this time, so the link to the pdf was available without needing to turn on screen recording, and the button for the screen recording was all the way on the bottom of the page. When I started the quiz, I just saw the link to the pdf without any recording button, which I took as confirmation that the quiz was open note.\r  \n\r  \nAround partway through the quiz, I finally did scroll down far enough to notice the button all the way on the bottom of the page. I was a little confused when I saw it, because there was nothing it was \"protecting\"; there were no other questions, and the quiz was already available above it, so turning it on would not reveal anything; the full quiz was already available. Thus, I assumed the button was there by accident; I couldn't think of any other explanation as to why it would be present, but be included after the quiz itself. Just to be sure, I double checked the announcements and instructions, which made no mention of any proctoring needed. I could not find anything, so I just concluded it was there by mistake, and continued with my quiz.\r  \n\r  \nLooking back, this was actually the 2nd time the professor had made this error; he had done the same error on quiz 2. However, I never noticed it that time; I knew from the beginning that that quiz was closed book and with screen recording, so that is the first thing I looked for in that quiz. I did see a link above the quiz that time as well, but I assumed that it was for a study guide, not the quiz itself.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, the professor found out later that he set up the quizzes wrong, and so investigated to see if students cheated. He saw that I never turned on proctoring for quiz 5, and so was required to submit a report to academic affairs\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, I plan on taking responsibility for this incident; I will state that I should have contacted the professor when I missed class to confirm the quiz was open note, rather than assume it was since the last one had been as well, and I plan to accept whatever penalty imposed. However, I would like to demonstrate that it was not deliberate, but rather a result of misunderstanding. The reasons I plan on showing are:\r  \n\r  \n1) There were no instructions anywhere that stated that this was a closed book quiz. There were no instructions at all on the quiz, and the announcements tab stated nothing. Obviously, this is still on me, since the instructions also did not state explicitly that it was open note, while it did for the quiz before, so I should not have assumed it would be the same. The only other source was the syllabus, but it was never updated and was inaccurate; it gave wrong dates for the quizzes and stated that they were ALL closed book, even though he had made the previous one open note; thus, I could not rely on it.\r  \n\r  \n2) The quiz was set up incorrectly, which confused me\r  \n\r  \n3) I made no attempt to cover up my cheating; I did not turn on my proctoring at all (since I thought it was there by mistake) which is the first thing the professor would see, and I went on blackboard, which records everything you do.\r  \n\r  \n4) I had a very high grade in the class already, so I had no reason to cheat.\r  \n\r  \n5) Quiz 2 had the same error as this one, but I took that one properly, since I knew it was closed book from the beginning. Thus, the cheating was not a result of me seeing the test set up wrong and taking advantage of it, but a misunderstanding.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, I will still accept the penalty, since this was my fault, even if it means failing the class. However, because my school puts violations on the transcript, I would like to reiterate it was unintentional, so future law schools will not be as harsh on judging my application.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason I am posting is because I am nervous on how this will affect my future. My questions are: 1) What consequences are likely for my actions, 2) Will the fact that it is unintentional even matter, and if so will my reasons be sufficient to demonstrate it was an accident 3) How exactly can I explain this on applications to law school, where I plan on applying later? Should I have it mentioned on rec letters?\r  \n\r  \nThank you all for your time and answers.",

The major and concentration both require over 20 credit hours each to graduate, and almost all of the courses have labs. We also have a baccalaureate program that requires like 40 credit hours outside of my major. This being said, I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019ll graduate on time if I use my second semester to take Calculus and am strongly considering jumping into Physics, since I need 1 and 2, both with labs. My only problem is that I\u2019m terrible at math. I\u2019m currently barely passing my pre-calculus class, which I failed in high school. Is it even worth it to try passing a physics class without more calculus experience, or would I be wasting my time? My biggest concern is limiting the amount of classes I have to take per semester. I\u2019m currently in 7 courses and it\u2019s just physically exhausting to the point where I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t study once I get home. I can\u2019t do this for the next 7 semesters.",

I'm just saying that he never specificies which of the two textbooks to use or mentions when we have them (which is infrequently)\n\nI'm new to school and the grading weights weren't specified in the syllabus (the syllabus was so barebones and none of the dates were accurate) so I don't know what they are. I know that on the website the assignment names vs. what they're graded as are inconsistent as well.\n\nMy biggest upset is that the work we do online seems to have nothing to do with what we are doing in class. It feels like I'm in class so my teacher can say class met in person when in reality the class is being treated as a minimal contact online course where we are supposed to glean from vague (often incorrect) instructions and infrequent updates what to do and how to do it\n\nEdit to add: Yes he did specify when asked. Eventually. But I feel that I shouldn't have to aske for clarification every single time.\nEta2: I see that my original comment said \"he never said there was going to be readings\" and I think thats just...not the sentence I meant to say...but I'm tired and don't remember the original point of that sentence.",

If the assignments put online are worth a very small amount, that might be why they're not being discussed.\n\nThere's a chance there's been a miscommunication somewhere and there's also a chance he's just a poor instructor. Either way, the best thing to do is to ask and to clarify. It's the only way you'll successfully make it through the course. If it's truly as messy as you describe, you won't be the only one confused or the only one asking. Hopefully that will force him to be clearer in future.",

I am always looking forward to learn new concepts in the modules I study. Because of that, I am 100% sure I want to do a Masters at one point, and I am thinking about a PhD.\n\nThe problem is from a financial point of view: I most probably won't be able to start a Master degree straight away, because I can't afford that financially and getting a loan would just increase the debt I already have for undergrad, so I'd exclude the latter option. Let's suppose I manage to get a masters within the next 3/4 years, would it be worth it to consider a PhD at that point (I would be 25/26 years old)?\n\nAlso, don't get me wrong, I am genuinely curious about what I study and many people say I am good at explaining concepts (I work as a Teaching assistant at my university), but I don't particularly love the idea of teaching as a job... So would it even make sense to try and get a PhD?\n\nThanks to anyone reading and eventually answering this!",
