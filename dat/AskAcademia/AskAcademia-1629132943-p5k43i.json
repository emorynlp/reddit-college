  "text": " Hi, guys! I hope you guys are doing well and staying safe!\n\nI am a (or was) PhD student at a university in California, and am about to start my third year.\n\nThis May I had my Screening exam based on core courses, written part, which I passed. Following that, last week I had my oral presentation, where I spoke of what I did and what I was going to do. Unfortunately or not, I was informed that I did not pass the exam due to lack of progress and originality and what not. Honestly, my progress has indeed been slow (the two years were very complicated by all means) but I was finally coming up with an original research and had promising results... I have a feeling that this verdict from the department was coming but I had no idea about it because I still had presented my work on weekly basis to my advisor, and he seemed to be on board with me. For a moment it crushed my soul, to be honest. I felt betrayed. Anyways, my apologies for the rant.\n\nSo now, I am eagerly exploring options elsewhere. What I think I am now is that a ready product who is ready to work and contribute to the research if I am given a chance. I will have my Masters and knowledge and skills are relevant - they just need a direction and guidance.\n\nMy first question is \"how realistic is to transfer to another university given that I get an OK from a potential new advisor?\" Transfer would ideal because I would not have to repeat same courses and can immediately start my research.\n\nMy second question is \"how realistic is to get a job for an international student in the US who's just got his Masters\"? I am also considering not pursuing academia and rather start looking for a job instead.\n\nThanks a lot for your attention!",

      "text": "Are you going to master out of your PhD program? If so, after you graduate you got around 60 days to figure your stuff out. Google \" working in the us after graduation for international students\" you will find a lot of info on what your options are. So depending on the time your current school is ready to give you, you might run out of time with the work of finding a new advisor and transfering/changing school. It's also not guaranteed that you will have an easy time doing so.\n\nFor your first question, IMO it would be easier and better to go do your PhD in the EU/UK with your master in hand. You would be finishing your PhD sooner (3 years in many countries with a master in hand) than if you were to change school in the US and start your research from 0 and not get all your courses credited or go through the trouble of getting them credited.\n\nFor your second question, more realistic in academia because they don't have a cap on H1B visas. Outside of academia, I wish you good luck. Because it's literally what you need since it's a visa lottery. I invite you to google H1B visas and other avenues for students who graduate and enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole.",

I'd speak with the visa office and the career center at your university. And also with others who have mastered out in the past and were in the same boat.",

Job is very well paid but it's not (possible) in EU .. rather those countries one would, at first glance, not going to. However life is good, also there, if the pay is good! say - maybe to check out countries with gaz and petrol. as far as i remember there are websites only to check those jobs, any country - good luck!!",

It is kinda like basketball players that do not make the NBA going on to play in Europe.  You are still good just need a different scene.  Of course look around at what is out there and make a new plan!  Sometimes a change can set a person off in a very rewarding direction!",

Some depts will take all/some of existing courses, some will make you do everything over. There is no one regulation for all PhDs in America - but there may be a way that your specific discipline tends to do it, so I'd inquire with your advisor.\n\nFrom a visa perspective, you are able to transfer your SEVIS record to a new school through the 60 day grace period, but not after. So, assuming you are getting an official masters degree, however much time you have between that graduation date and 60 days is the time you have - more with OPT. Otherwise, you can of course exit the US, then get a new visa stamp and enter with a new I20 from your new school. The most important thing is not to overstay.\n\n> \"how realistic is to get a job for an international student in the US who's just got his Masters\"?\n\nDepends on a lot of factors. If you are seriously considering just getting the job, I'd apply for OPT (assuming, again, that you are getting an official masters from these people, because if you're just terminating your program, you don't get OPT opportunity or grace period; you have to leave immediately).",
