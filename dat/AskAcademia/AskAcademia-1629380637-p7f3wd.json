  "title:": "Thoughts on taking a gap year before grad school?",
  "text": "I'm about to begin my final year as an undergrad English major, and I'm not sure yet whether I should take a year off between getting my BA and heading to grad school (I want to pursue an MLIS). The thought of applying to schools while writing my thesis and prepping a paper for publication is really overwhelming and makes me want to wait a year, but I'm also worried that my employment opportunities would be pretty limited with just a BA. Have any of you been in a similar situation, and if so do you have any advice? I'm feeling really lost and nervous, so any insight is greatly appreciated. TIA!",

I had some experiences, saved some money, tried the whole office job thing, etc. When I decided to go to grad school, I was 100% sure in my decision. I knew a lot of people in my cohort and just come right from undergrad and they were burned out and even bitter. I was always just thrilled to be there reading and learning instead of being in another horrible, boring inventory meeting. It gave me a way different perspective. I knew I COULD make it in the office job world but I CHOSE to go a different route.",

Right now you are eligible for virtually any job that requires a BA in a non-specific field: publishing, marketing, HR, policy analysis, admin, humanitarian aid, software sales - take your pick. With a professional masters in a really tight jobmarket, you'll have to explain for every, say, non-library employer why you got this degree, and will be disqualified pre-interview by many employers who assume you're \"overqualified\".",

Why? \n\n1) You need to make sure you aren't just doing this because you don't know what else to do (\"more school\" is just an easy and too-obvious answer for \"what should someone who has spent a lot of time in school do after they are done with school\")\n\n2) Going into academia without experience doing anything else but academia is a recipe for burnout and for a lack of confidence you can do anything other than academia\n\n3) Your employment possibilities are definitely limited with just a BA, but getting a grad degree will not necessarily improve them (it may just focus what jobs you can apply for) \u2014 the issue you have is not a lack of credentials, but a lack of experience\n\n4) It is worth taking a break from school for the first time in a very long time, to decide if \"more school\" is what you want or are ready for. The answer may be \"yes,\" it maybe \"no, for now,\" it may be \"no, forever\" \u2014 but it takes a break from the expectations, deadlines, etc. to see that sometimes.\n\nI took a year and half off, worked some jobs, decided that I'd really prefer academia in the end, and here we are, a long time later. But I was always glad I took the time off between. I saw a lot of burned out people who went \"straight through\" and had no non-academia experience to fall back upon.",

      "text": "All great points here. I'll add that I've worked with a hundred or so master's students over the years, and at this point I don't know why our faculty ever admit someone straight from undergrad. They struggle handling the workload, they struggle socially (they haven't had a chance to build a post-college support network yet), they often aren't comfortable thinking of faculty as peers yet so they don't get everything they can out of those relationships, and they often haven't spent years with the subject to know they won't be sick of it by the end of their first year of grad school. For example, an MLIS? You need to know already that you enjoy the company of databases, scripts, project management methods, etc. and don't care that you may never touch an old book.\n\nOur students who have worked a number of years have the opposite experience. They work efficiently. They're not only comfortable with faculty but know which of the faculty they can rely on. They have what amounts to a personal business case for why they're going for a master's.",

For me personally, I\u2019m looking into grad programs that provide internships (I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the same with English graduate programs). But I am always open to the idea of taking a gap year and just living life. I have a friend that took the entire gap year to travel (cut short bc of COVID), but I just thought that idea was pretty cool. Since I relate to you I would just say go with what you feel like you need more. If you need a break- definitely go for it. Have some fun and do what you want. (Although I feel like a major hypocrite because I\u2019m also extremely nervous and have no idea what I\u2019m going to do as well!). Hopefully we both figure it out within the next few months!",
