      "text": "I'm still trying to get back into the swing of things after COVID lockdown, but I can certainly say I am eating better and exercising more recently. \n\nAs I get queezy if I eat too early in the morning, I skip breakfast and only eat lunch and dinner (with a late snack thrown in). At each of my meals, I MUST have at least one serving of fruit and one of veggies. Preferably two servings of veggies. Combined with eating less meat and bread overall (very hard in France btw), my calorie intake has gone down, while essential vitamins and such are better than ever. I still eat too much sugar, but I have set very firm (upper) limits on my late night cookie/choco wafer numbers. \n\nCombined with riding the bike to work, and an extra 30 minutes of either rowing or virtual reality workouts after work, I am physically feeling stronger and healthier than ever before. I have also noticed my skin is less dry and I have less acne, although neither of those were truly problematic before.\n\nThis regime isn't without problems though, as I still often feel very tired in the afternoon. And while I sleep better being physically tired, there are plenty of days where I wish to not have aching legs or shoulders. Plus, coming back to the lab/office environment has been producing near constant head- and neck-aches from poor ergonomics. However, one benefit of working at the lab again is the lunch provided on the campus is far more varied than what I would cook at home. \n\nStill, it would be nice to not get tired in the afternoon, so I will need to monitor this thread for further advice!",

Prepping most of my meals in advance is essential for this.  In general, I will have something like yogurt or oatmeal for breakfast and a grain salad or soup for lunch.  Dinner is more of a wild card and is where I like to try out new recipes -- this week, I am making [Ottolenghi's roast chicken with preserved lemon](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/16/roast-chicken-preserved-lemon-garlic-recipe-yotam-ottolenghi-roast-turnips-buckwheat-salad)!\n2. At least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\n3. Harm reduction when it comes to dessert.  I have a *huge* sweet tooth and love to bake (which has been a big problem during COVID life, since I have no colleagues around who can help me with leftover brownies!).  I try to compromise by (1) baking slightly more nutritious desserts or (2) diverting my desire for something sweet into, say, a cup of herbal tea with a squeeze of honey.\n\nOh, and lots of coffee, obviously.  But I have been trying to abstain from caffeine intake after lunch.\n\nExercise is a super important part of my daily routine.  I run first thing in the morning, about 30-40 miles a week, followed by some yoga/core exercises at home.  I found that, once I started running more seriously, I very naturally gravitated towards a healthier diet: turns out what you put in your body does matter after all.  Shalane Flanagan and Elyse Kopecky's cookbooks have really helped me balance running and eating.",

I didn't even need coffee at a certain point. Melatonin with L-theanine helped me get to sleep and stay asleep which made a huge difference because I'm an extremely light sleeper. YMMV with all of this, of course.",

Diet and exercise was a big part of my life, my lab was focused on nutrition and well being.  And when I first got to the program I ate great, 3 meals a day and working out every other day. But eventually work took over and I could not maintain. At the same time I did not want my physique or body to change, so I began to skip breakfast, then I started working through lunch, and when I came home late I crashed rather eating dinner. My diet at this time consisted of coffee, tobacco, and the occasional free food found around campus. This continued for more than a year, eventually I had to take a leave to seek treatment for an eating disorder.",

No goals for how intense I would be, but just aiming to get into the gym or go for a run.  \n\nIf I set massive goals I would always end up slipping behind due to just exhaustion and mentally not being able to wrap my head around the huge goals I set",

With main meals containing protein & veggies. \n\nI would love to hear your own eating schedule as an academic! : )",

I cook almost all of my food....but truthfully I've always kind of eaten this way.\n\nI did the same introspection as you a couple of years ago, and I found that changing \\*when\\* I ate was much more productive than \\*what\\* I ate. For example, I was trying to have a full breakfast before my 8am....that just didn't work for me, I would be super full in the morning, then get hungry during my 12:30pm class....So I now eat something like an apple and have lunch at 10:30/11am ...really looking at when I was hungry and eating then was important.\n\nSome other non-diet stuff: \n\n* Drink water, you may be feeling drowsy because you're thirsty. I usually drink 20 oz. of water as soon as I wake up...it really helps make wake up\n* Sleep is SOOOOO important. I find that doing a guided meditation (usually 7-10 minutes before bed) helps me calm my mind and sleep a lot better. You can find these on youtube for free.\n* As far as exercise, I started doing Pilates last year and it has been an absolute game-changer. This woman does private lessons online:  [https://pilateswithrachel.com/](https://pilateswithrachel.com/)  I do two 30 minute sessions a month for $60 a month. She helps you work on stuff that is going on with your body. It has really helped me since my job is half sitting, half teaching night classes and being on my feet for 4-6 hours a day  \n\n\nGood luck!",

When I started my studies (majoring in engineering-something, just for the context here) waking up in mornings was such a pain in the neck. I had a very bad routine at the beginning and I can hardly call it a routine. But I managed to fit things in to my schedule now. I wake up around 5.30-6.00 am and run for an hour. It was 30-40 minutes when I started but now I'm running 10km per run so 60-75 minutes. I come back and do some home-workouts (I cannot go to a gym, all thanks to the virus epidemic), and shower. Then my breakfast. Basically eggs, sandwiches an apple and some other fruits. I go to the lab at 9.00 - 9.30 am. Lunch is a typical all-round one and the dinner is also the same. I have snacks in between :) I leave the lab around 11.00 - 12.00 pm/am and have another sandwich or something before I call it a night. Apologies, if it is tmi haha\n\nI'm still looking forward to improve my diets and workouts but that will have to wait until this whole pandemic blows over. I'm really happy about my running routine though, it really helps the day. I love coffee too! I used to drink A LOT but I stopped it a few months ago and now I only need my morning coffee (helps a lot when dealing with people in the morning) and one more later in evening.",

In college that meant I'd sometimes go through my problem sets as quickly as I could in the morning and figure out how to answer all of them, then actually write out the solutions in the afternoon.  As an adult it means I try to take important meetings before about 2pm.\n\nThe reason I don't drink coffee is that I was an athlete in college and knew that I could push myself too hard by working training and staying up late.  Caffeine would allow me to push myself harder, but I thought it would also make it easy to push myself too hard.  I'm capable of pushing myself too hard even without caffeine.  So I don't consume it, and that makes it easier for me to listen to my body and stay healthy.\n\nMy diet is pretty terrible but I don't worry too much about it.\n\nTiming of my workouts is also important, I usually work out in the evening because I'm usually drowsy after.  A morning run will wake me up for an hour or so, but then I tend to crash and struggle to stay alert the rest of the day.  Depends how much mileage I'm doing though.",

I like to make them as simple and balanced as possible, many only take about 30 minutes max or I just dump everything in a slow cooker.  You probably don't need to get as picky as I do; this works well for me because I want to maximise progress in the gym (which reduces stress and makes me feel powerful/ overcome imposter syndrome)",

Sometimes I'll meal-prep a fritatta. Then lunch is usually something pretty vegetable-heavy. It might be a quinoa salad with lots of veggies and chickpeas and spices, or it could be bibimbap, or this week it's homemade Chinese-American style chicken and broccoli with brown rice. My lunches are always prepped on Sunday. Dinner is something that is decided between my partner and I. Sometimes it's supremely unhealthy--fried chicken sandwiches for example. And sometimes it's quite healthy, like lettuce wraps with bulgogi, or zucchini noodles with tofu and peanut sauce. 90% of the time it's homemade, no processed foods. \n\nI usually don't snack in between meals because I don't get hungry, but if I do it's usually some nuts or fruit or occasionally a measured amount of chips or crackers. I always have to have dessert, which is usually ice cream. I usually drink black coffee throughout the day, sometimes add a dash of milk, and in the evening I'll switch to just water, iced tea, or diet coke, and if I want to treat myself, a glass of wine or beer. \n\nEssentially, I try to keep a balance between healthy and satisfying. I meal-prep a lot to make my work day (I try to keep myself as close to a 9-5 M-F workday as possible) smooth and non-stressful. I walk most mornings for about 30 minutes and take an hour long walk after dinner, and 3x a week I do resistance training. Once a week my partner play basketball together or go hiking. I do not have a perfect body by any means, but this works for me and keeps my energy levels up throughout the day--as well as trying to have calming hobbies and not looking at my screen too much in the evening, so that I can get to sleep faster.",

      "text": "My diet as an academic was horrible. A lot of fast food and stress eating. Now that I\u2019ve settled into an industry job, I do intermittent fasting (skip breakfast and eat a very small lunch) and try to cook dinner as much as I can, but since I don\u2019t eat much I can still eat out for dinner and have sweets without many ill effects. I was able to get into excellent shape after having kids and quitting academia, which albeit was a lot of work but is now simple to maintain. So I guess in hindsight my advice would be, try to get in great shape and then your diet and energy will fall into place. Find a sport or exercise you like and work out with full effort at least 3 times a week. When you\u2019re not in good shape, you\u2019re likely not eating well, and if you\u2019re not happy with those two things it\u2019s hard to get motivated and you have low energy (speaking for myself). Strong body->strong mind->strong spirit. Another tip would be getting a solid amount of sleep. For me, sleep helps my thoughts percolate so it\u2019s super key.",

Any long established cuisines developed in a historical region has some validity and they are pretty good at keeping you healthy. So in general, pick a few dishes from them that you know you can do well, actually like, and cook for yourself often and avoid processed, packaged, or fast food.\n\nThere are two variations on how I cook most days. I can cook a lot for dinner and reserve some for next day lunch, which I pack to work. Alternatively, I cook a big batch of something (usually meat) that stays good being frozen, chilled, then reheated on the weekend and eat it for lunch during the week (just add some greens and veggies) and cook some fast weeknight dinners (so I have something new and fresh every day). These are things like stews and curries (any culture would have one or two that fit the bill, pick one), Sloppy Joes, chillies, bolognese, pulled pork, BBQ ribs, briskets, etc ...\n\nI really should have learned all of these cooking with my parents or in school Home Economics (do they still exist?).

I get tired of eating the same thing every day, which is why I chose to make two, but you could make just one if you can eat the same thing over and over again. Make sure each meal has a good amount of carbs, protein and fat. But the good kinds, not a bunch of processed shit. \n* You may have noticed that I only prepped four meals, not five, in my previous point. That's because I would purposefully allow myself to eat out one day each week for lunch. I would typically schedule this on my busier days to \"force\" myself to take a break. I would set a budget each week and follow it. \n* Self-stable snacks to keep in your desk! Granola bars, nuts, dried fruit, peanut butter and crackers, etc. These are great to hold you over between breakfast/lunch or lunch/dinner, but also useful if you don't feel like an entire meal for lunch, but still want something. I keep mine in a big reusable zipper bag to ensure no ants/bugs are attracted. \n* If you like tea, I would suggest buying an electric kettle to go on your desk. Keep a variety of tea and some honey in your desk. For me, tea keeps me focused while I work and helps me cut back on coffee. It also is a great alternative to water for staying hydrated.\n* Speaking of keeping hydrated, buy a reusable water bottle and keep it full. Don't buy juice, sodas or other sweetened beverages; those make you crash. \n\nI also second ample amount of sleep. Sleep is a good thing, get plenty of it.",

I tried that last semester (my first semester) and it was an absolute nightmare. I didn't learn anything and I still don't remember what exactly I got done that semester.",

      "text": "Hey! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, intermittent fasting has been a thing of interest for a while now. There's some mixed evidence that it might have some long-term health benefits, though I haven't been following it super closely. Sort of got into it accidentally while studying in the US. Couldn't really afford to eat.\n\nAnyway, after a while, I found that your body adjusts to only getting one meal a day and sort of shuts down the relevant systems until 'designated food time'. Another mate who got into it intentionally reported something similar. Today I see it as a sort of 'academic superpower', granting the ability to slam out hours' worth of work at a time without getting distracted by hunger or lunch breaks, and a number of people at our hospital are dabbling in it.\n\n(That said, I personally find that if you ever miss 'designated food time', the day's hunger hits all at once with a fury - that's not so fun)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince you asked about exercise, my own habit is to break every hour or two and toss out a set of \\~12-13 pullups and 50 situps.\n\nThe whole lot only eats a couple minutes, helps break the monotony, and doesn't need anything besides a ledge over your head and something soft for your tailbone. Adds up over time, too; could only manage 8-10 pullups at a time on starting my data analysis a couple months ago, and the improvement feels nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, sometimes I also skim over Reddit in the middle of a workday, so take my thoughts as you will. Seriously, though, thanks for asking this - hope you get lots of replies, am rather curious what other people say!",

I try to keep fruits and veggies around to snack on so I don\u2019t default to junk food. I moderate my caffeine intake when I\u2019m not on deadline. Now that I\u2019m working from home, I do closer to the five small meals thing, but that\u2019s mostly because cooking larger meals is a disruption and it\u2019s easier to eat little things during breaks. \nBefore COVID, I was at the gym a few times a week, but now that I\u2019ve lost that, my exercise regime is honestly non-existent. Still trying to figure out what working out from home looks like for me.",

      "text": "Not that I'm particularly good at sticking with the following over any given time interval, but my \"system\" involves: \n\n- Drink at least 2 liters of water a day. Simplest way to do this is just have a nice water bottle constantly with you, keep it topped off, and take sips habitually. \n- Intermittent fasting. I only eat during a window from 11am to 7pm. The rest of the time it's just black coffee or (again) water. This prevents me from mindless snacking in the mornings and before bed (which helps me sleep better). Also I find that I overestimate how hungry I am in the mornings; if I restrict myself, it seems like I often don't get hungry until around 10:30am. (Then I'll have a good breakfast, but at lunchtime!) \n- Prioritize lean proteins and fresh fruits and vegetables; minimize carbohydrates; and eliminate (as much as possible) sugars.\n\nOf those three I really believe proper hydration is the most important. \n\nAlso, not diet, but: \n\n- Engage in some form of exercise every day -- 7 days a week. Lately I've been digging taking long (8-10km) walks after dinner in the evening during which I listen to an audiobook, so the exercise time doubles as learning/personal enrichment time -- and it's exercise that tires me out without raising my heart rate so much, so I sleep better. Sometimes exercise is just mowing the lawn or taking a bike ride with the kids. \n- Get plenty of sleep. I struggle with sleep-onset insomnia so I've been taking 10mg of OTC melatonin before bed each night, and it's really helped.",
