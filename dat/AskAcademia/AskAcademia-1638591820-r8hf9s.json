  "title:": "Unexpected institutions are downloading my MA thesis\u2026why?",
  "text": "So I submitted my MA thesis in August to my former institution\u2019s open access digital repository. Since then I\u2019ve had 36 downloads from around the world, which blows my mind. I didn\u2019t expect it to get any downloads. I actually kinda hoped no one would read it, because you always look back at your writing and wonder what people are gonna think!\n\nSome downloads have been from universities, which is understandable\u2026\n\nBut I got some commercial and government downloads! It\u2019s freaking me out!\n\nOne download is from a chemical industry company in TX, another is from a telephone company in Prague, an internet company in Brazil, an internet company in Oklahoma, and two downloads from the state of North Dakota. What!!??? Plus a number of unaffiliated individuals across the country. \n\nMy thesis was about conservation, capitalism, and zoos. I don\u2019t get it. Is this real? Why would the state of North Dakota, a chemical company, a phone company, and internet companies want my thesis?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI\u2019m already embarrassed as it is. I wish I knew what I signed up for, having my name out there like that. It\u2019s embarrassing. I never thought people would actually download it. In a few years I\u2019m gonna look at my MA thesis and think \u201cew how could I have written that??\u201d Now I don\u2019t want to publish anything, ever\u2026.why am I in a PhD program? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nI\u2019m just\u2026embarrassed. I put myself out there for the world. And now random companies are downloading it. It feels weird. It can\u2019t be right.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t have a common name, so I don\u2019t even know how they found my thesis \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Just because you know of the flaws it may have doesn't mean it doesn't have value. :)\n\nThe others could be scanning any known repositories of (academic) literature and just downloading anything they find. Google's bots, for example, might crawl the university page and download your thesis to scan its text for search terms so that others can find your work later. There might be other sites that automatically copy any literature they find to bypass academic paywalls or maybe others do it just to have a copy of data.\n\nThose steps are all automated though, and some will even use ways to disguise themselves (such as changing where they appear to be located) to avoid bot detection algorithms.",
