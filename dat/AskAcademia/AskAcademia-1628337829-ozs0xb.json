  "title:": "Further education after a masters",
  "text": "Hello, I have recently completed my Masters in Aerospace Engineering. Part of me wants to continue with education and part of me wants to start working. I have always been super interested in space (and just plain physics) and that is why I decided to do the degree I did. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend another 4 years doing undergrad theoretical physics but I doubt I will be admitted to a masters straight away. I thought I could learn by myself but I don\u2019t know if there is any official way of obtaining recognition of knowledge if I study it on my own (so I can add it to my CV).\n\nI am open to discussion on the topic and seek your help. \n\nThank you.",

      "text": "There is no way to add a certification of your knowledge of physics to a CV without studying it formally. However, you can definitely still learn about it on your own. Especially considering you have a Masters in aerospace engineering, you will not have any trouble studying physics on your own if that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in doing. \n\nWhy do you want your CV to say that you studied physics? For engineering roles you already seem qualified, and for 99% of non technical roles most people don\u2019t know the difference between physics and engineering. If you\u2019re thinking about a career change and working in physics research, a PhD would be a better option. There is a lot of physics research that is at the crossroads between physics and engineering so you might be very well suited for one of those positions.",

          "text": "Hey thanks for your response. The reason I would like for it to be certified is since I would be learning about it anyways, might as well have it official in case in the future I need it. I have thought about phd and will do it at some point later in life, but right now I don\u2019t think I see myself doing research. I will look into it in depth since I know with an engineering degree you can get into masters for physics and may only require some foundation lessons to get into shape. I will do my own learning beforehand too. Thank you.",

              "text": "You definitely have a lot of options coming from engineering, however you choose to go about it. I was just curious about the certification issue because quite honestly (I say this as someone pursuing a PhD in physics) the only roles where official knowledge of physics counts are research and teaching. In most other jobs physics counts the same as any other \u201ctechnical\u201d degree (math, chemistry, comp sci, engineering) so depending on your goals it might not be worth worrying about getting official recognition for your physics knowledge.",
