  "text": "There is a professor who is doing research in an area that I am very interested in but when looking at all his research I became a bit concerned. He has only worked with Chinese students and various Chinese researchers from industry and other universities. Looking through all his work, it doesn't seem that he has ever worked with a non Chinese person. Also, every summer he invites 5 students from various Chinese universities to work with him fully funded. As a non-Chinese student I feel like I may just be wasting my time contacting him.",

To make their work goes faster, working with students from his native country is much more productive. \n-\tThe faculty is more likely to be able to obtain fundings from China, which requires (unofficially) them to supervise Chinese students only. \n-\tThese students come from specific training programs in China that make them uniquely suited to the faculty\u2019 research.",

So they won't accidentally linguistically isolate non-Indians - unless they all happen to be from the same part of India, having the same native language, in which case you usually will run into the same problem as with any other group with the same native language you don't understand. Maybe less if you are interesting/useful to them, as switching to English is likely to be less difficult for them than for Chinese, Taiwanese, Koreans etc.",

(As someone already wrote, not because they'd want to isolate you or have something against you, but just because that's easier for them, speaking English is a huge effort for most of those Chinese people who didn't grow up bilingual, and as a student you are very unlikely to have something to contribute that would be worth that effort on a regular basis.)",

It is neither surprising nor inherently problematic that many non-white academics specifically choose to work with or end up working with members of their own cultural or language background. The many structural problems within academia often make this necessary. These groups support each other and create more secure environments in spaces that generally favor white scholars. As a non-white academic myself, I appreciate that these exist.\n\nI do not blame OP for wondering if he is intruding on a space that has been created perhaps unintentionally as a way of helping Chinese scholars succeed in a foreign environment. Describing this as a \"red flag\" and asking if he's \"wasting his time\" by contacting the professor \u2014 that makes the scenario I described above seem like a problem rather than simply a reality to be mindful of.\n\nI do think he should just treat the professor like any other professor and simply reach out to see if it's possible to work together.",
