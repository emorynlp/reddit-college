  "text": "I posted earlier this week about considering quitting from my PhD and I've given it a lot more thought over the last few days. \n\nI've grown to realised that despite being nearly a year in, I've made little (if any) progress towards completing my objectives and it feels like I'm working in a vacuum since I'm not allowed back on campus thanks to covid. Lifeless and unproductive zoom meetings punctuate days spent staring at articles and screens.\n\nI feel as if I'm at the lowest point I've ever been at- the deeper I delve into the research area the more I realise it's simply not interesting to me. I also feel as if I don't have a very good relationship with my supervisor since all they seem to do is bark orders and criticise me rather than hold productive conversations. It feels as if every supervision meeting is a chore to them and that I'm preventing them from doing their research. I had a meeting last Monday that nearly made me burst into tears after they criticised the code I've spend 4 months writing and working on (with no feedback). \n\nAfter recently attending a 3 week conference searon I'm even further convinced I've made a grave mistake picking this research area since not a single talk grabbed my interest the way what I studied as an undergraduate did. \n\nI don't even know how to handle this since I can't really quit a year in or really tell my parents. To summarise, I'm feeling truly unhappy and distraught about it all and I'm losing interest by the day. It's surely not normal to dread every single day of work?\n\nI feel terrible.",

      "text": "Losing interest is normal. I was also passionately interested in my current research area as an undergraduate (the reason why I decided to do a PhD). After finishing my PhD, I realized how out-of-touch the field is to reality, and how frankly, academia is just a political game. My interest is no where near as high as before, but do I hate doing research? No. Rather than a \"passion,\" I just treat it as an office job now.\n\nI cannot fathom doing what I am doing right now if I \"hated\" it, and was unhappy as you say you are. Respectfully, you cannot be influenced by your parents and have to make a decision as an adult. Research is a lifetime commitment. If you force yourself to do research, you will not do yourself or anyone else favours, and I cannot imagine a positive outcome at the end of your research degree (which depends on your research performance).\n\nMy advice is to talk to your peers about your concerns. Often, your PhD cohort shares the same feelings. As well, start thinking of exit strategies (e.g., mastering out, search for industry jobs). One year into your degree is a great time to make such decisions. You definitely do not want to make this decision much further into your degree.",

They're talking about the set of students who started the same degree in the same department in the same year as you did. If your department has other PhD students then they are your cohort. They don't need to be supervised by the same person for you to connect with them, and in fact, it's not particularly abnormal to be the only student of your PI or 1 of a small number. It's also not important, because you still have a cohort of peers. In fact, you don't even want to be siloed in with people of the same group. It's good to make friends in your department but outside of your group because then they understand your struggles without being conflicted in them.\n\nAnd also, if you're the only student in your entire department (i.e. you are truly alone) then that's a massive red flag and I'd be concerned about what institution you're in and whether your degree is legit.",

You could reach out to the programme organiser and ask if some kind of social call or meet-and-greet could happen. My department runs a PhD Jamboree every single year where all the current and new students introduce themselves, their projects (planned or current), hobbies, interests, and what skills they can help others on (e.g. programming in a particular language). It's at least a starting point for a cohort. From there you can make group chats and organise socially-distanced coffees and picnics or movie/game nights.\n\nIf no one has attempted anything like that yet then I guess it's up to you to suggest it. But once you do, you could be changing the culture for good and preventing another person from having to do it next year. If you feel isolated, you may as well try. \n\nIf you have other PhD students in your department then you literally have a cohort. It's a basic fact and you can't deny that. Those people don't stop existing just because you haven't met them yet. You have a cohort and so there is potential.",
