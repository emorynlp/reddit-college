      "text": "**BLINK regularly!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe biggest impact on eye health when using a computer monitor is that your body stops blinking as much and your eyes dry out. Make sure to blink **extra** to balance it out. Also, if you can look out a window or somewhere further away every 10 minutes or so, even just for 5 seconds, it will help with the strain. Blue light filters make like a 5% difference in the light energy that goes into the eye, the same as moving a screen away a few inches. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shouldn't hurt your eyes by staring at nature all day, and real sunlight is many many times brighter than any monitor. So if your eyesight wouldn't have gone down without the monitors, it's probably not blinking that had the negative effect and not anything special to do with staring at text on books/computers/whiteboards/etc.",

Also, if you wear glasses for distance and astigmatism and can\u2019t read without glasses, consider trying a pair of computer glasses with the distance rx reduced so you\u2019re not compensating at a close distance. You can get very cheap ones online if you\u2019re not worried about perfect look/fit or are one of those magical people one size fits all actually fits.\n\nAlso, switching between types of things I stare at throughout the day helps me quite a bit. I\u2019ve had some vision problems not related to work that made it very hard for me to read from screens, so I limited my device time for months. Now I try to see what my options are for material and vary it when I can. Can I easily get a hard copy of the book? I used to use the ebook for convenience but now I\u2019ll find the hard copy. I try to cut down on paper printing, but I do print things I refer to a lot like a syllabus, a manuscript I\u2019m editing, or a foundational paper/report. Need to watch a video? Can I do it at home on tv from 10 ft away instead of my tiny laptop close up?  I know most of us don\u2019t always have total  control of scheduling these things but varying source, lighting, and distance when I have the chance has made a huge difference in eye strain for me. One more helpful thing I did very recently was invest in a high-resolution tablet for reading. Totally worth it. Took a bit of saving, but i have a desktop at home and it was cheaper than replacing the laptop I\u2019d chosen for memory and processing capacity with a lower-res screen when it was still perfectly good otherwise. You could probably get the same effect with a high quality desktop monitor but since I rotate between several offices this was easiest for me.",
