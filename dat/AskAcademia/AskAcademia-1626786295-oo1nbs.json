  "title:": "Unofficially did the associate editor job in a journal for a PI, how can I put this on my resume/CV?",
  "text": "So I am leaving my current position as a research scientist and want to look into something in biotech/industry. A couple of years ago the PI of the lab was invited to be an associate editor for a journal, they accepted, but then passed the job on to me. So for these two years I would get the journal submissions, sort them, contact reviewers...etc. The PI would then have this work sent out from under his name. Is there a way I can put this work into my CV without outright saying \"I did the work for my lazy PI doing x,y,z\"?",

If it helps, very few people outside of academia are going to know (or care) how the academic publishing system works and won't infer that you were taken advantage of. The organizing skills are the more important bit, and your PI can't take *those* away from you.",

You did this job, which is a significant investment of effort, and if anyone wants to verify that you did this job I'm sure you can adequately prove it. \n\nI have to say, your PI was a real shithead. Even if I get someone I work with to help me with a review I acknowledge them. Getting you to do an entire editorial role for a prolonged period without acknowledgement is a really lousy thing to do. Make absolutely sure it's on your CV. You don't need to clear it with anyone in advance, provided you've got the backup emails or documentation or whatever to support your assertion. Best of luck.",
