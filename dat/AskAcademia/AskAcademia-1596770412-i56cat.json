I was wondering how most of you sit down and write? how do you organize your thoughts and quote from your references? any comment is appreciated.",

I try to make a rough outline on the first day with references (sometimes including a few direct quotes I want to use) etc. Then I just write a \u201cshitty first draft\u201d - I let it be shitty and don\u2019t try to make anything perfect, just to get words on the page. You will fix the shitty first draft later when you edit. I do not even try to write in order; sometimes I have a better sense of how a later section should look before I even have an introduction. This is fine! After I have most of the content down in a rough form, I take a day away from the writing. When I come back to it, I am in editing mode. First I try to organize the ideas to make sure the order makes sense. When I get really stuck, I print out the rough draft and then cut out each individual paragraph and move them around on my floor until I have an order that makes sense to me. Then I go back and try to clean up the language and add anything else I\u2019ve thought of along the way. If you are organized, you can also exchange papers with someone else in your program and give each other comments. This is very helpful but it requires you to have your work done early. I do think that starting early and giving yourself time to work a bit each day, or at least spread out the process over a few days, helps a lot. This allows you to separate the writing process, for which you have to be forgiving, creative, and sometimes sloppy, from the editing process, when you look at your work with a critical eye and make sure things are clear and up to standard.",

      "text": "I'm really bad at academic writing, half of my master's degree has been learning how to do exactly that. I failed half my classes first semester because I took a non-academic bachelors (which is a thing in my country) that didn't prepare me for the writing style of an academic degree,\n\nI go somewhere that isn't home to write. If I'm home I have a million things to do. I'm lucky that because of the pandemic, the place where I did my thesis research) is letting me use a desk to write my thesis (they even upgraded me to a nicer desk when the office opened up!). If I'm not at work, I'm at the library, or the uni. Anywhere but home. \n\nWhen I do my research or my desk research I have a powerpoint open. Any time I find a quote or a model relevant to my research, I throw it on the powerpoint and use it like a [notecard](https://imgur.com/a/BPZChDi). This is so helpful to me that I use it in planning all of my [projects](https://imgur.com/EazpuWk) (some notes for a rpg game I've been running).\n\nThen I create an [outline document](https://imgur.com/nDHck06) of what I am writing. This includes my eventual project outline, but I also throw the [project requirements](https://imgur.com/SVYLcBa) in there. One of the exams I failed did technically well on but I missed a requirement that was in the course description but not the exam brief. This way when I do my final draft and revisions I can check my own brief and make sure I'm not missing anything. If it's a long term project I include a [project timeline](https://imgur.com/BwlYpIp) so I can keep track of deadlines (My timeline for this project was derailed by the pandemic). I also include my project proposal, background, and preliminary research questions (which I won't include here because it's too specific) so I make sure not to stray too far.  The outline document is incredibly helpful when you're reaching out to people for interviews or field work because then you can just send them an overview that explains what they're doing. I've used my outline document more than I use anything else. \n\nWhen I get to writing the most important thing for me to remember is that the purpose of a first draft is to exist. If I get stuck or hung up on something I insert a filler statement with a searchable term and go back in the second draft to update it with revisions. So my current thesis is full of iterations of this sentence:  \n \n\n>Paragraph and citations about new social movements theory \\[citation needed\\].  \n>  \n>Paragraph and citations about social network theory \\[citation needed\\].  \n>  \n>Paragraph and citations about environmental social networks \\[citation needed\\].\n\nThis way I can just go back and search \\[citation needed\\] and find anything I need to expand on. \n\nIf it's a project I have to give a defense or presentation or speak about, I keep a massive supply of study snacks on hand that I *only* eat when I am writing. This is so when I go into my speech I can have something on hand to nibble on before my talk to spark memory. For me it's [sour fruit candy](https://imgur.com/OQyGuun) \\- because I can just keep it in my mouth to keep the flavor going. It makes it a sort of sensory background to hold with the memory of what I'm writing and it helps me remember more easily. \n\nI also listen to playlists while I work, especially playlists that are uninterrupted. I usually go for [video game soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1k4jGwhKF0) because they are designed to help you focus on whats in front of you without being too distracting. I just pin the youtube tab and let it run while I write.\n\nThen I take regularly scheduled breaks where I am productively unproductive. No chores, no family, no work, no research. I sit down with some simple phone game that has a set number of turns and then a timed recharge. I use up all my turns, and then it's back to work. That way I have a minor obstacle to continuing and it's easy to put it down. I also specifically block out time for my family and friends - my husband has two nights a week where we spend time, my friends get two nights a week where I'm social with them - and I spend time with my daughter from when she gets home from daycare to when she goes to bed. I have to turn my brain off from time to time otherwise I will burn out. \n\nThis is what works for me, at least!",

I tend to work in sections, so next week for instance, I'll be able to spend the morning (my best time to think) writing out ideas for the second section by hand, and then spend the afternoon typing up my writing from the previous section. Once it's all assembled, then it's the second round of revision and editing to give it more of an overall shape, fill in gaps I've created, and make sure the argument is sound. That involves printing up a copy and marking it by hand, so that I get another round of immediate editing as I enter those changes into the document. I will probably do two or three rounds of this before I think the piece is decent enough to be seen by someone else, whether it's an editor, committee member, or writing buddy.",

Then I write out my outline based on that. Then I go into my documents with citations and information and start writing / filling in my outline by paraphrasing/rewriting the copy-pasted paragraphs into my own. \n\nThat's for my intro. Which is always last because idk the context until after I've interpreted the result in the discussion. (the results write themselves based on the analysis. The methods are also just a description of what you did. The discussion can only be written based on the results so not too much searching the lit needed there until framing in the bigger picture or if defending a weird result).",

It is a long story but I completed my PhD with no corrections but immediately after it I had a psychotic break. Working with a therapist now to try to uncover what went wrong, I realise that my work practices were actually crazy and I have no idea how I managed to produce what I did! I published a peer-reviewed article in a top journal in my field which required no revisions so my work was high quality but I took very few notes from my reading and very rarely went back to them if at all, once they were on my computer it was as if they had vanished! When writing up I just tried to recall what I had read that was relevant to what I was writing and wrote in quite a manic state producing thousands of words that didn\u2019t require that much revision. But I overloaded my brain because it was as if I was trying to hold all the ideas for my thesis in my head rather than putting them down on paper as I went along. Has anyone else ever heard of anything like this?",
