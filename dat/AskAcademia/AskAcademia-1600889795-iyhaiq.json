Are there big differences in how PhD students are funded between public and private schools? Hard to decide about sending apps in when it feels like I\u2019m just waiting for the programs to pull admissions.",

Our unions are generally quite good and helpful (e.g. our health insurance rocks; we have gone on strike in previous years over grad school benefits and last year we authorized a strike, but the administration caved at the last moment) but it a challenge when the issues are happening at a level that is higher than the university. \n\nFunding loss from low enrollment, grant losses, etc are hard problems to solve as long as the current system exists. And honestly, I would rather that tenured faculty take a pay cut than operations staff like janitors and front desk workers, or underpaid grad students. Also, while I HATE how our state legislature earmarks funding for buildings instead of... school... there is a teeny defense in that this all occurred before COVID and once it is set aside for the buildings by the government, the university administration cannot then divert those funds to... school functioning. But our school as a whole needs to advocate for funds to go to the things that a university is actually for.",

      "text": "State schools generally have, to some degree, fixed funding. They know how much money they're going to get from the state in the next year (hopefully) or few (if they're very lucky). Even if they don't know the exact number, they have a general idea, usually. They then offset whatever the gap is between that number and their expenses with their endowment draw and then finally 1-5% tuition increases.\n\nAt a private university, funding is coming from student fees and the endowment draw. There is minimal fixed state support.\n\nWhat does all of that mean? It means that when endowments tank during bad economies or there looks to be a great deal of economic uncertainty ahead private universities are actually normally worse positioned. You can't just draw the shit out of your endowment, because the board of trustees has a fiduciary duty to the institution and making huge endowment draws puts the future of the institution at risk. You also can't just increase tuition by 15%, especially in an era where there is a lot of pressure to decrease/freeze tuition due to worse college experiences from COVID. If you can't really increase revenue in any meaningful way to offset your expected lost endowment revenue, you start to slash expenses.\n\nTake a place like Columbia. The endowment is \\~$11B. If it dropped to even $10B, on average, throughout this crisis, that'd eliminate a 5% draw on $1B; that's $50 million of funding that just disappeared. At this point, you have to start laying off workers, slashing retirement contributions and executive salaries, and reducing your number of non-revenue generating students (aka PhDs). You also want to do all of those things before touching the amount of aid you give out, because that will directly impact your reputation among peers and hurt your ability to attract talent.",

      "text": "What others have said: state schools need graduate labor forces. Many humanities and social sci grad programs only get internal grant funding if it is spent, and often need new students to spend the funding (e.g. I used up most all the pre-dissertation research funding afforded to me by my uni). All this while uni admins are trying to gut certain programs (history, Any \"studies\", arts, etc.).   \n\n\nThe thing about the ivies is that endowments suffer in bad economies and this meets the joke about Harvard and other ivies being hedge funds that happen to provide a world class education. These places don't want to dip into the $$ because they use it to buy property or renovate. And, sadly, the avg undergrad doesn't go to school to learn they go for the environment or prestige so they can get a good/great job. So they need to have the money for other things then supporting graduate workers.   \n\n\nI can't speak for all private uni's but I am at an R-1 state school and the private uni's around me were quicker to assure grad students a bridge year of funding - we need it because many of us cannot go away on research due to covid.   \n\n\nI would send apps out to your dream schools and contact advisors you want to work with. It is best to build the relationship now. I would also pay attention to grad unions and how a uni treats their grad students. You will be one soon and I will tell you...it ain't pretty. Academic work is a far fucking cry from stripping coal from a mine or any other stereotypical union job, but the animosity from administration and even some faculty towards necessary laborers (grad students and Non-TT people) is fucking palpable.",

The idea that state schools will have their funding is def not accurate at UVa--Arts & Sciences cut is around 30%. We get v. little $ from the state (around 7% of our budget) and anyway, the state is broke. Most $$ comes from tuition, external grants, philanthropy, etc. &  all sources that have dropped. (Tuition rates stayed the same, but not everyone pays the same tuition, and the %age of high-payers has dropped.)  \nWe mostly aren't hiring adjuncts, but are not replacing w/ grad students---instead we hired our graduating PhDs who couldn't get jobs because of the pandemic.",
