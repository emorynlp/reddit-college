Part of me can't believe I've made it to this point in my career, part of me thinks I don't belong, and another part is super excited for what the future could possibly hold. What a wild ride the academic career path can be.\n\nHere's to hoping for at least an interview or 2!",

      "text": "Same here and I am the third time on the job market and plan to move on if I cannot get anything.  I got one zoom interview so far, but it is really early in the season. They usually send out first interview invite at least 2 weeks after the deadline, and with Thanksgiving and final exams, probably a lot of invites will be sent between late November and mid-December (some I know will not send invites until mid January).\n\nIt is going to be a long process. I got my first postdoc in August when I almost give up. Some candidate quitted before semester started and so I moved up the list (and you can imagine how hard it would be to have no offer the whole year until August). \n\nMy second postdoc came in the last week of January, but I also got a tenure track interview invite in May and made it to the campus interview in June and got the offer (but I rejected) in July. So you never know. Good luck and don't lose faith too soon :)",
