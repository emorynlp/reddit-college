  "text": "Hello,\nsome time ago I had met a guy working in university administration, he is without any diploma, without any title, M.A. nor bachelor... but since he is often mistaken for profesor since he is visitting conferences and helping students with everything....\nIt let me think: is it possible to publish in academic magazines or taking part in conferences if you lack titles or background in some university?\nWill you paper fail in review if you lack PhD?\nAnd did you met some \"laic\" researchers to be recognized by academia?",

As a result, you have a much deeper understanding of what has been done before and how it meshes with what we know now. Lacking this base of knowledge would be one of the biggest obstacles to publishing. It's very hard, maybe impossible, to do meaningful original research without such a background.",

During my masters I worked under a medical researcher and published a meta analysis with them, but, honestly, that was on a whole other level than what I have done recently. The level of statistics, thought, and general work put in was exponentially more than anything I have done recently. I would not have been able to help without guidance from them. \n\nSo, I would say it is possible, but if it is for a high impact scientific journal it may be tough. But if it is a journal that focuses more on a professional field and not the theory of the field it probably would be easier. Like I mentioned earlier I required guidance from the other researcher when working on the meta-analysis, so I will say that the skills needed to do the necessary rigor of work for a high impact journal are learned through a PhD.

Any experimental research requires access to specialized instruments and/or a wet lab and most computational research requires supercomputer access. Any low-hanging fruit that does not is no longer publishable.

But these are also precisely the reasons modern publishing practices have disenfranchised significant numbers of peoples. We have a self-fulfilling cycle here. Gain entry to the hallowed halls and obtain the micro skills or else you cannot publish. And you cannot publish if you couldn't gain entry. \n\nOur scientific disciplines now reward people with such specific skills. In effect, they are rewarding privilege and those that have been fortunate in these aspects.  \n \nSTEM fields now largely discourage those without the ability to obtain these skills. In the social sciences, apart from gaining specialized research skills, it is still possible to do independent work, but that is becoming harder with the lack of resources to those unaffiliated with institutions.

      "text": "I think it is possible, but depends heavily on several factors. It depends on the field for one thing, and on the claims you make for yourself in your research. If you have no qualification or institution and you claim to answer some long standing questions in your field, probably no one will bother to read your paper. But amateurs do sometimes make progress, even in mathematics which has become very specialised. There was a case of a 4chan user proving something about superpermutations - that proof could probably have found its way into some peer reviewed publication. Even that though is not a strong enough result on its own for a full paper, in my estimation. It's quite difficult to generate sufficiently strong results unless you are working on it full time really, and ideally with access to other researchers to collaborate with or at least bounce ideas off.",

      "text": "This question comes up here a lot...\n\n> is it possible to publish in academic magazines or taking part in conferences if you lack titles or background in some university?\n\nConferences are incredibly expensive.  I work in a field that's well acquainted with industry but in general employers don't pay for their employees to attend and present at conferences, except in academia, let alone random admin people.  When I do meet industry folks at conferences it's almost always high level execs or government employees.\n\n> Will you paper fail in review if you lack PhD?\n\nNot necessarily, but the academic article is an art unlike any other.  It's kind of like asking \"hey I like to run, if I showed up at the NYC marathon would I make it?\"  The short answer is there's a chance, but you really need the proper training to even have a tiny shot at it.\n\n> And did you met some \"laic\" researchers to be recognized by academia?\n\nNo one who doesn't do research as their full time job, just like I haven't met any doctors or lawyers or nurses or garbage collectors or sysadmins who do it on the side in addition to a different full time job.  I've met plenty of non-academics who publish, but they do research as their full time job in some form or another.  There's really not much room to break into any profession as a hobbyist.\n\nTL;DR- Yes there's a slight chance but the person you know is likely an exception rather than a rule.  If you want to publish academic work, go for your PhD.",

Publishing as a sole author with no background is incredibly difficult, but not because of your lack of a title. Papers are judged based on their merit, not their authors. But lacking the background, it will be nearly impossible to produce a paper which is novel and of high enough quality to be published.",

Often an Alt Academic - in my experience - is someone who makes their living as, say, an author, and in addition to getting book deals, grants etc for fiction, they also do so for academic texts. Often they are not tethered to a University, but may form partnerships with them here and there.",
