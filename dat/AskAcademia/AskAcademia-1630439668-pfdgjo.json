  "title:": "Would you consider this cheating?",
  "text": "So I'm in a class taught by an instructor who I had before, and before the first class that I took with him, I came across a resume-type website while looking for a syllabus to get an idea of what the course would be like.  On the website, he wrote about what courses he teaches, and had some old syllabuses and exams from several years ago.  I looked at some of the old exams during both the last class I took with him, and during the current one (which I just started), to get an idea of what the real test would be like.  Do you think this would be considered cheating since the site wasn't linked on Canvas, or was it okay since he voluntarily uploaded them to the internet?  It's causing me quite a lot of anxiety, because the classes are major classes and I feel like I'm inevitably a fraud.  The school policy says that obtaining an exam or exam questions before taking the exam is cheating, and some questions were definitely reused in the last class, but I'm not sure if this applies to exams voluntarily posted online by the instructor.",

If they want to go over their test they have to make a (short) appointment with their prof or TA, at which time they are allowed to view their test (with no paper or pen available) but not have it back. The prof intends to continue to use the exact same test the next semester.\n\nThis only hurts people who aren\u2019t part of the Greek system, because every frat or sorority on campus has filing cabinets full of old test papers available to their members.",
