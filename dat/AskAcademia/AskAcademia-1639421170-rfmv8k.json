Set alerts for journals\u2019 calls for submissions, so you can be sure that your paper will be genuinely considered in a timely fashion. Good luck!",

      "text": "Have you presented it at a conference? At any informal meeting place? How have you gotten feedback up until this point?\n\nFor top journals, you typically need to have gotten extensive feedback on your manuscript before you submit. If you haven't, you are likely going to experience the publishing process. It is filled with rejections, but (in many cases) recommendations to improve the manuscript. Do so. Then submit to a slightly lower ranked journal, where the process repeats. Eventually, your paper will be matched.",

Ask at least one other faculty to review it.  Edit again.  Read it again start to finish.  Edit again. Make it more concise.  Correct format, spelling, bibliography.  Show what you hope will be final draft to professor.  At some point, decide to stop editing.  Submit.\n\nMake every change the reviewers suggest.  Do not argue.  If it's rejected, lather rinse repeat and welcome to publishing!",
