  "text": "Hi everyone \n\nI have been signing off my e-mails with the phrase \"Take care\" and my name and so forth for as long as I can remember. I've never had anyone comment on the phrasing until now. \n\nI've recently received an e-mail response from a professor in which he asked me to reflect that there are people who do not take kindly to the sign-off, \"Take care\".\n\nI honestly intended this cordially and have no idea how it can cause offence. Is there some significance that I am unaware of? Am I missing something? \n\nThanks!\n\nRESPONSE: AGEISM",

This borders on abuse.\n\nPeople who feel it's acceptable to take their anger out on junior staff like that don't deserve any kind of career.

It could be interpreted in a bit of suggestive or snide way, but even then that is assuming that the senior colleague was talking about himself having this gripe.\n\n'Take care' as an end-greeting is very normal. However, I can see that if a junior colleague uses this all the time, a person may start to think that it's a sign off that they use especially for them. Combine that with the fact that 'take care' can also carry the connotation of 'watch out', and I can somewhat understand how that may make a person feel on edge. I don't think this is unambiguously valid, but people take language seriously to varying degrees, and this is a known fact.\n\nBesides that, I do not think that anyone deserves to have their position questioned just because they made a remark about someone's use of language. To say that it is 'bordering on abuse' is something I really don't understand. It may not have been the friendliest thing... but _abuse_? _Really?_",

His emails are basically just him saying \"I already explained this\" (even though he didn't, and even if he did, he could try explaining it better/in a different way) or otherwise blocking me from getting the information I need. So \"take care\" in that context comes off as really passive-aggressive coming from him. Like he's saying \"*take care* of yourself, I don't give a shit about helping you as a student.\" It just doesn't match. Incongruence is still the word that feels the most accurate. \n\nGiven that...I could hazard a guess that either he had a similar experience (where someone using it came off as passive-aggressive) or worse, he's actually feeling frustrated with you for some other reason and then \"take care\" is landing as incongruent.",
