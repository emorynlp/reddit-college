  "title:": "Seriously considering leaving a TT position. Please check my head.",
  "text": "I (USA/ MFA) am seriously considering leaving a TT position. I\u2019m in my second year and I hate it. I accepted a 4-Year fixed term position overseas in 2020. Then I got a call from a small R3 in a fairly out of the way region. I have been conditioned to pursue TT for the past 10 years, includes graduate school. It really seemed like my \u2018dream job\u2019. The salary is decent (a 45% increase from my former position) with a *tiny* research stipend. I accepted the position at the R3 thinking it would provide stability, the opportunity to create community and I would finally be able to focus on my research rather than chasing this elusive Higher Ed unicorn. It\u2019s just been a mess from day one. I began in the fall of 2020 (online as a result of ongoing COVID protocols). We then transitioned into something our institution is calling hyflex/ hybrid, a mixture of online and in person classes. And finally returned to campus in the fall of 2021. Faculty has been a nightmare (not uncommon in my experience). Students are all over the place. I\u2019ve spent more time troubleshooting/ putting out personal-issue fires than really teaching or completing the research I have in the wings. Our department has seen a dramatic decrease in enrollment, something they were woefully unprepared for- even given the surprising elements introduced by a global pandemic. There are several key players in temporary/ at will positions including a dean with direct decision making influence, and a number of long time (as in, they all went to school at this institution- undergrad/ grad/ PhD) well- loved adjunct/ fixed term faculty and critical staff and grad students with a high turnover rate. Most of the ideas I\u2019ve had as well as changes I\u2019ve implemented have been destroyed upon arrival- leaving me with little motivation as we move into a heavy recruitment (required for \u2018survival\u2019) cycle. The town is tiny, it\u2019s basically run by the university\u2019s flex on being a residential school. All of this at the two-year mark of a global pandemic. And I think I\u2019ve had it. \n\nI have a solid offer to move overseas and teach independently (outside of a university setting) and I\u2019m at about 86% in accepting the offer. Am I insane?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the feedback, you all are wonderful! I most likely knew what I was going to do, even before writing this but it\u2019s nice to hear other perspectives. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever used Reddit for something personal, and you did not disappoint. Thank you again :)",

You're doing something that makes you unhappy and presumably you're thinking that if you just stick with it that you'll get tenure and you'll be happy? But why would doing more of the same make you happy? Don't spend your life living to other people's expectations of what you should be doing and don't spend your life being miserable in the hope that being more senior in the thing that makes you miserable will somehow make you happy. Life's too short for that.",

And stability is only nice with a good job, otherwise that's just a rut. \n\nFind the good job that makes you happy, stability will probably blossom from that (or at least personal stability, the job may change). \n\nI say this so much on here but don't be miserable now for the imagined trade off of a happy future. If it's making you miserable, you'll probably still be miserable when you get the thing your being miserable for right now.

And In my experience it\u2019s always best to do everything you can to make things work where you are rather than moving. If you have a reason to move, like you can\u2019t do what you wanna do where you are that\u2019s different. But from what you\u2019ve posted it seems like making progress with faculty and students would make you feel more comfortable and happier? So then this seems like a somewhat fixable problem. Easy teaching gigs are fun and pay relatively well, but I get really bored quickly teaching some stuff and I think you likely would too. You have a lot of power now. If you leave you lose it all. I found out the hard way that people respect the position you are in, not who you are or what you have done/can do. If I was in your position I would be hustling to build my own thing, something that would make me really happy. You totally could do that in your position, heck as a tentured prof you could do pretty much anything within reason. Even something radical like creating a new thing at the school etc\u2026 if it goes bad then you leave knowing that you did everything you could. I think you\u2019re smart for considering other options but you\u2019re also smart enough to create your dream life with what you have.",
