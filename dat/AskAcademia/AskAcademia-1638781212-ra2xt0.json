I was having trouble finding video resources on YouTube explaining step by step the method.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nAlso side question, is it common or acceptable to work in multiple research labs at the same time as an undergraduate? Are there any norms I should be aware of in relation to that?",

      "text": "Im currently working in a new group where I'm doing some pretty interesting work. But I feel like I'm not growing at the rate i want to. I've committed to 6 months and its been 3 months so far, but the PI is very unresponsive. They tell me to ask questions but never answer them. I message them on Teams, they ignore me. I sent them an email with some questions, they ignored it. All the things I learnt in this project so far, I had to teach myself as they provided 0 reading resources so far. This has been happening for weeks now and I dont think I can waste another 4 months here. Im thinking of moving to another group, which should be easier than before considering ive got a couple of yrs of research experience now.\r  \n\r  \nI get they are busy and have lots of things happening but not responding for weeks is not fair, especially since they respond to the grad students but not to me.",

All the online guides I've found give examples for how to write results of your own research data, not the culmination of what others have written and i'm really struggling.\n\nThanks in advance",

Generally a good idea is reading a similar review from your research topic/discipline/target journal and going off from there. Also obvious ask your advisor/PI too for help!",

I'm really at a loss since BOTH seem interesting to me, and I can't (without a pretty non trivial time investment) make a decision of which one I think I would prefer. Im still in undergrad so I'm not forced to make a decision yet, but I would rather not spend 2 years preparing for something I'm not actually that interested in.  \nAny words of wisdom are appreciated!",
