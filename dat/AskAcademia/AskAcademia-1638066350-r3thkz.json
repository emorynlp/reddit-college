  "text": "Per the title. I defend my dissertation in a few days, and I feel like my defense is shaping up to be very... Unimpressive for a variety of reasons. My committee gave me the green light to look for jobs and write a dissertation. I turned in the document a few days ago, and I have a job lined up, but I'm growing nervous about my defense because, well, it feels like it's garbage. \n\nI'm largely asking because I want to know just how bad I need to do in order to actually fail.",

Otherwise there are so many checks and balances prior to the defense itself in that system, that something would really have to go wrong. \n\nLike, in Finland (humanities), I had to submit to my advisor, she had to approve. Then I had to submit to the faculty council (a representative body of the school), they had to approve. I had to submit to two external reviewers, and they had to approve. Then the faculty council had to read their reviews to decide whether my case merited a defense. Then I was allowed to schedule a defense and work with my advisor to invite the opponent (another external reviewer) to test me in the defense. If they let me get that far and had any doubts, the fault would really be theirs. \n\nThe only warning I\u2019ve always given my doctoral students (in a somewhat different system, but with similar checks) is that one could still fail if it becomes apparent in the defense that one really doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about and is not able to argue the point of the thesis.

I\u2019ve heard of others passing contingent upon revisions (which is to say, you\u2019ll pass as soon as the committee, or more often just the advisor, approves of the revisions). \n\nI\u2019ll admit, my defense felt bad, and coming as it did in the middle of the stress and depression associated with the pandemic, I was gutted for a while afterwards. Honestly, if it were possible to be strategic about one\u2019s expectations, I\u2019d suggest that going in worried you won\u2019t pass at all is the better strategy\u2026",

Could just be my program but once you get to the defense stage, only your external can fail you.",

It looks bad on your committee if they gave a green light to a dissertation that wasn't up to par. I know that confidence is not something we all have, but just keep in mind that it's normal to be nervous because this is a big deal!! You could sit there and play with data for more years and still have room for more work. You're ready, take some time to take care of yourself and find and outfit that gives you some confidence. Take care and good luck!!",
