  "text": "In my US history course this semester, I was forced to purchase a $94 online textbook that was written by the professor. Everything that was graded (HW/quizzes/etc.) was done through the book publisher's website, so we either had to buy the book or drop the class.\n\nI just realized that nearly half of the sections in the book had been plagiarized from various online sources. There are no citations whatsoever and I've found that entire paragraphs have been copied word for word from news publications/online blogs/government websites. I used the plagiarism checker on Chegg and it found that some sections were as much as 85% plagiarized from other online sources.\n\nI'm just a bit frustrated right now because I had to spend money on this...\n\nIf I were to do this on one of my papers I would fail the course and possibly face expulsion. Are there any consequences for professors who commit egregious plagiarism? Should I report it to their department chair?",

You may wish to simply report that you've seen identical content elsewhere, rather than making claims about which direction the plagiarism came from, unless you have proof.",

Whenever I\u2019ve been part of publishing a book, there has been an extensive review (usually over months) and I can\u2019t imagine something so blatant being missed. \n\nOP, I might suggest reporting it directly to the publisher and to the research and ethics board at the university, and not mentioning it at all within the department. Some people hold grudges and you don\u2019t want to hurt your academic career because of it - those on the ethics board will have a duty to follow up on it after you report.",

      "text": "OP while I agree with everyone who's saying to report this, I'm assuming you're still taking this course. Wait for the semester to end, and for your grade to be locked in. I'm saying this because it's entirely possible for the professor to retaliate to a complaint. And while you could potentially get that sorted out, there's no guarantees of that and it's still a sword hanging over your head. Meanwhile if you report after your grade is locked in (and if you aren't taking any more courses with this Prof) then he can't exactly do much directly to you.\n\nSo while you should definitely report this, my advice would be to keep it quiet for a little while until you've completed the semester. Also definitely don't gossip about this. If your professor finds out, they could start thinking of ways to discredit you before you report. The system is geared to give greater weight to the instructor complaining about a student than the other way round.",

Typically, one just donates the royalties that would have been earned from the students you teach purchasing your textbook to a scholarship fund, so as to address the financial conflict of interest.",

The university charges you for the course, but the professor is still forcing you to buy a book. Regardless of who wrote the book, if you want to say the professor is charging you again to take the course you've already paid for, then I guess you can make the argument, but that's not how anyone actually views textbook costs. It's accepted that you need to buy books to take the classes you've already paid for.\n\nAnd you're not technically paying for the cost of homework, quizzes, or exams. The professor doesn't care if you check the book out from the library or share with a friend. As long as when the assignment says \"do problems 1-10 on page 231\" you have the same set of problems everyone else has, that's all the professor cares about. And if you can pass the exam without buying the book, again, that's fine. You're paying for the convenience of being able to study and prepare on your own terms.\n\nAlso, consider that the professor who wrote that book may well have signed over copyright to the publisher as part of the publishing deal, in which case he or she is legally and ethically obligated to not provide the material for free. I'd do it anyway, because ethics are a fuzzy gray area and I feel better about breaking a commitment to a publishing company than price-gouging students, but that's not some universal ethical good either, so everyone gets to make their own call there.",

Textbooks tend to have differences in the material they cover as well as exercises. You're free to buy no book at all if you want to, but a typical undergraduate course is going to follow a specific textbook. I'm not making 200 separate syllabuses for a Calculus II course for each student to get their own custom curriculum.\n\n> The OP said that the quizzes/HW had to be done through the publisher's website. Doesn't this mean there is no way to access the quizzes/HW without subscribing to that website? Maybe I am misunderstanding.\n\nNo, I think you're understanding that part correctly, and that does probably lock you into the book. I've never used such a system to know if you have to have a unique code for each student or if you can just sign up for an account without your own copy of the book, but knowing publishers, I'd assume the worst. If so, I'd agree that's a reasonable complaint, but I also understand the other side here, which is that I'm going to assume you're buying the book. For me personally, I'd try to avoid any solution that made it literally impossible to complete the coursework while sharing books or whatever, but I'm not going to go crazy trying to accommodate every possible scenario either. I'm going to pick a book that hopefully doesn't cost a fortune while covering the material the way I think is best to teach it, and then I'm going to proceed as though everyone has access to the book. It's the only way it works.",

      "text": "Everyone is just telling you to report it without any context, and that IMO is a very dangerous thing to do. Thats because there are *very* bad consequences for a prof who is caught plagiarizing. IDK about in other fields but in in history, and you said the prof was teaching a history course, finding out a prof plagiarized something can be career ending. If nothing else it means that that textbook you hate so much probably wont continue with that prof. The reason why they are assigning you that book in the first place is because theyre making good money on royalties. The loss of reputation generally for something like this can be quite serious, it can cost them opportunities in the future, potentially a new job, tenure (if they dont already have it), or promotions and pay raises. \n\nAll this is to say that if you accuse them of something, they have every incentive to A) prove you wrong and B) punish you for falsely accusing them of having done something. How you go about this, and who you bring this to, are very important here. Its not something you just take to the ombudsman and then the prof gets fired. You'd probably have to talk to the Department Chair about this, and if verified I wouldn't be surprised that (with or without you) it escalates even higher up the chain of command. Its a serious thing. Which all means you would need to have your facts straight and *demonstrated* examples of plagiarism. Without specific examples (please dont link me specific examples) of both blatant and lengthy plagiarism I dont think you'll get anywhere. If you bring evidence that 80% of one paragraph in a 500pg textbook was 80% copied, as told by [Chegg.com](https://Chegg.com), you'll look like a student who is just complaining about text book prices or grades. If you do, almost certainly this will get swept under the rug and ignored. When I deal with student plagiarism, I try to find as many examples as possible (usually thats not too hard), and then I actually go to the sources used themselves and compare the language from one to another. I try to understand the student's plagiarism process so that when I hand them back an F there is no chance for a debate. \n\nIn a perfect world, you could express your concerns to the appropriate authorities and not have to worry about negative consequences. You would tell the chair, they would look at the book and decide for themselves, and appropriate sanctions would be levied against the offender. Like you said, thats what would happen if *you* got caught. But we dont live in a perfect world, and the classic maxim still rings true. If you take a shot at the king, you best not miss. If you level serious accusations against your prof's textbook, you best be able to back them up when placed under scrutiny.",

The only way their complaint will be taken seriously is if they do a good job, it\u2019s not about \u201cdueling\u201d with the professor. \n\nIf in the second case this is something the person doesn\u2019t actually feel strongly about then the risks outweigh the rewards. There is very little upside to a halfassed and easily dismissed complaint and a nonzero risk factor. If OP doesn\u2019t feel strongly about doing the work why would they expect everyone else, who have strong motivations *not* to investigate, to do that for them?\n\nIf in the third case this is something done to punish the professor for assigning an expensive textbook, I think it\u2019s a very bad idea. The small amount of temporary pain they cause to the prof could come back to bite OP, or the whole class, in unexpected ways. Say if they have the prof again, or expect to get extra credit/a bump up come finals time. \n\nAnd of course we\u2019re assuming that OP is correct that the textbook is plagiarized. If OP is mistaken, and they write an anonymous email cc\u2019d to the Chair, Dean, Uni Prez, Ombudsman, the Publisher, Mom, Dad, Joe Biden, and apple pie, that\u2019s wrong and irresponsible. If they don\u2019t want to invest the effort in proving their claims they should not float a potentially false allegation out there. Plagiarism is a serious thing and like I said could have very negative consequences for a profs career. If OP isn\u2019t serious enough to do some due diligence maybe they should just forget the whole thing and try to find a good place to resell the book this winter.",

      "text": "Yes, you can decide to report it, but not to the department chair.  Look through your university's website for an anonymous ethics hotline, as your first choice. I don't always advocate anonymous reporting but this is a case where your personal experience isn't relevant, so an anonymous report with enough detail (e.g., specific sources you believe were plagiarized from, with highlights showing which language was plagiarized) should be sufficient. If you don't find that, look for an ethics officer, misconduct policy, or even a research integrity officer. They won't be the one who handles this, as it's not a research issue, but they'll find the person who is, and your university is required to have a RIO if it accepts certain kinds of funding, so they may be the person easiest for you to find.\n\nI suggest starting with such a person because ideally you want someone who knows the rules and processes around plagiarism issues, and who is *not* part of the department in question. Departments have a conflict of interest around wanting to protect their own, and often don't know the relevant rules and laws, and may not be sensitive to your rights as someone filing a report.  A compliance officer is specifically tasked with looking into issues like this and also with protecting someone who files such a report against retaliation.\n\nSimultaneously, you could report to the publisher.  The university *should* do this if they find after their own investigation that plagiarism did occur, but those investigations are a long slow process, and ultimately the publisher will want to do its own investigation which is another long slow process.  These things can happen in parallel, if you notify both.  (They *may* not - in theory a publisher could decide to wait for a university process to finish or vice versa - but in my experience each organization wants to do its own investigation.)\n\nI agree that this late in the semester you may as well wait until the course is over and your grade is locked in, to prevent potential retaliation if you are identified as the source of the report.",

This awful scam tends to overwhelmingly infect shitty departments and subpar scholars. Actual academic oversight prevents this sort of thing, and it does not fall under \"academic freedom.\" If I heard of a colleague doing this I would complain to the dean (all of my courses are peer reviewed articles, you know, the freely available  top-tier research that academics produce, textbooks are barely even useful for intro and I don't use them essentially ever although I have giant stacks to choose from as the publishers are aggressive af).\n\nAs per plagiarism, that's more of a faux pas at the academic level unlike at the undergraduate one. I always say that if you really want to be a dick download their PhD and run it through turnitin and look for actual plagiarism. If they did it once they probably did it twice. If they simply stole their shitty textbook you could report it, but I doubt anything happens.\n\nI remember a few years ago a professor got caught plagiarizing recent theses and turning them into for-profit and paid articles. They got a minor reprimand and the young scholars were literally told to sue personally for damages. The school said they would be representing the professor.
