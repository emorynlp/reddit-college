  "title:": "I\u2019m a fourth-semester PhD student, and my advisor passed away suddenly on Sunday less than two months before I\u2019m due to defend my thesis proposal. What now?",
  "text": "Both I and my advisor\u2019s other graduate student have meetings with the professor in charge of our group\u2019s graduate program to discuss what comes next. Luckily, our department is tight knit, and I\u2019m not at all worried about my funding or completing my degree or anything like that. I just want to emphasize that funding or finding another advisor is not what I\u2019m worried about.\n\nI\u2019m worried about finishing a PhD without *my* advisor. He was wonderful. He was cited just shy of 20,000 times. He wrote and published something like 300 papers. He was the editor in chief of the journal I\u2019m about to submit to. We just finished writing our first and only proposal together barely a month ago, and now he\u2019s gone. Even if we had eventually won the grant, I have no idea what the protocol is when the PI dies before it can be awarded, which is just one example of many of the questions I\u2019m now drowning in.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just at a loss and hoping to find any kind of general guidance you all may have as far as the things that probably come with this situation. I would deeply appreciate any and all advice, guidance, thoughts, anything.",

      "text": "Edit: apologies if any of this seems a little blunt. These are just my practical thoughts on the experience of losing a colleague and friend after having several years to deal with it. \n\nThis happened with one of my committee members. I lost out on the job he had been championing me for (he passed away before the reference was sent, and unfortunately no one knew he had died for two weeks-- I found out when I called the dept concerned after not hearing from him), and found out later that his lack of reference was a deciding factor in choosing the 2nd candidate. It was an academic job, so protocol for applications was pretty strict, and given his sudden passing, it wasn't public info for a while, and I was in no state to worry about references anyway. My point being-- there are some shitty external consequences of something like this, but try to remember that it's really out of your hands, and try not to put too much pressure on yourself to control everything. There are people that know how to handle this in your department. Focus on trying to do what you need to do emotionally. \n\nA few regrets: I wasn't around on campus much when this happened, as it was after my defense. Because if this, I wasn't around when they cleaned out his office/went through things/divvied up books, etc...  I really, really regret this. Other faculty close to him have a few books that he notated and doodled in heavily, so I'm lucky some are preserved, but I personally wasn't able to take anything before it was tossed (it's my understanding that much of it went to salvage). There was a lot of obscure stuff that likely wouldn't have had any meaning to most people aside from those who worked closely with him. This may or may not be the case for you, but  I would suggest that you keep tabs on what's happening with his personal affects and with his family if you can in an unobtrusive way. Universities aren't always very careful about these kinds of things, especially when there are no family to advocate for the deceased. \n\nI would also look into how any partially written/drafted material of his will be handled, if it's of value to you or something you worked on together. In a more personal case, I was able to request that the family member search for a letter of recommendation my Prof wrote for me for another program. They never found it, but it would have been invaluable to have his written thoughts of me if they had. \n\n\nLuckily, after taking a job I didn't enjoy after the academic one fell through, I ended up running into one of his colleagues at a conference. This colleague is head of a Center in our uni that does a lot of work intersecting with my committee member's. We drank and mourned his loss, and I was offered a job on the spot back at the University to publish a book based on the work of my committee member and his mentor. Some of the funds for my position are actually from his family, which is pretty incredible. I've been hard at work on it for the past year, and it's pretty sad sometimes but also pretty incredible to know that I'm keeping his work alive (and hopefully not screwing it up too badly). That's all you can really do-- keep them alive by passing on what they taught you, both as an advisor and as a dearly missed friend. \n\nGood luck to you. I hope my ramblings are helpful in some way.\n\nPS- I don't know anything about atmospheric science, but I can tell he was a prolific writer and accomplished academic. May you carry on his legacy!",

We lost a president some years ago who was widely respected and also a scholar in my field. Some of his staff went through his books and offered them to faculty who knew him and shared his interests...I still have several of his books in my collection, classics that he annotated heavily back when he was still teaching/writing in the 1970s-1980s, and I always smile when I open one.",

      "text": "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nThe faculty should take care of you.  They will figure out who will take over chairing your dissertation (you should have input).  It will not be the same.  You will have to learn someone new, but odds are, they will not mess with your topic or methodology.  I have even seen a case following a death where there was a faculty that was technically the chair, but since no one else really did what the other professor did, they found an outside person to really advise the project.  But if you already know someone that was a close collaborator or someone on your committee you get along well with, you may be proactive and ask them to help.\n\nGranting agencies have had this happen before and they have a process for this.  If the grant is awarded, they will transfer PI to another investigator.  My post-doc mentor passed away (after I left the lab, but I was still in regular contact) and the people in the lab were almost surprised how easy it was in that they just followed the process, filled out the paperwork, and everything just switched over. \n\nAs for the papers you are working on, you can still publish, he can even be a co-author if it is a paper he has be contributing to.  This would be conversation you would have with your grad director or chair so you understand what is typically done in your field.  The functioning of the journal will not be impacted by his passing in that they will probably elevate an associate editor to an interim chief until they find a replacement.  So you can still submit your papers there. \n\nAs someone else said, take some time and grieve.  Things will work out, but it will take some time and there is no reason to rush anything.",

A month after my mentor lost her long battle with cancer, we got word that the grant is to be funded. Given the stage in my career I did not have the necessary experience to lead the grant. The NIH were willing to fund the project if someone with a similar level of experience to my late mentor was able to step in as PI. Someone did and the grant was funded.\n\nThough the timing may also influence this as our grant had been reviewed/scored and we were waiting for the final decision. If it was still to be submitted a different approach may have been better .\n\nA tragic as this situation is - and having been there myself have an idea of the questions/emotions going through your head at the moment - I will say that this has happened before and will happen again. The university and funding agency will have dealt with it or have plans in place to deal with it. There are options and a path forward even if it may not seem like that at the moment.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want. I'm happy to try and answer any other questions that you might have.",

We lost a professor in my program to a heart attack (he was just 56) and the department was quite good at helping students find other advisors, especially if they were well into their dissertations or nearing defense. It was harder for younger students, many of whom ended up leaving as it took several years to replace him with another expert in the same subfield.\n\nUltimately I'd expect your director of graduate studies and department chair to be taking the lead on this, and they should be able to address your questions about all of these topics. Meanwhile, take time to grieve and support your fellow students, faculty, and staff, all of whom have experienced loss. At our professor's funeral the church hit overflow capacity and many people who had been gone for years came to pay their respects, it was moving and a good way to connect with others who were also grieving.

Needless to say I\u2019m so sorry to read that you\u2019ve lost yours.  It seems like your advisor was one of the good ones, a true mentor and supporter of you as a scientist and a human. \n\nI admired my advisor and his loss was a huge setback both research wise and just overall.  I was at the beginning of my second year, right as my research was picking up. I really didn\u2019t touch my project for almost 6 months, partially because it happened right before the holidays but mostly bc I needed time to grieve.  I was lucky in that the head PI of the grant that is funding my PhD is another faculty at my university so my project and funding source didn\u2019t change.  So I\u2019m still here, and my entire PhD dissertation and any publications are dedicated to this man who changed my career trajectory. \n\nOne thing I struggled with, that you mentioned, is that this project is no longer ours. I\u2019ve had to move on and complete the work without him. It\u2019s sucked. I think about him everyday and wish he was still here. I thought we worked so well together and I selfishly want him back so I can learn more from him.  He was a great scientist and amazing advisor. \n\nRegarding the grant and other administrative things, use the department and other faculty for help.  I can give advice for the grieving process. I want to encourage you to take care of yourself in the coming days, weeks and months.  Your sense of normal is gone and it\u2019s a lot to process!  I hope your department and lab mate are able to support you in this hard time. \n\nThis is unfortunately a small club to be part of, please reach out to me if you need anything. I wish you all the best!  *internet hugs*",
