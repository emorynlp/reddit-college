  "text": "Hi \n\nI am a research student in Sydney and I am doing archival research in urban history. The story might be a bit anachronistic to some of you.\n\nI am doing a one year honour program and it is supposed to be my dissertation applying for PhD candidacy next year. It is crucial considering my architectural design background. Nevertheless, the lockdown of Sydney bursts suddenly, it seems like the archive would not be accessible at least till the end of the year. It is due in November and it is August now, so change methodology fundamentally might not be an option. On the other hand, a sloppy dissertation would immediately terminate my academic path.\n\nPessimistic that it might be an unsolvable situation but any ideas are welcome.\n\nBest",

      "text": "Have you reached out to the archive yet? Many archives are getting creative about how research can be made possible. I am in the US so things are different of course but the archive I currently work with here has been requiring appointments in advance and limiting the number of people in their research room. They have also been scanning more for people and helping look through documents more than they usually would for people unable to come in person. A big concern for archivists during the pandemic has been how to still serve the public and support research. I recommend contacting the archive and explaining your situation to see if there is some way you can move forward.\n\nAlternatively you could switch your topic somewhat so you are using material already available online.",

          "text": "Unfortunately, Sydney is a little different context to US that government seems preferring to completely cut off all the public service like archive and library. I am in a tricky situation that I was just about finishing the work with one institute and deduced a hypothesis, which needs material from another location. I will contact them for information and prepare for the worst.\n\nThanks for your advice and I guess I am a bit calm down now from the shock. Yes there were a few choices to adjust my topic and it might not be a totally bad thing to have a chance to review and look back to the big picture.",

Is there any way that you can contact the various places, explaining your dilemma? In my situation, a great deal was already online (quite a lot not, though), and my final project reflected what I could find and analyse with the caveat of what I could not find.",

It was thought to be just another two-week inconvenience but seems stickier. Yes I will contact the uni to discuss options and I might have to supplement it by a section of media representation analysis, in which material is largely online.",
