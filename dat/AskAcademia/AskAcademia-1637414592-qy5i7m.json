  "title:": "MSc in Applied Biochem looking to combine it with another MSc (reason included). Please help!",
  "text": "**Hello all, please read till the end to have the full image. Thank you!**\n\nI have graduated last year (2020) with an MSc in Applied Biochemistry. The name looks big but I actually lack ***a lot*** of \"applied\" lab methods and techniques, mainly due to our university's budget and inability to provide more materials but I am thankful regardless :).\n\nUnfortunately, in my country (3rd world, limited opportunities in STEM), there isn't a big demand for biochemists, there are no startups or companies where I can work in interesting jobs (very limited to basic work that any lab technician can do and that's it. You cannot move forward in your career).\n\n**I want to get another Masters degree :**\n\n* I am hesitant whether to seek another masters in Biochemistry (pick a program focused on the practical side)\n* or seek a different one in an area that I am interested in such as Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology (open to suggestions, all subdisciplines of biology are interesting for me)\n* What degree, if combined with my theoretical knowledge in Biochem, can give me a big push in my studies and future career?\n* Based on my interests what countries offer the best Masters programs and what countries have a high demand for Biochemists, Molecular Biologists, Biotechnologist, Bioinformaticians?\n* Not important but curious : Which one of the above makes more money in EU or America? I guess more or less they make about the same?\n\n**Reason why not a PhD :**\n\n* When I check some programs, I see that I cannot fulfill some requirements such as \"wet lab\" skills\n* Many draw PhD as a very serious, somewhat tough commitment, and since I will be experiencing life abroad for the first time, I am afraid of failure\n* Overall not confident tbh, I rather form my self properly before engaging in a such step\n\n**About me :**\n\n* 25 years old Female from Algeria\n* Holder of a Master Degree in Applied Biochemistry (Good grades, 2020, Algeria)\n* Zero (0) work experience in the field of my studies\n* Three (3) years experience as an online Virtual Assistant\n* C1 in English, C1 in French, Native Arabic Speaker\n* Around 10K in savings (cannot save more)\n* I do not mind learning a new language, I don't have issues with any weather\n* Interested in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Biotechnology...\n* My Masters Thesis : *In silico* design of new inhibitors of an enzyme by molecular docking\n\n**I want to hear your suggestions or experiences and I will be really grateful for any advice or guidance.**",

For someone with a masters and thinking about a second masters, no. At least in some parts of Europe you'd be looking at three years for the PhD vs two for the second masters. \n\nIn terms of immigration, a PhD is far more useful than a masters. In terms of funding, they are much better than a masters.",

All you need is a chance to find an internship or secondment in a lab that will boost your wet lab skills. You can do it! You have everything you need.\n\nEdit:\nYou need to identify labs that motivate and excite you and contact them.
