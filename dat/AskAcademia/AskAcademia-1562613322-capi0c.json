  "title:": "How can we ethically justify training graduate students?",
  "text": "My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:\n\n* Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about [2.5 times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About [one in three](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422) end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. \n\n* For [80%](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184130) of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over [10%](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663) actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions [1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.\n\n* [Most](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367) biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc [salaries](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00587-y) are lower than that of a new [college graduate](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html) even though the postdoc is working [50+](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/4/245/253174) hours per week and is [9](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab27.htm) years older than the new college grad. \n\n* [20%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318302312#sec0030) of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.\n\n* If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary ([~$48K/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf) )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research [4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0241). \n\n* Moreover, several studies agree that there isn\u2019t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs [6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766) lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether. \n\nSo if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route? \n\nI think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile. \n\nSo how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] http://rescuingbiomedicalresearch.org/blog/bias-distribution-k99-awards-faculty-hires/\n\n[2] https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622886v1.full\n\n[3] https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005\n\n[4] http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367\n\n[5] https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766\n\n[6] http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663\n\n[7] https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766\n\n[8] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318302312#bib0465",

Practically this might mean not taking students unless you can guarantee good, ample, stable funding, health insurance, vacation time, etc for them. \n\nI think that some European institutions have done good work in this direction.\n\nIn the long term, I don't know what kind of reforms are needed.",

Can you please explain?\n\nNot OP but guessing the answer is this: you can go right into a successful industry career with a permanent position. You often have to wade through postdocs, research positions, often contingent positions, etc. to just have the small *chance* at a TT job -- and even then you are at the mercy of the market in terms of location, department, and school. Yes if you get TT it is great security (well...if you actually get tenured), but everything prior to that -- and the chances of getting that TT in the first place -- makes going straight into a good industry position potentially much more desirable in terms of security.",

Some of this is due to degree inflation, but it was around even before the '08 Recession. In short, most companies prefer to have people with higher degrees managing groups. So it's very unlikely that someone with a bachelors is going to be supervising people with masters or higher (unless they have a lot of experience). So if you have a group with researchers that have masters or PhDs then the management is most likely going to have a masters or PhDs (or terminal degrees). In pharma it's pretty common to find PhDs or MD/PhDs that are heads of research.",

But as someone who grew up well below the poverty line, academia was a career I could get into that didn't require expensive professional school (the massive costs of writing standardized tests and interviews for medical school kept me from even bothering).  Getting paid to do a graduate degree was mind blowing for me relative to that.  It also was the first time I travelled internationally.  I really don't think that I would have done better in the private sector being someone who was bright, but didn't really know how professional fields work at all.\n\nThen again, I went to a public school in a country with reasonably-priced higher education that didn't require the GRE/SAT/etc.  I also had a great mentor.  All those things would help anybody in academia I think.",

For me, the MCAT was a huge barrier because I just didn't have the finances to get all the study prep in that I knew wealthier students had, and I was worried about paying for the test itself.  So I'd love to know relative admission rates to grad school vs. various professional schools by income.\n\nBut I agree success is also another interesting question.  I've found the American system is very school- oriented (e.g. a degree from Harvard is considered to be far superior than one from a state university). In my country, we don't have near this bias.  I'm TT at a worldwide top 20 university despite doing my PhD at an equivalent of a state university.",

Some fields are well off for PhD grads, some moderately well off, and some exceptionally poor. \n\nTo me, the biggest thing we can do as faculty is help our students be aware of the situation such that they are making informed choices. A lot of that, in STEM, is helping them make connections in non-academic markets to know what those fields look for, and what those jobs involve- this makes it possible for students to pivot to gainful employment more easily.\n\nI also think you're slightly over-interpreting the early PhD career academic interest (80%)- most students don't enter a PhD really having any idea of what a scientist outside of academia does, and there's a significant decline in interest during the PhD due to this.",

Only a small number of people \"make it\" and most people end up moving on and doing something else with their lives.\n\nOn the upside the unemployment rate for PhDs is something like 1%, so even though you might end up underemployed or not using your degree with a lot of sunk costs, it definitely doesn't mean you will be on the street.  You might have all kinds of unusual options open to you.\n\nIf it were presented as akin to signing a D1 scholarship  with the dream of becoming professional athlete or hauling long hours with low pay with the dream of becoming the head chef at a restaurant rather than a route that makes financial sense, perhaps people's view of \"failing\" to become a professor or seeing a PhD as a totally economically secure route (compared to the loss of earning potential) would be clearer.",

But during the time you spend in academia, you (broadly) get to pick who you work with, where you work, and what you work on. That's an incredible privilege, so it makes sense that lots of people are willing to take a pay Cut in exchange for such a job.\n\nI strongly disagree with this thought process, including the \"post-docs are still in training\" excuse as a justifications for their salary. It's basically a version of \"you're doing a job you love it could be worse\" which is basically never a good justification for a salary level, otherwise we would have salary tiers to pay people based on how happy they are at work.   Plain and simple it's supply and demand - if we could pay post-docs the salary they actually deserve we would, but given the demand we don't have to. We should all be honest that their pay is too low instead of justifying it with non-economics based excuses that sends the message that they don't deserve more - they do - we just don't have to pay them more given the demand.\n\nWhen California changed their overtime laws my institution forced everyone to bump their new postdocs up by $1200 a year, and my professor told me to my face that if he could he would pay all the postdocs $1200 less because when he was a postdoc he made less than graduate students do today. There is just insane justifications out there for post-doc pay, and some like this one devalue you on many levels. The best part is that professor was hired so long ago doing a post-doc was not even a defacto requirement to get a TT professorship at a big name university at the time.\n\nIf we think a PhD has value we should compensate like it does. In my no-income-tax state, I had a grad student move to a coastal school for their post-doc and after taxes they only made $350(!) more a month than they did as a grad student, not to mention the difference in cost of living. That is entirely unacceptable no matter how you slice it. Yes they could chose an industry job if salary was that important to them, but people also chose industry jobs because they actually want them  - and does industry pay those people less because they actually want that job? No, they pay them for their PhD and experience.",

I think though the straightforward question to ask that isn't really answered in your examples is: how many recent graduates regret doing a PhD? How many people wish that they had taken a different path? While I suspect that measuring regret (without comparing across groups or something) isn't a great raw indicator, I'm also not sure all of these measurements are measuring life satisfaction that well either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm convinced that 1) PhD students aren't happy/don't have great finances (and neither are postdocs -- though depending on the definition of existential crisis 20% doesn't sound that bad tbh); 2) many phd's want academic jobs but we don't get them; 3) doing a postdoc then going into industry isn't really better than straight to industry (in terms of the industry job you get); 4) industry jobs don't let you do the \"research whatever you want (kinda)\" that academia does\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I guess you haven't convinced me that industry as a fall back plan is all that grim. like ya your students going into industry won't make bank necessarily but maybe they are fine with that? you compare phd postdoc versus phd, and phd postdoc versus college grad generally, but if someone was going to go into the biomedical industry, how does having a phd (vs no phd; some kind of ba/ma) change things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin fairness, its clear you're in this position of applying to TT jobs, and probably checking out industry alternatives, and all the options other than TT look pretty grim to you -- thats personal experience that I don't have. I guess the question is -- if you don't get your TT job, will you regret doing a phd? (it might be hard to know the answer for sure)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd honestly, I totally feel this way all the time. to answer your question about training and encouraging/discouraging students -- coming into a phd program personally I wasn't naive about job opportunities (nor I think are most of my cohort) and that I probably won't be a professor. but I thought the chance to do a phd for \"free\" was worth it -- an 'opportunity of a lifetime!' -- and I could leave whenever I decided on something better to do (before or after I finish). though I still sometimes feel even if I walked away tomorrow it was still worth it, what I think I was actually naive about was how painful/hard it can feel to leave (or to stay) years later, after it feels like I've given my phd my everything. I'm not sure how I could've explained that to my younger self. but then again, maybe if I actually do leave ill see that the \"well let's just try it out\" approach had been right all along: I'll be both happy I did it and happy I left. who knows",

If a student wants to make big bucks, you should tell them to go elsewhere. If a student wants to work and fight and struggle to figure out how things work, without being driven by a paycheck, invite them into your lab. That struggle can be its own reward, and those who enjoy it are probably those most likely to stick to it and end up with grants, faculty positions, etc.",

      "text": "From [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6369/1388](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6369/1388):\n\n>The current tensions in the biomedical workforce are well-documented and  familiar: In the United States, real levels of federal research funding  declined by nearly 20% from 2003 to 2016\n\nThis of course doesn't answer or solve all of the problems, but I think the minor differences in earnings you cite may well be attributable to your government cutting your funding by 20% (perhaps I am misunderstanding this figure or how grants trickle down to postdocs). When framed this way, suddenly it seems less like a discussion of what you personally are doing unethically (although I understand that sometimes we can do nothing and can only worry about the ethics of our own actions).\n\nIn my country, we have recently gutted funding for physics and mathematics at the national level. Do we now consider ourselves individually unethical if we encourage students to study mathematics? Hardly. Yes, it's important to be honest with them that the funding is worse, but it's basically understood that none of us are doing this for the money, we're doing this for fun/fulfillment/prestige/advancement of human knowledge. If we don't acknowledge this, and if earnings and job availability are all that shapes our ethics, then your argument extends immediately to the conclusion that we can't advise students to do *anything*, except for the top paying career. Also, even with the cuts, the money isn't *that* bad.\n\nThe psychological problems for students and postdocs are of course a big concern - I believe quite strongly in telling students that this is a risk. But I also think it's important to frame it as something that can be overcome with the right skills and will likely be character building if done right and with correct support.\n\nAlso, I like to remind people that we are in an incredibly unusual time in the history of academia: more technology, more people, incredibly higher levels of education than ever before. We are going to have to work out some kinks before this settles into a better system - 100 years ago it simply wasn't a problem to worry about whether students were depressed or if we had enough TA's or funding or if you could get a job. The societal conditions were so bad that there was basically no competition, so it's *excellent* that this is no longer true, but it also means we are in a transitional period and the blend of the old system with the new isn't really working (see of course for example academic publishing).\n\nSo I think you are right to question the ethics of what's going on, but we also must not throw out the whole academic project just because of this weird transitional period (I would consider advising students away from academia to be the collapse of the academic project). Rather, we need to expand and modify it to work in a world where many more people are and want to be participants. Easier said than done, though.",

They really said, unless you are doing a phD for the sake of wanting to have a phD and wanting to do the research even if it means less pay and more work, don't do it. They went out of their way to always tell us that and even held evening panels every year in the spring for juniors and seniors to Q&A so anyone even considering a phD could go in and talk to them about it. One of the things I'll never forget is them saying \"it might seem like every econ professional you know has a phD but that is because we're the ones teaching you. Out in the real world, there are plenty of people with an econ background but no phD having great lives too\"",
