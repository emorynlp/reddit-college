  "text": "So this year I've applied to our town's art college and got into interior design faculty, even though I've wanted to study digital art (if you have good grades you can transfer, but it's quite hard). \n\n For about two months I've been doing good, but recently I've had a lot of problems with working on my assignments, I find it extremely hard to even start doing anything, and the exams, where you have to show everything you've done are only a month away and I have tons of unfinished work. \n\n My teachers are concerned, my parents are concerned, I am concerned, and I honestly don't know what to do. Even if I start doing something, I find myself staring in the window for hours straight.\n\n Any help would be greatly appreciated",

      "text": "Have you tried to get professional help? Sometimes we have conditions that doesn't materialize until we're older, and these conditions can be a huge obstacle in doing things. If you want to do something, but find yourself struggling with it, it's a huge signal that you need to focus first on yourself and do everything in your hands to figure out what the hell is happening. I too had these kind of problems, no matter how hard I would've tried, if I didn't start to seek help, I would never have gotten out of that hole by myself.",
