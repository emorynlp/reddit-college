  "text": "I have a course which counts attendance as 15% of our final grade. However, I have missed more classes than recommended this semester and desperately need to pass. I know the material very well but with being close to the end of the semester, I need a way to explain this to my professor in a more genuine manner. Does anyone have any advice that could help besides telling me just to \u201cgo to class\u201d?",

I also know that personally talking to them can usually go a long way but I guess it\u2019s the addressing of your own demons that will be the hardest part. ",

Remember that even if you do the work they can, will, and have to drop you from the class if you don't show up for x amount of days without a good excuse so just be careful of that.",
