  "text": "I am planning on going into a medical program in fall 2019 for ultrasound, but I still need 31 credit hours. I plan on doing the spring and summer 2019 term (all online courses). I plan on taking 17 credit hours this Spring semester: \n\n1. Anatomy&Physiology I\n2. Intro to Sociology\n3. Medical Ethics\n4. Physics II\n5. Intro to Computer Science\n\nDoes this seem too much? I took 12 credit hours online last semester and got 3 A\u2019s and a B+.\n",

              "text": "I understand, but only people with experience in the classes at your school can really have valuable insight here imo. Like at my alma mater 17 is at the high end of normal for a liberal arts student but Engineers do 17 like each semester. There\u2019s is just too much variance. Do you have an advisor you could ask? They can at least tell you how common it is to have that kind of work load, especially one that includes those specific classes ",
