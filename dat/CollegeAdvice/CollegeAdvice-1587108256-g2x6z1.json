  "text": "I was wondering if I should make my classes all Pass/Fails instead of getting the letter grades. Because of the quarantine, the school I\u2019m taking classes at is allowing to make classes pass/fail. These 3 online classes are the last credits I need to graduate and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m doing really bad in them. I missed a lot of work and my professors have been very unclear as to whether I\u2019m going to pass or not. I\u2019m trying to get the final projects in on time and do as much as I can. Would making the class pass/fail be a good idea or am I just screwed either way?",
