  "text": "I am a high school junior in Ohio.\n\nI am in my 4th year of Spanish, and have gotten A\u2019s in all my previous Spanish classes (most likely I will in my current course as well). \n\nThe colleges I am considering are Miami University (Oxford, Ohio), Wittenberg University, and The Ohio State University. I am planning on majoring in business or political science and going to law school.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I hate taking foreign language. I\u2019ve heard that AP Spanish is a ton harder than any other Spanish class and that college Spanish (or any foreign language) would be similar.\n\nIs there any way I can avoid a foreign language in college? Let me know if you need more information for a good determination.",

      "text": "The only way to avoid college language classes would be to test out of them either by the AP classes or by the school itself, otherwise most schools will require you to take 1-3 classes (or years). Honestly language classes are not the worst, they are definitely tailored to your level (that\u2019s why many schools test you before allowing you to enroll), I promised they are all more than doable and you will be ok :)",
