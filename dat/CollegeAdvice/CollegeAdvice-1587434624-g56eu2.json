      "text": "As someone who once did pre med but changed majors in their 3rd year, I would say if you're in doubt, just go with nursing. \n\nMed school is really tough to get into, even if you have high grades and great MCAT scores. Even if you get into med school, you have to complete residency which can be anywhere from 2-6 years depending on what specialization you choose. \n\nNursing though is a little less school after college. Nursing programs are usually 2-4 years and then you get to start right after graduation. \n\nI'm not saying you should do one or the other outright. However, if you are really determined to be a doctor, then pursue the pre med path. Just know that it is a long road after college and you have to have a super high GPA otherwise you don't stand a chance. But as I said earlier, if you're still insure or your GPA isn't at least a 3.5, maybe nursing might be a better option.",

      "text": "Honestly, take nursing. I'm a nursing major rn, and if I ever do decide to be a doctor, I'll only be a few classes away from being able to take an MCAT. But also, it's nicer to have that BSN while studying to be a doctor. You'll be a lot more comfortable with patients and will have an easier time to communicate with them.\n\nOverall, with a nursing degree, you'll just have a lot more paths you can take, versus with pre-med where after undergrad, there's not a lot of options if you decide to stop there... At least post pre-med paths that don't make a lot of money.\n\nAlso, if you choose a BSN, and work for a hospital, many of them offer to pay tuition to many grad degree for nurses or for them to work on a specialty.",

      "text": "Hi, the great thing is that you've chosen to things that go hand in hand and you have time to fine tune your decision. It would be different if you said you were a graduating senior trying to choose between nursing and criminal justice. It's possible to choose either and change at most schools especially within the first two years. The prerequisites will be comparable so you wouldn't have wasted time or money. You might want to think about how flexible your life is right now. You may be willing to stay in school for long enough to complete medical school but you may be in a financial position where you need to start making money way before med school is over. I would normally suggest students try to volunteer/shadow/interview a professional in the field. Unfortunately, the lock down makes that pretty difficult. I am resisting the urge to quiz you because I don't want to get too long-winded. Hopefully, my answer isn't too long! I'm brand new to Reddit and saw your post. I hope it was helpful.",

Also, I'm interested in possibly becoming an OB/GYN but I heard that it is stressful, so I was considering dermatology but I know that residency programs can be competitive.",
