  "text": "Hello. I just graduated high school this year and I am considering going out to Los Angeles to attend  Santa Monica College next year but there are a few things that I am confused about and I want some advice. I was born in LA however because of family related stuff I moved to Texas when I was 7 but I have decided to move back out to LA because I hate it here. I applied to several universities in Los Angeles and a little further out and the one that I considered attending was CSUN. I liked the campus and all but I wasn't to sure if I was ready to go to a university and I really hate the valley area (boring and hot).  I should also add that I am not even going to be living in a dorm I would be living in a apartment with my dad. I explained this to my dad and he told me I can go to Santa Monica College and transfer if i like. The only reservation I have is meeting new friends and the opportunities I might be missing I guess. I am definitely not the type of student who is going to a community college because I think it is easier. I am genuinely willing to work hard either way. I have talked to many people about this situation and have gotten mixed responses many people say SMC is a great college in a great area and that the first two years are GE anyway so I should go for it while others say I should go to a university. Did any of you go through a similar situation or can give me your honest advice on what I should do? Would you go to the community college or university? I would really appreciate it  Thanks!",

      "text": "Community College. Hands down. In my experience, going to community college saved me half of my overall 4 year tuition cost. I made some of my best friends in my community college, so your social life won't be dead on arrival, work the Texas drawl a bit. Also, if you go to community college, your classes are smaller, you're not just a number for your professor and advisor, they'll get to know you as a person and what you want to accomplish. They will also help you transfer when the time comes to the right university for your program. My advisor hooked me up with a scholarship that I badly needed. Also, you're coming from out of state, until you establish residency (usually 6 months or so of living in that state) you will be charged as an out of state student, double the price of in-state tuition.",
