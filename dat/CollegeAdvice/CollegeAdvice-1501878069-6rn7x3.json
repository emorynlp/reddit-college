  "text": "I'm starting to look into what I am going to study in school (currently a high school student, going to pass the CHSPE and move onto college within the next year), and the engineering field that has attracted me the most has definitely been Mechanical Engineering. Is it an interesting field? What kind of things are worked on, and what really is done on a day to day basis? I'm also interested in business, as well as Computer Science to some extent, but programming bores me completely. ",
