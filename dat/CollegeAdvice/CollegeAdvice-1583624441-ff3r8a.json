  "text": "I'm taking chem 2 and have had 2 test. My avg is a 62. My teacher only takes test grades into account.  I've usually gotten all the multiple choice right, but end up not doing well on the technical math portion.\n\nI've been studying so much for this class, and want your opinions on whether it's impossible to get a B, and should just aim for a c. He does 5 tests, and the Standard Chemistry exam. I have an A in lab right now. \n\nSidenote for context:My mom took him when she was in college and got an A. Should I brace myself for dropping?",

I would advise taking a look at your professor at ratemyprofessor(dot)com.\n\nIf you are studying that intensely, then there must be something wrong with how the course material is done. Is it the tests?\n\nI'm taking a bio course and my professor does not even give us study guides for quizzes or tests. As you would expect, the first exam's average is a barely-there 60. The second exam average is in the 40s and most quiz averages are D's or lower.\n\nJust try to survive, then decide whether retaking the class next quarter is worth the tuition. Do you have to keep the GPA super high?",
