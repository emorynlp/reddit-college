  "title:": "Decided on College for Pre-Med (Tufts, Northeastern, UNC)",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m looking for some advice on picking a college. I plan to major in either bio or biomed and follow a pre med track. After looking at each of the schools, all seemed to have different strengths and weaknesses. Tufts IMO academically would be the best choice however it is also the most expensive by a fair bit, which I know isn\u2019t the best for students planning on med school. Northeastern and UNC have pretty much no difference in price since I am out of state for UNC-CH, so I am having trouble deciding if UNC is worth it. After touring I loved both Northeastern and UNC, but I didn\u2019t feel anything special at Tufts\n\nANY ADVICE WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED :)\n\nSide note: I was admitted into Northeastern Honors so I have some required honors classes to take.",

      "text": "All of these schools are fantastic!!!! Whatever choice you make will lead you to a great path (also congrats on getting  accepted to all of them!!!). Now to make a decision, all of them have wonderful academic programs and pre-med tracks so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much in that sense. I know it\u2019s silly but it is SO important to feel at home and like you fit it at the university you choose to go to. After all you are going to spend the next 4 years of your life there. What are you expecting from college? A small community? Small classes? If so tufts seems to be a better match as both UNC and Northeastern have almost 20,000 undergrads and their classroom size is going to be in the 150-200 range (mostly for your intro courses). \n\nNow I would have to agree that you should try to limit how much debt you will go in if med school is the ultimate plan cause that is going to be expensive. I would say look at your financial aid packages, compare them and do a loan re-payment projection to see what it would be like in the future. \n\nNow, don\u2019t just choose a University with the best pre-med track because what happens if in your sophomore year you decide mes school is not what you want? What if you like idk anthropology better or maybe even just public health. My point is go to a school that will give you options (which most do) and don\u2019t limit yourself to only the pre med track because at the end of the day over 50% of students will change their mind on what they thought they would study. \n\nLastly, as a UNC grad I am completely biased and would recommend UNC with all my power, it is a FANTASTIC school and I looooved going there (in fact I am hoping to go back for med school) I had so many internship, shadowing and research opportunities that have really built my resume. Professors (most of them) where always super helpful and open to help. Please let me know if you have any questions I am happy to answer :)",

          "text": "Hi! Thanks so much for your response. The only thing that I\u2019m struggling with right now is that I heard that UNC doesn\u2019t have the strongest BME which is what ideally I would fall back on right now. I\u2019m not sure if things have changed in the recent years there though, thanks again for your input!",

              "text": "Yeah, I get that UNC has never been known by their BME program however that\u2019s not to say that is bad. In fact they currently partner with NC State has brought the program a lot of new and exciting new options. If you don\u2019t know NC state has been nationally ranked for their engineering programs so basically you get to take classes and use the same facilities! And it will be noted in your diploma as well (I had friends in the UNC BME program). UNC also has a maker lab with like 3D printers, laser cutters and a bunch of cool equipment that is free for students to use (granted a lot of universities now days have these so there\u2019s that). \n\nAs far as being academically tough and cut throat. I\u2019m not going to lie it is tough, but so are the other universities you are considering. I never experienced anyone not being helpful or trying to consciously \u201cboycott\u201d you. Professors were always super helpful and willing to work with students in any way they could. The atmosphere and helpful environment was one of the things that I enjoyed the most about UNC. We were a very tight knight community even when there were so many of us. I think that for the most part the academic challenges come from the courses themselves, they will be hard no matter where you take them because the subject itself is challenging, granted I was a double major in chem and bio and did a minor in anthropology so my schedule was pretty packed, but it wasn\u2019t impossible and people and professors were always willing to help and answer all of my questions. Let me know if you have anymore questions :)",
