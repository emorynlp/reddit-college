  "text": "so I am a high school senior who is  hesitant to make my college decision. I plan on majoring in biology and finish premed requirements. I don't if I should go to Wayne state or Oakland university. They are the same distance away. I have to pay around a thousand each year to Wayne and that doesn't cover books and parking. Oakland I get back around 2,000 I can pay for my books and parking is free. I am still confused. What if Wayne has a better program? Thank you!",
