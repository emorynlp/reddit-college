  "title:": "Looking for an online university to attend",
  "text": "I've been taking classes at a local community college (mainly online), some of their policies have made being a student with disabilities very difficult for me. When I took in-person classes I had to constantly explain why I was sick and couldn't attend a class because if you missed more than one lecture you'd be dropped from the course without a refund. Disability Support Services at my school was barely able to assist me. I want to persue a four year degree in computer science. I am looking for a 100% online program where I won't feel pressured/overwhelmed and who has a good reputation for working with people who have disabilities. Ideally this would be a BS in Computer Science program.",
