  "text": "I'm a incoming senior and am interested in the field finance. I have a 4.0 GPA and am trying to get 1500+ SAT score. I have played varsity tennis for two years, have done DECA, have done Science league and Math league. I have numerous volunteer hours including at a hospital. I want to manage accounts for a large company, like Chase, preferably in the East coast once I graduate from college. Which colleges would be a good fit for me and that would be in my general range.  I intend on getting a MBA down the line. ",
