  "text": "Hey. I am currently a high school senior and I need help deciding what college option would be the best for me for the price. My parents don't have much money to offer me for college, so the following values are what I would need to take out in loans. I am going for a degree in computer science and my goal in life is to work at a big tech company like Facebook, Apple, Google, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy options are the following :\n\n**OPTION 1 - RPI** (Total Amount : $95,000) :\n\nRRI is ideally the school that I would like to go to. I feel that it would give me the best opportunities coming out of college, and I like the ability to easily dual major in a humanity (I would do Computer Science and Cognitive Science).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPTION 2 - HVCC & RPI** (Total amount : $40,000) :\n\nThis option seems like a good idea, but I'm worried about both my social and networking experience being impacted because of my first two years being at a community college, and then needing to transfer for my final two. If anyone has any experience taking this route I would love to hear your story and thoughts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPTION 3 - RIT** (Total amount - $65,000) :\n\nPersonally I don't know if I would like this option as much as the others. It is the furthest away from home and I'm not sure how the opportunities in and out of college here compare to RPI. I believe that the program is similar in outcomes to the following (Binghamton), while being much more expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPTION 4 - Binghamton** (Total amount - $25,000) :\n\nI've heard that Binghamton doesn't have that great of a notoriety to job recruiters outside the state of New York. This one is also decently far away from home, which isn't a huge deal, just not ideal. Im not entirely sure what kind of opportunities are available in and out of college here. However, this is the cheapest option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone is able to help me come to a decision on where to go for college I would be very grateful. Thank you for your time!",
