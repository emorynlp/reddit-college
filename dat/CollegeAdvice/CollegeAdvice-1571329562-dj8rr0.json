  "text": "\nFreshman year of college i went to a very small school in the middle of the woods/nature/etc, and i am used to living in a large city (i live in the capital city of my state). I lived in a dorm room with 3 other girls i knew from high school. I had an amazing freshman year with them and we made great memories even when we were doing nothing just sitting around, but i felt unsatisfied at such a small school, so i decided to transfer to a school in my hometown that was much larger (it\u2019s actually one of the top five largest colleges in the US). I knew 3-4 people really well that went there from my high school so i assumed i would be fine settling in because i had them. \n\nIt has actually been much harder to transition to this school than I thought, and I feel like i took for granted the small-school friendless where people smile at you and make you feel welcomed. What appeals me to this school is the rigorous academics and stand-out reputation of the school, but what is unappealing is the unwelcoming feeling i get from other students and the elitist vibe i get (everyone seems like they think they\u2019re the shit because they go to such a good school). What is appealing to me about my previous college is the friends and relationships I made there but what is unappealing is the small campus that makes me feel trapped because there\u2019s nothing around it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should transfer back to the small school or not, so reddit, give me your opinions/advice!",
