  "text": "This is my situation; I attend a public university and I have the option of graduating with my bachelor's in communication arts in either December of this year or May of 2019. I haven't had an internship and certainly don't have any job offers. People bash my major all the time and say it's a BS major, while others tell me college isn't about the major and not to to worry, but that's another topic.. I digress. Should I graduate as fast as possible even without a job on the line or having completed an intership or delay my graduation one more semester so I can try to find an internship and a job offer before? I really don't know where this major is going to take me at this given moment.",
