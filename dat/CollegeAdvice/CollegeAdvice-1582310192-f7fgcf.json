  "text": "Hey y'all, \n\nI have scoured the internet to no avail, and I'm very confused about the process of becoming certified. I am currently doing my Bachelor's, I have a total of 76 credits at the moment. I'm hoping to find a laboratory position upon graduation, possibly sooner, but the certification requirements are odd. I'm pretty sure I'm just not comprehending something.\n\nFor example, how can I meet the experience requirements that many certificate programs ask for if I don't have...the certificate...to get the experience? I was hoping to get an MLA as soon as possible, because from my understanding you don't need a BA for that. \n\nIf there are any MLA/MLT's who are familiar with this process please help explain. It would be much appreciated.",
