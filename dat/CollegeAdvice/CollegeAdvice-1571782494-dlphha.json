  "text": "I\u2019m in my last semester of community college. I have a prof who teaches 2 of my classes and refuses to use canvas as it\u2019s \u201cnot apart of her job\u201d and that statement has changed  because the first 14 (1x a class for 2 classes for 7 weeks)  times I asked it was \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do\u201d I got accommodations for a semester long project (last week she finally settled on them it\u2019s due in 2-3 weeks or so). I finally flipped out on her personally (not my best moment) after going to 3 advisors and the program coordinator with no support or success. I told her I would be seeking assistance out from academic affairs at this point because she is refusing assistance to me. Today I got an email revoking my accommodation and to me it screams retaliation. \n\n\nI\u2019m not a bad student I got accepted into our honor society and all that Jazz so I can definitely handle classes but it\u2019s her philosophy that I\u2019m not meshing well with or being successful with.  My professor also will sit and bash the teachers she works with because she doesn\u2019t agree with how they teach (I\u2019m and education major so this is bad) and it makes me seriously question my major which I have never done and I already work in my local public school system and love it. But hearing her bash other teachers makes me seriously question everything.\n\n\nLike I said I\u2019ve been in contact with not only her but multiple advisors and members of academic affairs since the first week of classes. (Lower members of academic affairs my next meeting is with the Vp of academic affairs and the next step is going to the President of my school)\n\nAny advice on what I should do? Any advice what I should say to academic affairs, Because at this point I want them to \n\nA) make her do her job and use canvas correctly\n\nB) transfer me to different classes\n\nC) remove me from the classes and give me a refund for my professors incompetence and my wasted time.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear that. Sadly, professors in the US do not seem to have any training on how to actually be effective teachers. In my experience,too many of them consider themselves researchers first and foremost who have no desire to teach beyound lecturing.  I tried scheduling some one on one time with one professor and she kept refusing until she very bluntly told me that everything I needed to know was in her lectures and if that wasnt enough then maybe I wasn't cut out for college.  \n\nFrom my experience, you really cannot make professors help you beyound what is outlined in the syllabus or if you have some kind of proven disability. \n\nGood luck!",
