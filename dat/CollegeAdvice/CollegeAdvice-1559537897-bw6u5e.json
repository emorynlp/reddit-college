  "text": "Hi, I'm a 3.0 student at a community College. I have an Associates in Applied Arts and Sciences as of 2018. I originally started going to college in high school working towards my goal of being an Ultrasound Tech. I got a B in Anat&P1, and C in A&P2. They told me once I got my degree I'd be more likely to get accepted in the program. Once I got my degree, I was treated like I'd never be accepted and to pick a new field, I was told I'd have to retake A&P for better grades to get in and got extremely discouraged. I chose this program as a fast track way to enter the career field and make decent money and I tried my best to get the grades I have. Now I have a degree and have no idea what to do with it and can't just keep retaking classes. I enjoy going to school but I'm paying for everything myself and don't want to dig myself farther in the hole now with no direction. I'm stuck at a grocery store almost as a journeyman cashier and I hate my job. I know experience would help but I've looked at internships for hours and can't seem to find what I'm looking for. I can't take a medical scribe job or such because it won't pay enough now that I'm 700 hours from journeyman, I hate my job but I need to pay my loans for the school degree I haven't used? I took science classes thinking they weren't for useless degrees? Any ideas? I've talked to college advisors and they suggest there bachelor programs which is an bachelor's in him, or community health. Both seem too specialized and non flexible to me. Any advice would be appreciated.",
