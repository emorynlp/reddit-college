  "text": "Hello!\n\nI am a sophomore studying Nutritional Sciences. I want to become a Physician Assistant later on in life. I'm ahead in credits, so I have a few options:\n\n1) Study abroad in Australia for a semester. (My university has a cool program where we pay in state tuition)\n\n2) Add a Biology minor (Interesting enough, and boosts science GPA)\n\n3) Add a Finance minor (I've always liked stocks and wish I knew more about finances, and later if I realize I don't like working in healthcare this might be good to have).\n\nAny and all advice/input is welcome.",
