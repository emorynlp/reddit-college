  "text": "Context: I am a CS major and really want to minor in Spanish. I am a first year Freshman and currently am looking at a 4.0 first semester. We're getting ready to register for classes (as in tomorrow) and I was looking at the schedule I came up with my adviser. Well... we didn't put Spanish in there. I've been messaging him about it and he basically said it's up to me, but if I sub out one of my gen ed courses I'll be \"down a credit\" (which doesn't make sense because I came in to college with 6 credits from AP).\n\nI am taking Spanish 101 now, and next semester would be 102. Problem is, 102 is considered an elective until you get to the NEXT class which is 200 which starts counting towards the minor. I wasn't sure if I should just take the hit and substitute out say -- theatre for this or if I should just pile it on and take an extra class this semester. One of my classes (political science) is only seven weeks long anyways. I'm in quite a pickle and would love some Reddit advice :)",
