If you are a guy then people will naturally be more guarded so you ll need to show them you are not a creep or a threat.",

I would like to join some clubs or something but I don't think I'll have enough time.. maybe I should focus more on school work and less on socializing until I transfer..\n\nI appreciate the advice, thanks",
