  "title:": "College Choice and ultimate decision- Georgia Tech Waitlist",
  "text": "Okay so I am a highschool senior and I am at a crossroads. I am not exactly sure what to do and could really use any advice on my issue. I live in Georgia and want to get a masters in Aerospace Engineering. So I applied to Georgia Institute of Technology and was waitlisted until after May 1st. I'm little bit disappointed that I wasn't accepted. However, I have also been accepted into University of Georgia and Emory University. I've been waitlisted at Vanderbilt as well.\n\nHere comes the crux of my problem. Emory has a dual degree program with Georgia Tech, so I could receive a bachelor's degree at Georgia tech for Aerospace Engineering and a bachelor's degree at Emory in something that relates to my major at Georgia Tech. However, I don't know what degree at Emory would most compliment my desire to pursue a career in Aerospace Engineering and it would require 5-6 years! Furthermore, I wouldn't be able to receive a masters unless I put another year on top of that. On the other hand, it is a prestigious school and an extra degree from it may provide more job opportunities. \n\nFor University of Georgia, I could initially major in mechanical engineering which I have heard is initially similar to Aerospace Engineering and eventually transfer to Georgia tech to get a bachelors and masters in Aerospace Engineering. However, UGA's engineering program is not as developed as Georgia Tech and I am unsure that I would even be able to transfer to Georgia Tech as it has become increasingly competitive.\n\nI was also waitlisted at Vanderbilt University. It would be expensive to go to an out-of-state private school and I worry that it will cost too much. Furthermore, it's pretty far away from home. But, it is a really good university that I could definitely get a masters in Aerospace Engineering at.\n\nTo make matters worse, the deadline to commit at UGA and Emory is may 1st, but I only learn if I am accepted to Georgia Tech and Vanderbilt after May 1st! This means that I have to pay for Emory or UGA as a backup just in case I don't get accepted to Georgia Tech. Emory requires a $475 deposit and UGA requires a $300 deposit. So even if I get into Georgia Tech or Vanderbilt, I will have to forfeit the deposit fee!\n\nANY Advice would be extremely helpful! I'm so stressed out and ultimately have no idea what I should do! The deadline for me to decide is around April 25 and I need to come up with a plan. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!",
