  "title:": "NYU Stern vs. Canadian Schools for future MBA",
  "text": "I recently received all of my college decisions and was hoping for some input.\n\nI was admitted to the following programs:\n\n\\-NYU Stern Undergrad\n\n\\-Rotman Commerce (U of T)\n\n\\-Desautels Faculty of Management (McGill)\n\n\\-D'Amore-McKim School of Business (Northeastern)\n\nIn my opinion, Stern is easily the most prestigious school I was admitted to. Unfortunately, it comes with a $72k price tag, and with only $15k in financial aid, I'd be looking to pay around \\~$57k annually to attend. \n\nI am a dual citizen, and I could, therefore, attend either U of T or McGill for about \\~$12k CAD annually. \n\nThe Canadian schools are clearly the cheaper option, but I was curious if anyone had any insight as to whether these choices would limit my options for MBA programs. I am especially interested in investment banking, and I know a prestigious MBA placement could help immensely with a high ranking job placement.\n\nIf anyone has any insight whatsoever it would be greatly appreciated.",
