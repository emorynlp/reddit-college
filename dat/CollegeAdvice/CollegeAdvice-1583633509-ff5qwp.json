  "text": "Hello! \n\nI'm currently a senior in HS who got accepted into UMASS Amherst, and UCONN. For both, I have to pay around 30k (UCONN is about 2-3k more expensive than UMASS). UCONN has better research facilities and the community is more active, but the student body is more competitive academically, and its in the middle of nowhere so idk how ill get my shadowing hours. UMASS is cheaper and they are slightly less academically competitive. Which one should I choose? Will either of them heavily impact my chances of getting into medschool?\n\nI have been stressing over this for quite some time bc I dont want to see myself in huge amounts of debt when I get accepted into medschool (If i do get accepted)\n\nMany Thanks!",

      "text": "Congratulations on your acceptances! Either school looks just as good to a med school admissions committee. It matters much more how well you perform than where you go. As far as shadowing goes, UMASS might be a little easier, unless you're interested in rural health. If everything else breaks down to equal, go for the cheaper option.",
