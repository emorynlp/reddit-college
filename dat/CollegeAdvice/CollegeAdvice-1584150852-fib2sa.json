I work as a college advisor and in the state of the current situation I would not be surprised if deadlines are extended to accommodate all students . Colleges understand what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m sure will be accommodating for students that were affected. So don\u2019t worry too much right now, it will be okay",

I really doubt that they will make you pay for it since it\u2019s your school that did so. Remember that things are constantly changing and they might not be able to update as fast as info comes out. I doubt you\u2019ll have to pay but you definitely need to contact them ASAP (they are only open Monday-Friday so make sure to call Monday morning.",
