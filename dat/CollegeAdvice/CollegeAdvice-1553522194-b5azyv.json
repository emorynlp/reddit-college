  "text": "So I need advice for applying to a college after an 11 year span. \n\nI went to a community college after I graduated high school, but I only went for a quarter, and I was young and stupid, and I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do, so I didn\u2019t apply myself. So I ended up on academic probation. I\u2019m really worried this will affect my college applications now.  I\u2019m more mature and driven now, and I know what career path I want to go down,  but I\u2019m not really sure how to proceed, especially since I have bills I have to pay now and most of the colleges that have the program I want are 1+ hours away (I want to be a paleontologist, but I\u2019m going to get a start in geology, so it\u2019ll be a lot of classes I have to take physically I\u2019m sure). I enrolled in FSA, but I need to get a college figured out and accepted before I can proceed further. \n\nShould I continue with my plan of saving up to move, and finding a job closer to school?  Should I try and get some online courses and get some of my other credits knocked out before relocating?  What about the GPA I need for my application?  I\u2019m just not really sure what to do. \n\nI really want to go to school and work hard, and really apply myself. I\u2019m so sick of working these terrible retail jobs and feeling worthless and unstimulated. I want to be able to do what I love and get into a field I find interesting. \n",

      "text": "I went back to school after a 10 year gap. Same situation almost. Went to a college after high school, didn't know what I was doing, didn't apply myself then academic probation. I applied for readmission to the school I had originally went to though so I was able to retake some of those classes for a better GPA.  What I would recommend is retake classes first then relocate, especially since community college class tend to be cheaper.\n\nIf you're worried about your GPA hurting you: go to the community college and retake the classes that tanked your GPA in the first place, the new grade usually replaces the old one when calculating your GPA. As for what GPA you'd need for the application that'll really depend on the admission office of whatever school you're looking at, some don't care as much as others.\n\nAs a someone working a 9-5 and going to school at the same time, online classes are a savior (scheduling wise). Traditional university programs aren't really geared toward the working student. So if you can take those do it, but make sure you're good as self management when it comes to due dates and stuff.\n\nOne last time, I know you didn't technically as but if you were on probation like I was you may have been on financial aid probation as well. Mine was for the \"completion rate\" for dropping/no passing my classes. So be on the look out for financial aid issues. I had to fill out an appeal every year with the school in order to get financial aid until I got that completion rate back up.\n\nIn the meantime, continue saving for when you need to relocate and get a new job closer to school. This will give you some extra money/time to look for a new job and if you don't need the extra time then you'll have extra for textbooks and trust me, that's a bitch to pay for.",

              "text": "If you don't use financial aid it doesn't really change much, it's just how you pay for classes and stuff. Most colleges/universities seem to keep finances and grades fairly separately unless it's about them getting their money. (Messed up, I know). I don't think it'll affect their decision of whether or not to accept you.\n\nI would recommend using financial aid though, even if you don't take the federal loans there's still a little bit of federal grants that'll help. You can choose to accept only parts of whatever aid is offered to you. I know the appeal sounds bad but it's usually just a form and an advisor sign off sheet (at least for me it was).",
