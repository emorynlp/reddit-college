  "text": "Hey guys, I just have some questions about rejoining college. I got into one college and got dropped out from poor performance. It was mostly from depression. I still want to continue education though. School and learning wasn't bad, but I just wasn't mature and strong enough and handle myself whenever I broke down. I'm planning to join the community college near by and apply back to the 4 year university. However, my question is, I want to major in Engineering or computer science, but I can't major that if I'm trying to go back to my college because of my GPA. I was majoring economics in university. I am planning to take engineering or computer science courses in community college and apply to different school. But the problem is my GPA back in the university I was going to is really bad. So I'm wondering if there is any chance if I can make that up in community college and apply to different schools. Can anybody give me advice on this? I had about 4 semesters in university and GPA is um... it's painful to say but it's near 1.3 ish haha...",
