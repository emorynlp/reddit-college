  "text": "Hi there! So as college admissions come out, I\u2019m a bit conflicted about where I should attend. I got into UCLA, U of R, and UW. UCLA is obviously the most prestigious one out of the three, but I\u2019m also planning on a pre med route, and I\u2019ve heard that UCLA is really really tough for pre meds. However I also like the idea of majoring in English, and UCLA has the best English program out of the three. Both UofR and UW offered me scholarships as well and UCLA hasn\u2019t. Any insight?",

      "text": "Hi there ~ as a UW pre-med, I\u2019ll tell you flat-out that it\u2019s not the best school for applying to medical school. Too goddamn hard to do well in classes because of intense curving and weedouts. Keep in mind that if you\u2019re going the medicine route, the prestige of your undergraduate school isn\u2019t a huge factor - it\u2019s your scores, your experiences, and what kind of person you aspire to be that matter. I don\u2019t have much info on UCLA or u of r, though I did turn down UCLA myself when deciding schools because of cost. UW and UCLA are the same academically, so keep in mind other things like weather and location. Congratulations and good luck :)",
