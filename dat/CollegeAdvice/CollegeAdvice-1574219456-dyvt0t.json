  "text": "I'm a current CCC student, applying for transfer this year.   \nI was just wondering for those of you who are currently majoring in, what has your experience been like, and what I could expect in History/Poli Sci/Classics comparatively. (Especially in the way of writing requirements, research opportunities, etc) I would love any insight that might help me get a better frame of reference prior to selecting my major for transfer. Thanks!",
