I want the college experience, but I also don\u2019t want to swimming in a large pool of student debt. Any advice? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "The best thing to do is plan. Take a look at your local community colleges, and see if they have agreements with the nereby universities. If they do not, see what classes transfer from the community college to the university. Depending on the university, they will not transfer all of the credits, so that means you have to be there longer. This is usually the case unless an agreement is setup between the two schools. \n\nKeep in mind as well, that most universities, you don't major in anything right away until you have met certain requirements (usually credits and other stuff), so your first year or so will be gen eds with possibly a low level major class here and there. If you can bang out a lot of the gen eds at community college, I wouldn't see why not. Just ensure the community college you go to is accredited. If it is accredited, all of your gen eds will transfer to any state school. \n\nCongratulations and study hard!!!",
