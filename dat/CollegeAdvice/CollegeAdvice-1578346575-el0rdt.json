The new semester started and I know I need to commit to getting better grades and studying for the SAT. What do I do to ensure that I could attend either of these schools?",

      "text": "I\u2019m a senior graduating next may, and I\u2019ve already got into the school I\u2019ve wanted and committed so I hope I can give a little bit of advice. Build up a good record with activities and such like NJHS, volunteering, sports, other extracurriculars. An 1140 isn\u2019t bad thats literally what I got and it got me into every school I wanted. I would use the SATs official study book I think it\u2019s maybe around 50 bucks. I had a 4.18 GPA sophomore year and then took college classes at a community college and it brought my GPA down slightly. They will look at your classes so as long as you are taking challenging courses I think that\u2019s more important than a GPA.",
