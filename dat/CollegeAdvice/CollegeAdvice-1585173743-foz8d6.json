  "text": "So for college I would love to move away from home and experience things on my since I have some pretty strict parents so I really never had any freedom. However, I\u2019m just scared of the debt. If I stay home and go to school then I will be debt free. If I move away I will have to take out loans only for housing. Should I take the risk and step out of my comfort zone or would it be dumb of me not to choose the option that keeps me out of debt?",

      "text": "Sophomore here and I think you develop a ton when you\u2019re on your own. One option for you is that you could stay in your home for two years because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be going to community college if you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll graduate debt free. After the two years you could go away and still have debt but less debt. Your decision could also depend on financial aid offered to you.",
