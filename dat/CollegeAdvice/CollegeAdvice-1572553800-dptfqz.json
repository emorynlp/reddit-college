  "text": "I'm in highschool, and want advice choosing what I should do in college.\n\nMath comes easily to me.\nI'm an introvert.\n-\nI tried computer science, but I didn't care for it partly because my problem solving skills are slightly below average.\n\nAlso my memory for memorizing names of things is slightly below average.\n-\nI can go to college to get my masters, and I want a job that has a median salary over 65k.\n\nI'm fine with a job that is a bit repetitive.\n-\nThanks a lot for any replies!",
