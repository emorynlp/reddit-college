      "text": "1)Wow, I'm so sorry you had your bag stolen and are dealing with this blowback. 2)I would first see if this is legitimate.  \nDebt collectors are trained to be as intimidating and ruthless as possible - it's unlikely that they're actually going to report you as a first resort, that's an involved process and is probably just their go-to scare tactic. You also would have needed to have received some notice by the college that they referred your debt to a debt collector. See if you can verify that claim with the school, and then see what timeframe you have to pay  it back.  \nIt's unlikely that you'll get any financial aid disbursements before school starts, normally they aren't released more than a week or so before instruction, and the funds are first applied to tuition and fees, anything left is then deposited into your bank account.  It's possible that your school would let you wait until you get financial aid to pay it off if you explain the situation and show them proof of what your eventual disbursement  will be.  \n\n\nIf all else fails, do you have a credit card? You can almost DEFINITELY pay a debt collector with a credit card, they don't care how you pay them back. Lots of financial institutions have great introductory rates for college checking accounts and most associated credit cards have zero interest for the first 12-18months. Even starting out, you'll probably have a credit limit that is more than $300. I know credit cards can seem a little scary, but if you pay off your balance, you won't have to pay any interest rates. As long as you're fiscally responsible with how you use it, you're not going to get sucked into the credit card debt nightmares people talk about. This would just give you some breathing room to pay off the textbook debt before your school's financial aid kicks in.  \n\n\nBest of luck, I'm rooting for you!  I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this stressful situation!",
