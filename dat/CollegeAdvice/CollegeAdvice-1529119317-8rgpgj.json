  "text": "I am currently a college student in the Cayman Islands looking to apply to schools as an international transfer student. I have a 3.64 GPA with 2 semesters remaining. My GPA is this low because I got a C in one of my courses in my first semester. My transcript contains mostly A's and B's and I am still trying to improve my GPA with the remaining time I have. I am currently researching schools I could apply to for Fall 2019. I want a school with affordable tuition without having to sacrifice quality education. I am kind of lost as to what I should be looking for and so on. I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice anyone could offer. I would greatly appreciate it. I need all the help I can get.
