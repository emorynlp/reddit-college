  "text": "I am a sophmore at my college in Robotics/ Mechatronics Engineering I mostly picked the major because of my parents.  I have been struggling with this major as whenever im in my major class i feel like im the stupidest person in the room. I\u2019ve joined a fraternity and looked at what my advisor chose for classes and the classes i have left for my major and i am terrified.  These classes will eat up almost all of my time on campus workload wise and i was never that great at math so i was wondering what u guys thought my friend recommended me IT as hes in that idk thats sounds interesting let me know",

      "text": "I'll suggest you change the major, especially if you're struggling with it and don't seem to be that interested in it. I personally think computer science  or software engineering because these are great majors to get as it's very employable, has a high starting salary, and it's something that you might actually enjoy.",
