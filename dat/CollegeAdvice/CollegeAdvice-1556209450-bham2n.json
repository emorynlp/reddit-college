  "text": "  Hello everyone. I'm a 27 year old male considering returning to school in some capacity to pursue a new career (maybe accounting). I've been working for years and feel like I'm at a dead end and feel that this would be the best way for a fresh start. \n\n  My question is how do you refresh yourself in the subjects that you already took without just retaking the courses, which send effective but a huge waste of money for credit in classes I already have and passed?\n\n  Thanks in advanced!",

      "text": "After taking a year long break from school, I found that YouTube has several great resources for reviewing subjects when I decided to return.  Most notably, I use channels such as 3blue1brown and MIT's OpenCourseWear for mathematics, CrashCourse, SciShow, Kurzgesagt, and others for quick reminders on some science topics, and I'm sure there are plenty of similar channels for finance and accounting that can be found.  With a quick search you'd probably be able find plenty of videos on any subject you want. The best part is this is free, but the trade off is that the videos aren't necessarily comprehensive or in depth.\n\nHope this helps.",
