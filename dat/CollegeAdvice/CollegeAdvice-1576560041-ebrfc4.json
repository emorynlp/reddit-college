  "text": "Hello I\u2019m 18 and I roomed with my best friend from high school for my first semester of college and it was miserable.  Painful really she never had much freedom and we had always partied together in high school but when we roomed together it was at a different extreme with her being careless and putting me in dangerous situations. She brought a guy in our shared room during the night and I woke up to them doing stuff and truth is it was very disgusting and there were many other deep seeded issues that just kept piling up and I couldn\u2019t handle it so I switched rooms and told her we couldn\u2019t room together anymore for the sake of our friendship. Didn\u2019t take it too well. But since my first semester was so traumatic and I didn\u2019t rlly bond with other students since I tried so hard to making it work with my best friend from high school and my other roommates, I\u2019m worried about next semester. I\u2019m starting off new and fresh but realized I have serious trust issues and feel thoroughly disappointed in my radar for finding good people. How do I find good friends? How can I overall just be happy in college? Might join a sorority if they let me rush during spring and join some clubs but yeah. It\u2019s a lot I\u2019m scared and college wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be. It feels awful.",

      "text": "I had a very similar experience my freshman year (now a senior). I just want to say that I hear you, and I'm sorry you had to go through something so awful. But I can also say that you can get through this. I think in this situation, it's really important to both try to get out of your comfort zone and talk to new people, while maintaining a safe space for yourself in your room/wherever you are staying for next semester, that you can come back to at the end of the day. Make a list of the things that you find comforting and want in your space, and build that desired space for yourself. That way, it can serve as home base for you while you start to reach out and make new friends.\n\nFor socializing, I recommend joining some clubs or student organizations on campus based on your interests and meeting people there. Check if your school has an online list of groups that you can look into, or even an activities fair. My university does one in the fall as well as the spring, so there might be one you could go to. Pick 5 or so and go to the initial meetings in January. It may feel kind of awkward at first, but stick with it. Try to go to the first two or three meetings, and if it still isn't working out, then I say try a different group.\n\nTo answer your question about finding good friends, I think that it's a matter of just continuing to talk to people until you click with someone. This process can definitely take some time. However, I think that it's also important to take time for your own self-care and be a friend to yourself. You took the first steps by recognizing that you were in a not-so-great situation and getting yourself out of it, which is great. I think that happiness comes in moments, and that it really isn't an overall state of being for anybody, which is ok. College can be a rough time, which I think isn't something that really gets mentioned often. But those moments of happiness can come when you're doing things you enjoy, whether with others or by yourself. \n\nAnother idea -- while you're working on meeting new people, if you need someone to talk to face-to-face or over the phone, it might be worth checking out your school's counseling center or a warmline (which is a free phone network through which you can talk with a trained person who can advise you on things you're concerned about - Google \"warmline\" and your city/region for the right phone number). These can be great resources to give you some extra support while you process everything that happened with your roommate, and you might be able to get some good tips there too. I know it helped me a lot!\n\nJust keep moving forward and trying new things. You're doing great! Also, I'm here if you have more specific questions about college life in general. :)",

          "text": "Thank you so much. I will for sure take ur advice on listing what I want as a safe space and well everything else . It means a lot to me that you said such amazing things it\u2019s been so hard. And yes I will join clubs and try and reach out to the counseling center.thank you so much really this is exactly what I needed to hear it means the world, and I will reach out if I have specific questions!",
