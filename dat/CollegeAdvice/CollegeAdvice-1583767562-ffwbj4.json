I'm a little confused on which one I should pick. Any help or feedback on which one I should do would be great!\n\nTheories discussed so far:\n\n1. Social Bond Theory\n2. Low Self-Control Theory\n3. Rational Choice Theory\n4. General Strain Theory\n5. Social Learning Theory\n6. Social Disorganization Theory\n7. Life Course Theory\n8. Labeling Theory",
