It's what I've wanted to go into for a long time.... but now here I am in my second semester of college failing both Calc 2 and Data Structures, and not for a lack of caring.\n\nAt this point though I'm thinking I might be needing a different major, but I honestly just don't know what to do.\n\nAny ideas?",

And even when they are available it's rather likely there would rarely be tutors on hand for such classes.\n\nAs for my classmates, I'm not on friendly terms with any of my classmates in Calc 2 and while I have befriended most of my classmates in Data Structures, due to the pandemic it's hard to keep any form of useful contact outside of class time.",
