  "title:": "How can I change my major behind my mom\u2019s back?",
  "text": "Here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m currently doing a dual degree program in Biology and Psychological Science. I wanna drop the Biology program because A) I\u2019m bored with it and B) the math requirements would be much easier if I only did Psych Science. Trouble is, I have a strict mom who has a fiery grudge against anything remotely related to the Humanities, has threatened to make me go to a community college and derail what little of an academic career I\u2019ve developed if I change my major to something she doesn\u2019t like, and is both my sole monetary provider and the sole arbiter of a small trust fund I got when one of my grandparents died. How can I be sneaky about this?",

But you have three options A) Let her determine your academic endeavors, B) Find a way to help her see your point of view, or C) Take on debt and pay for the education YOU want. I hope option B works for you! I am sorry that you are in this situation.",

      "text": "Academic advisor here; Have you allowed her to have parental access to your academic information? If not you could change your major without her knowing that you did so. Some colleges allow you to change the access type that parents have to your records such as only being able to see financial information. Otherwise you may just need to have an open and honest conversation (should probably do this regardless) and explain how Psych is still related to the heavier sciences. That's a tough situation, you may also want to get to the root of why she is so against this major. ",

I realize that is tricky with financial options but have you considered scholarships or loans if for some reason she withholds financials? You also could have a discussion about how you need more personal space now that you are in college and a fully functioning adult and that while you appreciate her caring and support, the level at which she is support you is crowding within your own personal decisions.
