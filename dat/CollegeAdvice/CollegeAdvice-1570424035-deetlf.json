  "text": "So I\u2019m in my first of year of college and I took random classes that meets my first year requirements because I still don\u2019t know what to major in. One of them is political science 102 and I hate the class. The lectures are so confusing(not to others apparently), the midterm I thought I did good in which turned out I got 56/80 and on the essay I got 81 and now I have a C. I love American political science and it\u2019s interesting but it\u2019s soooo hard to understand. Any advice on note taking and studying strategies for this clas? Help a sis pleaseee!",
