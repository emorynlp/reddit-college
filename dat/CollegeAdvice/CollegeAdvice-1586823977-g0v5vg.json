If you are asked by your new university about the incident, BE HONEST, do NOT lie to them or they would have every right to take back their offer.  Otherwise, don't mention it to anyone.  Use this as an opportunity to have a new start, the right way.",

I don\u2019t plan on lying and will be truthful if asked, but should I notify them that I had an honor code violation? Since I have to submit my final grades anyways I assume they will see it.",
