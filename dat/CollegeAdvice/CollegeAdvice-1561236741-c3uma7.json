  "text": "I currently have worked in hospitality for over 6 years and now at the age of 23 I have decided it would be beneficial to get a degree, specifically in hospitality management. I would like to be a food and beverage director with the goal of being in consulting one day, preferably in luxury hospitality. I am currently the event coordinator for a small cafe in Portland and things don't seem to be going anywhere and I can't seem to grow in my industry. \n\nI would like to obtain a bachelors in Germany but I dont really know where to begin. I will need to take out a loan for living expenses and school fees if I want to start this year. I also have some personal debt that I am currently trying to work down.\n\nBasically any advice on this path that I am considering would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "What is pulling you to a German program? And is it a specific one or any one in Germany? \n\nJust wondering bc I know it\u2019s common for Americans to glorify the price of European colleges but with the cost of living in a lot of Europe and (assuming you don\u2019t have an EU citizenship) it\u2019s not necessarily aggressively affordable like you may have heard.",

          "text": "Any program in Germany. I am also considering other countries and correct I do not have an EU citizenship. However I have lived in various countries in Europe for short periods of time. It is costly, but not as much as San Francisco where I currently live so it is sustainable. \nThe draw is partially cost and partially putting myself somewhere I am willing to stay for four years. I have lived in a number of popular areas in the us the past five years, supporting myself, I just don't seem to find any of them appealing enough to stick for the Long haul of a Bachelors. I enjoyed living in Europe so that is the larger draw of studying abroad.",
