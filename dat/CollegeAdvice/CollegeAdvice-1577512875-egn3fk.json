  "text": "I\u2019ve been set on getting my bachelors in nursing for the last few years. That\u2019s still the plan, but I\u2019m very interested in running a business. I love reselling. I dumpster dive, dropship, sell graphic t\u2019s, make political bumper stickers, etc and I love it. I\u2019m only 16 so it\u2019s more of a hobby, but it can generate a lot of money at a bigger scale. I understand that you don\u2019t need a degree to run a business, but are there degrees that give me an ample amount of job security in the business field?",
