  "text": "I've been accepted to a college that's nine hours away and paid my orientation fee, found a roommate and selected a room, and that's all I've done. I decided today I no longer want to go there because I have reasons to believe I won't succeed. I was going to go to a college closer to home I can commute to and I've already been accepted to, and it would be free because my mother is a professor there. How do I go about telling my parents I no longer wish to attend the out-of-state school, and how do I go about contacting the school I no longer want to attend? Any help is appreciated!",
