  "text": "I'm currently a high school senior,18 f, and planning to go to college in the fall of 2020. The school I'm going to is five and a half to six hours away from my home so it's not like I can run home easily and grab something if I need it. What are the main things I should plan to bring with me when I move in to make the process easier and help me feel less stressed. Any advice is helpful, thanks!",

Some stuff I have now+will get later include:\n\nTowels\nBed set (usually Twin XL)\nBath caddy (ones with multiple pockets) \nFoldable laundry basket with lid\nReading pillow (just cuz) \n\nDefinitely bring pictures of your family at home, cuz you'll miss them. Bring any other important documents that you think you'll need. \n\nTheres a ton more, but those are some I could come ip with. There's a ton of sites online that say way more stuff!!
