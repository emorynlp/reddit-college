  "text": "I am going into my second year of college this Fall semester. My first year I got the Pell Grant but this year I couldn't get it due to not applying soon enough, I think. I am terrified to take out loans and don't have a ton of motivation to finish college anyway. Should I maybe just skip a semester/year to try and figure myself out? I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious about it. I'm kind of at a loss for what to do.",
