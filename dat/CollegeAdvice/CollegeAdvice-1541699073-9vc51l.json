  "text": "This entire semester I have been doing poorly on my exams. I feel like a prepare adequately but I always fall flat once I actually take them. What really makes me mad is that other people in my class that don't prepare or pay attention always outscore me. I've always had testing anxiety and I feel like that could be a part of why I am doing poor despite thoroughly preparing. Any ideas of something I can do differently to get better results would be greatly appreciated. ",

You could also consider going to the dean for further guidance, not to complain, but for assistance. One other thought, approach the student that loves to answer questions in class & ask how they prepare for tests & homework. (Compliment the student & their answers then ask for their method of study.) ",

Mix that in with \"funny worded\" questions, whether the information on the test is what I retained, and suddenly I'm guessing on the answer. \n\nIt might not be your study method but your natural ability in conjunction with luck of the test bank. \n\nJust my two cents.",
