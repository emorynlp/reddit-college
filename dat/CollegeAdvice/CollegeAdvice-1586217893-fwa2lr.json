My end goal is to go to MD after 4 years.**  \n\n\n**1. Cost - I got a 50% scholarship and remaining will be paid by my parents. I\u2019m mostly worried about other areas than the cost for now,**  \n**2. GPA - Which is the best university for scoring better grades. Grade inflation vs deflation?**  \n**3. Since MD admission is also required student involvement in Research, Clinical Shadowing, hospital volunteering, which one will be best for this?**  \n**4. Which college is sending more students to medical college? I see in ADCOMS data that both are sending around 330 students YoY but I am not sure what is the total avg. a number of people from these universities apply.**  \n**5). Professors - Which one can really add value and prepare the student to handle MCAT and easy to approach with.**  \n\n\n**I really appreciate your comments since that will help me to choose the right one to accomplish my dream of becoming a physician.**",
