  "text": "I live in Australia and I am extremely passionate about american football, and its my goal to play college and even play in the NFL but I am struggling to find information on international students and american football. I am 100% serious about this as a pathway in my life and I really do believe you can do anything you want in life with enough determination. I am 16 years old and still have my final 2 years of high school to complete before I am at the stage of applying for college, but I would like to know my pathway and have a strong plan for the coming years. if anyone would be willing to help me out a bit or point me in the right direction I would be extremely grateful.",

There are lots of Americans who don\u2019t even make it to the college level, let alone the NFL. Just play your best and use film to try and impress some people.",
