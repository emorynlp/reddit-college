  "text": "I\u2019m planning to hit all of my professor\u2019s office hours and plead for some way not to fail, in the form of extra work or something. I cannot imagine a scenario where I do not fail most if not all of my classes this semester. I have a few credits extra, is it possible that I could void this semester from my transcript?",

Most colleges will grant exception to enrollments in certain cases like medical issues, mental health etc. But they usually require fully documented and supported circumstances.",
