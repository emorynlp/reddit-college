  "title:": "Feeling like I'm in the ocean without a compass",
  "text": "I am currently finishing up my first semester of my junior year, and I'm still undeclared not by choice but because I completely fucked up freshman year and had a horrible advisor. I've been really questioning life and my direction, and i feel like I'm on a ship in the middle of the ocean with no map or compass. \n\nI am currently registered as an undeclared seeking journalism, the only reason I chose journalism was because writing has always been one of my strong suits and I enjoy it. But lately I've been doubting my own abilities and my confidence with that. So far I have hated college more than I did high school, I need some advice on what to do or if I should even pursue journalism still.\n\nI love strategy especially in video games and I have always been really good at coming up with good tactics, I love problem solving and puzzles. I've conquered every escape room in my home town and I loved them, i am an archer and an active gamer. I just feel unmotivated and like I don't have a purpose or an end goal to work towards, which ends up disheartening me from going to my classes. \n\nAny help is appreciated.",
