  "text": "I feel like the title is a little confusing, but here's the gist of my personal struggle:\n\nI really love fashion and I want to work in the industry but more on the corporate side, specifically regarding supply chain and sustainability. The fashion industry is extremely wasteful and I want to help make a company or companies more eco-conscious and reduce their waste output. Right now, I am at a school that has no fashion related majors, just an exchange-ish program with the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC for one year where I would get an associates degree in Fashion Business Management. I'm currently a retail management major, and I'm in the process of picking up another major in supply chain. However, I'm debating whether or not I should transfer to a school with a more fashion focused curriculum and reputation. My current school has little to no fashion connections in regards to career fairs or internship opportunities, and I wonder if transferring would give me the opportunity to get more experience in the industry.\n\nMy biggest issue is that I know that the fashion industry is competitive, but I don't know what weighs more: experience or education. I'm located in the Midwest and I'm looking at Mizzou because they have a textile and apparel management/supply chain related major and I feel like a lot of the big fashion schools like FIT don't have supply chain-focused areas of study. Right now, adding another major will make me take 5 years to finish regardless, so time to graduate isn't that much of a concern for me so long as it doesn't take me like 7 years\n\nWhat do you think I should do: graduate from a general STEM/business college with 3 degrees (2 bachelors, 1 associates) and hope to get into the fashion industry with 3 or less internships or transfer to a fashion-focused program at a different school and get one degree but potentially more internship experience?",
