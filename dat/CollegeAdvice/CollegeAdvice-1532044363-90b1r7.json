  "text": "Hi! Okay, so I made the choice to attend community college for my freshman year of college. In high school I had severe medical issues that caused me to miss over a quarter of each school year. These caused my grades to drop drastically every single year from where they were when I was healthy. Although I was accepted into schools that I really loved, I did not receive any financial aid from them so that meant they were out of the cards for me. Within the past year my medical problems have improved dramatically, and I\u2019ve been able to attend college with regularity. So after a semester at community college, I have earned a 4.0 gpa. I was planning to transfer into a 4-year college after my two years at this college, but because of this I\u2019m thinking if I keep my grades up for the second semester I might apply to transfer for my sophomore year. However, I\u2019m unsure if the amount of school work that I will be applying with will be sufficient in outweighing my grades from high school. My high school gpa was a 2.7UW and 3.2W, and although I took nothing but AP and Honors courses I know that my gpa and transcript are nowhere near impressive. I also know that by the time my application goes to the schools, the only grades they will have seen are the ones for the first semester. So with that all being said my question is: would it be a bad idea to apply to transfer after only one year?\n\nFor those who are curious/care to know: My medical issues were 2 concussions within my junior and senior years, hemiplegic migraines (basically migraines that cause stroke symptoms), as well as anxiety and depression. \n\nAND IM SORRY FOR WRITING SO MUCH, SO IN SUMMARY:\nHigh School GPA of 2.7UW/3.2W (+med issues)\nCollege GPA of 4.0 after one semester\nLooking to transfer colleges, unsure of whether to do so after one or two years of improved grades. \nSample of colleges looking to apply to: BU, NYU, Tufts, Williams\n\nThank you so much for reading:)\n",
