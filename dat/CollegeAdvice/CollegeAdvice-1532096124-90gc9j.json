  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am currently a 21 year old undergrad student looking for some advice on my major, career path, and generally life. I've just wrapped up junior year, my first internship, and with senior year coming up have been giving a lot of thought to my life within the workforce. Came into college as an Economics major, mostly because this was what my dad studied and had always been told I should study due to general application. I later switched to Construction Management major, because a few friends were switching and speaking to me about it, I was scared economics was not technical enough, and my school has a very good program. In addition, I had always been interested by architecture and civil engineering, the process of creating buildings, and having a tangible reward for my work. I just completed my first internship with a general contractor (mid sized, new/4-years old, $140 mill of work) and was disappointed. Most of the work for PM's and APM's seems to be very unfulfilling and the environment is not one I see myself part of. In class alot of what they talked about interested me but in the field when i speak with my peers a lot of the technical jargon bores me. I also do not feel satisfied with my college experience having earned such a niche major and a more versatile, mind broadening one. Due to this I wanted to reevaluate and find myself with some options:\n\n1. I could continue with my CM Degree and keep following the Project Management track I am on. I feel that working for a larger company in a metropolitan area might offer a different experience but I am not sure yet. I am also scared that if I follow this track and do not like it, there is no career/industry flexibility with my major besides taking on other construction roles such as Estimator, Superintendent, etc. Another fear is the possibility of losing my job if the market crashes due to tariffs and labor shortages. Reasons I feel disillusioned after my first job are long hours for PM and APM, not finding the salary worth the work, finding the projects uninteresting. The VDC side of it has interested me also but I don't know if the salary is worth it.\n2. Finish with my CM degree but pursue a Master's. Possible programs I have thought of are International Business, Information Systems, Real Estate, or a basic MBA. The typical length for all of these would be 1 year (1 1/2 for IS) at my school. I have been leaning towards the MSRE route since during my internship the owner meetings and relations peaked my interest and I know I could follow a development path but was wondering what that career path would be like. I also have a Real Estate minor. The MBA, MIB, and MSISOM would be if I wanted to go into a different industry.\n3. Switch my major and stay an extra semester to graduate. It would have to be one with business oriented due to excess hours. I wanted to switch back to Econ and try to double major with Poli Sci or Psych but my school doesn't let me. IDK what other major I would choose but besides those mentioned Information Systems, Business Admin, Finance, and Digital Arts and Sciences interested me. If I could start college again I would either do the Econ and Psych or Industrial Engineering.\n\nAny help or thoughts are appreciated, no matter how small. I'm having this small existential crisis because I don't wanna live my life doing something I hate. Would prefer an industry that has above 6 figure pay, in metropolitan area preferably NYC, allows me to work with both genders and in a youthful environment, is social, includes some travel and is not boring work. My interests include: psychology/mental health, fitness, art, media, film, English, law, business analysis, urbanization, music",
