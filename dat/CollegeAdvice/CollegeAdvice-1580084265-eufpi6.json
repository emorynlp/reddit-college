  "text": "I am a senior in high school and have recently committed to a college. I am the type of person that is always \u201cgoing\u201d and I want to make the most of my college years. I have considered a few ways to do this, but am unsure of how realistic they will be. These are my two main \u201cplans\u201d:\n\n1) really load up on my courses and graduate a year early. Get a head start on my medical journey\n\n2) become a nurse assistant prior to my freshmen year of college and work whilst in school to acquire some experience and save up some money \n\nAre they unrealistic? Which one is more doable ? \n\nI am just trying to proactively explore my options before making a decision I will regret so please no judgement comments lol",

      "text": "Most colleges have it set to where you need certain prerequisites before you can advance to the next level. You can see about getting the prereqs waived but prepare to be at a disadvantage. I would talk to your academic advisor and map out your classes to find the best route forward towards doing this. \n\nIt also all depends on what you want to do too. If you work and take classes, you will have way less time to study. How much does GPA matter to you? Do you necessarily need to work or could you benefit from volunteering/engaging in clubs instead? On the flip side, you have to start taking over 18 credits a semester to finish early, and most colleges will make you sign a waiver for this. Do you think you can handle this? Are your beginning classes easy or are they hard?\n\nMy advice would be to find out whether or not option 1 or 2 are even feasible and go from there. With option 1 you have to prepare to have no social life for a while and will doing a lot of studying. With option 2 you wont have as much time to study, but you will have walking around money. \n\nHope this helps! Congratulations and good luck!!!",

      "text": "Great plan. But I think you're vastly overestimating how much spare time you'll have. You can stack your classes. To be either mon-weds-friday. Work the other 4 days  or 3 and have one off day. Or tues-thurs and work and study the rest of the time. But graduating a year early will probably have you taking summer courses too for the entire time you are in college.\n\nI work around 50-60 hours a week while I'm in school and can only take 9 credit hours due to time constraints.",
