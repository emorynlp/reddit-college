  "title:": "I am a very organized person, but I do not have OCD/OCPD. I am especially organized when it comes to math so tend to work slow. This is cool and all when Im doing my hw, but really bad for tests where I have to work quickly. What can I do about this?",
  "text": "I am a college student currently in Calc 2? When I do my HW, everything is very neat, organized and easily readable. When I take tests, they are always timed and I do not have the time to neatly do my work, causing my scores to be negatively impacted. If I try to rush, I tend to make more mistakes and end up doing even worse on my exams?\n\nCould the Disability Resource Center help me with this (Im guessing not because It is not diagnosable). Is there something different that I can do to help me speed up my work? Any other Ideas?",

      "text": "I'm not sure how much this would help for exams, but you could use a whiteboard to work out homeworks and practice problems and transfer them to paper after. It might be easier to help you practice learning quickly too without having to write on a more permanent substance like paper.\n\nI kind of have the opposite problem where I'm slow since I hesitate to write on paper because I don't want to mess it up, but on a whiteboard, once you erase it there's no real imprint left behind and the mistake is gone forever (sounds stupid but it works somehow). Once I get the hang of how to do certain problems I can write them on paper properly without mistakes and second guessing. Maybe you can learn how to be messier on the whiteboard?\n\nOn the other hand, if you do go to the disability resources and they say they no you'll never have to see them again and it'll probably be one and done in like 5 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this post is from a month ago apparently and I need to get off reddit",

      "text": "I would prioritize the work that you show on tests. In college level every prof/TA that will be grading the tests understand there are time constraints and that limits detail. For example: for graphing, Most of my electrical/electronics courses just say \u201csketch a rough estimation\u201d which essentially means a general shape over non-indexed axis. \n\nEssentially, keep the tidiness up. It is very helpful, but lose some unnecessary details to save time. That would be my approach.",
