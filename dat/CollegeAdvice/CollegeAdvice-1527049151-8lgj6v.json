  "text": "Hello,   \n\n\nI have enrolled in UCSC and will be attending this next year as a robotics engineer major.   \n\n\nHowever, I'm very worried about being rescinded as I am about to either get a D or F in my Linear Algebra class.   \nI have As in the rest of my classes except for one which was for AP Physics C E and M this semester. Last semester I also got all As in my classes except for a B in AP Physics C Mechanics.   \n\n\nI am currently very worried of being rescinded because of this class...  \n\n\nWould anybody know what my chances of being rescinded are?   \n\n\nThanks in advance",
