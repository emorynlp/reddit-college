  "text": "This is my first post ever as this is something important enough for me to look for help for.\n\nI am 23, I live in Oregon, turn 24 in November and I graduated 2015, I had a poor GPA (I believe barely above 2.0), and I don't recall my SAT scores. I want to go back to school, I want to go to university, i have ever since i was little, but i don't know where or how to start. Do i have to take my SAT's again? can i get in with a poor High school GPA? I don't even have my High school transcript? how do i get it? I cant afford to go to school without loans or FAFSA, so i have to wait until i am 24 as my parents cannot and will not help me with filling out the FAFSA. I just don't know where to start or if i even have a fighting chance if i go back 7 years late. what do I do? Where do I start?",
