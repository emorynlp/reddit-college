  "text": "Hello. Recently I saw that I had failed my courses last semester. Origianlly I was going for an IT degree, specifically for CyberSecuirty. I was good with computers, so much so that during my last two years of high school, I was able to work with the IT Technician at the school. (I was in JROTC and the position I got my sophomore year was IT Technician for the program, and from there I met with the Technician.) Because of this, I was encouraged and recommended by him, a worker that came by from Dell after he saw my work, my family, and friends to pursue a degree in IT. I wanted to transfer to University, since I have a seat reserved for me there anyway. However, the problem is that for me to fulfill the requirements, I have to take two coding courses, and of course math. I passed Algebra, but I failed my pre-cal, and I failed the first coding course. I was never a mathematician, and I hated math. I studied hours on end, during my days off, and whenever I could, but I still could not pass. As for coding, I felt that I was in the wrong place. The students that were there were coding in High School, and knew what they were doing. Once the programs started to be 2-5 pages long, I lost track, and just started to dislike it because I didn't understand, and it was too difficult for me. I was close to passing the class, and the professor didn't add two projects yet, so I had thought I would be fine, so I am waiting for him to come back from vacation to speak with him. Even if he does pass me, I have to take another course, which is supposed to be harder. I might change out of this major.\nSeeing this, and looking at the courses ahead, I thought that maybe this isn't right for me. Sure I can repair computers and I am good with them, but I do not have the patience or love for coding. And I was never good at math, and given my efforts, I could not pass. I began to search for other things. I had been pondering over Psychology for a while, in fact that was my second option if I didn't go to IT. I excelled at it, never had to study, at least too hard, and I am good at memorizing things like that and I find it very interesting. I have heard though that it is harder to find a job as one, and I read online that people go as far as to say it is one of the worst degrees to go for because of the difficulty of finding a job. I am not sure of that, I cannot remember their reasons, other than you need to be a doctor before you can start anywhere, but like I said, since there was not a lot of reasoning, I didn't want to throw it out the window. However the required classes are easy, it seems, and it is not as demanding as the other majors. The problem I see with this is that it looks like a easy degree. (Not that it is bad, but I have my reasons that I will go into.) And I have seen the people who go for these. (From my experience) They are the people who were high school bullies, the popular kids who always partied, the ones that never cared for school and are only in psychology just for the degree. most of them don't pursue a job in that field. This turns me away because I don't want to follow the herd, or associate with those people. My Psychology professor did say that some of those people don't stay on that degree path, and that is true. It looks to me though, because of those people, it looks like a basic degree. so many people follow that degree path not to get a job. Obviously it is not a basic degree, but by the sheer amount of people I have seen in it, and the type, makes it look like it, although it is not. I am strongly considering this anyway, because like I said, I am good at it, and it is interesting to me. I have taken most of the required classes, with the ones that I ahvent taken yet being very easy.\nI followed up and did research on becoming a Doctor. MD. I did research, and found out that there is little to no math, nothing too hard, and like psychology. it has to do with memorizing. I am good at that. Someone also wrote that if you are good at things like history, and associating pictures with the information, then this field might be good for you. In high school, I loved history and passed all my tests. when I took art history in college, I passed every class. Never studied. Not one bit. Obviously medical school is different. I have heard the phrase that it is like drinking from a fire hose. There is a lot of information and little time. I know how long it takes, the stages, and what is expected. But I am interested in the process and learning. I am interested inn helping others, and maybe specializing in something that I have, Asthma. the whole process and concept of being a Doctor is interesting to me. Other than the hardships, with less free time, a lot of information, the cost, and the stress and pressure, it looks like fun and I think that I can handle it. It would set me back one year however, since I have not taken any of the required courses to transfer to the university. and I do not know how those classes are like. But everything else seems interesting and doable. I need to do more research, but from what I have found, did scare me at first. After a while, it faded away and I felt like I could do it. Although that's is how I felt like at first when I went into IT.\nLastly, my college has a program that specialized in Video Game development and design, and animation. That is basically me. I have played games and wanted to make/design games since I was a kid, and I have taught myself how to animate and wanted to be an animator at one point. This seems like the best choice, it is my passion. Then I found out that I might not be financially stable, and that I can learn this myself. the only benefit would be that I can be hired by someone in the industry. (They regular have people come down here) I have been told that although art and what have you is nice, but I need something financially stable. Don't follow your passion, and learn to love the process. I do want to become a director, a game designer, animator, everything. Its something 10 year old me would have loved. I was encouraged, and given books and help learning about this. But the fact is that I might not be financially stable, or get a job. All degrees don't guarantee you a job, but with art, or something like this, it is much more difficult. The other degrees would benefit me financially, but none of them I have been thinking about since I was little, except for IT. I can learn to love the process for MD or Psychology, and I do like most of it anyway. But designing games and directing is something that has been on my mind since I was young. I do not get to transfer to the university, however.\nTwo of these paths grant me financial stability, I have grown to like, and interests me. Both would take me a while, one sets me back a year, where the other keeps me on track. More or less. One is a passion, or something I was interested in for a while, but does not grant me financial stability. But like I said, they say not to follow your passion. I don't want it to become a chore, and end up hating it.\nsorry for the novel, I had a lot to say and a lot of options to weigh, and it is bothering me. I don't mean to brag when I say I didn't study, I wasn't trying to brag. I meant it as to say that it comes naturally to me. This is a tough spot im in, and I have never had this much trouble deciding something before. This is important of course, and requires a lot of thought, but there are many pros and cons for all my options, and I cannot decide which is best. I will ultimately make the choice, but if I can have help, I would appreciate it.\nThank you all.",
