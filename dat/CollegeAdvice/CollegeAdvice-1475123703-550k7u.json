  "text": "To keep this short and sweet, my roommate and I share a similar traumatic history. My event happened more recently than theirs, and I haven't really emotionally recovered yet. However, my roommate brings it up at least twice a day. I began having nightmares once again and I've made it (in my opinion) pretty clear that I'm not okay with talking about it. I wouldn't complain about this normally, but this has begun to affect my sleep and performance in class. I'm also not a person to confront others, though I've tried. Any advice in dealing with this?

      "text": "Your roommate might be trying to deal with the traumatic experience by talking about it with you, because they might not have been able to talk much about it in the past. However, if it makes you uncomfortable in any way, then that's all there is to it. You should explain to your roommate that you really do not want to talk about it, and that it really affects you negatively. If they continue to talk about it, talk to your ra or an advisor and probably get your room changed.",
