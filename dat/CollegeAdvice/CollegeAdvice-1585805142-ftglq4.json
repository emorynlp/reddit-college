  "text": "Hey all, sorry for such a long ask but I'm currently an east coast senior and have received my college decisions, but am having a lot of trouble choosing where I should go, my top choices are very different. It will not cost me particularly more or less to attend each of these institutions, so that doesn't rule things out. I'm not 100% sure what I want to do but I am interested in the arts and social sciences, more specifically english, international relations, psychology. All these schools seem to have great programs in my interests. I probably will go to grad school. i do have some interest in the hard sciences but i haven't really explored it much in high school and tend to gravitate towards the social sciences, although i like exploring the social sciences' hard science connections. also, I can't visit anything because of the quarantine.\n\nCurrently, my top college choices, with their pros/cons, are:\n\n**Wellesley**\n\npros:\n\n\\-great academics, from what I've read\n\n\\-safe for women\n\n\\-quiet enough to study when needed, beautiful campus\n\n\\-near(ish) to boston? possible use for internships/fun also Boston is a college city which is cool\n\n\\-useful alumni network?\n\n\\-pretty good study abroad program\n\n\\-12 college consortium to study at another college for a while\n\n\\-small, campus community --&amp;gt; friendship, individual professor attention, a traditional campus\n\n\\-cross-registration opportunities with mit, babson, olin\n\n\\-some prestige? I know everyone says this doesn't really matter but it's still kinda nice although idk if people know wellesley much\n\ncons:\n\n\\-kinda isolated? appears to be 40 min - 1hr from boston, but does that trip feel like a lot or get old fast? or is it fine to go a couple times a week? is campus really that dead?\n\n\\-students seem stressed/studious, which i can do but --&amp;gt; will i find friends that want to go party or enjoy boston when we have free time? im not a huge partier but i enjoy a good get together to meet new people/explore a new place\n\n\\-not coed. does the mostly women thing feel weird? idk ik being surrounded by women could be a good thing, but how hard is it to meet/maintain guy friends or date? most of my friends are female anyway but i'd like to have some variety in college (for reference, i am pretty extroverted)\n\n\\-is it kinda unknown? some of my friends hadn't heard of it, some had\n\n\\-boston weather doesnt seem great, i don't love the cold but if i go i can endure it\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**NYU - College of Arts and Sciences**\n\npros:\n\n\\-great academics/professors, from what I've read\n\n\\-New York City! i love the city and its iconic, plus internship/fun opportunities, closer to more people. plus feel like you're living in the city rather than isolated\n\n\\-larger university, more people to meet/network\n\n\\-closer to real life experience\n\n\\-coed, more of a traditional college experience in that sense\n\n\\-good study abroad program, from what I've read\n\n\\-name recognition/prestige(ish)\n\n\\-havent heard much about the alumni network?\n\ncons:\n\n\\-the college of arts and sciences seems a lil overshadowed by tisch and stern? don't know if it matters much though\n\n\\-not as easy to reach professors/stand out?\n\n\\-some people say it's hard to find close friends because everything is so spread out and moving so fast, people seem kinda high strung\n\n\\-college party scene seems to be limited to clubs/smaller, exclusive apartment parties\n\n\\-expensive city which is harder to manage, gotta keep careful track budgeting\n\n\\-noisy/dangerous? i don't really mind noise unless its just a Racket. is it hard to find quieter places to study?\n\n\\-things are spread out and no real campus so not big on \"community,\" trek far to get to classes\n\n\\-i've read that it's hard to get into classes/opportunities bc administration is inattentive/puts up a lot of hoops to go through\n\n\\-maybe not super great for exploring interests if i don't 100% know the exact thing I want to study?\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**UCI/UCSB**\n\npros:\n\n\\-pretty good academics\n\n\\-lovely location, i've always wanted to live in california, there's beaches nearby and great weather!\n\n\\-people seem pretty chill, traditional, closer campuses/community, more relaxed, happy vibe, parties\n\n\\-larger student body to get to know\n\n\\-coed, more of a traditional college experience in that sense\n\n\\-great study abroad programs, lots of locations\n\n\\-respected uc system\n\ncons:\n\n\\-academics possibly not quite at NYU/wellesley level but idk\n\n\\-not super close to big cities, maybe lack of internships/work? --&amp;gt;maybe even less things to do but the beaches/self contained campus social life might make up for it\n\n\\-doesn't seem as prestigious/recognizable\n\n\\-not a great alumni network? idk much abt it\n\n\\-more of a drug culture, maybe not super safe but i can manage\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you guys think, and if there are alumni from these schools who want to weigh in/answer questions/correct me, please feel free!\n\nadditionally, i was also accepted to Vassar and UT Austin, which i also like, although they are not currently my top choices, but if you have an amazing account of the school/new information, feel free to share\n\nthank you for any help!! :)",

      "text": "Hi there. I have absolutely no knowledge of any of these places. Hence, what follows are just the incoherent ramblings of an old man. My apologies.\n\nWhile making a list of plusses and minuses may be a great idea at first, after reading it all, I can't keep it inside my small RAM which nowadays functions like a stack: as soon as I push one item another pops out.\n\nI spent about 2 years of undergrad in a school of NYU type in Europe. I was living literally in the downtown for 1 year. While it was interesting from the social point of view (from the dorm straight into a busy street; movie theaters nearby; cafes and parks; people on streets; almost daily student protests, etc.), unfortunately, I discovered I was easily distracted by the bustling city. You list academics as pro and for this reason I would suggest not to go to NYU due to the possible distractions. \n\nAlso, while it may appear that it will be plenty of opportunity to get to know people and maybe make friends, I am afraid you may discover how easy it is to be lonely in a big city. Maybe you are different and you will make more friends but my circle never expanded beyond students in the dorm. Also, if classes are large, you will not get to know your classmates: as soon as one class is over, they will run to the next one. I am also not sure NYU has great (career and other - you mention how inattentive admin is) advising and so, you may discover that you will be all on your own to find good opportunities in NYC. Just because it is a large city, it does not mean that (good) positions are readily available to anyone. For this reason, I would suggest running away from NYU.\n\nLet me comment a little on the other two choices that I know nothing about: Wellesley and UCI/UCSB. \n\n**Wellesley**\n\nPros (an analysis):\n\n* I have no doubt that academics are great;\n* *quiet enough to study* (compare NYU);\n* I have no experience with alumni \"network\" from any of the colleges I went to but this could be important to find opportunities.\n* *small, campus community; friendship, individual professor attention.* That's right: you will make friends and you will be able to study well.\n* ~~cross-registration opportunities with mit, babson, olin~~ Based on your description, it does not look like you are interested in STEM or engineering so who cares about MIT?\n* Prestige. Believe it or not, it matters. It will not do everything for you, but it can open doors. Also, do not worry about it being unknown: those in industry who matter know everything about Wellesley.\n\nCons:\n\n* *kinda isolated? appears to be 40 min - 1hr from boston.* That is a good thing IMO: going out to Boston once a week should be plenty.\n* *students seem stressed/studious ... i enjoy a good get together ...* Students are stressed and studious almost everywhere where academics are great. Stressed students almost invariably find ways to have fun. I have no doubt you will find a (good) way. Even nerds at MIT find ways to have fun (Google it).\n* *Not coed. does the mostly women thing feel weird?* Yes, it does (from outside), especially for an European. This is something that you need to weigh yourself.\n* *Boston weather doesnt seem great...* Somebody I know who is from Erie, PA and went to MIT told me that he felt very strange in the bright sunlight of Boston and its mostly clear skies. So, things are relative and even if it is cold, at least it is not gloomy.\n\nI will not comment on UC schools except to note that while they may not be as prestigious and academically rigorous as Wellesley, they will probably provide more than adequate education (for what? - I do not know. I will discuss this below). Good weather, ocean, California culture, etc. Probably UT Austin could also be considered for its city's atmosphere and culture. I am sure education will be adequate, especially if you do not need handholding and if you can pick a book and study it. Is it a great University AND city for \\*humanities\\*? I have no idea.\n\nI would suggest that you look at this process in a slightly different way. Ask yourself what do you want to do the rest of your life and what do you need to do to get there. You need to find all possible trajectories that will lead you to the place where you want to be and then apply [Hamilton's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle), see picture on the right. Everything else is secondary to this. All these pros and cons that you have listed are mostly minor things that seem to you important but to an old man like me - it is all just a passing thing. Even if you go to that isolated all women's college, you will get out of it in 4 years and move on to some great graduate school or maybe interesting work place.\n\nWell, I would be lying if I said that it does not matter how you will feel next 4 years. It does matter. However you are the only one who can figure out how you will feel in different environments. No one here can help you: we are all alone when we need to make important decisions.",

          "text": "**Hamilton's principle**\n\nIn physics, Hamilton's principle is William Rowan Hamilton's formulation of the principle of stationary action. (See that article for historical formulations.) It states that the dynamics of a physical system is determined by a variational problem for a functional based on a single function, the Lagrangian, which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. The variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the differential equations of motion of the physical system.  Although formulated originally for classical mechanics, Hamilton's principle also applies to classical fields such as the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, and plays an important role in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and criticality theories.\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/collegeadvice/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)",
