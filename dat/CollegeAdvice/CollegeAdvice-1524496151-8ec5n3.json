  "text": "So I'm 19 and in college. Last semester my grades were B C D F and my mom knows but my dad didn't. And she told me I had to do well this semester in order for her to continue covering for me. I'm currently slated to fail everything unless I do the race  in the next 3 days. One class the teacher refuses to accept late work so I'm screwed there but I need to pass the other 3 so I can maintain financial aid eligibility. ANY AND ALL ADVICE ON HOW TO TACKLE THIS WILL HELP.",

      "text": "Hi! What exactly is leading you to poor grades? Is it time management, the course load, procrastination, lack of interest..? Starting at the root cause can help you reflect and start to make changes. Just breathe, and don\u2019t stop believing in yourself. Once you decide that failure is your future, it will be. :)",

      "text": "First, take a deep breath. Second, understand that failure is unavoidable. \nI was in your place a couple of years ago as a freshman. Right now I\u2019m 20 and approaching my junior year, and I honestly can tell you it only gets harder. But you learn. Dedication and motivation doesn\u2019t always flick itself on overnight, once you start to realize you can succeed, your efforts are greater.\nMy advice at the moment is talk to your parents and tell them that you are trying to succeed. Be honest about your mistakes and accept any criticism or advice they may give you. Tell them what you are going to change and how you are going to set yourself up for success. Do the same with your teachers and ask for help that you need. Anyone with a degree will understand the hardships of college, and when you truthfully and humbly ask for help and support, those who care will give it to you.\nI can tell you now that when I was failing classes left and right my parents were not so understanding, and rightfully so. I didn\u2019t value higher education or understand the importance of it. Even now I\u2019m not a perfect student, but if I hadn\u2019t failed and taken a moment to understand the weight of my mistakes, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today.\nIt\u2019s hard. College sucks. But just think about how good you\u2019ll feel when you pass your classes, because you got to be the good student this time.",
