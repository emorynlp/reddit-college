  "title:": "Flunked Chemistry II twice, withdrew once, and got a D once",
  "text": "I am 20 years old and in my sophomore year of college. I want to be a civil engineer once I graduate. I have always been a nerd in the sense that I always did well without studying or picking up a book. I feel gifted in math/sciences, I am so embarassed that my grades don't reflect this.\n\nI got a literal 4.0 in Chemistry I. Top of the class.\n\nIn Chemistry II, I got a professor that yelled at you for answering questions :( (I failed) , then one that never asked questions or cared (I withdrew), then a very great one (I fucked up. Failed), then one that was very smart but had a very hard to understand accent and was hard to engage with (I got a 'D').\nBad professors and a lazy student don't mix.\nIs this fixable? I will do anything and everything from now on!",
