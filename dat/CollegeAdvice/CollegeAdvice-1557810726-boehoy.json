  "text": "Hi redditors,\nI\u2019m a senior in high school this year, and I\u2019ll be attending college next year. I won\u2019t be able to fully cover tuition expenses and will need to take out loans, but I\u2019m not sure how to go about it. If anyone has any advice on taking out loans or what they wish they would\u2019ve known before, I\u2019d love to hear it. Thanks in advance!",
