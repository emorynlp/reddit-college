  "text": "I'm a double major in computer science and music, however I'm mostly interested in music and I spend all my time studying it. Ideally I would just do music but I feel like if my dreams for music fall through then it would be kind of a useless major. \n\nI sing brazilian songs so I'd possibly interested in language/foreign business or something else, I don't know. I'm in my 2nd year of college and pretty much finished my GEs and have done some of the coursework for both computer science and music. At most I could do 4 more years and possibly do some summer classes. Any advice?",

That could be being a music teacher while you songwrite on the side. That could be doing a comp sci related job while composing on the side. \n\nBottom line: you gotta pay the bills but of course you should be happy.",
