  "title:": "What's the best way to get my engineering degree without having to uppend my life for full time school?",
  "text": "Just some info: I'm 25, have a 4 year old and a dead end job in the artisan baking industry. I don't make much money, and never will regarding my current career and the state I live in (I'm a manager with 6+ years of experience and I make less than a construction flagger). I want desperately to get my Engineering degree and move into doing Astronautical Engineering later on. I've dreamed of building spacecraft since I was a child, but life and poor decisions put me in a spot where I couldn't go to school. I can't quit and go to school full time, and with my hours I think all I can manage until I find a better job is online courses. I'm at a stable place now, and I'm ready to move on and follow my dreams, I just don't know the best path to get started on. ",

I was looking at engineering but am considering just straight mathematics for now, emphasis in applied mathematics. \n\nI hope you figure it out, I'm going to learn all the math I can on my own for now as a booster of sorts so when I start school it won't be so crazy. I can message you with some resources I was sent by someone that look like they will help!",

Even Bama has one, but it sure isn't cheap. That's a great idea. I need to brush up on my math too or I'm sure I'll be blindsided. Thank you. We can do this! I believe in you! We'll both do it if we just buckle down and get it done.\n\n\"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\"\n-Wayne Gretsky *-Michael Scott*\n\n",

I got a 2 year diploma in 2004 in Computer Networking Technology but didn't get any certifications, so haven't done anything with it and don't want to anymore. I mainly worry about getting the financial aid I need, I can't even get a job here in central FL. Grocery store turned me down lol. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2f I sent you a PM with some stuff that may help. Have a great evening, keep me updated! If you find anything as well give me a shout.",

I'll be looking into financial aid tomorrow, but you ought so see what you can get from FAFSA. There are also a lot of grants out there for adults over 25 with kids (or so I keeo hearing). Have a great night!",
