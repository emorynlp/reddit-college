  "text": "Ok so I applied to a bunch of schools on impulse cause I got rejected by a couple. Now I\u2019ve been accepted into 7+ colleges but my top 2 are Michigan State University (MSU) and Louisiana State University (LSU). Almost all my friends and my bf lives an hour away from MSU and at LSU I\u2019m near my extended family.\n\nI\u2019m going for English and Film Studies, and I also want to continue competing gymnastics. Because corona sucks, I can\u2019t visit either schools and have until May 1 to decide. \n\n\nAnyone know anything about either schools? Which should I go to and why?",
