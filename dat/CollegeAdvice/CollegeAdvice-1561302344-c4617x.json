      "text": "A Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci, BMedSc, BMSc, BSc(Med) degree or Bachelor of Medical Sciences is an undergraduate academic degree awarded after four years of degree level involving biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, pharmacology and other related disciplines, leading to an in depth understanding of human biology and associated research skills such as study design, statistics and laboratory techniques. It is an equivalent level qualification to the more commonly awarded Bachelor of Science (BSc). Graduates may enter a diverse range of roles including post-graduate study, academia, the biotechnology industry, the pharmaceutical industry, consultancy roles, or unrelated disciplines which make use of the broad range of transferable skills gained through this degree.\n\nBachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, or in Latin: Medicinae Baccalaureus Baccalaureus Chirurgiae (abbreviated in many ways, e.g. MBBS, MB ChB, MB BCh, MB BChir (Cantab), BM BCh (Oxon), BMBS), are the two first professional degrees in medicine and surgery awarded upon graduation from medical school by universities in countries that follow the tradition of the United Kingdom (UK). The historical degree nomenclature suggests that they are two separate undergraduate degrees; however, in practice, they are usually treated as one and conferred together, and may also be awarded at graduate-level medical schools. In countries that follow the system in the United States, the equivalent medical degree is awarded as Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) (the latter in the United States only)\n\n\nBMedSci/MD is basically a combination of Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSci) and Doctor of Medicine (MD).\n\nIf your goal is to be a Medical Doctor, pick whichever course is cheaper or shorter in length.",
