  "text": "I have scholarships for music, but I'm a social work major (gonna switch to nursing). I dont want to continue doing orchestra because\n1. it takes up SO much time and my orchestra teacher treats me as if I'm a music major\n2. it makes me have panic attacks and I have to focus more on orchestra than the classes I need for my major\n3. I would rather study and work and go to therapy than spend so much time practicing\nI love my violin, but it's just a hobby\nI don't know what to do and I really want to get out of orchestra but I feel like everyone would shame me for it because I got scholarships even though I'd rather work than stay in orchestra\nplease advise me on what to do.

If someone is gonna shame you for giving something that is causing you mental health issues AND physical health issues up to pursue something you like way more and is healthier for you, they probably don\u2019t deserve a good place in your life.
