  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a senior in high school and I\u2019m freaking out! I\u2019m not sure if I should apply early decision/action to any schools bc i have so little time left! I recently applied for questbridge but did not get chosen as a finalist (which I was really hoping I would get bc my family absolutely can not afford college). Would it be unwise to only apply through regular decision? ( My counselor said I have to apply to at least 20 schools to increase my chances of financial aid). I am also worried because my test scores are not the best and my extracurriculars are not as \u201cprestigious\u201d as everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019m also scared because I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to study once I get to college! \nPlease if you have any advice share it. Also, I would greatly appreciate any helpful links for finding scholarships and filling out fafsa/the css profile. I\u2019m really lost in this process because I\u2019m the first in my family to ever to do this. Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)",
