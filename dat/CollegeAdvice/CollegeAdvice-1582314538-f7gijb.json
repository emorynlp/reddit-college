I took the first test on Monday? Any advice on how to email her? im fine with making things up I just either need her to let me do all the work or drop the class.",

      "text": "If you missing work is due to something out of your control, like a family emergency, medical incident, major schedule adjustments or newly adding the class, things like that, they might let you do some of the work. If missing the work is due to not attending the class, purely not doing work etc. Good luck, that class is toast.  Professors are understanding when it comes to personal problems as long as you talk to them but if you put off the work and don't ask for help if you need it, it will be hard for them to have sympathy.",
