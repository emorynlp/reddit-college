  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in highschool and have had a rough road through my education. As a sophomore I got a 1.8 GPA and had to take summer school going into junior year. Although I got such a low gpa I still managed to get a 3 on the AP euro exam. As a junior i recognized what I needed to do and got a 4.2 first semester and plan on finishing the second semester with a 4.4. I take 2 ap classes as of right now AP United States  history and AP Environmental Science which I plan on getting 5\u2019s on both .My main question is how will colleges view my gpa going from a 1.8 gpa to a 4.4. Will they be impressed and recognize my desire to do well especially with my high AP scores. Or will they see me as a waste of talent.",
