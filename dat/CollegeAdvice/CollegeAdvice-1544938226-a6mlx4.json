  "text": "F21 here. So I got accepted to Snhu\u2019s online program for computer science. I was really excited at first but now that I am nearing closer to the beginning of everything, I\u2019m scared. The reason is that I am completely new to coding and know absolutely nothing about computer science. I only just recently started learning how to code with some Udemy classes. I\u2019ve barely even gotten into learning css so that\u2019s how much of a beginner I am..... is this a bad idea for me, going into cs as a complete beginner? I guess the only real reason I chose it is because the job prospects are really great and pretty much the best out of any other field (one I can physically handle). Coding is really fun for me though and if I had more time and was less lazy I would like to learn more. Other than those two reasons, I don\u2019t see why I would go for a degree in computer science..... my other options would be- 1. teaching (I\u2019d have to go to a different school) which I\u2019m not sure I want to do after working at the Boys and Girls club with horrible kids, and 2. English, which I\u2019m fine with except for the fact that I don\u2019t read enough (I can always start but I\u2019m in a bit of a depressive state atm and don\u2019t have the motivation to do anything really which is why I haven\u2019t been coding) and also that the jobs are crap and there aren\u2019t many well paying or steady ones that I know of. Any advice for me? I have no idea what to do right now. I\u2019m completely stuck. My mom doesn\u2019t want me to switch majors but i really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what I want to do",

      "text": "My advice is to try it out! The average person switches their major five times. If you realize you don\u2019t like it then switch. And they don\u2019t expect you to know anything about computer science before going in! That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to school for it! Take it easy, I am a second semester sophomore now and have switched my major three times without much issue. ",

              "text": "Welcome! if it seems like it would interest you, then you will be fine! All that really counts in college is motivation; you have to be motivated about what you\u2019re learning about. I\u2019m going for ultrasound, I have never done an ultrasound (obviously) but the idea of it seems neat! In my case, I\u2019m going to shadow someone before going to school for it full time. Ask around the local computer places, or whatever you\u2019re looking to do in the field, and ask if you can check out what they do for a day! That might get you a little more motivated, to talk to someone successful in the field!",
