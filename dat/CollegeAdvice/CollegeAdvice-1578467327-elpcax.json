  "text": "I am reapplying to schools as a transfer student and have run into some major bumps. It\u2019s my third year in college and I went to a state school my first year(2017), decided it wasn\u2019t the right fit and went to my local community college the next year(2018). Took more classes the following fall 2019 at another community college and applied to transfer in spring 2020. I met all of my major requirements and had over 60 transferable units which is also required. My application was withdrawn because they don\u2019t count classes after Spring 2019, meaning my credits (which was a full load) from Fall 2019 weren\u2019t considered, meaning I didn\u2019t reach the 60 unit requirement (note: they have my completed transcript, so they know that I did complete those units by Spring 2020). My application was at first conditionally accepted but then denied mid-December, which was AFTER FALL 2020 ADMISSION DEADLINE. Meaning I can no longer apply to school in the Fall now. This sets me back until Spring 2021 to start at the school I\u2019m intending to transfer too. I\u2019m basically losing like a year and a half of school because now that I have so many credits, I can\u2019t take more otherwise I won\u2019t be considered for future transfer. What can I do??? Is there anything that can be done to get them to accept my Fall 2019 credits, having the official transcript that they were completed? Or some way to have my application be considered for Fall 2020? Please help I\u2019m desperate for advice.",

      "text": "Talk to the admissions office, they are the only people with experience in this situation at that school. Its weird they wouldn\u2019t bump your application to the next eligible semester even with the deadline passing but sounds like a pretty competitive transfer situation. Be prepared that they might not do anything to help considering the issue with the application was on your end.",
