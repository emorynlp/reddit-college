  "text": "I need a 70 in the class. I currently have a 73 (45% of my grade is already calculated). I just turned in a paper which I\u2019m hoping for a 75+ on (this is 25% of my grade)  & about to take a final (will be 30% of my grade), hoping for a 75+ on. However, im very worried I will not do well and will get below a 70. Can I email my prof/how should I to ask him to give me above a 70? Should I volunteer to do more work? Please help!! This is totally my fault I\u2019ve just been swamped this semester as I started working full time",

      "text": "Firstly, take a deep breath and don't try to think about the worst-possible-results. If you've been sitting in the 70's in your other grades for the class, it's doable to stay there. You don't want to go talk to a professor when you're in a panic that might not be justified!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost professors are not receptive to 'hey, please give me XYZ' grade. I've even had some banning emails like that, and also telling students to never ask for extra credit. So, check out your syllabus before you broach the subject. Your best bet is to go to their office hours and talk to them in person so that it doesn't feel impersonal like an email might. If this is an online course and you don't have another way to contact them, then an email would be fine. Just explain your concerns, and that you're hoping to get a D-C grade in the class, and ask them what should be done/if they have any advice for the final (if there's still time to get advice).",
