  "text": "1. Do not, and I can't stress this enough, take 8 classes. Bad idea\n2. Online classes might not be for you. You just have to figure it out \n3. Marry your course requirements with your career\n4. Go to the goddamn gym \n5. Sometimes it's the professor, not the course, that makes you want to bash your head through a glass window \n6. Do NOT wait until the last minute for a big project\n7. If you can do the project alone, do it alone\n8. There is absolutely no shame in living with your parents\n9. Take a break every once in a while \n10. Get sleep or else your 8 am class will be hell \n11. Don't live off of coffee\n12. If you wake up one day and you randomly feel really sick, sometimes it's your body being like \"Go to bed\" from being overworked \n13. There is no shame in dropping a class\n14. Take one day a week do absolutely NOTHING school related \n15. Professors are weirdly understanding. If you're going to miss a class, let them know. If you're struggling in their class, let them know\n16. You get  a lot of discounts. Take advantage",

      "text": "Got to say, brilliant realizations for having just gone through one semester. Some of these took me quite a bit longer to get my head around. \n\nI'll add:\n\n17. Completely, 100%, always okay to say no. You are the one to decide your priorities, values, and actions - and they won't always be the same as someone else's. \n\n18. Value your mental and physical well-being over the assignment/class. If you're not doing okay on the inside, the other stuff is *never, ever* going to come easy (or at least without a cost).\n\n19. Create an identity outside of school. Have things you do, places you go, people you talk to, etc. that have nothing to do with work, campus, or classes. Defining yourself soley by your school and what you do there can make your world feel small (*it's big, get around it*). \n\n20. Have a support system - a friend, a group of friends, a family member, a counselor, a coworker, *someone*. Even if you don't think you'll need it. Even if you're too proud to admit you do. It's important as ever to take care of relationships with those you love and value because at some point, whether you anticipate it or not, they will need you and/or you will need them - and you'll be thankful you have \"your people.\"\n\n21. Don't buy into the competitive, cold culture. At the end of the day, it's school. It's important - but so are a *lot* of other things in life. Make sure you put things in perspective (often).",
