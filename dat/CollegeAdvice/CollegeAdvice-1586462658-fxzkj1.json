  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve recently ran into an unfortunate situation. Due to a chronic medical condition I have which leads to me missing a lot of school, I\u2019ve received an average grade of 50% in an elective course the past two years. I\u2019m working towards attempting to fix this but in the event that I cannot, I\u2019m extremely concerned about how this will affect my college applications. Besides these grades, every other grade i\u2019ve received in high school has been 95% or higher. I\u2019ve taken the ACT once and got a 30, and I have a long list of extracurriculars and other accomplishments. So my questions are, will I still have a chance at getting into decent colleges with those two 50%? It obviously will impact my gpa a lot, but will colleges be able to see that I\u2019ve done well in every other class and that those elective credits are the reason for my low gpa? Will I be able to explain to colleges the reasoning for these low grades(chronic medical condition) somewhere on my application? I apologize if this is a lot but I\u2019m just so concerned and would like to see where I stand in terms of my future. I should also mention that I am a junior. Thank you to anyone that has some advice or knowledge to offer up here! :)",
