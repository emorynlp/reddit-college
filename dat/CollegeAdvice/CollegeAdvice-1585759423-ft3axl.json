  "text": "So I have been accepted into my two top choices and I\u2019m so grateful for that. However, it is a very difficult and stressful decision to make- especially when i can\u2019t go tour again before I make my final decision. \n\nThe two schools are NC State and St. Andrews University. One is public and the other is private. \n\nObviously academically, State is the right choice. They offer a more specific major to what I am planning on doing as a career. However, I received almost a half ride to St. Andrews due to my equestrian abilities. I was very excited to attend the school but, getting into State and looking into their programs changed my perspective a little bit. My biggest hangup is letting go of the scholarship and the ability to really work on my sport for the next four years. \n\nWhen I first started applying to college I was planning to go into the equine industry, hopefully as a trainer. However I have done a lot of research following that and I just feel that it\u2019s more of a pipe dream than a realistic career. For that career, St. Andrews would definitely give me a better path. However since I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a career that takes me nowhere, I feel like St. Andrews limits me. I would be doing an equine related major rather than Zoology which i would do at state. \n\nThe schools both cost about the same, so that\u2019s not really a factor.  \n\nI feel like State gives me more options in the future, and I definitely prefer Raleigh to the city which St. Andrews is in. It\u2019s just hard to give up being on a team which I worked so hard to get on. I could ride at State but the team is not as good nor is it school sponsored, so it\u2019s a little different.",
