  "text": "So I looked up my schedule and it turns out I have some pretty bug gaps. On one day I have one that's about an hour and half long and on another I have one that's about two hours long. \n\nDuring my orientation I was told that its not that good to have. Is it actually a bad thing? The classes I got are basics I need and were available.",

      "text": "I think it\u2019s pretty normal, me and my other class mates would talk about how much time we have till our next class which would be like a hour or two. In between the hours working on homework from another class, studying, getting lunch, or hanging out with other classmates where easier to do with the gaps in between classes.",

      "text": "I consistently have 1-3 hour gaps between classes. I personally enjoy it, because I live close to campus I can go home and eat/work on stuff for next class. Some people may work better in a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach every day, but I find it beneficial for me to take it a day at a time, chunk by chunk.",
