  "title:": "Please Help a Confused, Overwhelmed High School Senior",
  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m a high school senior interested in majoring in Chemical Engineering. I have narrowed my list down to MIT, Princeton, and Rice. Decision day is May 1, so I\u2019m definitely running out of time. Everyone keeps telling me that MIT is wonderful, has the best engineering reputation, and I\u2019d be crazy to turn it down. Admittedly, I visited for CPW and had an amazing time; I connected with people, and I felt at home in a way. I didn\u2019t visit Princeton, but I did visit Rice, and I had a wonderful time there as well. Generally, I\u2019d love to attend MIT. The name recognition, variety of opportunities, and environment are unique in a way that makes it especially difficult to turn down. Don\u2019t get me wrong. This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve already subconsciously decided on MIT. I had just as great a time at Rice. However, my major reservation about MIT is its intensity. Is it really that bad? Will I fail all my classes unless I study 24 hours a day and even then only earn C\u2019s? What\u2019s the point of attending a world-renowned university if I\u2019ll only graduate with a 2.0 GPA or perpetually be at risk of flunking out? The students didn\u2019t seem overworked or too stressed during CPW, but people have hinted at this being some sort of act they put on for the event? Princeton seems to have a strong engineering department as well, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s more theoretical and less hands on? Also, I am a middle-class African-American from the South, and I\u2019ve been warned of Princeton\u2019s pretentious vibe and lack of diversity. Rice students seem especially happy, but it is a smaller school, and I doubt it has similar name recognition or quality of opportunities as Princeton or MIT? I\u2019m running out of time and losing my mind. My crippling fear of making the wrong choice has left me unable to make a decision. I\u2019d really appreciate some advice and guidance here.",

      "text": "College advisor here: you can always, always transfer. Don't feel as though you are stuck, make the decision where you will be most comfortable with a supportive environment as your general happiness truly matters when it comes to academic success. Also remember the school has to fit you and your goals not the other way around. While prestigious programs are great academically, they may not have the same resources available as a smaller school. I would also consider contacting a current student, not just someone that was at an event to get a feel of the climate. All three options are excellent schools and from experience, hands on is the most successful tool in the work force. Also anywhere you go, be sure to take advantage of opportunities, internships and resources available (career centers, workshops, etc.) Hopefully that helps!",
