  "text": "Hey guys! I am currently going through the motions of getting my associates degree to be able to transfer to a university. My current boyfriend and I are in it for the long run and he has an incredible job located in the middle of zero universities. He's commuting about an hour to work everyday from where we currently live and he wants to find a place a closer to his job. However, I am a year and a half way from going back to school and I can not take him away from his job to pursue college life. \n\nSo...26, living in a dorm? Any thoughts? I'm actually really excited about the thought, since I never got to experience it before. ",
