  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore in college as a mechanical engineering major. I am struggling with several classes, one of which I am already taking for my second attempt. You only get three attempts at this class, but you have to get special permission to take it a third time. If I can't pass the class, I'm likely going to have to change majors. I'm super worried about what I should switch to if I do have to switch. I enjoy mechanical engineering but recently have came to be super frustrated with the overload of work and I lack motivation. I'm really worried that if I change majors it will set me back and I don't like the thought of my past two years basically being wasted and all the money I've thrown down the drain. I need advice, anything helps honestly. I'm super stressed. ",

      "text": "Hey Carrottop74.\nI am literally in the exact same situation as you, second attempt at Calc 1 isn't going any better than last time so I figured this path wasn't for me either. My plan is to transfer to a Community College for Automotive Technologies (Associate) because I realized Mech Engineering was just too far above my reach. I see it as \"Do something you know you can finish rather than what you are expected to finish.\"\nI know it won't be as presitigious as Mech would've been but it's the kind of thing where you have to look at yourself and think \"I'll do what is possible for ME\" (No Mech Engineering pun intended)\nNothing wrong with taking a step back and reevaluating what you're capable of, not everyone can get a PhD and that's okay. Do what makes you happy at the end of the day, life's too short to have grey hair by the time you're 25 on something that overworks you, everyone has limits and again, that's okay.\nHope my anecdote helped, I'm currently in the EXACT same situation. (M.E. sophmore and repeating a class that could determine everything)\nJust find what works for you, my CC advisor already assured me that my State University credits and (most) classes will transfer to the CC i'm headed to.\nHope I gave you any sort of direction (even if you take a completely different route hah)\nKeep that chin up and do what works for you.",
