  "text": "So basically I am a junior in college with a Major in enviromental science. I am probably not going to graduate on time due to previous college I transferred from. This semester I sort of realized I wasnt really passionate or really cared about my major at all. I care about the environment, sure, but as a career I am not sure if it interests me. I am considering switching. My girlfriend is a theater major which she is really passionate about, and my best friend is in a physical therapist assistant program and hes passionate about that. So I feel as though I should pick something im passionate with. My favorite class I've taken thus far is philosophy but I am afraid I couldn't really make a career with a major in that. Any advice?",

      "text": "I think philosophy majors (humanities majors overall) get too much flak. Places will hire you with a Phil major, but it will mostly be in writing or reasoning based fields(just google careers for x major). If you want to do work with actual philosophy you would have to pursue higher ed and probably teach it at the university level. ",

      "text": "What environmental science jobs interest you? Before changing majors, talk to someone in the industry or a trusted professor about what jobs exist. You might be excited about an emerging area. However, changing majors is common but your graduation might be delayed. What excites you about the other major & jobs after college? You\u2019re doing well to stop & think about this decision. ",
