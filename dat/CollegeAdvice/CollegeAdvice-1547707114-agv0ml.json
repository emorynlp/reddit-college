  "title:": "CHSPE to drop out and go to college",
  "text": "So I am considering to drop out of high school as a junior in college. I hear about the CHSPE test that I can take to legally drop out of high school and then go to college with it. As of right now, high school is rather boring for me and seems like a waste of time. If I were to drop out, what would my best options be and how should I apply to college. My plan is to apply for a community college for the first 1-2 years and then later transfer to a UC school junior year. Should I do this? How?",

      "text": "I passed the CHSPE and have been attending my community college for a while now. The next testing date would be in March, so you would probably get your certificate at the end of your junior year. The catch is you can only apply to community colleges. To transfer to a UC, you would have to stay at 2 least years(up to 3 if you are a STEM major). Although you can transfer to most other colleges after one year. The tricky part would be that transfer rates to anywhere but the UC's are notably lower. How are competitive are your grades and SAT/ACT/AP scores? ",

              "text": "Great stats! Admission to every UC besides Berkeley and UCLA is guaranteed through TAG(Keep a reasonable college GPA). Admission to UCLA is pretty much assured if you complete TAP(Take 15 units of honors courses; doesn't what kind of classes). CC semesters are also accelerated, which means that one CC semester=one year of high school. You'd be able to finish your undergraduate education at a faster rate than your peers. Although that being said, if you are a STEM major, you should look at schools like USC or Cornell, places that accept transfers whenever or after a year. The transfer unit cap is at 70 for UCLA, which is higher than most. Most STEM students are required to complete 95-105 units before they are eligible to transfer, so you'd have to retake many courses at the university, which would extend your stay, probably by a year at least. Although you shouldn't worry about this, as your high school stats would make you very competitive for transfer at places like USC. But if you think you have a chance at places like Harvard or Princeton, I'd consider staying your senior year.",

The more selective universities(usually top 15 and under) still take them into consideration. Most of them talk about how they want transfer students that would have also be competitive for freshman acceptance.",
