  "text": "Hi there! I\u2019m looking for ideas for low cost activities/programs for college freshman to do over the summer where I\u2019ll be able to meet other people around my age. Could be anything from volunteering to meetups to traveling. What have you all done over the summers where you\u2019ve hung out with and met people your age? I currently live by NYC, so if anyone knows programs in the city that would be helpful as well! Thanks!",
