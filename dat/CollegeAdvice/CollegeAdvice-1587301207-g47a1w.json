  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a high school senior majoring in biology for the fall of 2020. I recently got accepted to San Francisco State University and while I am thrilled in attending, there is something lingering my mind. The question, should I really attend SFSU? \n\nSomething I really wanted you all to know is that I hope to transfer to UCLA. Ideally transferring from a CSU to a UC is unrealistic as you are not given priority over other applicants. Though I DO want to attend SFSU, a better alternative would be to start with a community college and then transfer to UCLA. It would be more ideal than staying at SFSU, transferring back to a CC, and then UCLA. \n\nSan Francisco State University is a wonderful institution with amazing staff and students. The dorms are amazing (IMO), the volleyball club is great, and the overall experience would be phenomenal. I already picked out my classes ahead of time and have almost everything planned out if I do end up going. But I will not receive fafsa or other forms of aid for college (besides my parents) and attending school and living in the Bay Area is expensive! I like SFSU and I really want that feel of independence in my first year of college. It\u2019s an ideal fit, though I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my home for the next four years. \n\nPierce College is another viable option. It is a community college that has a significant amount of students transfer to UCLA successfully. The Honors and TAP program is one of the best in all CC\u2019s in my area and it would also be a great way to get everything needed to transfer to Ucla within a short time period. Though it is a community college I do not care of the stigma behind it. It is a cheaper and faster alternative than attending a school I\u2019m not 100% percent sure of attending yet. All I know is that this school can also take me to great lengths, and I know I can try to get into Ucla with this opportunity at hand. \n\nSo at the end of the day the question is the same, should I attend SFSU or should I try my chances at a CC in hopes of obtaining my goal of attending UCLA? \n\nI thank you all for your time and consideration, this is longer than I expected. Stay safe and healthy. \n\nBest regards,\n6arci6",
