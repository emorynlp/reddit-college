  "text": "Hi guys!! So I wanted some advice on applying to liberal arts schools, I\u2019ve heard they give a bunch of aid (which I need) and that overall it\u2019s just better to apply to really good schools for my graduate degree and do my undergrad from liberal arts (mostly because I want to study a shit load of different stuff and dont want to decide my major until I\u2019ve got a good idea of everything, but I\u2019m leaning towards Law/IR).\nThe thing is though, I\u2019m not ED/EAing to any college because I just don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nIs that a bad idea? Please help me!",
