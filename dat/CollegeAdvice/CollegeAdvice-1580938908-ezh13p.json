I don't know what I'm asking for exactly, I guess just wondering if anyone has any recommendations. I've looked at Boston University and Stonybrook, if anyone has opinions on those.",

It's a good proximity to the city so you can make trips out there. the campus is pretty nice I mean yeah there are some old buildings but lots of them are newer. there's a nature reserve on campus I haven't seen it yet but ive heard its really pretty",
