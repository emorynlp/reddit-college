  "text": "((Reposting from r/IndustrialDesign))\n\nHi! I\u2019m a high school senior and I\u2019m having some serious indecision choosing between CMU and RISD..... \n\nFor some context: 1) I am very fortunate that money is not an issue, 2) I went to CMU\u2019s precollege design program this last summer so I already know the lay of the land (so to speak), 3) I have taken literally a single art course in my entire life (how I got into RISD is kinda beyond me but the point of this is that I actually have very little classroom art experience)\n\nMy main concern are is how applicable each education is in the field.. I know money isn\u2019t everything but I would also like to not be a starving artist, so actually being hire-able would be super cool. \n\nAny advice is welcome!!",
