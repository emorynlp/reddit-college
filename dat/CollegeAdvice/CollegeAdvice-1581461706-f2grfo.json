  "title:": "Double Major Pre-Med Pre-PA????",
  "text": "Okay, so, I\u2019m an 18 year old female senior in high school. I will be attending Edinboro University (Good Pennsylvania State school) and I need advice. I\u2019ll be the first in my family really to go to college, so I have no where to turn and I still don\u2019t 100% understand how this all works. I currently have 12 credits due to AP classes going into college (I already know my school accepts them, I got a transcript for them in the mail), and my school also has 2 majors I\u2019m interested in: Pre-Medical, and Pre-Physician Assistant. I\u2019m not quite sure which I want to do, but a lot of the classes I want to take are part of the requirements for PA, but my teacher tells me to do Med in case I want a broader range for Medical schools if I decide I don\u2019t want to be a PA. A lot of the class requirements are EXACTLY the same for both degrees except 8 classes, with a total of 22 credits. My question is, since I have enough credits to not take some basic, gen ed classes and free up my time: is it possible to take the classes needed for Pre-PA and Double Major it with Pre-Med???? I have no idea and would love to know. I want to know if this is possible and if I should do this instead of going for a minor. Thank you so much. Again, I don\u2019t know a lot about any of this, I\u2019m still learning, and really appreciate the advice.",

      "text": "As a college advisor (and currently applying to med school) I just want to say that pre-med is not a major. They probably have a biology pre-med program (similar with the PA). As to what you should do, please don\u2019t be limited to pre-professional majors let yourself choose what is right for you, wether that\u2019s chemistry, biology or whatever you like. Med school and PA school does not care what major you are, as long as you have your pre-requisites you WILL be okay. I have a lot of friends with majors in English, Psych and Literature that are current med students. Focus on what you like and complete the prerequisites that\u2019s all that really matters.",

          "text": "I know, but I want to take those classes that are required within those majors. I really enjoy biology and anatomy, etc etc, and I don\u2019t really see myself wanting to major in anything else. Plus, I want to take classes that are going to help prepare me for the MCAT. I want to know if the question I asked is a possibility or not? (I\u2019ve looked into psych and bio as well, I\u2019m still getting my thoughts and wants together) (For some background information, I\u2019ve already be accepted into not only the college, but the honors college and have a full ride)",

              "text": "That\u2019s ok! I was also a bio major lol. I would say got with pre-med because more than likely all the PA prereqs will be met as well (maybe some will be an outlier but the majors ones will be most likely the same) you can definitely do a double major but personally I would recommend trying to do something different for a double major to show your versatility. I would definitely encourage you to talk to your pre med adviser at the college (I\u2019m 90% sure they have one) and see what their advice is as well.",

I was also first gen and I understand not really having a lot of people to ask for advice. I know you are just starting, but I wanted to say, pre-med is hard and there are going to be days were all you want to do is make a bonfire and burn all of your books (I might or might not have thrown my orgo book out the window once it was over lol) but you can do it, is possible and it will be worth it, I promise :)",
