  "text": "Hey! I am currently deciding on which school to attend, I am an upcoming biology major (but may change to a major in public health). \nTo give some background as to what I am like, I have been a part of my schools track team for four years, and I live in a kinda small town looking for a big school to finally venture out. I enjoy activities like coffee dates, goodwill thrifting, and I also did band in high school (but I am not really looking to continue with that). I do like a good party, but I would consider myself a stay at home person and would rather enjoy seeing some good close friends. My first choice was NC State University in Raleigh but sadly I did not get in. I have toured UNCW, but not ECU due to the recent virus outbreak. I really liked UNCW for many reasons but I wish they had a football team and a more appealing cafeteria. \nECU seems appealing due to the big campus but it is the \u201ceasier\u201d school to get into\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/frichy)",
