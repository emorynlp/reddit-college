  "title:": "Considering dropping my math minor",
  "text": "I have been having thoughts lately on whether I should pursue on my Mathematics minor or I should drop it and focus on finishing my degree. I am an IT major heading into my fourth year. I just switched from my CS program last year so my degree path has been delayed. My plan before adding the minor was to graduate with an extra fall semester after my fourth year. \n\nI am taking a cryptography course next fall and I had some doubts because I did not do well in my discrete math course and I heard the instructor was a bit inconsistent with her past courses. \n\nIs it worth pursuing my math minor? I only need three more courses, but adding the minor would only add an extra semester and my primary focus is to graduate. On one side, I find it useful for any math-related problems in my field. On the other, I believe it would only be another bullet point in my resume and nothing else. I cannot choose another minor because that would delay my graduation longer.",

      "text": "From what I have heard asking employers, employers in IT generally do not care about minors. Your major is more important as well as your prior experience. I would pursue the math minor only if you are interested in it :) - but it shouldn't have too much impact on your career options.",

What they dont tell you in University, is that you need certifications more than anything. I know guys with a 2 year degree and a list of industry certs making well over 100k a year.",
