  "text": "Hi!! I've been accepted into my top choice college, but I have not committed yet. I'm hesitant firstly because of the debt I will be in in my first year of adulthood and second because I'm still not sure what career path I want to take, and the thought of spending 20,000 on gen ed classes hurts. Although I love the school, I keep questioning weather I should take my first classes at a community college and save money or take a year and spend it figuring out who I am and what I want to do. I know that freshman year of college will be a year of discovery in itself, but if I could accomplish the same without putting myself in debt I believe that would be preferable. If anyone has any opinions or personal experiences they would like to share with me I would love to hear them!!",

      "text": "Taking a gap year shouldn't be seen as a detrimental situation. People tackle college in their own ways, and it shouldn't matter when you start, just that you start. Especially if you aren't sure of what you want to do, I would suggest maybe interning in different fields or even traveling a little, just to understand what motivates you.

      "text": "First, congratulations on getting into your first choice: thats a great accomplishment! If I could do it all over again I would have started at a community college and got my GE out of the way. I would have taken the time to get to really figure out what I wanted to do out of life. Personally, I was not ready for a 4-year college, and I do now have an immense amount of debt. When I was 18, however, I was CONVINCED that every one was wrong, and I was right. So I went to a university straight out of high school, and ended up changing majors 5 times, transferring numerous times, and ultimately I did not finish my degree until I was 30 (Just last December)! All in all, I think that the best option for anyone who is questioning, is to take time for themselves by slowly doing their GE at a CC. The good thing is, you can do good at CC and always transfer to a great university. There are so many options!\n\nReally take this time to get to know yourself!",
