      "text": "There's no age limit on college. My mom went back in her 50s. I can't really recommend any site in particular for you, but you would be considered a \"nontraditional student,\" so try looking up tips/ scholarships for that. Otherwise, the advice for typical, post high school college students isn't incredibly different- it just needs to be bent to fit your needs. From what I remember of it, most of it was how to find the school you fit best at, how you can pay for it, and figuring out what you want from school. While the answer to those might differ from a fresh out of high school college student, same ideas apply.",

Are you looking for something that can be flexible with your schedule? then online might be your best bet! or are you looking for more of a community? if so you might need to do more research. you can even schedule an appointment to talk with an advisor if you have specific questions. \n\nfollow your dreams! the rest will fall into place \ud83d\udc95  \n\nand most importantly...NEVER compare yourself to anyone else because they\u2019re not you and you\u2019re not them. \ud83d\ude0c (idk why the font has suddenly changed)",
