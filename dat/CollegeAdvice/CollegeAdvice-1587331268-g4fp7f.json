  "text": "Ok Reddit, I am stuck and could use some help \n\nI am currently in between RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology) and Penn state (At University Park), My goal is to graduate with a biomedical engineering mechanics degree!\n\nAt RIT I would be doing a mechanical engineering mechanics degree with a heavy focus, minor, in biomedical\n\nAt Penn State, I would be doing a biomedical engineering degree with heavy emphasis, minor, in mechanical engineering\n\nNow here is where my problems begin, both are fantastic schools, and I am truly blessed to have been accepted into both of these schools, but I can only choose one\n\nAt RIT, I would be paying close to nothing as I have received a very generous amount, Less than 30K for four years, and yes, I know its five years of aid. while at Penn State, I would be paying much much more, 100+K for 4fouryears.\n\nI have been leaning towards Penn state due to the immensely influential Alumni, recognizable name, social life, and community if any of you understand, they pass the \"Vibe Check.\"\n\nOn the other hand, RIT is a fantastic school, especially for what I want to do with great alumni and, of course, the Co-Op program, which I have since found out I can do at Penn State, but there social life and community do not fit my style at all. I am a very social person who goes out with friends regularly and considers meeting new people a hobby. This is something I know I need to have at whatever college I attend, and I don't think RIT has that for me, but as we go back to the root of all problems in life, the money being awarded to me.\n\nIf any of you amazing people could share your opinions or suggestions on the situation, it would be much appreciated as time is ticking down.\n\nThank you",

      "text": "I mean it's hard to imagine that there would be no social life whatsoever. I'm a BME and I'm super introverted so I prefer not to go out but  I know a lot of engineering majors who do. I don't go to a tech school but I have friends that go to tech schools and those schools are still very representative of the college life- like they go out and party all the time. What I found is that no matter what, engineering is going to be slightly more difficult/labor intensive than other majors so you might have a fraction bit of less time going out but that's regardless of the school that you go to because that's just the nature of engineering. The cool thing is because of that, engineers have a pretty strong bond and a lot of assignments are cooperative so it's not competitive like test-based majors at all. Colleges are huge so you're going to find people with your interests/personality regardless. \n\nThat being said, if there's a college that you know you're going to thrive better in and the academics match more of what you want to pursue then that's what you should go for. I turned down a paid research scholarship to go to a school that taught the classes that I wanted to actually learn in that the other school didn't offer.  Do I regret it sometimes? \\*yeah\\* but the people who I've met where I go now are amazing and I've been accepted into another research program here so it all worked out.",
