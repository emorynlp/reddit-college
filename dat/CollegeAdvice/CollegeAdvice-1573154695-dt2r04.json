  "text": "I really would like to open my own spin on a cat cafe. These animals would be adoptable and would stay in the cafe overnight ideally (in kennels of course). However, it\u2019s not nonprofit and i would also be selling food and drink, and maybe some merchandise down the line. \n\nAnyways, the thing is i don\u2019t know actually how to run a business and i also need a degree that allows me to work/run an animal shelter/adoption agency? \n\nDo i double major or have one be my major and one be my minor? If the second, which one should be what? I\u2019d like to focus more on animals than business, but i still need to learn the business aspect very well",

      "text": "You would probably want to try to find a US cat cafe and ask what they had to do as the laws in the US for animals and food are completely differentfrom Japan. I'd start out with a business/managing degree and probably pick up some barista and possibly some baking skills.\n\nA local cat cafe here in Texas runs well but because of food safety regulations they are only allowed to sell prepackaged snacks and beverages.",
