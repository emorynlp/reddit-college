      "text": "You're going to need a bachelor's degree to start, but it may not need to be in biology or even a science. Many medical schools only require a list of science and math classes (biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, calculus), which you could take while majoring in something else. This might even set you apart from other applicants who all majored in bio. Look at some medical school websites to see what their requirements are and think about where you might want to go after you get your bachelor's.\n\nAlso think about where you want to go for undergrad, and get started on applications if you haven't already. It will be important that you are comfortable and supported wherever you choose to get your bachelor's degree, to make sure that you can complete the science/math prerequisite classes. Also look for a school that has good premed advising, clubs, research opportunities, and volunteering opportunities nearby. \n\nThere are plenty of resources online to help you with taking your first steps as well. Maybe ask your school guidance counselor too, to see if they have any advice on colleges in your area (if you want to stay close to home). \n\nI would also start thinking about what you might like to do with a medical degree -- do you have a specialty in mind, or a particular area you would like to work in? What are your reasons for wanting to go into medicine? Make sure they are ones that will keep you motivated over the years. Talk to some current doctors too, if you haven't already, to get an idea of what their day-to-day is like, and to learn about different specialties. You can totally do this over the next couple of years while in college, too, and it may be even easier while you are in college and may be closer to hospitals/clinics where you could shadow.",
