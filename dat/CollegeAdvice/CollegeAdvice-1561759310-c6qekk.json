  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming sophomore who made the terrible decision of taking Chinese. My school requires 3 years of foreign language to graduate (one you get in 8th grade) so I can drop it after sophomore year. The class is a hassle and is a lot of work. It\u2019s also harder than other languages offered but doesn\u2019t have the benefit of honors or ap weight that other classes have. Do colleges care if I take it all four years or should I drop it.",

      "text": "I would suggest dropping it if you believe that you will struggle in future classes. While it would look nice if you had 4 years of language, they don\u2019t really care if you dropped it since most students come in with 2 years of language. Only some colleges would require a language requirement but most won\u2019t so you should check if any of the colleges you\u2019re currently interested in requires more years of language.",
