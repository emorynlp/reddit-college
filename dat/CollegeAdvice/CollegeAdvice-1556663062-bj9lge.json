  "text": "I have a 1430 on the SAT and around a 94 average gpa.  I have pretty good extra curricular activities like VP of my class, science Olympiad, varsity track, and an officer in habitat for humanity. \n\nI have no idea where I want to go to school or where I can get in. I live in New York so I\u2019ve looked at SUNY schools but don\u2019t know if they\u2019d be a good fit. I want to challenge myself academically but am also want to have a good time in college. \n\nI\u2019m interested in biology but also government and foreign affairs, so I still don\u2019t know what I really want to do with my life.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations for where I should go it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Have you toured any schools? Maybe try to decide if you want a lib arts college or more of a large university as a first step. I'm also from NY and had pretty similar stats so feel free to pm me for more personal advice.",

I\u2019d say Johns Hopkins for bio, but that might be a dream/reach  level for you. I\u2019d still give it a go! Not sure about government but I know the majority of Ivy\u2019s are very strong in that field",
