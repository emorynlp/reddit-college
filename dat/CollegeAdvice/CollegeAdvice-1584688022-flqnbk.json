  "text": "Hello guys! I'll be moving away in Fall 2020 from my hometown. Ill be moving away 3 hrs and 30 minutes away, which is the farthest ive ever been away from my family in a long stretch of time. I'm gonna miss them SUPER BAD, I can ALREADY tell. I get anxious thinking about it. This ALSO means that I'll be needing some essentials. \n\nFirst thing, what are some essentials that i should bring with me that most people don't consider? \n\nWhat are some things that i could just buy over there? \n\nSecondly, how do i get over homesickness? \n\nWhat are some tips that help? What are some of y'alls experiences with homesickness and how do i combat it?\n\n I was thinking of maybe calling them every night and talking with them. \n\nWhat are some things that i shouldn't do that put me deeper in homesickness, in a way? \n\nThank you!!",

      "text": "Ooh! Another thing I almost forgot. \n\nSomething my dad and I did when I moved into my apartment was make wall art together. My dad isn't particularly artistic but the fact that its something with a good loving memory attached helps me feel better when I'm really missing him. Consider doing a family art project you can take with you, it doesn't have to be big. Just something you can look at every day and think about a good memory",

      "text": "So when I first moved out my body decided that I needed to suffer. I got really sick physically so make sure you're taking care of yourself. Stock up on some over the counter medicine especially cough drops and peptobismol. \n\nGrab some of those microwavable bags of frozen veggies. Everyone gets constipated when they move to college. If it's not the stress from the move, it'll be your diet so eat your greens. \n\nAs for homesickness, this might sound a bit odd but if you can bring something that smells like home, do. It'll help comfort you when you're scared and overwhelmed. \n\nTry your best to not go home on the first weekend. Its very very tempting to just... not go back to school. You need to make friends so stay on campus. \n\nSpeaking of, it might take you a long time to make friends. I didn't make my first friend at college till November of my freshman year. Take your time, you'll find the right people. \n\nAbsolutely call your family. They're probably worried about you and talking to them will help you feel better. \n\nWhen I was feeling very lonely and sad I did whatever I could to distract myself. I would turn on kitchen nightmares in the background and knit or play guitar. Do something to use up space in your brain so you dont feel as homesick. \n\nMake sure you keep exercising. It will help you feel less lonely and homesick (excersise = endorphins= less sad) the gym is actually a pretty good place to make friends. \n\nDont trust the on campus food. My school has had norovirus outbreaks once a year every year I've been there. Dont trust the on campus food. \n\nDorm rooms in their natural state are depressing little pits of despair, make sure you make that room feel home. Add posters, art prints, lamps, plants, photos wherever it takes so your room feels more like home\n\n(All this is just based on my experience yours might be completely different. Good luck and stay safe!)",
