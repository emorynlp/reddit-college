  "text": " I had an exam for a company a few days ago and gave it at 1 am. The test was video proctored and tab switching wasn't allowed. I completed the test after an hour. Took 8 submissions to solve one of the questions. Study a bit more and then go to sleep. Wake up. Go to the hospital with my dad to get his x-rays and prescriptions for an injured ankle. Then went for my DL test directly from there. 10km away from my home. I check my phone at 11:35 am and see I've got an interview from the same company scheduled at 12:00 pm. The email was sent at around 10:45 am. I saw it late. As soon as I saw it, I asked the Placement cell for a postponement of my interview by an hour. Sent multiple emails. They didn't listen to my reschedule and instead cancelled the interview.\n\nNow I accepted it because I had no other choice. I did protest a lot. But they didn't listen. Then at 1:30 pm, I get an email from my college's placement cell that I've been banned from the next 3 companies for refusing to give the interview at the last minute. I send them an email explaining what transpired. Sent them my father's X-rays with the date, timestamp, and name of my father present. My parents talked to the officer and requested them to listen and understand the situation and be humane and reasonable. But, they didn't listen.\n\nThe thing is that I already have an offer of 7.5LPA. I can only sit for companies that offer more than 12LPA. Thus, my options are already limited. And this just threw a huge wrench in the plans as the companies I missed out on were hiring people exactly with the same profile as mine with proficiency in Java and Spring boot a must.\n\nI just really hate my college's placement officer. They aren't human and are playing with a child's future. All they care about is percentages as they did tell my mother what will I do with another offer. And then there is the case of double standards. A girl earlier in the year faced a similar situation. But, they let her go and didn't punish her. And here I'm being punished quite unfairly I feel. Look, I admit I'm to blame here as well. But my fuck up wasn't this big. I had very valid reasons and I did attach all the proof I could. Yet, they didn't listen. It sucks :3. They even lied to my parents saying I refused at the last minute. My father just asked them if a student stays up late in the night just to give an exam and has studied hard for it, why would he not want to give the interview for the same? They had no answer. The college lacked professionalism as well, as students should get a buffer time of at least 2.5 hours before an interview is scheduled. \n\nTL;DR: Couldn't give an interview for very valid reasons and the college refused to co-operate to reschedule. Instead, they banned me from the next 3 companies and were lying to my parents.",
