  "title:": "My work was plagiarized by two other students in my class",
  "text": "In the one online class I\u2019m in, we have a discussion board where we had to respond to prompts weekly. I completed all of these assignments on time. Two students who have completed them weeks later plagiarized by copy-and-pasting a sentence or two from the paragraph that I wrote and either submitting it verbatim or changing a few words here or there. One of them did it at least four times while the other did it once. I only realized because I saw that I had a comment for my response to the prompt from three weeks ago\u2014it was the one who has done this multiple times, who copy-and-pasted one of the sentences and must\u2019ve accidentally posted it as a comment to me (he also submitted this as his response for that prompt).\n\nNo, I do not see this as a form of flattery. I\u2019m actually pretty peeved. I put a good amount of effort into these responses, and I don\u2019t like the fact that others who couldn\u2019t do their own work in a timely manner have decided to mooch off of that. It\u2019s pretty clear that these aren\u2019t their words anyway\u2014I write in a pretty distinctive way\u2014, but I took screenshots and you can see how some of them are literally identical to what I posted before. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can find for students who had their work plagiarized in my code of conduct, and the library only referred me to the part for students seeking grievances against professors\u2019 accusations of academic dishonesty. Other than going straight to the professor or confronting the students themselves, I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nI\u2019m so annoyed. Just do your own fucking work, it\u2019s not that hard. But if you\u2019re going to cheat, at least try to be somewhat clever about it\u2014that means not just lazily copy-and-pasting.",

      "text": "I feel you. This happened to me before\u2026 and I was the one accused of plagiarizing, when in reality, my professor didn\u2019t double check who posted first. I was soooo angry. Luckily, she quickly corrected it once I brought it up to her. Definitely tell your professor and see if they can do something about it. Maybe they can make the threads so that students can\u2019t see other threads until after they post. A few of my other online courses did that and it definitely prevented plagiarism from occurring. They also made it so that you can\u2019t edit or delete your thread. Good luck!",

They took everything I said including the same corny joke I put in it but changed a few words. \n\nWorst part? I was one of the first to post, they were like the 4th or 5th.",
