  "text": "I used to go to USC, University of Southern California, for film, now I am going to USF, University of South Florida, for economics. I am not really that excited about going to my new school. I feel a lot of regret about failing classes when I was at USC and I often think about what I would be doing if I got that film degree.",

      "text": "do what is good for YOU and not what is good for your ego. the best advice i\u2019ve ever been given. life is too short to regret.\n\n(i promise you this is not to brag or sound entitled at all!!! i am very very grateful for my achievements and opportunities!!!) \ni declined offers to three top 10 schools because i felt as though i would do better academically and grow as a person more at the school i go to now. everyone called me crazy for doing that and i still feel major regret when i see people at those schools getting so much praise for being so smart when i know that could\u2019ve been me being praised. but at the end of the day i\u2019m gonna come out on the other end just fine and life will take me on the right path. trust your gut and your instincts. it\u2019s better to thrive at a \u201cworse\u201d school (but still a good school btw) than fail at a top school. you are going to be so so successful \u2014 don\u2019t look back and i promise it will be okay.",
