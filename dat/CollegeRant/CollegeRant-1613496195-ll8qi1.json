  "text": "So I\u2019m in a class where the professor, while a nice person, is doing the absolute bare minimum. He doesn\u2019t have slides, takes forums down, doesn\u2019t record lectures, and talks in circles. Our class put an email together asking whether he could do any of these things and he refused. Naturally, a lot of us took to the group me to vent our frustrations. Then in come two of the class suck ups like \u201cwell guys, this is an upper level class! It\u2019s going to be hard! Stop BASHING the prof!\u201d And another came in like \u201cit was easy for ME to get help on my own time, don\u2019t be meeeean\u201d\n\nThey completely missed the point...We took the class at that time because it was at THAT time. None of us have time to chase him down. Also, I think we are justified in being a bit concerned that the class we are paying for is not really delivering on anything. Just like, WHY be a suck up? He\u2019s never going to see it, where will it get you? Do you just have to feel like you have some moral high ground? GRRRR",

Idk what those students are like but I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re also just there to get that A and move on from the class just like everyone else is. IF you and your peers truly think that the professor isn\u2019t doing something right then you all should consider going straight to the department chair or the dean. It\u2019s one thing when a dept chair/dean deals with one student\u2019s worries, but it\u2019s a completely different thing when a whole group voices their concerns. Maybe there\u2019s students of the same professor in different classes who have the same concerns as you all do and they haven\u2019t thought about saying something. That\u2019s just my two cents.",

      "text": "It's not always about being a suck-up, though I don't know these two so maybe they really are like that.\n\nSome people (coughMEcough) are too sensitive for this world (empaths?) and don't like hearing other people being trashed without them having the chance to defend themselves. For me it comes with living with *very* negative people who think they're better than anyone and talk so much shit about other people it gets difficult to listen to, no matter who they bash. sometimes it gets so uncomfortable and makes me feel so bad for the other side I'm just like \"OMG SHUT UP ALEARDY\" and start defending the other side even if I don't know them at all. I believe it's a Devil's Advocate mindset? at this point, not defending that person will feel like I'm betraying my own morals and to be honest, negative people who talk shit about others all the time piss me off. I'm guessing a whole class bashing one guy triggered guilt or something in these two suck ups. \n\nI'm not arguing, I'm just offering my input on why I might ever defend a professor in whatever circumstances.\n\nThat being said, i'm not beyond bashing professors. There's a couple in my collage I'll be the first to bash, mainly because they offended me on a *personal* level... and yeah my entire class hates them. you won't find ONE student in the entire college who had them that would defend them. It's that bad. And they're Tenure. These two students of yours are completely wrong though: Just cause one of them understood the stuff doesn't mean everyone else did. and, NO, high level class doesn't mean it can't have fucking slides (?!) Your professor is either lazy or doesn't understand tech. and what the hell is \"takes forums down\"?? does he *want* to being bombarded with individual emails? because that's what it sound like. That goes beyond the bare minimum, it's just being lazy and not giving a shit.",

Just part of being a student. Always has been.\n\nESPECIALLY for an upper-level class.\n\nProfessors are not obligated to have slides. Whether they use a whiteboard or lecture without visuals, professors deserve to teach in the format they feel is best.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like the other students are \"sucking up\". It sounds like they are sick of listening to you complain.\n\ncan't speak to the other issues you are having, but as a TA (and upper-level student) I am getting really sick of the entitlement that students have with online classes. And yes I mean entitlement separate from the very real difficulties and issues we are all facing from the pandemic. Downvote me to hell, idc, some of you guys need to grow up",

We are paying thousands of dollars for this class only to have a prof talk in circles (he does not organize his thoughts AT ALL, it\u2019s just stream of consciousness basically). I do the readings and email him when I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on but I can\u2019t do that to understand an entire class. He is being paid to teach and while I\u2019m sympathetic if he has a lot going on rn (who doesn\u2019t) taking the time to just hit the record button at a minimum won\u2019t impact his life much.

Quizlet, clegg, slader, etc. are heavily monitored. academic integrity is a priority here. \n\nAnd, in general, It is important (just as a human being) to be able to take constructive criticism and adjust accordingly. However I think a lot of students forget that many professors have a minimum average grade for each course, at least at my university. If they are hitting that GPA target, the department is satisfied. Professors can only control so much beyond the admin\u2019s guidelines. I work for a professor who recently got tenure. Before, they had to consciously make their tests more difficult to keep their avg GPA down. Now that they have tenure, they are actually making the class much easier and providing significantly more resources. \n\nThis does differ from uni to uni of course, and the difficulty arises when you have a tenured prof who does not gaf. The tenure structure sucks. I think we can all agree on that.",

If you're doing well and unaffected that's fine but being so unaware of how some things don't translate to some people (or in this case, the whole class) shows low emotional intelligence. I feel bad. When they get a shitty professor they'll pro think that they're just the stupid one and not realize that they're being screwed over",

That\u2019s not the same as respect. I respect my prof but he is definitely being inconsiderate to his students. And if respectfully requesting more support and privately venting our frustrations with the class constitutes \u201cbashing\u201d to these people....yikes",

If there are like 25/30 students complaint about the  curriculum, it should not go unheard or be ignored. Two or 3 people getting it doesn\u2019t justify why everyone else isn\u2019t.\n\nPeople like that aren\u2019t good when it comes to compromise because they just settle for whatever and try to go along with it. The sad thing is instead of trying to sympathize and offer help they patronize acting as if the majority is in the wrong. Are they sleeping with him ?
