  "text": "Man, how time flies. I just got home and reality hasn\u2019t hit me yet that I\u2019m done with school. It feels like I\u2019m only on Christmas break and I have to get ready for next semester when that\u2019s not gonna be the case anymore. \n\nLooking back at pictures and memories and journal entries, I can\u2019t stress enough how much college kids should cherish their experience. Even if you had an awful time in college, just cherish any good moment. I know the real world is not gonna be a nice place and while I\u2019d rather not go back to school (at least for a little bit) I would go back for the experience hands down. \n\nThis chapter of my life really has been the best. I\u2019ve learned so much, matured, made mistakes, tried a multitude of new things and so on. If I could go back and relive this entire experience, I really would. \n\nI promise you, you\u2019re gonna move on campus as a freshman, blink, and then BAM you\u2019re already a senior. It\u2019s crazy how fast this went by. Nonetheless, it\u2019s gonna feel really good not having to come down and do homework or study or anything. It\u2019s going to be VERY strange because i\u2019ve been so used to this routine my entire life. I\u2019m gonna come home and have nothing to do, hopefully I can get back into old hobbies I used to love such as reading. \n\nAll in all, this is very bittersweet. I\u2019ve made some lifelong friends and hopefully this new journey will take me somewhere great. Happy holidays and everyone enjoy your winter break! You\u2019re all going to slay your spring semester and I wish you all nothing but the best \u2764\ufe0f",
