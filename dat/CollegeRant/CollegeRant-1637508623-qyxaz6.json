  "text": "I really don't have too much more to say. The fact that paper/space is being used for 3-4 lines of text feels ridiculous. That could easily be added to the first page of the paper, but I get this impression that they don't want those few lines \"wasted\" on your name, assignment name, etc. They want to make sure to squeeze every possible word and minute out of you to justify why you are paying so much. Maybe I'm just frustrated \ud83d\ude44",

I am not in an academically heavy course the way a lot of people here are (I am getting a Medical Billing Coding and Health Administration Cert) so sometimes it can feel silly for me to have to present my research this way. I just don't feel like I \"researched\" much of anything. I Googled a whole lot though \ud83d\ude02. But for a resume I can also see why a cover sheet would be needed!",
