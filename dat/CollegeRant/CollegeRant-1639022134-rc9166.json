  "title:": "My Professor hasn't had class in 4 weeks, but has the nerve to assigned 4 major assignment before the final.",
  "text": "Good god.\n\nThis is by far the worst class I've ever taken. This professor canceled our class for 4 weeks now (only our class keep in mind) won't respond to emails, or when he does, offers the most condescending feedback I've ever seen. Did I mention he's a harsh grader for no damn reason? Oops forgot to indent a paragraph? 0 for the whole assignment! My man is nuts, a true madlad of the chaotic order. Thinks it's fine give us 4, 100 point assignments (with no clear rubric) before the \"performative final\" that, and I quote, \"won't be meeting for\".\n\nHe once gave us a \"practice assignment\" for a later project that forced us to use an outdated software. No big deal, everyone and their grandparents can use Window Movie Maker. Only when it came time to do that project we did the practice assignment for, SURPRISE! You can only use Adobe Sparks!\n\nWhat?? Do I look like I can afford Adobe? Why couldn't we use the software THAT WE PRACTED ON?? \"Schools often use the latest software, so you'll need to get used to it\" OKAY, SO WHY DIDN'T WE PRACTICE WITH SPARKS TO BEGIN WITH? \"Not everyone has bought the program, but you should since you're going to become future educators\". Amazing logic from yours truly. Got 20 points taken off because he didn't like the music I used (despite saying we had have artistic liberties ((((: )\n\nImagine having the BALLS to be a shitty professor in an education major. WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG, BUDDY! WE GET GRADED ON IT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Shitty professor abandoned the class, but not before giving us some cryptic ass projects ",
