  "text": "I have failed Chemistry 2 times now and I didn't learn a thing about programming so far in college. Everything I have learned is me building shit, creating projects and talking to people on internet. College has taught me nothing so far. Only thing I have gained is the knowledge of how much I hate chemistry. And it is required for me to get the degree for some reason.",
