  "text": "Anyone else get extremely nervous when submitting an essay online? That anti-plagiarism program always scares me. Even if I know I did everything right I always worry I\u2019m going to get an email and then the cops are at my door. Ik thats not how it works but its still nerve wracking. I wish we could still hand in papers in person because if I did make a mistake my professor would see it and ask me about it. But now there\u2019s that extra step of RED ALERT RED ALERT PLAGIARISM DETECTED. I\u2019m not saying the program shouldn\u2019t be there, it just makes remote learning that much more stressful",
