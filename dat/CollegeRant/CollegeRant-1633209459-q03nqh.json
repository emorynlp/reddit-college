  "text": "We\u2019re geographically isolated, required to live on campus with a meal plan. Getting off campus to eat is difficult and expensive so as you might imagine we all use our meal plans. The dinner hall food is often undercooked or something is usually wrong with it. So many of us are continually ill. It\u2019s been a huge issue for years at the school and admin doesn\u2019t fix it. That is all.",
