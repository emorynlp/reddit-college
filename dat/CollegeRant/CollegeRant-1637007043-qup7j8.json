  "title:": "Worst semester ever due to incompetent professors",
  "text": "Since rate my professor only gives you 120 characters to describe how awful your professors are, I decided to take out all my anger on Reddit. My apologies. \n\nI\u2019m in my second to last semester and will be graduating Spring of 2022. I\u2019ve never had a problem with professors like this before, and Ive always had a least 2-3 favorites out of 5 each semester. However, this semester it seems like I got every worst professor at my school. Firstly, my microeconomics professor is terrible. This class is 100% online with no meeting so we just get assigned weekly work. He was extremely confusing in the beginning, had no clear due dates, had weekly modules but would change the dates without notifying, doesn\u2019t communicate over email at all so I almost missed the midterm cause I had no idea it was posted on Blackboard. He sent out an angry announcement to the entire class threatening that some people will fail cause \u201csome of you\u201d turned in the quiz late. He wasn\u2019t specific at all and it made everyone in the class panic. There\u2019s been a few weeks where I would check for the weekly assignments on Monday Tuesday or Wednesday and nothing would be posted until late on Thursday or Friday with no announcements and they would still be expected to be turned in that Sunday (weekly work was due every Sunday). And that\u2019s just one of my professors. \n\nMy marketing professor quite literally has two brain cells. Her class is also 100% online with weekly work and this has got to be one of the most confusing classes I\u2019ve ever taken. Very similar to the previous Professor I discussed, she was unclear on due dates. She formatted the syllabus into an interactive PowerPoint which made it very difficult to quickly find important information about the course. She would randomly move due dates around, was horrible with communication. And on top of this, her workload for a 200 level class is insane. It\u2019s easy work, just very long and tedious. Here\u2019s a weekly example: \n 2 hour long reading + questions \nChapter homework \nChapter quiz \n4-5 videos to watch + questions \nJournal entry \nAnd this was only PER chapter. Sometimes she would have 2 chapters due within the same week. We now have to also post weekly flipgrid videos responding to a discussion question that the STUDENTS have to make up. She also now randomly posts lectures but they are optional thank the Lord. One student actually called her out over email and cc\u2019d the dean of the university but I don\u2019t think anything was done. \n\nThis next Professor creates a type of rage in me I\u2019ve never felt before for another human being. She\u2019s very clueless but also an extreme hardo and so anal when it comes to the technicality of an assignment. I got 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s on assignments I completely understood, I just formatted them wrong. What makes it worse is that this is a ONE CREDIT COURSE. It\u2019s supposed to be a lab for accounting. As far as my regular accouting class I\u2019m doing great; got a 100 on the last exam and love the professor (the only one I like and respect). However in order to pass regular accounting I need to pass this extra 1 hour lab practice with this menace of a professor. She doesn\u2019t even teach during the one hour we have her, she assigns weekly work that is impossible to do without asking help from a peer leader. If you miss one assignment she fails you for the course, and since this is a pass/no pass if you get below a 70 you fail. I currently have a 73 in the class and over the weekend she sent me a warning email basically saying that I may not pass the course. Pretty bold of her to say since she has yet to even teach one lecture. I\u2019m seriously considering going to the dean about her. Today I overheard her talking with a student from a different class and from what I could hear I guess the student missed an exam due to a sudden emergency and he was trying to work with her to figure out how he can make up this exam. She basically said she doesn\u2019t do make up exams and he asked if he was getting a zero and she was just dancing in  circles around his question basically answering like a politician. I feel so bad for him. She said in order to conduct a make up exam she would need something in writing from the University. F$!k you!\n\nThis next Professor isn\u2019t too bad, his methods of teaching is just terrible. He\u2019s a nice and chill guy, but treats his college students like middle schoolers. 20% of the class is him lecturing, but the other 80% of the class is being put into small groups to answer a discussion question together and come up with solutions. However, these discussion questions are a complete joke. One question asked which five items we would bring to a deserted island, and another one asked us how to make the workplace more diverse. Just a very simple minded questions that fifth graders could answer. He gives out three quizzes a semester and they are all based on the text book and don\u2019t relate to anything we do in class, so unless you memorize the textbook it\u2019s very hard to get a good grade on those quizzes. A few months ago we had a written assignment where we had to take a quiz to see how compatible we are to work in management and the paper was very subjective/reflective and purely opinion based. Even though I followed all the criteria, exceeded the word requirement, and had no grammar mistakes I got an 87. I emailed him asking why I received an 87 for a subjective/opinion based paper especially since I followed all the criteria and he emailed me back apologizing and gave me a 92 instead. Even though I\u2019m very appreciative of him changing my grade I still don\u2019t understand why I lost points for and I honestly think I should\u2019ve gotten a 100. Again he\u2019s a very nice and chill guy but you don\u2019t learn a thing in his class.\n\nThis last professor just makes me question how some people passed grade. He was so insanely strict about masks that he Took 10 minutes out of the first day of class to demonstrate how to properly drink from a water bottle while wearing one. Like are we serious? He would call people out immediately if someone\u2019s mask accidentally slipped under their nose. The worst part is that he didn\u2019t use blackboard to post assignments and course content. He made us buy a whole separate website where he said he posted all course materials. Halfway through the semester we\u2019ve yet to receive one assignment and every single class which was an hour and 15 minutes was just him rambling and rambling on about the same things that we already learned. Yes not having any assignments was nice, but if I paid $100 for a whole separate website at least make it worth it. I actually withdrew from this class a few weeks ago because it was so effing pointless and a waste of time and money. \n\nTL;DR my professors this semester are the worst of the worst and I go into detail of what makes them so awful.",

The student failed to follow procedure or chain of command. These kind of E-mails result in professors having a meeting and basically saying, \"Look, this student doesn't know what they're talking about. Just do this to make them be quiet and go away.\"",
