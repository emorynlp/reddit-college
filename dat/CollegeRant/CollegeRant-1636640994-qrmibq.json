It's ridiculous. If I'm able to express myself in less than 1,000 words then what's the problem \n\nTL;DR word count bad",

Rarely a page.\n\nIt was a joke. \n\nTo me, the word count isn't supposed to be specific, but instead, it's to give the student a general idea of how much detail to go into, how much support to utilize, and a general idea of what is expected. It's not something I literally go in and check. \n\nBut submit a paragraph and I WILL dock some points. :)",
