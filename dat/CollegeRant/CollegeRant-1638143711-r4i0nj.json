  "text": "Isn\u2019t the point of breaks supposed to be that we get to recharge from all the studying and whatnot?\n\nWhy do professors think we have all the free time in the world? Because I honestly don\u2019t. I worked all day Black Friday and yesterday. I\u2019m fucking tired. I\u2019m constantly doing work when I\u2019m not at work and even when I\u2019m on my lunch I\u2019m doing homework. I\u2019m fucking tired and constantly on the verge of cracking. I have an exam, modules, discussion boards, and a two page paper. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m tired and want a proper fucking break.\n\nFUCK PROFESSORS WHO DO THIS.",

Im tired man im just trying not to kill myself.\n\nI decided to actually take a semi break thanksgiving because I haven't been feeling well and im regretting it terribly because we have a final exam due the MONDAY after break and im rushing to complete it.",

I feel like my brain gets fried any time I try to to work on the Internet or at home. Its so, so damn frustrating. Its like one of those dreams where bad stuff is going on but you can't move. Sucks because you feel guilty and you know its going to hurt you later, but you still can't do it.",

I dont know where I heard this but someone mentioned how our online connection to our schools let homework and assignments follow us home which is very true. Many of my assignments have been due the night before class at 12am and ON THE WEEKENDS, so i cant even count on them to get ahead or catch up.",

One of my music major friends who\u2019s a 5th year senior (she transferred from community college in 2019) says it\u2019s like double-majoring. I find myself spending long hours on homework because I have not only music classes that are important but also the required Gen-Ed classes (like Intro to US History this semester). I\u2019m probably going to change my major to political science or psychology or art and maybe just do music on the side here and there (like play my clarinet in my free time and as a hobby).",
