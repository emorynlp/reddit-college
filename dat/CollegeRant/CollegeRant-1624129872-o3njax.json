  "text": "I'm a very hardworking student and my professors can tell you that but I've always struggled with my gardes. I'm a B/C student at most sometimes a D. I've even failed some courses. I really realllly want to become an A student and try and get my gpa to atleast a 3.0 especially since I'm graduting next year so I've been stressing out about that because it's been literally impossible.\n\nI've tried every method of studying, every tip and trick in the book to find what fits me but none of them seem to work. I'm tired of people thinking that I'm a neglectful student when all I do is work my ass off.\n\nI've finally found out my problem, it's that I'm not a good test taker and I keep trying to explain that to my professors since they're always on me about how my grades don't match my work in class. \n\nI think it's time that we acknowledge the fact that some of us aren't good test takers therefore our grades don't reflect our true abilities. Every student has a way of being assessed that can show what they're capable of whether it be through giving a presentation, writing an assignment, volunteering, or being tested and so on.",
