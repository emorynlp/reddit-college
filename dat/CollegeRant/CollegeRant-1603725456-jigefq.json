  "text": "Has anyone else had a really rough time staying motivated this semester? Normally i\u2019m pretty motivated. I always make A\u2019s or B\u2019s depending on how hard I study. Never missed an assignment, attended every lecture, and enjoy school for the most part. But for some reason with all of my classes online (i\u2019ve taken one over the summer before), I can\u2019t get myself to hardly do anything. I procrastinate beyond belief, attend maybe one of my zoom classes every other week, and don\u2019t study. I\u2019ve missed a couple assignments and push everything out until the day before the due dates and then do my assignments all at once. this has made it really hard for me and i know it\u2019s my fault in the end but I cannot find a single bit of motivation to even change it. I feel like i\u2019ve completely given up on trying to learn anything this semester. has anyone else been experiencing something similar? currently i\u2019m taking 13 hrs, i\u2019m thinking of cutting down to 6 next semester with it being online as well. any tips on how you get yourself motivated to do your work?",

The schedule keeps me accountable and in btwn classes I would go to the library and crank hw out. The separation of entertainment space (my bedroom) and study space (library) really really helped me stay on track. Not only that but the social expectation to do hw like when all your friends are getting their stuff  done you feel left out if you're a mess so I'd keep up. This semester went out the window. I don't even care at this point I cheat on everything and at the least I'll take some notes and feel accomplished. Add a tik tok addiction and... well it feels hopeless. Not only that but I work full time and stay up till like 4am every day bc that's when the world is at peace and I'm a night owl. I started with 18 credits but I'mma drop 2 classes to have 14 credits because just \u2728no\u2728. I don't wanna. I'm so tired all the time I don't want to do anything. So excited for the semester to be over. When I talk to my friends they feel the same (not as extreme but defs a huge lack of motivation). I think we are all struggling rn \ud83d\ude14 good luck sis the future is bright.",

      "text": "I'm going easy on myself and taking one class, but the class is pretty hard and I too get distracted easily. The best advice I can give is to set goals for yourself. If you're on Reddit all the time, give yourself the motivation of allowing yourself to go on Reddit after you get so much homework done.\n\nI know it's hard to stay motivated when you'd rather be doing literally anything else, but I just set goals and push forward. I also give myself brain breaks and rewards for getting so much work done. (Ex: A snack to keep me up for a few more hours to continue working, a nap, an hour to play video games, etc.) However, when you take breaks, be mindful of how long of a break you're taking. From experience, I can say that taking too long of a break only makes things worse.\n\nJust make sure that while you do this you take care of yourself. Make sure you're up to par, getting well rested and staying healthy. Working yourself 'till you crash isn't going to help anyone. Just make sure to keep yourself on a schedule. I usually try to schedule a whole day where I don't do homework and just write, read, scroll through Reddit, or just catch up with friends.\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck!\n\nTL;DR: Set goals, boundaries, and schedules (including breaks) for yourself. When in doubt, keep moving forward.",

      "text": "The worst thing for me was that I was finally getting my shit together and starting to get motivated and mot pushing everything off until the last minute. But then (out of the blue), I started getting socks and was in a lot of pain, and it kept me up all night and then I\u2019d just pass out during the day from being so tired and in pain. But I couldn\u2019t do work during the night while I was up because any movement caused me immense pain. It got to the point where I was going to have to miss a test because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit in a desk for that long and wear a mask (when I went to the store for fifteen minutes to get a heating pad and biofreeze i threw up three times) during that entire time, I emailed my teacher and said I\u2019m going to have to miss the test today there\u2019s no way I can make it. He said in order to do that I\u2019d need a doctors note, so I went to the health clinic on campus to get one (expecting it to just be gas pain or something) but they realized it was something wrong with either my appendix or gall bladder and I had to go get a CT scan ASAP. So I did that and they realized that not only did I have an extremely inflamed/maybe infected (I don\u2019t remember at this point because of shock), that I also had a pretty big gallstone. So I was immediately admitted to the hospital, my parents came down that night (from 7hrs away) and I was told I would be having surgery the next morning. Before all this started (on Wednesday) I was preparing to write half-all of a paper and proof it and then turn it in later on Thursday. I was also going to study Thursday for my test (it was an essay test) and start prepping for the midterm I had for the class I was writing the essay for. Now it\u2019s about 23 days since my surgery, and I still haven\u2019t turned in my paper that was due the Thursday before (or finished it) or the midterm that was due the Thursday after. And every time I try to work on either of them I can only write a little bit before it becomes impossible to do anything. I\u2019m also unable to actually do any work in my apartment, but everything closes so early on campus that half the time there\u2019s no point in going there. I could go to my sorority house and work, which I like doing, but then it causes other (unrelated) issues.",

I know this online class stuff is really challenging for all sorts of reasons, but if you try these things, I think they'll help SO much.\n\n1. Maybe this one is more geared toward next quarter/semester, but you need to create what I call a \"master due date list.\" Sit down with each syllabus from each class, with something like Excel or GoogleSheets open. Go through each syllabus and put in the due date, etc. for each and every assignment for every class (all in the single document). Once you have this done, you can then sort it out by class, due date, etc. It takes an hour or so to do, but I can promise you it'll be the best investment of your time that you've ever imagined!\n2. To talk more about what you're feeling and saying right now, I know how hard it is to find any motivation, especially when you already feel behind, like you're struggling, etc. You need to set weekly to-do lists, all on a single sheet of paper (lots of templates online for free) and sort of plot or plan out your time each day, specific to what you want to do when to make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get everything done that needs to get done each week. \n\nI know it's hard right now, trust me. Just dig deep, try these things out and keep us posted! You've GOT this, just keep working!",
