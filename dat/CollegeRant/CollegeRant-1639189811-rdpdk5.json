  "title:": "What are you going to do with this education? and other smug questions",
  "text": "It's not a bad question depending on how it's asked and the context but my dad asked me this recently in the most condescending tone as if he's never talked to me in his life. I can't with this man.\n\nI mention I'm working on my grad school applications. He's like, you talk about grad school but what are you going to do with this education? What's your plan?\n\nA few points: I've described to him in detail many times since high school about my plans.  I'm an engineering major...so engineering is what I want to do with an engineering degree, to be brief.\n\nIt's such a thoughtless question on his part for so many reasons. I've explained in so much detail my career plans/ life goals. He's seen my work and projects. He has the gall to ask about my plans in that tone.\n\nHe'll also be like\n\n \"Why are you always doing homework?\" \n\n\"You must have so much free time now being remote. Bet it's so easy\"\n\n\"You made this with a team right, not on your own?\" \n\nTLDR: My dad says thoughtless things",
