  "text": "Hi everyone. So, I\u2019m currently an engineering student at a junior college and I\u2019m on my third year. I\u2019ve had a bunch of professors by now and I am just coming to realize that some professors facilitate life for their students while others are just DEDICATED to seeing students\u2019 semesters fall apart. I\u2019ve had no issues with any of my professors, except for two who I feel like they\u2019re the stereotypical \u201cbully professor\u201d  who intentionally sculpt their course so the maximum amount of students can fail their class. Let me clarify and explain.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking linear algebra, and my current professor is one those bully professors. I\u2019ll describe her. For exams, she makes us memorize theorems/formulas/concepts that aren\u2019t particularly easy to mentally absorb. I\u2019m talking about forgettable theorems/concepts/formulas that the entire class forgets about within 2 days after the exam because of how elaborate they are. Like, what\u2019s the point of memorizing these concepts if everyone will forget about them right away. Why not just allow us to use a formula sheet? It takes me about 5 hours (at the very minimum) to complete her weekly homework assignments which consist of about 35/40 problems (about 23/28 pages). 6/26 people passed the first exam (I was one of those 6) and 12/22 passed the second (I failed this one). No words of encouragement and she gave off a rather \u201cI\u2019m satisfied\u201d reaction when announcing these number to the class. Even smirked. Zoom exams with camera on, and she spies on everyone and let\u2019s us know by expanding our windows to the entire class as we\u2019re taking the exam. Someone asked about extra credit, she laughed. I think I\u2019m dropping her, it\u2019s not worth the mental burden.\n\nFor comparison , my calc 3 professor was an angel. Senior asian dude in his 50s. His exams were open notes, he would give us the entire day to work on the exam, and although he had a strong, slurry accent, his teaching style was superior than my current linear algebra professor who literally annotates from the itinerary that is given to professors with the messiest writing I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nIf I were to estimate, I would spend about 6 hours max a week studying when taking calc 3 and ended the semester with 106%. I still remember most if not all of the concepts that were covered in that course. As for my current semester, I spend about 13 hours a week minimum studying for my linear algebra class and I\u2019d be lucky to cling on to maybe a C-. And quite frankly, I forgot about the concepts we covered last week. Same thing happened the first time around taking calc 3. Miserable professor, I would spend so much time studying which wasn\u2019t representative of the letter grade I had.\n\nI believe that there should be optimized instructor evaluations. Because this only means that there are students out there who dedicate twice the amount of time working on the same classes that other students are taking but with different instructors and they still end up with lower grades at the end of the semester. \n\n\nTL;DR- there are miserable professors who deliberately make their student\u2019s lives sad and it\u2019s not fair because there are other nicer professors teaching the same courses. Which means that contrary to popular belief, the content of the course does not define a student\u2019s sanity but it\u2019s rather the professor who does.",

      "text": "Some colleges will offer end-of-semester evaluations for your professors. A professor at my university even got fired because of how bad she was with the workload and ineffective teaching methods, so her students shredded her on those reviews. \n\nIf your college does not offer this, just drop the f bomb on RateMyProfessor and save future students from going through what you went through. There\u2019s really not much you can do at this point, just make sure you carefully research your professors in the future. I am sorry that you are having a difficult time with your linear algebra professor, and I wish you the best of endurance for that class.",
