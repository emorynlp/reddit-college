  "text": "Obviously it's a lot easier to do than in a normal in-person class where you'll have the professor and TAs keeping an eye on you to ensure nothing nefarious is happening, but I'm talking about people who have always been honest with their work that are now stooping to cheating because of stress of the pandemic and the sudden shift to Zoom learning.\n\nPeople who are so afraid of getting a bad grade in a class or of their GPA dropping too much (and losing scholarships and academic opportunities) that now you find yourself skimming the textbook during what is supposed to be a closed-book exam. Or plugging your homework questions into a \"homework help\" site because you don't understand any of it.",

One person asked if it\u2019s closed source or if we can use resources for the exam at the end, this was the response: \u201cWill you have your phone or a device with you when you\u2019re out in the field?\u201d \u201cYeah, most likely.\u201d \u201cOk, then by that logic if you ever can\u2019t remember something or need a refresh on a concept, then it\u2019s just a quick Google search away isn\u2019t it? I would expect you guys to be resourceful considering we live in the modern era... so to answer your question, yes, you can use resources for your exam.\u201d",

      "text": "Well when teachers start recycling old questions that they didn't even create themselves..... what can you expect? \n\nMost of the issue with \"quizlet cheating\" comes from the fact that the question was from a textbook or some various website that has been in use for a few years at least. And honestly.... I can't feel sorry for professors because if you're charging hundreds of dollars to recycle questions you didn't write a student will recycle answers they didn't make. \n\nSome professors try to combat this by making the time limits more tight but all that does is incentivize cheating which they don't seem to realize.\n\nFurthermore a lot of professors are assigning more work than usual or making tests harder than usual which AGAIN DOES NOT DISUADE CHEATING, it encourages it! \n\nAnd finally so so many professors are just reading powerpoint slides. The \"I don't care\" attitude makes students not care either. And the worst is when the slides don't even cover the topic fully. So what do you do? You look elsewhere for help and in doing so you might consider looking for the solution while you're at it.\n\nI'd argue the way to disuade cheating is to write your own questions, teach what's needed, and include all the relevant information in the class material (don't just say \"read the textbook\").",

Unless you're on one of those lockdown browsers that specifically disables the ability to exit the test window, there's nothing to stop you from using the textbook PDF or google",

It\u2019s just that online college is uninteractive as well as overwhelming and most people aren\u2019t willing to put forth the effort, especially after being so mentally drained with the pandemic",

No student should have to feel so desperate that they resort to cheating because a test is so important for their grade. Tests should be nothing more than an indicator of a students understanding of the content, it should not even count for a grade let alone a majority of it. If i had my way, only homework- type assignments would be graded and i would want it to all be scored so people know what they did wrong. We pay 1000\u2019s of dollars for this shit, the least they could do is fucking try to teach us properly.",

The professor who runs it tells us that even when we're doing quizzes and exams, we're allowed to use the slides from his lectures and even Google. If we get stuck on the programming assignments, copy/paste the error code and talk to the TAs during the extra help meetings, classmates, and again Google it. \n\nHis logic is basically he doesn't care where we're getting the information, as long as in the end, we're getting the information that we need. Because that's how the real world works. In an actual job that Computer Science people have, you're not expected to know everything verbatim or never make mistakes. You're allowed and even encouraged to research and talk to other people to figure out how to solve issues and make things work.\n\nWe should be paying $$$$ to learn, not memorize",

A lot of the knowledge I learned is from googling, extensive research, and trying to implement things directly rather than memorizing arbitrary crap or reading from a book. Majority of the problems that you'll encounter are those that you cannot predict. Thus, the most important skill you can learn is not memorization, but the ability to research and adapt so you can better prepare yourself for unpredictable situations.\n\nObviously other majors are different, but I really don't understand the concept of tests in Computer Science if they are based on memorization. It seems your professor understands this and that is really good to hear.",

Even had a stats class where the teach both didn't provide a textbook and then told us to \"ask our fellow students if we had questions because he wasn't planning on being accessible throughout the quarter.\" Might be a shitty rationale but I've gotten to the point where asking quizlet for help occasionally isn't the worst thing... Though I do wish I felt like all this money I'm giving this college is worthwhile. I want to feel good about learning. Hell, I just want to learn. Is that too much to ask for at 8k a quarter??",
