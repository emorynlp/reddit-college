  "title:": "Might fail summer course that I really needed to pass",
  "text": "So I needed to take gen chem 2 over this summer, as it\u2019s a prereq for my new major that I just switched into. I attempted to take it spring of 2020 but ended up withdrawing and delaying it until summer. (This was a bad move). I decided to take it from a college near my parents house since I\u2019m staying with them for the summer. Unfortunately, to transfer credit to my actual school you need a C- or better in the course. I am terrible at chemistry and barely passed gen chem 1 my freshman year. I am almost done with the course and it does not look good for keeping a C in the class after the final exam. I am so upset with myself because not only did I need this course to transfer, but I had to pay for it separately as well. So it will be a waste of a couple thousand bucks in addition to a huge problem with some courses I need down the line. I will do my best on the final exam, but I have no idea what to do should I end up getting below a C. (I even briefly considered cheating but that will never sit right with me- can\u2019t bring myself to do it). I don\u2019t know how lenient my professors will be in terms of waiving a prereq if I don\u2019t have it, and I REALLY don\u2019t want to take this course again. It would be trying for a third time and I don\u2019t know if I can handle it. Has anyone been in this situation who could maybe offer some words of advice? I have no idea what to do. Thx",

I know the name is organic chemistry but if you search that name plus the type of questions you have he has tons of videos explaining and going through multiple practice problems! Good luck!",

Doing a lot of practice problems helps, but unfortunately I really don\u2019t have the time to go above and beyond. I am also working a summer job and struggling to keep up with the mandatory assignments. (The 2x a week lab section doesn\u2019t help either). I wish I could\u2019ve figured out better time management earlier in the course. It might be too late now",

Also is your last unit nuclear chemistry? That\u2019s literally the easiest unit I ever learned in chemistry. It\u2019s child\u2019s play, and most Gen chem classes end with it and it\u2019s a big boost to a lot of students grades. But like I said practice practice practice, chemistry involved INTENSIVE problem solving skills and if u don\u2019t practice itll bite u in the ass on exams.",
