  "title:": "What's the point of getting an art degree if the professors don't actually teach you how to prepare your resume/portfolio for the real world?",
  "text": "I got my art degree at the end of 2019 and I was always frustrated with my professors when I went because they didn't focus on any real-world applications or skillsets. I was one of 8 graduating students my last year and the only one to graduate in the winter, and they didn't focus on me or my journey as an artist in the slightest. It seemed like they only cared for the beginner's classes and once you became somewhat competent they just tossed you away and didn't care whether you were prepared for your field or not.\n\nIt's been almost two years now and I've been applying and building my portfolio like crazy but I still don't know some of the essential things that are needed for the path I chose within the department I spent almost $100k in debt to learn from. I took extensive notes and was at the top of my class and still i feel underprepared and looked over every time i apply somewhere. No one wants me or my skills, my portfolio, and it's eating me alive.\n\ni feel like i should have taken more from the schooling i paid for. like i got cheated somehow. it's truly frustrating not being able to do what i want to do.",

      "text": "So you have a bachelors degree, correct? It may just be time to hold off on your dreams of being an artist and just take up any professional job right now. I don\u2019t know much about art to be honest, but it seems like a very niche industry. Keep doing art on the side as a hobby, but right now you just need to put your degree to use and get any job",
