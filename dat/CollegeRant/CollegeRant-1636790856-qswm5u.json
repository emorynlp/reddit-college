  "text": "In high school, everyone is close to each other and is super friendly to you. People talk to you at lunch or whatever when it is clear you are sitting by yourself. In college, no one cares. Someone could get a heart attack in the middle of the day and no one would care. Everyone is so busy and occupied to the point where it is virtually impossible to befriend new people. It doesn't help that at the beginning in the school year, everyone just seemed to hanged out with their high school friends and stick with that group for the rest of the school year. It is just so frustrating when people say your social life gets better after high school when it doesn't.",

      "text": "It\u2019s honestly a very unique experience being in college right now. I was lucky enough to try one good year of college in before the pandemic hit and the social life was actually quite nice back then. For the first time in my life I felt able to choose my friends rather than making friends simply through the shared suffering of high school, and I was surrounded by peers who were more mature and treated me with a higher level of respect and tact.\n\nThere are certainly some colleges whose cultures have always been shitty but I think we\u2019re just unlucky to be attending college right now in the aftermath of a societal lockdown where everyone is still hesitant to reintegrate and we\u2019ve all kind of forgotten how to meet people. That said, I believe there is also a general trend of the college experience getting shittier over the decades as college education becomes more of a standard rather than a luxury, kind of like the airline industry, so the glamorous and inspiring image that the older generations have of college is not entirely accurate anymore and kind of sets one up for disappointment.",

The good news for this is you befriend men in your classes and for women, I'd recommend just approaching on campus. Never shit where you eat, meaning never mess with a woman that could be taking similar classes to you. Plus if you're in engineering (like me), meeting good looking women in those classes isnt gunna be a thing. At least for me, where I'm just looking to make guy friends and date casually. Those things have worked best for me. The biggest takeaway is to be proactive and don't be afraid to get to know new people. Two of my best friends I met in my first year (in class) and tons of women I've dated I randomly approached on campus. A disclaimer, the masks have made no discernible difference in my ability to make friends or meet new women",

Around spring of 2017, there was some random guy that randomly talking to me. Looking back, it was clear that he saw I was lonely and tried to socialize with me. However, I was extremely cynical, didn't want to be social, so I didn't really respond to him besides a bunch of nodding and shaking my head.\n\nAnd:\n\nI always remembered getting particularly angry towards the end of every high school year when I see other kids signing yearbooks with each other and talking while I sat on the side of the classroom glaring in their direction. I was jealous.\n\nAnd:\n\nA major downturn at this point of my life is when I started to get blocked from subs on Reddit for breaking the rules. This hurt me massively emotionally as Reddit is the site where I grew up learning social skills, social interactions, and the world in general. I was so sad, angry, and furious. It was also then where I learned harassment was when you keep talking to someone after being told to stop, which was what I did.",

One of the best pieces of advice I got in college was this (in regards to social life) \"If you eat at the school cafeteria, find a group  of people, ask if you can sit with them, and START TALKING. Even if it's small talk like weather, how classes are going, favorite subjects, etc.\" this way you're engaging other people and might make friends.\n\nAnother great way to make friends is join one or two clubs about a subject you really like (most colleges/universities have multiple clubs) and make friends that way. Join facebook groups dedicated to your college and see if you can make friends that way and/or find other social media groups connected to our college that way. A lot of schools also have discords now.\n\n**At the end of the day, socializing in college is COMPLETELY ON YOU. Talk to people in class. Go to a club event. Talk to people while walking to class. Talk to people in the cafeteria.** \n\nIn high school, you're forced to be around the same group of people for 6-8+ hours a day.",
