  "title:": "Is anyone else having a hard time getting the grades they used to get in math courses pre-pandemic?",
  "text": "Am I the only one struggling a lot with online math courses?\nI feel like I have to watch the lectures, read the book, study the slides, take detailed notes, and then watch several YouTube videos (same concept but explained by a different person) to feel like I properly grasp the concepts. Then, I would solve all suggested problem sets.\nAfter that, I managed to get a B- (ODE), C- (Calc3) and a NP in discrete structures :(. I found discrete especially annoying since 70% of each exam and all quizzes were MCQs! So in most cases I felt like I could have gotten AT LEAST half the grade had the questions not been MCQs.\n\nAlso, I won't hide the fact that my mental health was in shabbles throughout the semester. For example, I had a panic attack the night before the Calc final.\nMy GPA went from 3.86 to 3.7 this semester :( I'm applying to grad programs in economics and I'm worried that this semester would negatively affect my chances of getting into a good school. (I'm applying to unis in Europe).\n\nI know this was very long but I thought I would get this off my chest and see if others are going through the same thing.",

If your grades were great before, and you tanked a little during the pandemic, they won\u2019t think \u201coh this guy doesn\u2019t have the skills then\u201d, no they\u2019ll think \u201cwow this person kept themselves afloat during this pandemic while taking hard classes\u201d. If you bounce back once it is all over, it will be clear. You can also clarify what went wrong on your statement of purpose as well.",
