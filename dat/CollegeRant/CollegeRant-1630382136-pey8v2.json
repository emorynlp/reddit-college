  "title:": "Forced Summaries for Readings so they know you\u2019ve read.",
  "text": "I\u2019m senior in college and I\u2019m taking a 300 level Ancient Rome class which means it\u2019s just basically readings. Personally, I love the readings but I\u2019m really annoyed with the forced summaries we have to do after every reading. And my teacher said it\u2019s because she wants to know we read. I get that but I\u2019m paying thousands of dollars to not be treated like a child in middle school. Im here to learn. I\u2019ve taken latin for years and this level of Ancient Rome info is literally beginner course stuff so it\u2019s not that hard. \n\nIf students don\u2019t want to read, fine let them not. Then let them fail because they chose not to read. And let them pay to retake the course and maybe their ways will change. \n\nBecause as someone who always reads the books and comprehends the info by just reading ( bc I enjoy it and it often seems like that\u2019s the only time I actually learn anything), Im tired of the bullshit assignments that waste my time and make me dislike the readings bc I know I have to write a summary afterwards. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first class I\u2019ve had that\u2019s done it but I figured by senior year, it wouldn\u2019t be this way anymore.",

As a professor I imagine that\u2019s annoying so I think that is part of the reason for the readings. And if you read anyway, it\u2019s no big deal to you right?",

And this isn\u2019t an intro class but a 300 level so most students are beyond that. \n\nI\u2019m just more frustrated that as a senior, I thought I would be having more intellectual conversations and ideas to comprehend instead of just being told to write summaries on info.",
