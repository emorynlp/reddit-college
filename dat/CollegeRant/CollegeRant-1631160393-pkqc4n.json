  "text": "I started classes last week and I'm already feeling like I want to yeet myself out of the window! Most of my professors are wonderful and my current schedule could be better but I did what I could for what's available but! I hate the fact that \"sorry professor, if I leave my apartment today, I'm not sure I won't just throw myself into the river\" isn't a good reason to not come to class. I wish attendance wasn't graded! Sometimes my brain just sucks and I spend my time just sobbing, and I have broke down in the middle of class before *because my brain sucks*! I have bipolar disorder type 2 (diagnosed).\n\nI still can't focus but because I'm non traditionally aged, psychologists refuse to take me to test me for any learning disabilities (because my educational needs were just brushed aside as \"laziness\")! And it's not like I'm intentionally trying to miss classes, it's just I'm positive they'd be cleaning my body up from the cement.\n\nI dropped a required class because the professor said that we have to plan all family emergencies in advance and even then, that will count against us and she will drop us a letter grade! She also refused to use my preferred name and pronouns. Even if we get COVID, she expects us to show up!\n\nI just wish I could convey to my professors that I'm not dumb and that I'm trying. I'm terrified of reaching out to my professors because I'm scared of what their responses might be because academia doesn't seem very empathetic to mental illnesses or treating them as disabilities. Sure, they can put orange ribbons out during suicide awareness month and pretend they care by advertising their counseling services (expensive) but in the end, I wish there were better accommodations.",

      "text": "The professor you dropped is an asshole. It costs nothing to use someone's preferred pronouns and name. As for family emergencies,  her policy is beyond ridiculous. An emergency is an emergency for a reason. I hope someone reports her. \n\nI've always been on the fence about attendance being graded in college. We're paying for the class. May as well show up. But we're grown. If the work is getting done, not showing up a few times should be ok. In times like these, it shouldn't graded. We are in a pandemic. My professor gives us a number of crisis passes where we can turn in work late and not be penalized. She knows life happens, especially right now. More professors should be understanding and empathetic. \n\nYou should email your professors at the start of the semester to let them know. I've found professors are more understanding and accommodating if you let them know ahead of time things like that. Let them know you may need extra help or time. Thank them for being understanding. \n\nHave you talked to disability services? They may be able to help in your situation. It's worth a shot. \n\nI hope things get better for you, friend.",
