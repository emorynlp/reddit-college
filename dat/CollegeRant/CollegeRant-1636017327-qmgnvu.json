      "text": "At least for exams, a lot of people tend to cram, stay up late and study up until the last minute of the exam. The day before an exam, give yourself at least 6 hours of sleep if you can. Care/nurture yourself EXTRA the day of/before your exam too.  You\u2019re already so stressed/overwhelmed, the least you can do is care for yourself in the best way that you can. Before an exam, i would go early to class and pick the best seat for myself (setting is really important to me), try to relax, i would watch something funny, and have everything ready. I can\u2019t control how hard the test will be but i would try my best to control everything else.",

      "text": "I study the hell out of exams to the point where I can\u2019t anymore and just sleep. Other than that, I walk around my neighborhood to calm myself down, no music- just mentally revising. After, I drink tea and then go back to studying or grab a quick nap then study.\n\nFor project presentation, I drink coffee and pick up a \u2018let\u2019s get over this/fuck it\u2019 attitude. I still struggle with that honestly with my big fear of public speaking but it is what it is- you gotta do what you gotta do type of thinking. Imagining myself doing the presentation helps sometimes.\n\nListings thing help when there\u2019s a lot of things to do- I usually go through the closest due date first but depending on how big and important other projects are, I might make those as priorities. When things get overwhelming and when I do have time to spare, I always drink tea and then take a nap or clean my surrounding. Puts my mind at ease.",
