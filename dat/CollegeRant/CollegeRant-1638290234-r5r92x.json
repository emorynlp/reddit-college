  "text": "No way in hell I\u2019m going to do well on it. I honestly can\u2019t remember a single thing from this class especially now that I\u2019m grieving. She also won\u2019t let me take it virtually which would be so much better because then I could stay longer with my family. Bc of this test I have to leave four days earlier than everyone else. It\u2019s a history gen ed. I hate that I have to memorize information just to pass a stupid test. This isn\u2019t how I learn. It feels like such a waste anyway because I\u2019m not a history major and I\u2019ve already taken two history classes in college. I could easily learn this information online but instead I have to spend hundreds of dollars just for college credit. \n\nI\u2019m seriously thinking college isn\u2019t even fucking worth it. I\u2019m so exhausted. I\u2019m three years behind bc of mental illness & I\u2019m so tempted to just switch to nursing but even then they\u2019re expecting a BSN more and more. I\u2019m currently a mass communication major and I like my major classes but I honestly wouldn\u2019t be in school if all the jobs I\u2019m looking at (and internships) didn\u2019t require a degree. It all feels like a scam. I\u2019m so sad.",

              "text": "It could potentially help on the back end, but we have a lot of say in whether we will allow extensions or not. This means that she may not change things for you regardless. There may be good reasons for why taking the exam virtually is not permitted, as well. It\u2019s hard to say without more information.\n\nIf you were doing well in the course right up until this moment, you may also be able to work out an Incomplete, but policies on those are fairly strict, and they usually require that you be doing well and then have something catastrophic happen (death in the family applies at my university, but it might be different at yours). Doing this would require going through the formal channels, and you\u2019d still need the professor\u2019s approval most likely, but your chances of success are much better with formal documentation.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck!",

A professor *might* be more inclined to agree to that (assuming she is giving any other exams later in the week) since it doesn\u2019t require the logistics of a make-up exam.\n\nEdit: I hope you are finding solace being with your family during this difficult time.\n\nIf you won\u2019t be the one driving, borrow a pillow or two for the ride home.

The problem also is that I missed the entire final week of material + review (not posted online). Also that her second class has about 30 people stuffed in a small classroom as opposed to my class with about 10. I have agoraphobia and panic attacks so that is a bad idea for me. Unfortunately my professors aren\u2019t aware of that so it definitely just sounds like excuses.\n\nI have a call with disability services this morning but don\u2019t think anything will come from it.",

Being kind will get you what you want a lot faster than coming into it sounding angry. Let them know what is going on, let them know what your professor said, and ask them for some advice on what to do. Keep in mind that it is finals season and a lot of people lie saying their grandparent just died, it is a VERY common lie. If you\u2019re comfortable with it, offer some documentation of it so it is clear you are telling the truth. \n\nCollege is very trying, the entire time. There\u2019s almost always something that makes it more difficult than it needs to be. Keep your goals in mind while those difficult times are happening. That being said, you don\u2019t have to go to college if you don\u2019t want to. There are tons of trades and careers that require certifications that take much less time than a bachelors does. Do whatever will make you happy. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry your grandfather passed. If you need to talk to someone to work through that grief, your university probably offers some sort of therapy for situations like that.",
