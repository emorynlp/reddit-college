  "text": "I have been assigned to complete a group project for my STD class. Everyone gets the same grade, and we are all responsible for turning in the right assignment and checking to make sure it\u2019s correct. Personally, I hate group projects. It\u2019s my last semester before I graduate and the first time having a group project and I hate it. I don\u2019t believe someone else\u2019s work should determine my grade. I worked too damn hard for this degree. I have an \u201cA\u201d average all while dealing with family drama, giving birth three days before the start of a spring semester, dealing with COVID including me and my baby catching COVID, having a teen and dealing with teenage drama and getting him ready for adulthood. I am sleep deprived and still I manage to do all my work ahead of schedule and I would absolutely hate my hard work going down the drain because of a classmate. Does anyone else have experience with group projects and have advice? Thanks for the help and letting me rant!",

One groups is fantastic, responsible and communicative, the other one is shit.    \n\n\nMy advice...at the first sign you see someone lacking or not responding to your messages for days or weeks, try to reach them, if they are hard to get, contact your professor ASAP.  However, professors have different approach to group projects.  Some may ignore the fact that you have shitty team mates, while others will try to help you.  Either way, stay in communication with your group, take screenshots, send messages through the official college platform (AKA, Blackboard), create a Google document and share it with your team mates, and try to get as much evidence as possible (just in case).  \n\n\nSadly, must of the time you will do all the project by yourself, in that case just write your name on the doc.  If the others start complaining, show the evidence you have.  \n\n\nHope this help, and good luck.",

I get that working with other people is part of life, but I hate how my professors force it on us just for the sake of having one. \n\nLast term was a book club project where we got put in groups to read a certain novel, and at the end of the term we had a Zoom where we were supposed to talk about the book in great detail with our professor and anybody else that felt like observing. Out of the four people in my group, just me and one other person showed up for the Zoom and we had to carry the conversation. Luckily our professor was understanding. \n\nThis term I\u2019m in a psychology class in a group of four again. We have an essay and presentation over the different values of people based on their generation. We decided to split up the work so each person is focusing on one generation and we\u2019d post our notes in our group text. With about two weeks to presenting, I\u2019m the only one who has sent anything. Nothing but crickets. I\u2019m about to say screw it and write the essay myself. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but it needs to get done. \n\nI just hate depending on other people to pull their weight for my grade. I know I can count on myself to get things done, but your random classmates are such an unknown X factor.",

I just had an assignment and my 'partner' was only slowing me down.\n\nFirst of all u had to correctly determine a function which u will basically use in ALL of the next exercises. So if u got this wrong, everything will be wrong. He got it wrong. He didn't understand the theory at all and I noticed that he was just copying answers from homework exercises with similar questions (The ones asked in the assignment had additional conditions, and if u understood the theory, u would be able to adjust the answers).\n\nI was basically correcting his answers the whole time and then this guy even refused to accept some my answers (turned out to be correct) which were basically results that you could find IN THE HOMEWORK. And he didn't even know what to do either, so he did some  useless derivations (10 lines) and probably thought the more I write, the more points I get (My 1 line derivation was correct). In the end he told me he would include my answers. I didn't check because I was done with this guy and assignment (yeah I should have probably submitted it) Aaaand he didn't include my answer and left his own stupid derivation.\n\nIn the end 'we' got a 7, and he happily texted me: \"we got a 7!\". I immediately called him out and said my answers were right and he said: \" yeah i fucked up, sorry\". He literally contributed nothing, and only felt like changing his answers if my corrections made sense to his microbrain. \n\nI had another teamassignment in my previous year. I did everything there and he did nothing. I was basically explaining my answers to him and he had zero input for questions that I didn't answer yet. Though I honestly prefer that scenario since he is not slowing me down, but just mindlessly accepting my answers. \n\nTldr: I had a 'partner' that slowed me down and refused to accept my answers (he didn't even know what he did either, but he felt his answer were right). And I even prefer a 'partner' that does nothing and just accepts my answers.",

      "text": "It's your first time having a group project that close to college graduation? Lucky you lol. \n\nAnyway, I would say keep clear lines of communication. Texting is better than email because in today's day and age everyone is texting multiple times a day. Make sure everyone is aware of dates and times. If someone's not there, make sure they're made aware after the meeting is over. Confirmation is key because everyone needs to be on the same page. If someone looks like they're not doing the work, check in with them as soon as possible and get confirmation as to whether they're having a problem but can still continue, or, aren't going to do the work. Finally, I'd say that the group (or at least group leader) needs to establish a \"no later than date\" that gives the rest of the members time ahead of the deadline to pick up someone else's slack. So if the project is due December 11, that means that if one group member hasn't done anything by November 11, cut them off and start doing/ sharing the work between the other members. You'd have a month's cushion instead of reaching out to that lazy member 3 days before the project is due, then rushing to complete their section because it's last minute. Just my advice. \n\nYou're almost done and you won't have to worry about this BS ever again. Keep pushing.",

      "text": "So my feeling on group projects is that they can be fun, rewarding and productive IF a few things happen:\n\n1) it has to be an assignment that makes sense for a group to tackle - creative or big complicated projects are best.  Papers are the worst (unless it's the report part of the big, complicated project).\n\n2) There has to be an option to remove or ungrade non-contributing team members - and they need to know when they're about to be axed by teammates.  Similarly there has to be a mechanism for not rewarding the people who over-control and try to do the work for everyone.  Type A folks think that's the path to success when in fact the best leaders learn how to get great work out of their team, not just do it for them.  That means they need a few honest peer evals throughout the project, not just at the end. \n\n3) Teams need a conversation up front about what grade they expect and what the interim deadlines are - with an option for folks to skip to a different group if those goals don't line up.  Putting one \"expects an A and works early\" student with 3 \"fine with a C and works last minute\" students means the A student will end up doing everything because they can't leave it til the last minute and the C students will ghost bc why wouldn't you if this joker is willing to do all the work and you get the same grade? \n  (Although, if you have it set up so 1) and 2) are true there will be a last minute team implosion bc they'll realize too late one person can't do it all and they won't get the same grade).\n\n4) Big, complicated projects need a couple of formal check ins with the prof where everyone has go report in on what they've done / will do.  Nothing gets the slackers to either step up or drop the class faster than looking their prof in the eye to say \"still haven't done my part\". \n\nThe honest truth is 99% of group projects should not be group projects - the prof just wanted to grade 6 papers instead of 30.  So when that's the situation, just try to focus on 3), 4), and providing lots of feedback.  Basically communicate with your team and prof a teeny bit more than you think you need to.  Address problems IMMEDIATELY. And remember we all do a cost benefit analysis - If someone isn't performing the way you want consider their rewards/punishment calculus.  Typically slackers do what they do because they've learned they can get a better grade for less work when they let others cover for them.  Invite them in and make contributing the better option to coasting (how will depend on the person and the team but I've found carrots work better than sticks).",
