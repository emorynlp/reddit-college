  "text": "I haven\u2019t gotten a passing grade on a single midterm this semester out of the 4 I\u2019ve had. Just took another one the other day and although I studied hard before it and I felt like I knew everything I think I failed again anyway. There\u2019s always too many problems and not enough time to do them, so either I rush through the exam and fail because of all kinds of little boneheaded mistakes which screw up the answers, or I spend too long on each problem, run out of time and leave some of the exam blank (and sometimes both xD). I\u2019m not used to these closed book exams in-person when last year\u2019s Zoom University was usually way more relaxed with the resources you could use. My Calculus III professor doesn\u2019t even let us use a formula sheet. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s so much work it\u2019s hard to find time to study beforehand outside of just doing the homework. To be honest I don\u2019t really have good study/note-taking/time management skills either because in HS I barely had to lift a finger to get good grades and this is my first time on campus. I feel like I\u2019m slowly getting better with those things but idk if I\u2019ll be able to get through all these classes or if my good gpa will survive this. Most of us \u201cfreshmores\u201d seem to be in the same boat because the class averages haven\u2019t been good either. One of my classes had a solid 75% of the class (including me) get under a C on the first exam.",
