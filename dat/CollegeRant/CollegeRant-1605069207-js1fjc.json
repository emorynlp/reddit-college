It seems that I am not the only one having trouble with courses. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I have not passed any of my three exams in a single course. It's a financial accounting course, and it's the most difficult course I've come across. If you're curious on my grades of these three exams...\n\nExam 1: 48%. Exam 2: 35%. Exam 3: 49%. Exam 3 just happened yesterday and I studied so damn hard on that one, just to have it flop like that.\n\nI won't lie, I kinda entered a depressed state upon receiving my grade. This may be the first time I may fail a course. And it hurts. A lot. Especially since I spent so much time on Exam 3.",

No one cares though, the only possible cause of illness nowadays is this bullshit virus. If you don't have it, in the eyes of everyone else, you're completely healthy. Even if you have completely died inside and are extremely suicidal you're still healthy in the eyes of everyone else. Its disgusting.",
