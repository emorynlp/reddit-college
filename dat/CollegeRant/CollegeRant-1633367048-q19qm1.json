  "text": "My chemistry teacher is a mess.\n\nIf you ask her a question, she simply doesn\u2019t give you the answer you\u2019re looking for. She points at definitions or tables and stares at you like you\u2019re stupid and should understand. I ask questions often because she\u2019s so bad at teaching and I\u2019m desperate for clarification, but she only makes me more confused because she is completely incapable of understanding or answering your questions. And it doesn\u2019t help that she moves so fast that there\u2019s no time to take notes and she gets annoyed if you ask her to slow down.\n\nHer degree is in biology. She\u2019s teaching chemistry without a solid, in-depth knowledge of the subject. This is a 101 class and sometimes she\u2019ll have to take time and stare at the powerpoint slide so she can understand, and sometimes she\u2019ll skip over something saying \u201cWell I don\u2019t quite understand that, so we\u2019ll move on\u201d. If you\u2019re the fucking teacher, you should *never, EVER* say you don\u2019t understand something and just move on. \n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m paying for this class. I feel so angry and ripped off. I am terrible with chemistry, but I need it for my degree, so I need this intro class to be clear and thorough. As a class *should* be. But no. I have to go in the library for hours to teach myself the material. I sit down with the powerpoint and the textbook and teach myself fucking everything. Nothing in class makes sense because she\u2019s so bad at teaching, I\u2019m only going because attendance is mandatory but I\u2019m so fucking mad about it.\n\nI feel like I deserve to be in a different class or something and to get the most of the money I\u2018m putting into my education. I\u2019m being scammed. At this point I am certain that if I just taught myself everything from the book and never went to class, I would be more successful.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no way to get a refund because colleges are stingy as shit, but I have never been so mad about where my money has gone. Absolute waste.\n\nAll I can really do is write a strongly worded review on RateMyProfessors.",

Thats what they are there for and hopefully will keep it anonymous but they will forward your email along so don't identify yourself through your concerns. Like they redact your name but they wont redact your unique actions so your teacher may identify you through it. I suggest emailing your fellow classmates to collaborate.",

Sorry you're dealing with this OP. If there's one thing I despise, as a student, it's a professor who gives zero shits about his/her job. I don't understand how these schools have such a garbage hiring process. \n\n>There\u2019s probably no way to get a refund because colleges are stingy as shit\n\nThere's typically a deadline where students can drop a class for a full refund. This is usually two months after the start date. For example, my college's fall semester start date was 8/20. The deadline to withdraw for a full refund is 10/23. Are you sure your school doesn't have something like this because if it does then you can drop the class and get your refund but at the cost of a grade of W. \n\n>All I can really do is write a strongly worded review on RateMyProfessors.\n\nIdk if your school allows you to choose your professors, but if they do, use RMP from now on to find those with good reviews. This is what I do. I don't always get those with above average reviews but I refuse to take a class with a POS teacher.",

I definitely will use RMP from now on, I was too lazy to do it before and now I\u2019m getting my ass handed to me. Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate any gentle support I can get.

              "text": ">Our refund date was 2 weeks into the semester.\n\nWow. That really blows. I don't think that's anywhere near enough time to truly gauge a professor's competence and ability to teach as well as the enjoyability and learnability of the content. Regardless, I think you should be entitled to a refund. Your money is paying for a class that's meant to have a teacher who will do their job to ensure you understand the material and pass. Clearly, with this professor, your money is being wasted. \n\nBest of luck to you too. I don't know how expensive your tuition is but if it's not too much then I'd personally just drop the course and take the loss. Sometimes it really is not worth it. But if your tuition is too much that you need the credit right now and/or want to get it out of the way, I give you my advice to just hang in there and make the most of it. Seek tutoring if you can and try to learn as much as you can on your own despite how fucked up that is for a student to have to do. Truth is most schools couldn't give to shits if a professor is terrible at the job. You can try talking to the higher ups but don't expect anything to be done or at least immediately.",

It is not normal at all to allow redos on exams in college outside of extenuating circumstances like illness or a family death. Its honestly crazy that thats your criteria for whether a professor is good or not",

      "text": "As to your opening statement, a hard lesson for most young people (I'm assuming you're young) coming out of high school is that college is nothing like high school. The professors are not there to give you answers, they are there to teach you how to find the answers yourself. They are trying to teach you how to teach yourself. This is difficult at first, because your education to this point has mostly been rote learning. The teacher tells you things and tells you to read things, and your exams are simply regurgitating that same knowledge back to the teacher. In college you have to use what they teach as fundamentals to come up with more elaborate concepts and solve more complex problems on your own. It's to actually prepare you for life where an expert isn't always available to give you an answer. It's to teach you HOW to solve problems on your own. \n\nI promise you that her Chem requirements for a biology degree went waaaay beyond Chem 101, maybe she is rusty at this stuff. Does she normally teach Chem 101? Regardless, you should get your money's worth. That being said....\n\nI was a physics major and had to take Chem. I struggled with it myself. Text books are a wonderful tool. I'd say forget the PowerPoints for the most part, and just use the very expensive text book you have. Seriously, when used as they should be, you dont need a professor or teacher. Read the chapter, do the problems, and if you get stuck on something, there is usually free tutors available from the more advanced student body available on most campuses.",
