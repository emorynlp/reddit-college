  "text": "tl;dr - my final speech ruined my speech grade and I\u2019m just really upset with myself right now. \n\nI turned in my final speech yesterday that was worth 100 points. I got a 0. Now my grade went from an A (don\u2019t remember the %) to a 69.25%. \n\nMy professor did leave a submission comment explaining why she gave me the grade she did, which I do appreciate, but she also mentioned that I only submitted an audio file instead of a video file, which isn\u2019t true. I even went back to the submitted file, it still comes up as a video. \n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I did miss major marks for this speech, that is on me, but if she was able to actually see my speech (which I believe she should have, I\u2019ve never had this problem before) I would\u2019ve gotten some points for what I did do right and I would have ended this class with at least a C rather than a D. \n\nIt\u2019s the end of the semester. I\u2019m not going to try to convince her to help me, she did her job and I did mine. I\u2019m just really upset that all my hard work in keeping a good grade got completely demolished because of what seems to be a computer error. And because I paid for my classes with my pell grant, its likely that I\u2019m going to have to repay for this class and take it again. \n\nI\u2019m just really upset right now.",

We don't want students to fail, especially when it may just be a glitch. Many LMS have been having intermittent issues which could lead to situations like this.\n\nBest of luck!",

I made sure she knew I wasn\u2019t demanding a regrade or anything like that, but just so she at least knows it was a video file. Everything beyond this point is up to her so I hope she shows mercy. \n\nand thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it :)",

You must advocate for yourself and push for what you deserve, instead of giving up and settling, only because you don't want to cause a hassle. \n\nIt's simply quite silly to sit there and be upset about this kind of situation after you decided not to take any action to try and fix it. It can easily be fixed, and most of the time professors will give you the benefit of any doubt, or will accept their mistake and give you the points. This is not a scenario where you say \"lesson learned\" and do nothing about it. \n\nOP, you did the right thing by taking the advice in the comments and emailing the professor. I don't mean to be rude with this comment - I just wanted to stress the importance of pursuing matters where you are in the right, but forcing yourself to take a loss when you could have turned it around with some basic communication.",
