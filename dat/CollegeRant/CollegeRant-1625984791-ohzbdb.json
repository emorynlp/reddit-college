  "text": "I took an asynchronous stats class this summer and I took it asynchronous because I work retail with a new schedule every week. I thought the whole point of asynchronous was so that everyone could do it on their own time (I understand there are due dates and that stuff.) What irritates me is the professor requires us to take our quizzes and exams over zoom at certain times, and only gives us one time slot for each. The worst part is she sends an email a few days before the test/exam letting you know what time she decided. Last Thursday I had a quiz at 10 am and this Monday I have a test at 7 pm. I thought the whole point of asynchronous was to avoid this mess.",

      "text": "I just completed my entire first year of University online, without stepping foot on campus once. I did much better in my asynchronous then synchronous classes simply because of the stress of making the zooms on time. I also worked retail during my first year, and my job was extremely strict. Days off had to be know two weeks in advance there, and I worked weekends. One of my professors gave us all of our exams on Sundays because he thought that \"it would prevent you from having other class work in the way.\" This class was also considered asynch, even though we had set times and places for every exam...",

I prefer to write tests that are cheat proof (critical thinking questions).   I then set a timer to the test.  Student has up to three days to complete exam, but once they start, the timer starts.   I don't use any of the other anti-cheating stuff.  \n\nHang in there.",

          "text": "This is also my approach. The proctoring software is a pain, and even when it\u2019s used, people find ways around it. My exams are all open book, open note, and they\u2019re all my own original questions. Folks who didn\u2019t prepare and try to wing it usually fail (I\u2019m not proud when that happens and warn everyone several times, but you know how some people are...). So, the ones who aren\u2019t prepared basically separate themselves from the ones who did, and the exam averages are about what they are when I give in-class exams. \n\nInterestingly, I find that folks usually adjust their efforts downward to meet the average rather than investing the same amount of time to get a higher score. Phrases like \u201copen book\u201d and \u201copen note\u201d seem to be signs that flash \u201cstudy less\u201d in some people\u2019s minds. I see the same results for study guides - exam grades don\u2019t ever get any better with them.",
