  "text": "Lmao I\u2019m only in two online classes this semester because I\u2019m a depressed loser who fails at everything, still lives at home, won\u2019t ever have a job. \nI think I\u2019m going to drop this \u201cplant science\u201d class get a big fat \u201cwithdrawal\u201d (F) grade and only take one class. I\u2019ll be a real loser then. Didn\u2019t want to take this class, registered late because I\u2019m a lazy, depressed POS. I don\u2019t get the lab homework, I don\u2019t even know how to begin on starting them, I don\u2019t know how write the \u201cdiscussion\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d pages when I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I don\u2019t how I\u2019m supposed to find plants to write about when it\u2019s almost impossible for me to go to a plant store and look/buy them (I don\u2019t drive of course). I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to look around the landscape at types of grass/special landscaping. Lmao I don\u2019t know, so I figure dropping the class while I have an hour left to do so is better than failing and making a fool of myself. \nMy mom thinks I\u2019m a fucking lazy loser because I can\u2019t just do the fucking class. I wish I could. I wish shit was easier for me and I wasn\u2019t such a fucking idiot who is slow at things and never taken a real fucking science class. I don\u2019t work, don\u2019t do chores, don\u2019t do anything or have any friends so just doing two little online classes should be the easiest thing in the world, right? But I\u2019m too much of a fucking loser for even that, so I\u2019m going to still be a dropout taking one class after doing nothing for a whole fucking year. I\u2019m really extremely depressed and feeling totally fucking worthless, nobody fucking cares what I do and that\u2019s the truth. Yeah , if i wasn\u2019t some fucking loser who is depressed by thought of just \u201cliving\u201d (trying to do things to other people\u2019s standards) then yeah, taking these two classes might be easy enough. But it isn\u2019t. And I\u2019m a fucking useless, stupid loser who isn\u2019t good enough for easy online classes much less a fucking job or whatever else. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m a fucking idiot. Too useless and stupid for this \u201ceasy\u201d online science class, so I\u2019m dropping it and officially accepting my status as a failed loser/dropout who will never have a job. Probably work at Walmart and fucking rot the rest of my life\u2014how ridiculous to think I wanted to go into psychology or teaching, law, etc., lmao. I\u2019m extremely depressed and nobody fucking cares, even my mom thinks I\u2019m a lazy piece of shit loser who fails at the simplest things and she\u2019s absolutely right.",

If you're not willing to be a foolish beginner, you'll never be a graceful master.\"\n\nAnd damn you are extremely hard on yourself... give yourself a break. Sure, you're not perfect, but neither is anyone else... you seem to be stuck in a really bad mindset. Your mom sounds like a total bitch",

          "text": "Thank you so much \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 I ended up dropping the class, but accepting that i will feel like a failure/embarrassed sometimes is something I need to learn. Going to really try to feel better this semester (therapy and new meds) and then go back and try harder in the spring. \n\nYeah, everyone says I\u2019m too hard on myself. I\u2019m just extremely depressed, really mentally struggling but I\u2019m finally trying to do more about that. It\u2019s not my mom\u2019s fault, she\u2019s really stressed about work and everything too, but I do just wish she could try to be more understanding. Probably even worse than being in a depressive state is having people around who make me feel like even more of a loser about it.",
