  "text": "So, let me blow off some steam here.\n\nI went to independence University starting in February this year. I thought it would be awesome, everything seemed great and everything appeared to line up, I got my loans, I got a scholarship, and I made a payment plan. I should mention, I graduated a year early. I\u2019ve never done any college prep stuff and I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I went in for graphic design, looking to get my bachelors. I was sent a MacBook Pro and a tablet. I was a little worried at first because they mentioned that their accreditation \u201cwas on probation.\u201d\nWhatever, okay. They said it wasn\u2019t an issue. I began classes on Valentine\u2019s Day, and they seemed all right. It was a new setting for me and I had no idea that colleges typically didn\u2019t let you teach your self the materials that instructors gave. The assignments were relatively simple, I got good grades and I did my best to maintain a very high GPA.\n\n\n\nWell, time Skip to August and I get a letter from the Dean saying \u201cthe school will be closing on August 1 you can either transfer or withdraw and get a refund.\u201d Understandably, I was furious. I can only imagine how other students felt about this wasted time. I looked into the transfer option which was some online college in Miami, and it was ranked very low for colleges in the US and honestly? I didn\u2019t really trust them after this. \n\n\n\nOf course I opted for the refund, I withdrew and I signed loan discharge applications. Luckily the company that loaned me money was very kind and easy to work with. The only positive out of this is I don\u2019t have any crippling debt and they let me keep the devices they sent me. However, they totally ran off with my money. I didn\u2019t make a huge investment since it was only a few months I was in the college, but I never got my refund. I\u2019m still fuming about it. \n\nI found a few other people on Reddit who had similar experiences these last few months. I am upset for them as well as myself of course, and I\u2019m still looking at ways to get my money back. Oh, and as a bonus\u2026 The guy in charge of CEHE apparently was fined By the state of Colorado \u201cfor defrauding students at CEHE schools.\u201d \nThat was before I enrolled at the school. They never told us to my knowledge. \n\n\n\nTL;DR I went to a CEHE school and they closed abruptly, not issuing me a refund and as a bonus they never told us the founder had been fined in Colorado for defrauding students.",

So while yes, it is VERY frustrating, you\u2019ve got some time to figure your stuff out. maybe try a state school or a community college first and then transfer? i can\u2019t believe schools just shut down with no warning",
