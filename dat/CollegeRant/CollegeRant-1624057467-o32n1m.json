  "text": "so far my whole college experience has been a shit show to put it into simple terms. 1. couldn't get into the nursing program because my highschool messed up. 2. lost my 40 credit hour scholarship because my step dad didn't want to be an adult and do taxes so fafsa didn't get done the 1st fall so lost that. and now I can't get into the rn program because God knows why. I'm done bending backwards for them and always falling short after doing EXACTLY what they say. i am not waiting ANOTHER year to start.. so im changing my major from Nursing to Mortuary Science \n\nTL;DR- screw this school and all it's bs to get onto the rn program. I'm dealing with dead people",
