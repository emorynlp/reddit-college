I have to teach myself with the book and pre-made slides and do the homework on that site. The only thing my professors do is take the grades i get and put them into blackboard. My one professor stands out and has a discussion group where we can ask questions if needed. Glad I\u2019m shoveling out thousands for a $200 access code to teach me:)",

College is not all it's cracked up to be, and they've always been selling a few hundred dollars worth of material (think access codes and textbooks) thousands of dollars a semester.  \n\nProfessors are not any better.  They have always thought they are very important (when in reality, they are just a part of the medium we use to learn.  It can be done entirely without them).",

      "text": "This has been my experience across the board with STEM except for one stats professor with a PHD and a cushy corporate job who just does teaching for fun (coincidentally he was also a much superior teacher than the usual grudging candidate for the job of \u2018educator,\u2019 it\u2019s almost like giving a shit makes a difference). My liberal arts and GEs weren\u2019t much better: either overeager, self-absorbed loons who would rant about the state of the universe (and heavily imply that covid is a hoax and that they think lockdown is BS) and assign ridiculous amounts of writing that no full time CC student could plausibly be expected to complete in a week, or completely hands off professors who literally just assign reading and an essay a week and fuck off. No office hours, no emails, nothing. It\u2019s fucking bullshit man, and as the son of an English teacher who instructs over 800 high school students a day, it\u2019s incredibly painful to see that this is what education has become. Returning to in-person education once conditions are suitable might temporarily fix things, but I honestly think eliminating the \u201ccampus experience\u201d just ripped open already gaping holes in the higher education system. The corporate Supra-infrastructure has cemented its control over the education system, thanks to our dependence on their services as a result of being online, and now professors are practically encouraged to sit back and let these companies do all the work for them. Otherwise they might get in trouble for letting an incident of cheating slip by, or they might get fired by the school for not getting with the program.",

You should raise your concerns with the dean of students, the department chair, college dean, anybody you can get to listen who is actually in a position of power to influence things. \n\nThat being said, to be honest, you probably have zero idea just how exhausted and overworked most professors are atm. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you- I\u2019m a professor now, but as a student I had no idea what professors actually did. Depending on the size of your school, the exact position your professors have, and a number of other variables, teaching may be their #1 priority or their last priority. It\u2019s possible they are being lazy but I know a lot of faculty at a lot of different sized schools and the common feeling is that holy shit we are all very busy and losing our minds.",

          "text": "It depends, I've heard people say it barely affects tenured profs because they can't get fired barring extreme circumstance. I recently read a post from the prof sub where they were discussing student evals (and how totally evil and unfair they are, of course) and multiple profs said straight up that they are tenured and don't even read their evals anymore period because they're \"too mean\", and due to their tenured status they don't have to go over the evals with admin. Not all colleges are like that I'm sure but I was disheartened by how many admitted they do not even read them at all (wish we could simply choose not to receive the feedback on our assignments or ignore all customer feedback in a service based job but alas) and that their admin doesn't read them either. Or cannot/does not act on them.",

              "text": "Yeah that is potentially true. More likely to be the case if the professors job is primarily research instead of teaching. Bigger universities are often actually more research focused than you realize, so some of the teaching stuff is devalued.\n\nThe eval process is fundamentally flawed. Probably for both professors and students. Some professors are indeed bitter about that. Most I know at least try to take them seriously. On the other hand, some people are just shit people. For students, doing the evals and taking serious issues to any department focused on student retention is probably the best you can do.",

Professors and TAs have gotten soo lazy over covid. \n\nLike, how does that make sense? In the real world, you almost always get feedback on your performance.",

I\u2019ve seen quite a few comments similar to this, and I honestly can\u2019t believe so many professors are formatting their courses this way. We all knew adjustments would be made for Covid, but I didn\u2019t expect it to get this bad. \n\nWith that being said, I wouldn\u2019t put this on all professors. There are some who are genuinely trying very hard to continue their normal routine for classes, labs, HW, etc. I do understand your frustration, but just know that they are experiencing similar, but different difficulties as us students are.",
