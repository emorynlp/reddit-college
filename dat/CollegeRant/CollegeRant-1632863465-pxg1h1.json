  "text": "bruh. im so annoyed at people who use like 4 big/not very known words in one sentence. like babes im not reading ur discussion board post if i need to look up every third word. maybe im stupid but like i find it so funny that people who do this get no replies to their posts. sometimes people use these \u201cfancy\u201d words yet make no points in their post and its so frustrating.",
