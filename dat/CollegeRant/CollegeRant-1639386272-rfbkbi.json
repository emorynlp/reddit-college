  "title:": "I might fail my chemistry final",
  "text": "I just came here to rant, but I have no interest in chemistry at all. Before I went to college, I told my parents that I will be doing biochemistry and then become a doctor. I can't take it anymore. I genuinely don't like being in school, and I can't stand another 10 years of this.\n\nI'm in my first semester of college and I think that I'm going to fail my chemistry final tomorrow. It honestly sucks having to accept this, but I just have no interest in the subject at all. It is so boring. I know that if I put in the work, I might actually pass, but I don't see the point anymore. I'm shifting to business instead, which I actually wanted, and chemistry is not at all useful to that.\n\nI know that failing this class will have consequences on my transcript but I don't think it's worth giving energy anymore. I regret every trying and I should have used the days I tried to study for it on other subjects. I don't even know if I should bother showing up to the final tomorrow. I'm sorry to what a waste of money that class was, but I did need to take it for me to realize I hate it. So yeah, see ya chemistry, you're literally the worst.",

              "text": "This is true, but like I said earlier, I needed to take the course again for me to realize that it isn't for me. It was a waste of time and money, but there was that bright side. And, I think exploring is a good things for students as long as they limit it. Like, they can just try out their top 3 interests and settle on one of them. For me, I knew that I couldn't leave college without some science skill, so the business course I'm hoping to take has computer science with it. And, I know that I'm not creative enough for an arts degree so that removed the faculty of arts. To enter the faculty of science, chemistry is a pre-req, so LOL.",
