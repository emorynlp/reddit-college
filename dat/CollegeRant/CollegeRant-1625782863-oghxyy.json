  "title:": "After four years, my paper diploma doesn't even fit my paper diploma cover",
  "text": " Finally got my diplomas in the mail today. One of them was bent by the postal worker who stuffed it into my mail box. Secondly, it's literally just a simple piece of paper (though I'm not 100% surprised, but just expecting more since my high school diploma is a really nice faux leather bound one). Third, it doesn't even fit the diploma \"cover\" they gave me at graduation!!!!! I say \"cover\" because it's literally a folded piece of paper with my college's name on it. I am very disappointed, and obviously there's nothing I can do about it, but I wanted to rant a bit.",
