  "title:": "There are two distinct reactions to the end of the last class of this semester",
  "text": "\\#1: Feeling like you might cry because this is the last time you'll get to hang out with your cool classmates for that class and then your supportive, parent-adjacent professor gives a short speech about how you're the best class they've had and how proud they are of you that you managed to power through one of the most challenging semesters ever. They tell you to feel free to contact them if you just want to talk about whatever nd you get misty-eyed as you close out the Zoom meeting\n\n\\#2:  Feeling like you might cry because you managed to make it through this nightmare of a class with the shitty professor that did a terrible job with everything throughout the whole semester. You did not get a chance to bond with your classmates because they shut down the chat to keep everyone \"focused\" and the only reason you managed to scrap by in the class was because of outside free resources that really make you wonder why you paid thousands to sit in a Zoom meeting to watch someone not really explain the course content.\n\nAs you close the Zoom meeting for the last time, you feel yourself smile as you remember that course evaluations are open and you can finally tell the higher-ups what a shitty professor that person is so they'll be replaced with someone competent (they almost never do btw, because the school wants them to do research or whatever so they can say they helped)",

Fucking horrible all around so I wrote a solid paper for her in the additional comments or notes part that highlighted there pros and cons in the class. Even mentioned that I got an A so they know I busted my ass and I\u2019m not some salty lazy kid. I praised the teachers that did well and gave specific examples and anecdotes. Those teachers that put in effort and did the most deserve some praise and maybe a raise, bless em.\n\n-edit for clarity-",

But hey that\u2019s to logical for some of these colleges lol. Seriously college is such a scam and mind you this is coming from a straight A senior. I feel like I\u2019m barely learning shit I\u2019m going to use in the real world with a few classes as an exception and most of my personal skills and knowledge come from actually working and operating businesses. Idk man I\u2019m just ranting at this point as I\u2019m sleep deprived rn. \n\nEitherway best of luck to you if you still got any finals left fam, home stretch \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd",
