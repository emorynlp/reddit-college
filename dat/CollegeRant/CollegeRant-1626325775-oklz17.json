  "text": "Hey, it seems like everyone gives really good advice here so I\u2019m going to try. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to start with this. I feel so unmotivated and don\u2019t want to do anything, I\u2019m not trying to be lazy, I guess it\u2019s just depression. I\u2019m in a 3 week English class that ends on Friday and I\u2019ve just been nothing but stressed the whole time. I have a final paper due on Friday and only have 4 pages (out of 6). Yeah that\u2019s not a lot, but I just feel so burned out and I know when I finish it tomorrow I\u2019m just going to try to fit random things in and it won\u2019t be the great, well thought out paper it was supposed to be. I just hope I get an ok grade because that\u2019s all I have energy left for. \n\nI\u2019m also really depressed about my situation and think going to college full time next month will make it worse. I can\u2019t really take in person classes, I live with my parents 15 mins away now and I don\u2019t want to bother them, I\u2019m 21 and want to be independent but I don\u2019t drive anymore. I can\u2019t really get an apartment because my scholarship was canceled because I took all of last year off, so now I only have loans and don\u2019t want to waste them on rent (and I already have bad experiences with roommates, I don\u2019t really want to try again).\n\nI absolutely hate and loathe online classes. But I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019ll have to do again next semester, all while I feel depressed about living with my parents and not being able to get \u201cout into the world\u201d at all. I don\u2019t really have any friends, and when I felt better about talking to people everything shut down and now I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real way to meet people. \n\nI also go to a college and am stuck in a little small town I absolutely hate, but I guess there\u2019s no real solution for that other than trying to get over it. I hate that I\u2019m stuck at this school/town because of in-state tuition (it\u2019s all I can afford). I hate the weather, the closed-mind local people, how impossible it is to drive/park anywhere, just everything. \n\nI guess I would just really like some advice on how to \u201csuck it up\u201d and just get over it. I can\u2019t really move out, and even though my parents don\u2019t bother me, I just really hate how unindependent I have to feel.\n\nTLDR: Im stuck with my parents and can\u2019t move out, have to take full time online classes again next semester (even though it made me so depressed last year I dropped out), no way to meet anyone and feel \u201calive\u201d and like I\u2019m actually doing things in the world, I hate this town/state and the shitty weather, I can\u2019t do good in my summer class so I guess I\u2019m just going to hope for a passing grade. \n\nThank you for reading and any advice.",

I do think I would feel better if I just got out and did anything, if I actually had something to work towards.",
