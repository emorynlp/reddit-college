Over all took 2 years by maxing out in the spring, summer and fall.\n\nI had a part time job most of the time but i wanted to focus mainly on classes. I worked and saved over the summer.",

I took at least 15 hours each semester (except my last) and I always took at least one class (sometimes more) in the summer. \nMeanwhile, I worked the whole time. Unfortunately my bills never paid themselves. \n\nIt took me 3 years.",
