  "text": "I have a comp sci exam at the end of the week, and the class is extremely hard and out of my comfort zone. The professor says the exam will be just writing out programs on a piece of paper. That's it; no multiple choice or anything. Just straight up writing code on paper. Every other comp sci class has had multiple choice/short answer type of exams or large projects. It's making me incredibly nervous because we've had one quiz like that so far, and I bombed it. I panicked and couldn't pull it together. I feel like I know my stuff and spend a lot of time on this class, but I'm worried that I'll bomb this exam. \n\nI keep trying to remind myself that one bad grade will not define me as a person or my value. I will still be me. I will not lose any worth. No one will hate me or anything. But, it's really hard to get past a bad grade, so I'm bracing myself now.",

      "text": "You\u2019re correct that one bad grade isn\u2019t going to be a big deal in the grand scheme.\n\nOn the point about exams, multiple choice is usually a poor indicator of mastery as that question type really measures cued recall (and can be gamed with test taking strategy). The kinds of exams that really demonstrate mastery are the essay and other open-ended kinds of questions. In this case, it sounds like the professor is using that concept as it applies to CS. If you\u2019re not used to it, it can be stressful, but it\u2019s not intended to be punitive. It just takes some adjustment.",
