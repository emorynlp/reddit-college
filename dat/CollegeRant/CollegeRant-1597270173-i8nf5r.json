  "text": "I do not understand why some professors don't respond to any student emails. Especially during COVID where we didn't have any face to face time. Why become a professor/teach students if you're not willing to talk/respond to them? Don't they have to check their emails incase their colleagues or bosses email them? I don't see why they ignore student emails and answer other emails.",

It's still a little frustrating though that we're paying thousands of dollars and the students still aren't the main priority, but that's more of a problem with the university system rather than professors in general. I wish that weren't the case. But thank you for the insight!",

      "text": "As a professor and as a former student who emailed professors, you\u2019ve just asked the Magic question. If I was going to give benefit of the doubt, I\u2019d say it\u2019s because they get so so many and sometimes emails just get lost in the pile. Happens to me every once in a while. But honestly there\u2019s no excuse. Some professors are bums about it and don\u2019t prioritize students. My wife had a professor that only cared about one school club and nothing else do students would put that club in the subject line to get him to actually open their emails. It\u2019s a shame but it\u2019s good experience for cold calling and persistence in the real world I suppose. If you\u2019re having a ton of trouble, just go straight to the chair and say you can\u2019t get a hold of the professor. If that doesn\u2019t work, email the dean. Don\u2019t come off as emotionally charged. Just say you\u2019re having trouble reaching the person and they haven\u2019t responded to x number of emails in x number of days.",

My professor did end up replying to my emails, but no one else's in my class until after the final where he responded to one person asking about how the assignments will be graded due COVID. Thank you for the insight, and I'm glad a professor also sees how frustrating this is! I wish you the best this year!",

      "text": "Well, from their perspective, they're hugely interested in their own work, and thus went to graduate school to get a PhD to continue publishing research. While teaching undergraduates is one of their responsibilities, it's not their only responsibility, and it's likely not their primary interests. Had they wanted to teach kids/young adults, they likely would've gone into teaching high schoolers.\n\nThis is assuming that you're at a university where professors do research. If you're at a community college, then this likely isn't case and I don't know what's up with your professors.",

I wish it weren't the case that they were mainly teaching classes to get by with/fund their research so the students could have a better learning environment, but that's more of a problem with the university system rather than the professors. It's just a little frustrating that students have to pay thousands of dollars to not be the professors' priority, but given what you said, it makes sense. Thank you for the insight!",
