  "text": "My main issue is that well i suck at everything i was never inclined to anything. Not medicine, engineering, maths, science NOTHING i suck. I only enjoy reading books and learning about history and the news about videogames and basic level politics. I been in college since 2019 i had AP classes for a couple things like spanish geography and history. Currently im doing the pre reqs for nursing and my GPA is trash 2.4 and i still have two more biologies one more chemistry and one math class. Im not a handy man either, i cant ever seem to really focus on classes this past year with online school, and i just feel like im not build for school i hate the community college teachers we get they all are super old and strict and their policies often dont make much sense, i just want someone who has been in my position before tell me what i can do to be better. I dont want to be a deadbeat im a first generation US citizen here in California and i dont want to lose at life. My Gf has a bachelors already and is ready for her masters and im not even half way into an associates (she is 23 im 20) please any tips would be appreciate it.",
