  "text": "Just a rant... I live in Oceania and some of our instructors prefer using messenger and facebook for their announcements of quizzes and tests. My classmates and I have a separate group chat for some chitchats for our general class and this is where I discovered that a professor has instructed 1 of my classmates to create a group chat for a certain course. However, I was the only one not included in the group chat. I immediately contacted this classmate, she did not reply immediately. I also contacted 2 classmates but they still didn't reply to me. I was already panicking at that time because that group chat  that I was not included is a major course and hours have passed and I am still not included in the group chat. After 5-6 hours, they already added me. The classmate in charged of the group chat added me and the other 1 classmate that I messaged reassured me that she will tell the person in charge. However, the 3rd classmate that I contacted just ignored me. Until now, my message is in deliver zoned. To add, the person in charge of the group chat took 5-6 hours to reply when I see her online all the time, sharing some posts on facebook and reacting on her friend's posts :(\n\nIt really sucks, you know. Upon seeing the group chat, the instructor's announcements were very urgent . I was so pissed off seriously. Like, how can they forget their 1 classmate which is me when that group chat is very important :(",
