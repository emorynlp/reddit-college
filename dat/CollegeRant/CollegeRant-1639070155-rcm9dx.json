  "text": "I didn\u2019t prepare like at all, I\u2019m an idiot, and I completely bombed an oral exam. The teacher asked me if I was okay and I was like I\u2019m blanking and she just ended it halfway through because I could not speak in another language at that moment to save my life. Oh well. I only have myself to blame and I have been barely passing the class all year\u2026",
