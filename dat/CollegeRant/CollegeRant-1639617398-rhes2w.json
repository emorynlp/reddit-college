  "text": "I have the final exam tomorrow in my business class. Since it is a survey of everything in business, there is a lot to cover. The professor allows us open book/open note/PowerPoint for the test. \n\nShe recommends we try to learn the material because we would run out of time if we look up every answer. It is 40 questions.",

If you can immediately see a question and know \"oh yeah, that's from the final section of chapter 4\", you're golden. \n\nBetter than studying the actual material because I find that even if I think i know the answer, I won't be able to resist looking it up because it's open notes, so studying actual material doesn't save any time",
