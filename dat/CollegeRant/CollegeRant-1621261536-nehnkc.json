  "text": "Hi, so as you can see from the title this is an update from the post I made on here a month ago. I had no intentions on doing an update, but now that I have my final grade, I thought    it'd be nice lol. \n\nFor those that didn't see the original post, I basically posted how I hated my major (Chem major) and how I was failing Organic Chem II and didn't want to fail because I needed a break. If you want to read the original post I'll like link it or something. \n\nAnways, apparently I wrote that post a month ago, but it felt way longer. When I wrote that post, I had just failed my 2nd exam and in order to pass the class I needed to pass the next exam with at minimum a 70 and pass the final exam with a high 70 (the final exam replaced the lowest exam) I thought I could do it, so I studied for the next exam and ended up getting a 50 something? It felt like everytime I studied for the exam I just ended up doing worse than when I didn't. \n\nSo yeah, I ended up failing that exam and like two more quizzes. I didn't give up though and I refused to withdraw, so I kept going. Now at this point, there's only the final left and I had to make a high 70 in order to pass. It felt beyond impossible honestly. The exam covered everything from orgo I and orgo II. I barely passed orgo I, so of course I don't really remember anything from it. So I tried my best to relearn everything from both semesters for the remaining 2 weeks I had left until the exam. It was the most stressful and miserable two weeks of my life, but in the end I happily passed with a C!\n\nAt the time I wrote that post I'm sure I thought I wouldn't pass. I kept trying my best though and praying that I would succeed in the end and here I am! This is truly the happiest I've been in a long time. \n\nAnyways, I still hate my major and there is no changing that lol. On the bright side, next school year is my last year and I very excited to be finished with college! \n\n(Btw, for anyone that's failing any class and you feel like you won't be able to pass.... keep going! Don't give up and don't let those negative thoughts get to you! You can do this!)",

              "text": "Pre-general? Is that just a intro class to general chemistry? Sorry, I never had to take a class like that, so I'm not 100% sure!\n\nEither way, I did very well in my General Chemistry courses. I don't think you should be that worried, the first part of General Chemistry is easier than the 2nd part of General Chemistry. I hated the 2nd part actually, but overall both parts aren't extremely bad as long as you never fall behind. \n\nThe best advice is to do a bunch of practice problems every single day. That really helped me. If your University is in America then you may have to take the ACS exam for General Chemistry, so I recommend the ACS General Chemistry study guide. I used that for my exam and it helped a lot. Even if you don't have to take that exam, I think it will still help. \n\nKhan academy and YouTube are also good resources to use. If you're ever confused, go and ask your prof for help! Never wait until the last minute to ask for help or to study for an exam.  The stuff in later chapters in gen chem can be really confusing, so the earlier you practice, the better. \n\nAlso, don't let other people's opinions about the class worry you a lot. Most people hate Chemistry(lmao even me), but sometimes I think when you think negatively about a class, it can somewhat sway your opinion on a class before you even take it. I'm not saying you're doing this or anything, but sometimes Ive seen myself do this by unnecessarily dreading a class before I even gave it a chance. Now I try to think as positive as I can for my classes,  like manifesting I guess. \n\nLol anyways this is way longer than I was expecting \ud83d\ude05, but GL to you!",
