  "text": "I'm not gonna lie, I never thought it would get this bad. But I have to accept the fact that this is no one else's fault but mine in the fact that 3 weeks ago I woke up, and suddenly I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything anymore. the class gets boring, and life seems dull. It's been 3 weeks since I've gone to classes and my friends are so distant that no one cares. college is so expensive too, it really just sucks and I feel like if try this late in the semester ill be met with nothing but disappointment since it's really what I deserve. I don't know how to ask for help, my mom never told me anything she just dropped me off here and expects everything will be okay. I just want everything to stop but alas tomorrow is Monday and I'm staring at this blank google doc: ... | I'm sorry guys.",

You DO NOT deserve disappointment. \n\nMake an appointment with your college's counseling center.  It's the least you can do for yourself.  Counseling is awesome.  \n\nE-mail your professors and let them know what's going on.  You might be pleasantly surprised.",

      "text": "Dude, go see your professors now! I was fighting some pretty bad depression and apathy last spring after I lost a leg 2 weeks into the semester and my professors worked with me to get me back on track even though it was already after spring break. You'd be surprised at how flexible they can be if you just talk to them. I'd also highly recommend reaching out to the counseling services at your school. They can help guide you through this first year and really help you develop the coping mechanisms you are going to need to be successful. The counseling services at my school helped me a lot and now I'm back on campus and thriving. You just have to reach out and the help will be there. Hang in there man, it does get better!",
