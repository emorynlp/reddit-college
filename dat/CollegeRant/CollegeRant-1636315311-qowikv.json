  "text": "\nI\u2019m thinking on minoring in something like IT or take computer-based classes and just have a business administration degree. I\u2019m currently in finance and I declared my concentration too late so I have three more semesters to go. I am so sick of school already and I have to pay so much more money if I stay. \n\nWill employers hire me with just a BA degree and no concentration?",
