Didn\u2019t help she was part of the friendgroup (my bad)\n- Had the most absolute DICK of a student aid/motivator at my internship. No social skills whatsoever it drove me nuts. Couldn\u2019t grasp what I was going through. \n\nThe internship was a 1.5h drive one way. Woke up at around 5am, returned at 10PM. This continued on until I had mental breakdown at a motorcycle dealership out of all places. \n\nThe sales guy there (out of all the people in my life?!!) gave me the best advice, well sort of: this too will pass + you\u2019re young so don\u2019t get hung up on making mistakes, girls or school or whatever. I wish I was me in 2019, you need to go to some party or go 200miles/hour on a race track. Hell pick up skydiving, you need something to take off steam. Go to the therapist of the school district. And go to a party once in a while, you WILL regret this, even anti-social me can confirm this. Don\u2019t have to drink or take anything to have fun btw. \n\nSorry for the rambling, I hope I gave you some inner rest, you will see through this, I know it sucks major balls for now but that\u2019s the thing, for now :)",
