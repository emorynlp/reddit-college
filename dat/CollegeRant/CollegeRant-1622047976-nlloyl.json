  "text": "**It helps that during my experience at CC I was in a better state of mind rather instead of borderline suicidal.**\n\nTL;DR: Community College was a lot better of a experience compared to a Regular College during COVID.\n\nCourses:\n\nRegular: 5 Courses beginning & 4 courses ending. (Total: 15-12 credits)\n\nCommunity:  3 courses beginning & Ending (Total: 13.5 credits)\n\nIn both terms I was taking: The same English Course, A Java Programming Class, and Trigonometry\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Actual Class experience:\n\nRegular: Majority of the classes didn't host a zoom meeting & when they did it was just the professor blabbering. Majority of the professors I was taught by were Student Teachers. Felt like professors cared more about the pay check instead of the students. My Java programming specifically had practically steps to do things missing, when you tried to ask the professor for instructions again I felt like he was going to yell.\n\nCommunity: 3/3 courses were taught by real professors that work at other colleges. Although 1 class I didn't really get \"taught\" by the professor, he answered questions with actual answers instead of riddles.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrading:\n\nRegular: Grading was usually Cutthroat. had - & + s' (like B- or C+). Had little to none sympathy with students even though it was something that even they haven't experienced.\n\nCommunity: Regular grading system. had no - & + s'.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Grades:\n\nRegular: A C- and a handful of F's. + a W (withdrawn)\n\nCommunity: Unknown. Expecting A-B ratio. (Grades haven't been finalized yet.)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWorkload:\n\nRegular: Majority of classes accepted late assignments but were heavily deducted points in short times. Assignments majority of the time were due when the class started (I understand it's fair to do that , but I kinda feel that having it due the day of gives the student time to readjust an assignment) .\n\nCommunity:  Similar experience to regular (assignments were due day of), late assignments were a lot more merciful.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAffordability:\n\nRegular: I think with everything together it was 5,000 USD ish. The only thing I used on campus was the weight room. (I lost those privileges when COVID hit the Midwest)\n\nCommunity: It was around 1300 USD overall. I didn't have access to campus (online only + it was closed due to COVID).  I actually don't have to take out another loan if I choose to go to CC next semester. (and if I spend money wisely)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion: It's weird that I'm having a better experience at CC. I kinda thought I was considered \"dumb\" for taking doing it. However, a handful of people in my family actually took classes when they were in college. This feels less like a rant and more like a comparison but I just wanted to share my experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick Edit: Some folks may have different result with CC & a better experience at regular college.\n\nEdit 2: I just got done with classes & they're now in a 33 % chance to either get a 3.33, 3.66, or 4.0 gpa.

They use the same website for classes and homework as my regular school does  and the teachers at the community college all post a \u201cwhen assignments are due\u201d page so you\u2019re not looking at 4 different websites to see when things are actually due. There\u2019s no guessing and there\u2019s actually some structure.",

I saw that the course & my emails were licked clean from my history about him. If he was an actual professor, he isn't now. (if that tells you about how bad the class was taught)",
