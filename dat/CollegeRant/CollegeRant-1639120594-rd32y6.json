  "title:": "My professor/mentor told me how \"deeply disappointed\" he is in me because I chose an internship in finance.",
  "text": "Warning: cursing.\n\nFor the past two years of my undergrad, I've been lucky to have had an amazing professor who has mentored me and given me absolutely invaluable advice. He has put a lot of time and effort into training me to be an excellent STEM researcher and, with his encouragement, I have won numerous accolades and scholarships for research and ultimately designing my own self-study. Suffice it to say, I am extremely grateful to have him as a mentor and, over the years, a friend.\n\nBut, as I go into my senior year, I have realized academia is not for me. I do love research, but frankly, I hate the bureaucracy of it all and the constant feeling of being inferior to everyone else in my field. As such, I accept a position within high finance, a summer internship that typically becomes a full-time job offer once it's finished. I have no idea if I'll like it, but I've met with the people I'll be working with and they seem wonderful and I'm really excited to try something new.\n\nRecently, I met with my mentor to catch up, and when he asked me what my plans are for the summer. I told him honestly that I had taken a few finance and accounting classes earlier in the year and now am trying my hand within finance.\n\nLike the title says, he did not take it well. He asked me several intrusive questions about the position, and since I consider that I have a personal as well as professional relationship with him, I answered all his questions. He went quiet and essentially told me how disappointed he was in me, that he didn't spend so much time training me only for me to become \"money-hungry\" and become so enticed by the slightest hint of money.\n\nI never expressed it to him, but I am furious. I know I shouldn't take it so personally since he is really just expressing his worldview, but he has no right to scold me like that. When I first met him, I applied to be an RA at his lab. I never promised to make research my career or get a Ph.D. I have only ever told him that I'm considering it, never that I was definitively going to do it.  I also never asked him to spend so much time and effort on me, he was the one that first got me to apply for scholarships and such and basically got the ball rolling for me. I am appreciative that he did that, but again,  I never forced his hand at any time to do anything for me. He could have refused at any given point.\n\nA Ph.D. is such an unworthy investment for me, I hate the idea of being in near poverty for the next 5-7 years while watching all my friends have families and be able to buy houses and whatnot while I'm wiling away doing paperwork. I also want to be able to afford to go on holiday before the age of, like, 45 and through extremely careful financial management. Not to mention, I would undertake all this only to not get a professorship because professors only retire at like 110 years old and so the market is tiny, or the alternative of going to Buttfuck, Montana away from my friends and family and the life I've built for myself because you can't really pick the location where you will get a job. Seriously? Fuck that.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what to do now. I don't want to end my mentorship with him, but I feel it has come to that. But, it sucks, I hate that I'm put in this position and shamed. I have eternal admiration for those that do graduate studies, but I refuse. I worked my ass off in and \u2014 even before \u2014  my undergrad to be successful and financially free (not in debt), I'm not ready to give that up.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: prof shamed me for not choosing to get a PHD or remain in STEM.",

It could be that he saw potential for you to succeed and contribute to the field. He might have been talking to collogues and potentially setting you up for a graduate position.  There's also the issue of passion for a subject; money is often less important to professors than the love of their work and the idea of making career choices based on money can seem profane. Many professors see the PhD as a badge of honor, a mountain to climb, or a club to be in rather than a financial investment. Ultimately all this is his problem not yours.\n\nAs someone who went the PhD STEM route and who's life played out similar to how you described, I cannot fault your decision. I would not have made it because even if I was successful, I would always regret not pursuing the degree. The degree has a cost that you've recognized and not agreed to.",

          "text": "Thank you for your input. I apologize for the curt tone I used to describe the PhD-life. At this point, I have met 100s of grad students and it's essentially the same story over and over again. Overworked, underpaid, and in some scenarios, trapped in a toxic lab environment. I mean, relatively recently a student committed suicide in my own school over the conditions of his lab environment. I find it unbearably tragic; it isn't even really being talked about anymore. \n\nMy professor once casually mentioned to me that most, if not all, of his cohort were children of professors or faculty themselves. It was a slap in the face to hear, but not surprising. I grew up near the poverty line in a tense family situation (I believe financial stress contributed to it), so, yes, I am quite \"money-minded.\" One of my unspoken promises to myself has been to never be in my parents' position ever again, and getting a Ph.D. is a leap of faith that I cannot afford, even though I am currently in a better financial position. I don't mean to entice pity, rather, I feel this is an issue with the state of grad admissions overall and must be addressed if they want more lower-income students to actually join academia. \n\nI have a lot of respect for you, and success is a different measure for different people; you are most definitely succeeding in your own way. Maybe in another life where I had a more comfortable upbringing and more support, I would have joined you in this courageous and noble endeavor.",
