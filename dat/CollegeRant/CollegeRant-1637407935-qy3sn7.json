  "text": "I (19F) am a sophomore in college studying theater. I live on campus in a suite-style dorm with four other girls who I would consider to be my best friends. I love being here and I love them all so much. However, a problem has risen recently and I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to bring it up to them. \nI don\u2019t drink, smoke, or party, and all my theater requirements for the semester are over. This means I never have any plans and usually stay up in my room every night with a book or movie or homework until I fall asleep (which is totally fine by me). Anyways, I also have a job at a coffee shop, which requires me a lot of the time to be up early to open the store.\nOver time, I\u2019ve gotten used to waking up early (around 5:30-7 every day), and going to sleep early. Last night, I was so exhausted from work that I fell asleep at 10.\nHere\u2019s the thing, my roommates all stay up much later than I do. And sometimes, they\u2019re really loud. I can tell when they get back from a night out because they talk loudly in our shared hallway, or in the room next door with paper thin walls. This wakes me up every single time.\nI really don\u2019t mind most of the time, but it\u2019s gotten to a point where I\u2019m losing sleep and my physical health is only getting worse (not to mention the mental illness and chronic stomach disorder that also wakes me up super early). I don\u2019t know how to bring this up to them without sounding super lame. \n\nTLDR; my wonderful roommates tend to forget that I operate on a different sleeping schedule than them and have woken me up on multiple occasions by talking loudly in our common areas.",
