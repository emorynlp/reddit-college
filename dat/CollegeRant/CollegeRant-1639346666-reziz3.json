  "text": "I'm in my 3rd year of college, currently writing exams for the 1st semester. I realised that I missed half of the exams and missed all of the deadlines for the assignments given to us. I'm doing online classes until I return to school. I'm anxious about returning to school. I feel like I've gotten dumber \n\nIdk how I've let this happen. Nothing has been going right academically, and it's all my fault. I've allowed procrastination and anxiety to cripple me and chase me away from my studies. Whenever I sit down to study I can't concentrate. I lean towards doing something that doesn't require sitting down and focusing on books. \n\nI love the idea of studying and learning. I watch videos of people studying to motivate me. It works at that moment. But when it's time for me to do the same, I fail. \nI think I have a learning disorder and it's only getting worse. At the big age of 24, how do I still struggle to do a simple task as studying. Everybody else can do it, why can't I \n\nThis has made me depressed. I punish myself by not eating. I'm a financial burden to my family. I don't think there's any hope for me. I've ran out of chances",

      "text": "I really think you should take a break from college and seek mental health help. I had to take a break because I was addicted to multiple hard drugs and things just got out of control. Im clean now, graduated with a 4.0 from community college, and am back at a 4 year school and just aced the first semester back.\n\nOops didnt mean to submit yet\n\nFocus on your mental health first and foremost, it will make everything much easier. Just know you arent a failure or any negative thing youre telling yourself. If you were trying to run a marathon but had 2 broken legs you wouldnt be mentally beating yourself up, would you? No you would focus on healing then get back to it.\n\nOnce you do go back to college you will have to radically change how you approach school and studying. Maybe only take 1 or 2 classes at first to ease into it. *Get an agenda*, or an app or anything where you can write down due dates. When you get a syllabus write down all the dates thats in it, and add due dates as you become aware of them. Every single day check whats due in the upcoming week. Work on the thing thats due the soonest, and once you get a buffer between when the next thing is due, you can be more choosey with what you work on, and also, perfect time to review past notes. With that method its impossible to get blindsided. Read the relevant textbook sections *before* theyre gone over in class. Take notes. Do flash cards. Go to office hours. Get a tutor. Review your notes. Do practice problems (if relevant) For every hour in class spend roughly 1.5 hours studying. <--  tried and true method, if you do all that and still do poorly at least you know you gave it your all. But chances are youll do fine",

It\u2019s happened to me and it\u2019s happened to a lot of students and it\u2019s almost like you get physically sick at the thought of studying. Idk if you have a LD on top of that but if so things are even harder and there\u2019s no point in trying to fight all that. You\u2019re worried about pleasing your fam and not eating right on top of that, ofc you won\u2019t do well like this.\n\nYou can recover but you have to step back and rest for a while",
