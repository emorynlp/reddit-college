  "text": "I hate how a year of my school was basically taken away from me. Not only that, we have to worry about actually contracting the virus itself. I hate online classes bc I can\u2019t concentrate and I\u2019m just sitting in my room all day. Can\u2019t see friends either cuz covid and we\u2019re busy with work/school. I could be making new friends but I can\u2019t. I used to be so optimistic and happy to go to school now everything\u2019s changed. I feel like a shell version of myself. Anyone else feel like this?",

It may not be my place to say, but I've completely turned a 180, and lost all motivation to do anything. I've wasted it binging hours of TV shows and movies, and barely doing any assignments, so I've already set myself up to fail this semester. =/ Not sure how to come back from it when my exams are in 5 days and I got nothing to prepare for it. My parents won't even let me take a gap semester/year so I'm totally fucked. Worst case scenario, I repeat those exams in August.",

But someone in my current class made a group me and invited the class for anyone who wanted to make a study group. It's been helpful at least just having a group of people to vent about the class with who actually understand. It has been academically helpful as well in terms of getting things done. I know it's awkward putting yourself out there, but just asking if anyone wants to form a study group can help make some friends. Worst case scenario no one responds and nothing changes lol",
