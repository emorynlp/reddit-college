  "text": "TW: physical assault, racism, sexism\n\nSo, I recently moved in to a nice dorm as a freshman in college, and I did not know my roommate beforehand. I met him on the roommate portal for the college, and he seemed relatable and nice, so I chose him as my roommate. \n\nHowever, once I moved in, I realized that he was very different than I thought. I could tolerate our polar opposite political views, his carnivore diet, and his annoying tendencies.\n\nHowever, what I could not tolerate were his physical tendencies and insults.\n\nMy roommate constantly insults and belittles others, where he has called women \u201cfatasses\u201d and \u201cbig tits,\u201d objectifying them. He has very twisted views about women and minorities, to the point where he has said flat out that he hates all Asian people.\n\nOk, so you might be reading all of this so far and be saying \u201cyeah, he\u2019s a dick, but that\u2019s life.\u201d And this is what I told myself too. Until he was physical with me.\n\nFirst, he fake kidnapped me by texting some of his friends to put a bag over my head while I was walking to the dorm at night. I played along in the moment, but this is a very fucked up thing to do, and the justification I made is that my roommate just loves pranks and this is how he is.\n\nSecond, I got a grade back for an exam I didn\u2019t want to reveal, and he grabbed me and shoved me onto a chair, holding me down until I revealed my grade to him. I don\u2019t really care that I had to give up my grade, but I care A HELL OF A LOT that he grabbed, shoved, and held me down like it is nothing.\n\nThird, my roommate was trying to annoy me by taking over my conversation with someone else by spouting nonsense. I got really frustrated, so I went over to him, tapped his shoulder with a pair of clothes I was holding, and told him to stop. He then proceeded to get up, scream \u201cYou\u2019re dead!\u201d at the top of his lungs, and he pinned me against the wall, screaming into my ears questions about my name , my date of birth, and my favorite color. I felt so confused and violated, so I answered his nonsensical questions and he let me go. While he had me pinned to the wall he screamed in my exposed ear, where every time I would turn my head, he would just go back to screaming in the exposed ear.\n\nStill, I played this off for the night because I didn\u2019t want to address it. Finally at a group therapy session, I worked through what had happened and finally understood what he had done to me was assault. I confronted him , and he didn\u2019t seem to care at all and said what he had done to me was \u201cjust a joke.\u201d So I left him notes that I wasn\u2019t joking and that I was serious about feeling uncomfortable with his actions. At this point , I drove home, broke down emotionally, called my friends to tell them what had been happening, told my mom what had been happening, and validated the feelings I had held in for so long of feeling taken advantage of and violated.\n\nAs of right now, I plan on confronting him on Sunday night when I get back to my dorm with the RA on call in case he gets violent.\n\nMy parents want my roommate to get kicked out of our room by the school, and I kind of do too, but the college doesn\u2019t seem to take stuff like this very seriously and I feel that I will have to leave before he gets kicked out.\n\nHas anyone dealt with anything similar to this, and, if so, what did you do and do you have any advice? I am kind of at a complete loss emotionally and am very unsure of what will happen next.\n\nThank you all for reading. I hope I can get through this.\n\nTL;DR my roommate has repeatedly assaulted me and has this happened to anyone who sees this, do they have advice, and what should I do?",

      "text": "Honestly, this dude needs mental help and you being in the same dorm as this dude is a scary thought. Others are correct. Call the authorities and get it sorted.\n\nAnother thing, I am a dude. I dislike when dudes generalize females into pools of \u201cfatasses\u201d or \u201cbig tits\u201d. It\u2019s not cool and frankly, it just shows a whole lot of immaturity. You really do not have to be a feminist or whatever else to show basic respect for people who aren\u2019t the same gender as you. It\u2019s common sense. Treat people nicely. I still don\u2019t understand why some people still do that. \n\nI\u2019m also asian. It\u2019s sad that we still have racists in 2021. Asians really have gotten the short end of the stick. But, you don\u2019t see any of us outright complaining about it. Racism as a whole, against Asians or not, is such a stupid social construct and one that really has no place in society. \n\nThat being said, I do box and have for a while. If he said any of this to me in person, he\u2019s getting forced into the ring with me and I\u2019m going to toy with him for a couple rounds before he ends up in a wheelchair. Just so he understands the weight of what he\u2019s saying and how fucked it is.\n\nPeople like what you describe have deep rooted anger and project to other people as some sort of relief. Evidently, these people don\u2019t make it very far.",
