  "text": "I want to rant.\n\nI got my grade for this particular assignment back earlier today and I got a 0/100. The professor claims it looks similar to the code of 2 other students. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s even possible due to the fact I did this all by myself and submitted my assignment before anyone else spoke. I then requested to see these codes she claimed I copied, and while it does look similar I can safely say there is no way in hell I copied. Mine looks completely fleshed out while the 2 others look like they where rushed over night and submitted a few minutes before the due date.\n\nI am many things but a cheater ain\u2019t one of them. I feel offended\u2026 I paid for my classes out of pocket and to have this thrown at me is a crime to my character. I emailed my professor immediately after I saw my grade was posted but she has not gotten back to me.\n\nTomorrow I\u2019m going to talk to her and if she won\u2019t budge on accusing me of copying then I\u2019m going to the dean.",

Try to keep your emotions out of it if you do go to the department chair - who, by the way, should be the next stop (don\u2019t go right to the dean - this usually doesn\u2019t go well, and you\u2019ll probably be kicked down to the department chair, anyway).\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Universities have a strict set of guidelines that must be followed in case of possible cheating. Be patient and know the rules. \n\nAt my school, a prof is **not allowed to communicate with a student** if an allegation of cheating has been made. The same may be true at your school. Confronting them will not go well for you.\n\nWhen the time comes, you'll be informed of the next step. You can explain your case then. \n\nMake sure you speak with someone who knows the process. It's very easy to get yourself into trouble if you don't keep quiet.",

Be kind and polite to the instructor and note how you turned it in much earlier than the other two and point out the differences.  Ask her to test your knowledge if she doesn't believe you were capable of the work.\n\nIf she doesn't budge then move up the chain - generally chair, then dean, but follow the order your school has established.",

      "text": "Bruh I swear some of these fuckers think they are some detectives or some shit. Like if u wanted to be a detective ur in the wrong job u fuck. get the fuck out. (Talkin about the professors lol) Also I\u2019m pretty sure in the case of programming there\u2019s a limited amount of ways of doin something. So idk how they can say code looks like someone else\u2019s. What if 2 people think the same way? Why is that not a possibility? Also why is cheating such a big problem on tests and shit? If u have access to information (phone, Google, etc) WHY TF NOT USE IT? To learn a bunch of useless shit in High school?! And then get to college with no real idea of what the fuck to do?",
