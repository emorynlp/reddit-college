  "title:": "So embarrassed after my request for an assignment extension was denied.",
  "text": "I accept that my excuse was probably not a valid one compared to the reasons of some students asking for an assignment, yet I still feel so stupid and am cringing at being such an idiot for even thinking they might consider. I told the truth for why I felt like I needed it, I'm exhausted and stressed and the workload for the semester is massive and also the dates are in a tight time frame, which makes it hard to commit to one and the other. The valid reasons for getting an extension have to be illness or bereavement, something like that, but with a doctor's note, none of which I had, which they said would give me an unfair advantage over other students. I was close to bursting into tears when I saw the email, my head is fried and I'm a fucking idiot for even considering asking them when I had no valid reason in the first place. Also because they probably think I was bullshitting when I said that I have the majority of the work done, and that this was not an excuse for leaving it to the last minute. I'm afraid to show my face again now to the professor.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I had to get it off my chest. TL;DR",

When we get extension requests, we either grant them or we don\u2019t, but we don\u2019t sit there and think \u201cthis person is so awful, omg\u201d and ruminate on it. We just move on from it as part of doing our jobs. Just take a breath.",
