  "text": "I got all A's and B's my freshman year of engineering school. All As first quarter of second year. Traumatic mental health started to kick in the middle of the year. Still got mostly A's and B's but the C's started coming in. 3rd year I got a C every quarter but mostly B's and some A's. Then Pandemic Mode came into full swing and the A's completely disappeared and became B's and C's in my 4th year. Now I am in my 5th year potentially going to get my first D, in a class that's basically review of things I already learned too and most people get A's and B's in (luckily not required for me to graduate but its also a class with information i wanted to specialize in grad school and yet its probably gonna be my worst grade overall). I honestly am exhausted from the bullshit pandemic to fake people and family that drastically just punched me down every step of the way. Glad to be almost done because I have no energy left to care. It really sucks because I originally had my eyes set on graduate school from the beginning and they are going to see this depreciating performance as a sign i would not be successful and it hurts a lot.",
