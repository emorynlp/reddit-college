  "text": "So I notice everyone on here hates Knewton Alta. I\u2019m currently in a Calculus 2 class and we use this for homework AND EXAMS. My answers are usually correct. I got an F on my last exam but all of my calculations are correct. I don\u2019t understand why they would ever let a computer grade MATH. Anyone else have professors that use it for exams?\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be used beyond hw.",
