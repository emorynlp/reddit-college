  "text": "My group is utterly unresponsive in the group chat. I have politely messaged them multiple times  and they all say that they will get started on the project due tomorrow and they never did. I did my part. Anyways, keep in mind that this is a 10-12 page paper with a presentation. There is many components to it. \n\nAlso, I can't even message my professor because they don't care and told another student \"Get used to this. This is the real world\"\n\nI shouldn't have a blow to my 99% in this class because of some fuckers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be  appreciated.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, sometimes you just have to suck it up and do it. I did our whole group project myself. 10 pages with a PowerPoint and a presentation. Zero help from my group. It sucks, but I have to protect my grade. Just make sure they get slaughtered during the presentation I'm making my group read the PowerPoint and it's going to be freaking hilarious when they can't pronounce anything and they have absolutely no idea what's going on.",
