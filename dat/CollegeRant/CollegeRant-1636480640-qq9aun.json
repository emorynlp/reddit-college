  "text": "I need to get my horrible first semester of college out in some form.\n\nI'm a freshman, biochem major. At first, I was doing great in my classes! I always went, was never late. That was the first month or so. Then, in October, I began to miss my classes. First, I missed one class. Then, it became two, then three... and so on. It became this addiction that spiraled out of control. I'm still doing okay in my classes, but I'm getting so lazy. This happened for the ENTIRE month. My parents think I'm doing so great, but in reality I'm not. I can't consider dropping for a bit so I can get myself together. I'm just so confused and sad, really. I'm slowly trying to get myself together, but midterms are coming up, and I want to be prepared for that. I'm so worried, really worried. I know eventually I'll get the motivation again, but I'm not sure when that will happen. I'm still doing okay in my classes, I just don't want to disappoint my parents. I don't want to miss classes anymore, but I can't seem to stop. I don't have any friends to be with, so I'm just skipping to have time to myself I guess. \n\nIf y'all have any advice, feel free to share.",
