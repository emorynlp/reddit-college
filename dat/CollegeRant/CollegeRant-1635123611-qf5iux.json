  "text": "And I never ever though I'd type those words out...\n\nBut this semester is putting me through the absolute ringer. I'm questioning everything, including stupid stuff like good/bad karma, if I deserve bad things, am I somehow a bad person, etc. It is absolutely weakening and making me want to just give up.\n\nBefore I came to this college, I was an honor student and made President's or Dean's list every semester. I was devoted and seemed to gain the benefits of spending so much time studying. This isn't a flex, I just have such severe anxiety about my passing grades that it makes me have to feel like I need A's to pass. I wish every day I could be comfortable with lesser grades like C's or B's, but I will literally have panics every day if not.\n\n4/5 of my courses have no book, which to some is good, but is horrible to me because I am at the mercy of attending every single class (even through Bronchitis) & have severe anxiety about jotting down everything the professor says. At my old college, questions were straightforward and came from the text. Here? They are open to interpretation, there are so many trick questions, and there are \"think outside the box\" questions that are WRONG. Im maintaining decent grades in 4 of my classes still, but 1, a 100 level course, I'm at risk of failing it because the questions are bizarre.\n\nI've attended office hours of this professor, I've pleaded with her about questions, and I've even provided so many examples of why these questions are flat-out wrong. And yes, I have been respectful about it too. The professor just laughs and says that isn't what SHE believes, and yes, what she believes is flat out wrong in some instances.\n\nBut this isn't even the heart of the issue. I needed to get out of my family home and away, so I opted for dorm-living because I thought it would be easier. It's absolutely not, even though it should be.\n\nI'm having financial issues because the workload doesn't allow for any sort of job, my classes are staggered throughout the day so I can't get a part time job even. My anxiety is so bad so I can't open commissions for my artwork even because I can't sit down and do anything. I just worry constantly. I've lost hair, I've lost weight, I've lost appetite, I'm a nervous wreck. I can't do anything on weekends because I've just lost any and all will to even leave.\n\nOn top of this, my ex roommate tried to fight me so I needed an emergency room switch not even halfway through the semester. I've replayed the scenario constantly in my head to see if I did anything wrong and I genuinely can't find any reason as to why she would do this to me. We were so cool from the beginning, I helped her out tremendously during move-in, I furnished the dorm with nice furniture that I both bought and brought from home, etc. I decorated it, brought extra supplies for her side of the dorm, everything. I did go through the proper avenues like getting a no-contact order, but I still just can't believe someone would do this to me.\n\nOn top of this, I've lost//had stuff stolen from me 2 times already. (My ID and Debit cards). My current roommates are very nice, but they aren't very sympathetic of any of my struggles, and they are very dismissive of me. And I can understand this because I think I'm annoying. My old dorm was much bigger so I brought extra stuff to put places. When I moved into their smaller dorm, I feel like I just have so much stuff everywhere. I also have art projects that I do and I feel like it clutters their space. I'm constantly apologizing but I feel like they are very distanced from me. I hate thinking Im the annoying, and try and do better, but I feel like it might be too late.\n\nMaybe the think I'm a bad person or something because my last roommate didn't like me, so why should they trust me?\n\nRegardless, I constantly think of just dropping out and quitting everything. I've had public breakdowns this semester which have been so embarrassing, I just can't control it. I think teachers think I'm annoying because I raise my hand, I think classmates think I'm annoying because I raise my hand, just everything seems to be horrible at this school.\n\nI distrust people more since being here, my ID got stolen so I hate the idea of someone using it who is probably underage, I feel just awful constantly. I'm not getting sleep, I'm laying in my bed a lot more upset, I'm not the person who I was before.\n\nI'm posting this mostly as a rant, but any positive encouragement is absolutely needed too.\n\nTL;DR: Sucky college semester, sucky ex roommate, I feel like I'm also the sucky roommate, bad teachers, not the best grades, not taking care of myself, feeling hopeless. :/",

      "text": "You really have to relax. I know it's not that easy, but try to remember that most of the stuff you're going through ultimately doesn't matter. You didn't go to college to be cool and perfect and popular. I don't know what your major is, but something tells me that having a perfect 4.0 GPA probably isn't the make-or-break for your career. Let some things slide and focus on yourself.\n\nThe schoolwork may be difficult, but I have a saying: The first step to solving any puzzle is to assume there's a solution. Don't give up.\n\nThe financial situation sounds tight, but that's what loans are for (as well as Grants and Scholarships). As much as I dislike the college loan system, they should allow you to just focus on your studies if you didn't have enough savings or support to pay out of pocket.\n\n(Also, what is a \"wrong question\", if I may ask...?)",

          "text": "Thank you, I definitely needed to hear a lot of this. :) You\u2019re great at giving advice!\n\nI actually have been getting all of the above, including loans. Ive just been financially on my own since my early teens, in regards to extras, and have monthly payments to make. I\u2019ll be fine, and I know this. :)\n\nAnd in reference to your question, I\u2019ve had professors who have created straight up incorrect questions with wrong everything. Some professors love that I point out incorrect test questions, others are very very stern on their views. Ironically, the stern ones usually have the most *wrong* questions. \n\nJust inserting the most absurd, blatant example: one professor wrote a question about how \u201cintroducing cats to an island is bad because they eat birds\u2026.\u201d that is all she wrote. I answered yes, and how it would be bad, and it was marked wrong. I debated her and she told me it was wrong because introducing cats to in island is bad because not only do they eat birds, but the birds might also have a lower population (?) and have nowhere to escape (the cats). \nI was dumbfounded. Brand name colleges don\u2019t mean shit, I just want to get my degree and move on hahaha.",

              "text": "Thanks for the compliment!\n\nYeah, that is kind of ridiculous. Open-ended questions like that usually don't demand specific answers, and I'd be surprised if other students in the class didn't have similar difficulty. Have you tried reaching out to other students? I've found that making a friend in the class, or finding some student community thing (like a forum or chat server), helps a lot when it comes to bad professors.",

      "text": "I don't think you can blame your issues on the semester, I think you should place the blame on your environment. Your school just sounds shitty. There are schools with \"alternative\" learning environments that help you focus on one or two classes at a time. There are schools where professors don't have tenure so they have to actually put an effort into teaching. There are schools where the students aren't a\\*\\*holes.",

You were just closest to proximity and it\u2019s bound to happen to the next roommate. \n\nI think you should see a therapist, it also sounds like you\u2019re going through rejection sensitive dysphoria. It\u2019ll help to look at your situation in another perspective (which I\u2019m still needing help with).",
