My professor let me call them out in class so I made it painfully embarrassing.\n\nThey still did nothing so I\u2019m explaining it all, and finishing the work myself. Suck it up, get it done.\n\nMy suggestion to everyone? Always call these people out, at school, at work, document it, prove it, let them burn and move on. If you\u2019re doing all the work you are a fucking ROCKSTAR. \n\nKnow your worth, they are lazy ass deadbeats and always will be. You are not, get the project done, roast them, move on and go crush your future career.",
