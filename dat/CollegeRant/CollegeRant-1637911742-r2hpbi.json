  "text": "So I messed up with my close group of friends recently. We are a knit group of four and we have been very close over the past few months. I just lost my grampa a few days ago, so I\u2019ve been down emotionally and have been a little depressed but also a little rude to others around me because I\u2019m in a rough spot.\n\nHowever, after we ended a call chatting on Discord while playing a game, I realized that I haven\u2019t been a very good friend to them.\n\nFirst, I joke around to one of the friends saying that her parents don\u2019t love her, and I know it\u2019s really messed up but I apologized and she forgave me but said to never do it again.\n\nThen, we hopped on an audio call and we start talking about this guy from my other friend\u2019s high school, who was a former friend. so I decide to come clean and tell my other friend that I viewed his Facebook profile to search up the guy a while back because he told me he was an anti vaxxer, and I hate anti vaxxers so so much. I guess I didn\u2019t realize that some people don\u2019t appreciate \u201cstalking\u201d, so he was very uncomfortable with that. I told him that it was only fair I brought it up because I didn\u2019t want to keep it in anymore and he deserved better. I apologized for my mistake and he said he forgives me too but not to do something like that again. but then he left the call. Then my other friends all left too suddenly. I worry that the entire group had lost respect for me upon coming clean with the fuckup I made.\n\nI text the last friend in our group, The other guy friend. He says I shouldn\u2019t worry too much about the conflicts with the others, and that he would still talk to me. but I worry the other two lost respect for me even though I apologized and they forgave me. \n\nI\u2019ve done a lot of things for them as well and vice versa, but keeping score in friendships is one way to lose them. I\u2019ve been in a bad situation financially and emotionally, and they know that, but it\u2019s not really an excuse for my actions towards them.\n\nWe usually meet at school to hangout after class, but when we return from Thanksgiving break, Should I distance myself from them to let them get over the fact that I\u2019m not a very good friend? I figure if the two of them don\u2019t want to talk to me then I won\u2019t talk to them anymore out of respect. I understand if they can\u2019t be friends with me anymore and I\u2019ll just make new friends if anything, learn from my mistakes and move on. Basically if they reach out and want to talk, I\u2019ll see them face to face to talk. Otherwise I rather just distance myself for a while, possibly forever. \n\nTLDR: I haven\u2019t been a very good friend. I may have destroyed our friendship forever. Deciding on distancing myself from them because they deserve better than me. I don\u2019t deserve them.",
