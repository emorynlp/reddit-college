  "text": "I failed a class....got a D. Not a high D either, but a mid level one. It's been a rough semester but I didn't put in the work I really needed to. I think that's actually why I had a rough semester in large part. College is a bit more difficult for me than most, but it's not like I'm incapable of performing better. I scrapped by on a couple of classes. Heck, one teacher has even given me an extension to finish my work.\n\nI'm just rather upset with myself. I kind of hate that in college there's this kind of culture where I'm just here for the grade - doesn't even matter how I get it. It makes it difficult to try and push myself to be better. I just kind of settled in and accepted it. People joke about slacking off and I don't know...I'd like to improve but it seems so normal to me. I've made a few changes....but it's become a habit in my life.\n\nI almost got a B in one class, but I fell 1% too little. *sigh.*\n\nEdit: spelling",
