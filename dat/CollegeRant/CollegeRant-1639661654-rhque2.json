  "text": "I have a shifting circadian rhythhm. If I sleep at 10 PM on one day, the next day it will be 11PM and it goes on around the clock like this. I keep switching from nocturnal to normal.\n\nBecause of this I thrived during online learning when all classes were recorded and had an asynchronous format. I was at my peak levels, mentally and physically. And my grades skyrocketed.\n\nBut then when in-person classes came again, I just couldn't adapt back to a normal routine. Tired, exhausted, and stressed out all the time.\n\nSome professors have called me lazy when I miss classes or think that I'm an insincere student. But I miss them because of the struggle of this shifting rhythm. \n\nAny other students who have this? I don't know how common this is, but I have heard of some other individuals having this.",

      "text": "I have a long circadian rhytm lol - I sleep at 10PM, then 11PM, then 12PM, then 1AM, ...\n\nThe trick is to have some days where you just get up early and be tired, but then go to bed early. Like if I pushed my sleeping to 2AM then I will get up at 8AM/9AM regardless. Then I can sleep earlier than normal, have a long sleep, and still wake up early in the morning.",
