  "title:": "\"It's impossible to read all of the material I assigned!\"",
  "text": "\"Just skim the reading, get the main points, be efficient!\"\n\"Just read the first and last sentences of the paragraphs.\"\n\"Don't read every word.\"\n\nSo far this semester three of my professors have said some kind of iteration of reading efficiently and skimming. \n\nAm I the only one that thinks this is bullshit? Isn't the point of reading to learn something? If I can get all of that information by skimming (which I personally can't) why even bother assigning seven articles and a chapter each week? If there's so much material that it is impossible to actually read it, surely there is a better way to summarize main points.\n\nIdk I'm a senior and this is my first time having professors tell us that it's \"impossible\" to throuroughly read everything they assign. I get reading efficiently for things like academic journal articles I guess, but this is like the meat of the material we cover. We're really just supposed to skim for information? Why even bother?",

      "text": "Personally this irritates me bc then the details in the fine print are on the final. That's if it's textbook reading. If it's a text you want to write a paper on , you need to get a reading of those itty bitty details or you'll try to address a question or explore a theme without that one explicitly written sentence that you missed (from skimming). This is why it the syllabus has everything ahead of time, i read it ahead of time so I can read through it carefully",

              "text": "I get that. I think my real issue stems from the emphasis of quantity of material over quality that seems to be the norm in academia. If it's like this in undergrad, I imagine it only gets worse. So I understand how it's a legitimate skill, I just feel frustrated with how learning seems to be valued in college. I feel like I never retain more than bits of information after the semester ends. Maybe that's just my experience.",
