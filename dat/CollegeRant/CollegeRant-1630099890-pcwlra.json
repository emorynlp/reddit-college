  "title:": "A rant on Title IX",
  "text": "Work at college had title IX training it it was really sus. I definitely think title IX is great, but i found out the application of it is very discriminatory.\n\nWe were given scenerios and that's when the discrimation was quite clear. One scenerio was a girl just said \"something that happened over the weekend makde her uncomfortable and doesn't want to talk\" and many said that us staff had to report it (justifiably so. We are mandated reporters). The next scenerio was a guy who was in a relationship where is gf was ruining his grades through things like changin password ls for accounts, disconnecting his laptop in tests, zoom classes, etc. And is always trying to sabatoge bc \"he spends too much on school.\" The guy's grades are falling, the professor is concernes, and the guy said that he's \"very uncomfortable at home.\" The response from the group though was \"It's his responsibility to deal with it because he chose to be in this relationship.\" \n\nI'm like damn, what tf is this standard? Both scenerios should be reported because there is a reasonable suspicion in botn scenerios. But apparently, when it's a guy, than it's they guy's fault. But when it's a girl, then better safe than sorry. Tf is this inconsistent shitty standard.",
