  "text": "Never again ( my preference, if it works for you that's fine. However, I need to rant about this lol) \n\nSo this class (International Business) ran for a month during the summer. It was asynchronous and mainly just involved reading a lot. I'm interested in this sort of thing and I have to take it anyway so figured I would get it out of the way. \n\nWe had three exams, 50 questions each, and all together they were worth 60% of our grade. I studied, read the chapters, made my own study guide on top of what the teacher provided us with etc. \n\n1st exam: 86% \n\nOkay, well I'll study harder this time. \n\n2nd exam: 82% \n\n....Wow. Well, there's still a shot, let me go hard for this next exam. \n\nI make this study guide-bibe hybrid and study it first thing in the morning, first thing at night. \n\nI take the exam today. \n\n3rd exam: 78%\n\n... and unless my paper and discussion board knocks the professor's socks off I'm probably getting a C and my GPA is going to throw itself into a volcano. Super disappointed in myself, but I'll just try harder in this upcoming semester. \n\nDid anyone else take an accelerated class this summer or in the past? What was your experience?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \n\nTook a class over the summer that I thought would be easy. Sucked on the exams big time, cue me going \"wahh\".",

      "text": "Some  lasses need to have normal paced registration options . I\u2019m terrible at languages and I need to take two years / 4 classes of a language. I put it off for as long as possible. And now! Out of no where, the university decided to make almost every single class 6 week accelerated instead of its normal 16 weeks this way they can go from 3 semesters to 7 terms with some breaks in between and graduate people faster. What used to take someone 8 semesters/4 years roughly will now take 2-3 years depending on how many courses each term you take. So me, someone who can barely figure out the basics of a foreign language will have \u201ctwo years of language credit\u201d in 4 terms / 24 weeks \u2026 that\u2019s less than 6 months! If I\u2019m even able to pass the first one, let alone the other three more advanced courses in 6 weeks. Gah! I\u2019m so sick of the constant pressure to get done faster!",

Worst part is idk if >63% is a good approximation either since our last few exams haven\u2019t been graded yet because of the nature of a summer course. Just gotta pray and hope i passed",
