Now I have to deal with the stress of obtaining any kind of housing/ meal plan refund and the possibility of moving out of the dorm. All this comes to light after they have my money...convenient to say the least.",

I mean I was kinda hope that I could attend \u201cin person\u201d classes for this fall but now it\u2019s just not worth it anymore. I don\u2019t know if I should just sublet this apt then go home or keep this place for the next semester if thing will be back to normal then?",

Unless things are abruptly changed by a successful and widespread vaccine, the trajectory for Covid is going to be the same in January as it is now. And if the campus does resume fully in person for the spring, I think student numbers will still be depressed enough that there will be plenty of housing to go around.",
