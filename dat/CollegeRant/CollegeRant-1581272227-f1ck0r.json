  "text": "Why am I paying the professors salary just for them to force me to buy a fucking access code shit software that auto grades and makes content for them? Professors don't do anything anymore.\n\nI have a professor that does not teach jack shit. ~160 kids in this class, there's only 2 TAs and 1 prof. The purpose of this class is to do all the work on your own outside of class, then show up for questions. How the fuck am I supposed to ask questions if there's 159 other kids raising their hands asking questions? I swear to fuck I spend the entire class with my hand raised waiting for a TA to show up. I send emails and they don't get answered. The best resource is other students. \n\nI have another prof, she is the ONLY professor who teaches a specific class which is required for my degree. There is no other option. I had an online (auto graded) assignment marked wrong, I sent her proof that I was right, and I didn't get a reply. I come into class *6 fucking days later* and confront her, and I asked \"did you receive my email or did I send it to the wrong person?\" and she says she got it but didn't read it. Well okay, a day or two or 3 is understandable. A fucking *week* later and still no reply (and no reply to this day, 10 days later) is fucking absurd. My grade still hasn't changed.\n\nI had another professor 2 semesters ago (spring 2019), and once again, I got an answer marked wrong that was correct. Emailed this lady and she replied standing by her typo and told me tough shit, you still got it wrong. This is for a programming quiz (data structures). A typo is the difference between right at wrong. \"quizBank\" is NOT the same as \"quziBank\", those are 2 completely fucking separate variables. She ignored all further emails, which I made very polite because my grade is in this woman's hands. This lady did not do anything at all except 1 quiz a week based on zybooks. The midterm and final were proctored, not by the school, so we had to pay out of pocket to take our fucking exams. $60 I wasn't expecting to pay, which isn't too bad, but why the fuck do I have to pay for that? There's no resources on campus for proctored exams? Fucking seriously? I can say I learned absolutely nothing at all about data structures but still somehow got a B. Fuck you [removed], you're fucking lazy and absolutely useless. Google her and check out that fantastic rate my professor rating. Edit I changed my mind on putting her name.\n\nFinancial aid. I met with a financial aid bursar lady fall 2018 who was reluctantly helpful. She sighed and sounded annoyed that she found me a $500/semester grant. Great! Any little bit helps, thank you! I only got this grant for 1 year. Last year, spring 2019, I went to meet with her only to find out she doesn't meet with students anymore. Neither does anyone in financial aid. Their whole office was relocated to another building. So I go and find out *other STUDENTS* are now handling finances. Fantastic, what's better than a barely paid 19 year old handling my finances? Them bullshitting every fucking question I ask them. They don't know the fucking answers. I call them out and say it's okay to say you don't know something, but don't fucking spread misinformation, especially on something that cost me $1000 a year and other students thousands as well. Fuck you. Now that grant I had is seemingly \"lost\", I can't meet with anyone over the age of 20, and I'm genuinely fucking annoyed. Some of these kids want to be helpful, but it's like they're trained to tell you whatever answer comes off the top of their fucking head at that moment. \"hmmmm *I think* it's because -blahblahbullshitanswer-.\" I've almost had to drop out on multiple occasions due to a lack of money. I got denied every federal and private loan. I applied for around 6 private loan companies. Federal is determined by the financial aid office, except parent plus which I was denied on with both my parents. My credit is great, 730, I've had an auto loan for $35k and I paid it off entirely (and my credit dropped because now my average age of credit is lower lmfao) and apparently that doesn't mean shit. My parents have $300,000 and $40,000 in student loans for my sister's private college loans, so I can't get money, my younger brother went to the military because he can't get help and had no money of his own, and now my younger sister who's still in HS doesn't believe me when I say she has to work, make money like I did, and pay your own way through college as you go. There is no money or loans that will magically appear. Just as you scrape by to pay the tuition by the due date, you're fucked in the ass with $400 in access codes and out of pocket housing / food costs. \n\nBack to access codes. Nearly every professor requires zybooks, Pearson mylab, wiley plus, or some other dog shit software that the students are required to pay for. Why are we paying the university and then paying a 3rd party to do our homework? These companies are determining the fucking prices. If the prof says \"we're using zybooks, this is the code\", there is *No. Other. Choice*. You are forced to pay whatever zybooks/pearson/wiley/whoever says you gotta pay. $60? $90? $120?? Pay it or fail. Textbooks are no longer as widely used because kids pirate them because they're charging $200 for a fucking textbook. What is the fucking incentive for these professors to be using this software? Zybooks is absolute shit. Complete one section, get to the next, and all the answers from last section are gone. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong. There is no learning going on here. It's only useful for information, but it even fucking sucks at that because it doesn't go in depth on anything. \n\nI'm running out of money and patience. If anyone has any advice or information to help me keep my fucking sanity please share.",

      "text": "Sophomore here, I feel your pain and your experience is not unique. Now for problems with a professor I\u2019d talk to your advisor and explain your issues with that prof and if they say basically that sucks but that\u2019s college I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to look up your professors boss and see if you can contact them directly (most/all college have a directory on their website clearing showing their job title) so I\u2019d email them and explain their lack of ability to properly perform their job in a reasonable manner. Any prof that isn\u2019t willing to correct a grade is completely failing at their job and unless their boss has their head up their ass will definitely tell them to get their crap together. \nFor FASFA, the website (student aid.gov I think?) has resources you can read to get help and info on how to handle things. Honestly YouTube also has some good tutorials and explanations of how to handle different aspects of the aid process. It often sucks but sometimes you just have to google \u2018how to handle financial aid on your own as a student\u2019 and just read what you can. It\u2019s not great, your financial aid dept. should be helping you guys and it\u2019s BS they don\u2019t. Your advisor might be able to help you though. \n\nOverall you are right everything you listed is the stupidest crap I\u2019ve ever heard and I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with all that.",
