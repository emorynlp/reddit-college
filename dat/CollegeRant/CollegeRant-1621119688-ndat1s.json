  "text": "words can\u2019t describe how much anxiety I am feeling right now. I don\u2019t have therapist but I am seriously considering getting one. \n\nSo two of my classes I need to pass or I\u2019ll retake it. I don\u2019t have room to retake any classes. \nI know it\u2019s my fault for not doing these assignments sooner. But I\u2019m failing two of my classes. One I\u2019m almost to pass level of 67% , I just need a C. \nI emailed my professor and she said I could redo the last project for a higher grade by Sunday ( tomorrow) \n\nThen my other class which I admit I tossed to the side most of the semester. I was close to a D 53% , so I just did the couple of assignments thinking it would my grade enough. WRONG he gave me an F again and told me to read the comments and re submit by 5/17 at 11:59 .\n\nI am beyond stressed out and my anxiety is going through the roof",

      "text": "Hey there, I\u2019m sure this is completely stressing you out so let\u2019s think about dealing with that first. Nothing is more important than your mental health. This year was insane and you\u2019re not alone with how you\u2019re feeling. And it\u2019s hard, but try to remember this is a blip in the timeline of your life. The fact that it upsets you shows that you\u2019re dedicated to making changes next year. Even if you have to take summer classes or speak to your counselor about taking a course at community college for credit if that\u2019s an option those are possible \u201cfixes\u201d for this specific situation, but long run getting a handle on your feelings, stress, and anxiety is the most important thing because that exists every day of that timeline. Go speak to someone. There are online options, group options, and as someone mentioned perhaps through your school. Getting through this year is with \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f it\u2019ll be ok keep reaching out to vent whenever you need.",

      "text": "First off, calm down it could be muchhh worse. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is next semester consider going to your counseling office and scheduling sessions with a counselor. I actually lost it one semester and had to file a medical appeal because I failed 3/4 of my classes and couldn\u2019t concentrate. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and are considering therapy, do it through school where it\u2019s free vs. $100+ per session (I did both) and spending unnecessary money. \n\nGood luck on your assignments! BREATHE and just go one step at a time.",

      "text": "The good news is that you still have control over your final grades.\n\nNot sure what your classes are, but I'm sure they were difficult. Definitely do whatever you need to do in these next two days to pass. You're lucky to get a second chance on your final projects lol, even if I asked my profs they probably wouldn't do that for me.\n\nI believe in you and while I do feel your pain, this kind of situation will make you a better student in the future. After the semester ends, do *not* dwell on it and make a plan for future classes. If you need to take off a semester after feeling burnt out, then do it. Pinpoint things that are in your control that adversely affected your classes and try to change them.",
