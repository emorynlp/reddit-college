  "text": "Long story short, both loans couldn\u2019t cover my tuition because my school never informed me until late that they charge for a insurance fee and other random schools fees I couldn\u2019t get out of. I was so proud of myself for going and getting my bachelors and as a Criminology major I technically have no choice because all my career options require a BA. Was very \u201cnice\u201d to wake up one morning and check my account to see that almost 2000$ was left for me to pay out of pocket. I\u2019m a 3.5 honors student and couldn\u2019t get any scholarships. I have no support from family because I\u2019m trans and they refuse to be around me. Like I don\u2019t know if anyone has been through this but genuinely what do I do\u2014 I\u2019m 25\u2013 people 21 already have their degrees. I work at a petsmart like I have never been so lost I guess. Growing up I\u2019ve always been in school. Even when I took a gap I was self studying. I would love to work with juveniles but I can\u2019t without a bachelors. This sounds so gross and whiny of me, but has anyone dealt with this? Where you realized you can\u2019t obtain your dream degree anymore? I was thinking of just getting my associates in criminology and at least I\u2019ll have 2 associates right?\n\nTL;DR\n\nI found out I can\u2019t afford school and now I don\u2019t know where to go from here.",

They then told me to do the unsub loans, I did that but just last week I found out that even that won\u2019t cover all of it because my school failed to tell me there were like 50 other fees besides just the tuition fee and online virtual fee.",
