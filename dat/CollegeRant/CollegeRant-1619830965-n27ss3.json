  "text": "I just finished my last final for this semester. After working through 2 months worth of long, late night study sessions and drinking through numerous cans of Red bull, I made it. I did better I thought in most of my classes, but a couple ended up being disappointing. I don't care anymore as long as I passed. I want to cry and I feel like I could cry at any moment, but I'm too happy, relieved, and tired right now. \n\nNow I can actually sleep for as long as I want\n\nThank you for reading \n\nTL;DR: Just finished my last final of the semester and I feel like I could cry and take a long nap",
