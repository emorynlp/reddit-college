  "text": "Hi everyone! I am not sure if this goes against the rules but feel free to remove it if it is. As an undocumented non daca student at UCLA, I am often seeking for advice from people that come from my background. I didn\u2019t find a community on here, so I created r/undocumentedstudents for undocumented students to share advice to one another! Feel free to join this if you are undocumented and share it with other students so we can help one another \ud83d\udc9c",
