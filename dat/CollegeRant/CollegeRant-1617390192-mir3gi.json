I struggled my first semester and a lot in my other math classes because of how much I let my brain rot for 8 years but i overcame it for the most part. \n\nNow, (not so much during online classes because I\u2019m getting my ass kicked) I have shown myself that I\u2019m actually capable of doing the stuff and I\u2019m doing a lot better than I ever thought I could be. I overcame all of my bad decisions and I\u2019m pretty excited to see what kind of future I\u2019ll have after this.",
