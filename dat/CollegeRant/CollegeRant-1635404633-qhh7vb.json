  "text": "\"Now I have a trial exam which is really important as it is a preparation exam for the real one that's going to determine whether I can go to a university or not. The worst thing is they informed us about this exam only two weeks before yesterday and you can't imagine how I freak out studying these past two weeks. I have countless of sleepless night. I spent my days trapped inside my house whilst everyone around my age spend their days hanging out with their friends. I'm an introvert but I'd be lying if I said that I don't want to go out and enjoy my life as a teenage. I hope that all these sacrifices will lead to a better future. All I want is to be really successful to prove that coming from a poor family doesn't mean you can't achieve what you want.\"",
