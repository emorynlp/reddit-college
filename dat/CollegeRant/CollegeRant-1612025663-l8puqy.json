I even told them to be quiet when it is time for me to take the exam and they will only be quiet for the first 5 minutes. I've had moments where I cried while taking the exam because I was so stressed out by the noise. I have nowhere to go either. All the best to you, hope you find a way out.",

Now there\u2019s no escape for students who live at home. I hope you also can find a way out of there.",

I want to get some or those noise reduction curtains, see it that makes a difference but I was waiting for financial aid to hit. I do listen to music when doing my homework, but exams it\u2019s not allowed. We take them on proctorio.",
