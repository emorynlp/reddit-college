I am going to lose some of my class credits because those classes are specific to the school I am currently at and I would be changing my major. Does anyone have experience with the transfer process and losing credits? Is it worth it if all my credits are not going to transfer over?",

      "text": "Hi! I transferred last fall during the pandemic. I lost a lot of my unit because I transferred from the quarter system to the semester system, and my new school didn\u2019t take all of my APs the way my old school did. For me, I felt like it was worth it because my previous school was such a bad experience for me. I was extremely lonely, and had a really hard time with the school\u2019s culture. Now that I\u2019m actually in person at my new school, I still feel like it was worth it even though I have to stay a little bit longer than I wanted because of the opportunities and because of the people and the professors. Personally, I think that the trade off needs to be that you\u2019d enjoy the new school better than the old one in order to justify staying longer and so I think that that also means knowing what you want out of the new school that you don\u2019t currently have. I\u2019m happy to answer more questions if you have any, just lmk!",

      "text": "i transferred to a new university this year while i\u2019m a sophomore at my new university i\u2019m considered a freshmen as one of my 4 credit classes transferred as a 2 credit so i\u2019m short by 2 credits to be considered a sophomore. MY NUMBER ONE suggestion is make sure your new school is what you truly want. I\u2019m considering transferring again as my school isn\u2019t what I want out of my major, granted I was undecided when i did transfer but I wish I researched more and talked to students and alumni about the school before completely transferring as now i\u2019m questioning whether to transfer again my junior year of college or not. Also don\u2019t worry too much about credits as long as your not losing id say more than 3-4 that could potentially lead you to a 5th year or busy schedule one semester or taking summer classes but honestly that\u2019s not such a big deal.",

      "text": "What I will suggest if you transfer is look at how many credits the school can take and what grade minimum they take.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me I'm planning on transferring out of a 2 year school and go into 4 year school (because the 4 year school's requirements for math and science aren't as strict as the two year's). I have close to 30 but the school will only take at max 24 only because most of my courses were graded on the alternative route (Pass/Fail)",

      "text": "In my experience, the further away from your old school you get the less likely the new school will accept your credits. So for me, I stayed in-state so that I wouldn\u2019t loose that many credits and could still graduate on time.\n\nHowever, if you find a school that\u2019s a really good fit for you, it may be worth it to look past loosing credits as you\u2019d be way happier. I\u2019d really make sure you like where you\u2019d transfer.",
