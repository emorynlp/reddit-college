  "text": "I'm really just going off so TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'm currently a senior set to graduate next Fall. I've transferred from community college to this university, and switched my major last year. I knew it was going to take longer to finish, but I wanted to learn the material in this major and felt that I was making the right choice.\n\nLittle did I know all the stupid shit this state puts you through for literally being in school. There's something called an excess hours surcharge where you have to pay double tuition per credit if you're over the threshold of credits it takes for a degree (counts my past major's classes even if it's inapplicable).\n\nThen, I'll be going into Unsatisfactory Academic Progress despite having only A's and B's every semester also because I'm over the maximum time frame of credits attempted... This means I'll also lose finanical aid. A whole double whammy of higher tuition and no aid and I'm expected to just figure it out.\n\nSwitching back? Same situation, yet I'd actually finish even later than next Fall. I've barely even gotten to the main classes I'm most interested in because they're the higher level ones.\n\nI've emailed damn near anyone that's involved in the process and have basically gotten back, \"that sucks, can't help though. Maybe reach out again later when you're in the thick of it.\"\n\nWhen it all hits I'm just straight up screwed, of course I'd reach out in advance to actually prepare for my future of bs. I've quit an internship/volunteer position related to my major to pick up more hours to work yet paying bills and rent on minimum wage doesn't allow me any room for a savings to go towards tuition. The goal was to work to save up for when this shit starts Spring/Summer, but that's already not panning out. I've basically exhausted federal loans and don't qualify for private loans.\n\nPushing back my graduation date to save up brings up a lot of personal stuff with family I don't want to dive into (looking into speaking to a therapist about it), while ultimately I just want to be done with school. I don't ever see myself going for higher education if it's not a full-ride since this stuff has really dampened my whole perception of it. The best thing I've tried to do for myself is strive for all A's and take advantage of career help programs from the school to actually feel like this is worth it. These days it doesn't even feel like I have the time to work on personal projects and learn on my own, hence a 3am rant.\n\nTL;DR: Doubled tuition and losing finanical aid soon, minimum wage sucks, and I don't know how to feel sometimes.",

          "text": "Yes I'm 100% going to, it's just that I have to wait until I hit the Unsatisfactory & actually lose the aid to be able to appeal it so I can't do it preemptively like I wanted to /: Instead I'm in contact with my advisor & filling out the paperwork now so hopefully it'll be processed quicker without any hang ups",
