  "title:": "Struggling to get job so that I can leave college",
  "text": "I'm in the middle of a media course in college and so far it has not delivered on what it promised. Its absolutely straining. I'm way behind on work and now I'm starting to not even show up for lessons. Safe to say, I want to leave badly. Problem is that I've applied for jobs and haven't been able to get one yet. It's starting to get to me mentally. I think I need help to find a way out of this mess of a course. I don't expect anyone to respond, I'm just venting away since my mother's expecting me to so something involving work. What I am certain about is that I've stopped caring about the course and there's nothing that can be said to convince me to try finishing it. I'm so frustrated and have been mentally drained of energy for the last few weeks",
