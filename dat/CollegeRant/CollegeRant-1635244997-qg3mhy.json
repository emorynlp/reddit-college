  "text": "My (F20) health (mental and physical) is terrible. I was educated with the sole purpose of being a good student and if I wasn't, I didn't mean anything to my family. I'm a first gen university student, I'm just asking for a break, I love my degree and I wouldn't drop out. I have awful chronic pain that makes me miss school 2 or 3 times a week and I obviously cannot keep up with my classes because I need to be in bed. My family thinks taking a break is \"wasting a year\", but am I not wasting a year if my grades are so low I'll probably fail everything anyway? My teachers are asking me to take a break for my health because they see me constantly struggling and in pain. But my family won't allow it, and I have 0 independence.\n\nAm I really such an awful and egoistic person?\n\nMy family is threatening me with stopping all communication and monetary support if I take this break. I live with my mom, she'll kick me out. I don't mean anything to them, as a daughter or a sibling, if I'm not studying until I pass out.\n\nI just can't take this anymore.",

      "text": ">Am I really such an awful and egoistic person?\n\nNot at all, OP. Having been there myself, the pain and stress you're experiencing is a perfectly normal and authentic reaction to the situation you have described. Your professors truly have your well-being in mind to recommend that you ought to take a break, and it's completely valid to take a step back from college to heal and recuperate.\n\nIs there someone in your life who you could lean on for emotional and psychological support? Whether you do or not, it would also be worth seeing a counselor at your university that can walk with you through this. They should also be able to help connect you with resources should you decide to take a leave of absence.",

      "text": "the thing is if your struggle with chronic pain is lifelong it\u2019s not going to improve from taking a year off. it might get worse from spending more time sedentary if you don\u2019t fill your time with other things.\n\nI took a year off because I hated my major after my freshman year and the classes I was taking during my first sophomore fall were not making me feel fulfilled. Plus I was lonely and depressed because of covid and I thought if I could improve my mental health before going back it would help my performance.\n\nMy mental health got worse from not having direction, I felt like a failure for dropping out and kept beating myself up constantly for it. I didn\u2019t have a job during this time so most of my days were spent lonely at home. I would not recommend it if that\u2019s what your plan is.\n\nHave a plan for your break if that\u2019s what you decide to do. It will help you heal and give you direction and motivation. I\u2019m really lucky that I found a couple new fields that I\u2019m passionate about and excited to study during my first semester back at school. I\u2019m feeling a lot better now that I\u2019m back on track with a direction.",
