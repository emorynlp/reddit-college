  "text": "I made a post a while back about this same professor.\n\nSo I am looking at the final exam - which is optional and I currently have an A- in the class. To be fair, I only studied for an hour and a half for this exam. HOWEVER. I only studied for this time because there was nothing else to study! To prepare for this exam, all we have are his notes and scattered examples! There were no homework assignments on this material. There were no full examples on this material.... but now we are being tested on this?? I truly don't understand the logic behind this. There's no textbook for this class or anything else. I REALLY wish there was - I'd gain a better understanding of the class. Instead, here I am ending a semester with a descent grade and shitty understanding of the class - and hence why imposter syndrome is even a thing... I graduate with my masters at the end of next semester smh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr professor is testing us on material that we have not had assignments on and his notes do not suffice.",
