  "text": "And then allow our counseling center to remain severely underfunded every year so they can barely help more than a handful of students at a time. Their maximum is 8 free sessions. Not for the semester, the entire fucking academic year.\n\nAfter that they want you to use insurance, but there are many reasons why someone would reach out to them instead of using their insurance. They don't have insurance, they don't have insurance with mental health coverage, their parents wouldn't let them use it, etc\n\nAnd don't even get me started on creating some of the most stressful environments ever. Yeah, college isn't supposed to be a breeze, but there's a reason in the past month there have been ambulances and cop cars having to come on campus almost everyday.\n\nThe school doesn't say anything (probably for fear of bad publicity) but we all know it's most likely because of psychiatric emergencies, especially in regards to thoughts of unaliving. \n\nThese past two years have had to be two of the most stressful academic years that have ever been, and yet, the college does nothing to assist us outside of empty platitudes and workshops on mental health where you get a free squeezy ball or bath bomb just for showing up\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are nice, incredibly helpful people if you're lucky enough to get your foot in the door, but again, they're almost entirely surpressed by the limitations of their budgets\n\nAnd it just feels like if they were able to help everyone way earlier, we wouldn't be in the current situation we're in now where a good chunk of the student population is doing things requiring ambulances and the other chunks are strongly considering following in their footsteps",

Our counseling services place only offers I think like 3 free sessions then they just ship you off to someone off campus. They don\u2019t have any therapists that can work with students the whole semester or however long, it\u2019s more about finding someone off campus, which sucks for me because my health insurance is shit so therapists in town are expensive. Students can get other free/inexpensive health services from the school, but not therapy. Also they\u2019re like \u201cwe hope this email finds you well\u201d and then fail to alert us when theres a bomb threat at a nearby campus. The school knows they\u2019re doing terrible shit and then tell us to practice ~self care ~ lol it sucks",

You can get COVID tests, vaccines (COVID or otherwise), STD/STI testing, gyno appointments, physicals, birth control etc. just fine without similar issues to the counseling center\n\nAnd even if you don't have or can't use insurance, they're pretty good at charging on a sliding scale so you can almost always get whatever you need without it.\n\nOf course it probably also helps that more people can just go there and face less issues in terms of using their insurance or even just going to their regular doctor (most of us are commuters) so idk\n\nIt feels like just another case of mental health not being taken as seriously as physical health, which is odd coming from an institution that often likes to remind us that both are equally important",

      "text": "Hi OP, sorry to hear about your experiences with your university in regards to how they handle mental health issues in students. First off, I want to say that it's ridiculous that we go into thousands of dollars of debt for a degree and we don't get the services for which we pay for. They truly don't care about us and ever since the pandemic, the education system has proven to be more about the profits than the students themselves. To them we are just a number and to expect anything more from them is just second guessing ourselves.\n\nI am assuming when you talk about insurance, you and other students are not able to afford it, am I right? It might be possible for you and other students to go apply for Medicaid. It is not a shame to do so and is better to do this than wait for a broken, underfunded department to help treat any mental health issues. You would have a greater chance at not only getting a diagnosis but also get the proper treatment plan from a professional who is more experienced if you chose to apply for Medicaid. It is disgusting that the administration chooses to fill their pockets and cut budgets to much needed departments that otherwise help students  which helps guarantees success in finishing their degree. \n\nI hope this helps and wish you as well as others at your university best of wishes! This is not a easy time for anyone, but don't let them win. Know your rights and what resources are available. Good luck and godspeed!\n\nYou can find more info about Medicaid on:\n\nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/",

You either receive no help whatsoever or you could even get an ambulance called on you to take you off campus even if you don't actually need it (which I wouldn't be surprised is just to avoid lawsuits because \"we got them the help that you needed to not do anything bad\")\n\nI've had friends with similar experiences to yours in terms of trying to reach out only to be told that they can't get appointments because they're too much demand and not enough people to handle it. This after reaching out because of advertisements about they're \"here to help\" and  how \"services are free w/ tuition or sliding scale\" \n\nIt's especially appalling once you consider how much money a lot of these universities are sitting on so much money or spending on it on things that aren't as important (say president salaries and unnecessary renovations that only exist to pad pamphlets)",

      "text": "I relate. I was assaulted in student housing in my first semester. I went to the counseling center the semester after, did my intake, got told that they would reach out soon with a counselor assignment. Plot twist, no one ever reached out.\n\nI emailed them the following summer semester and asked what happened. They said they assigned me to someone but forgot to email me. That person had left the counseling team and so I was told to do another intake and wait again for an assignment. I got like 4 or 6 zoom sessions with a grad student counselor before she left as well. Asked them not to reassign me.\n\nThey need to do better. They give such an intense shit about things like campus events, sports, academic honesty, drinking. But when their 18 year old students are being sexually abused in the dorms, or they're having mental breakdowns, or they're just struggling as any kid would to transition to college, no one is there. Suddenly there's not enough money to fix that. There aren't enough resources to tackle those problems.\n\nI hear you about the environment being a setup for stress. Just the nature of living alone for the first time, crammed in with thousands of other teenagers under the supervision of other barely-not-teenagers. And now we're expected to live up to the pre-pandemic standards, when we're two years into a global health crisis that has abruptly changed the landscape of schooling and working and living away from home. \"We're here for you.\" \"We're understanding of the situation.\" \"We want to help.\" Except you can't email students back when they approach you *literally in crisis?* When that is actually your *whole ass job?*\n\nAll the school has done in response to my crisis is take away my scholarships when it started to impact my GPA. Funny how they didn't forget that email. It was detailed and right on time, and it's the only thing they actually did.\n\nTheir counseling was half assed and unreliable. Some individual professors have been understanding but numerous others have a hatred for being reached out to. They tell their students to email a TA instead of them, even when most TAs are just students themselves. These kids should be handling homework questions, not peer mental breakdowns. This elitist bullshit is isolating to students. Professors are the adults in the room, just like counselors and administrators and everyone else who refuses to hold themselves accountable for student health.",

They care about protecting the school as an institution and keeping the cash flow in via donors and kids from wealthy families who can pay out of pocket. But when it comes to actually helping students once they're not just potential freshmen, they stop giving a shit and it shows\n\nAnd I keep forgetting that we're dealing with everything in top of s fucking pandemic that is *still fucking ongoing for almost three years*.

A lot of my friends are psych majors and they still have to take stats courses which are apparently very unpleasant\n\nAnd no matter what field, a lot of these classes are made harder by bad professors, heavier than necessary workloads with absurd deadlines, and curriculums that prioritize making money by forcing students into buying extra modules than actually ensuring they learn and retain the information that they need to progress in that field after graduation.

But there is literally NO support at all. I suffer from bipolar disorder and I\u2019m grateful I have insurance so I see a therapist and someone who manages my meds. But on the college campus they have online meetings(cause of covid) literally 5 times a year for the whole school year for people with mental health problems. On their mental health page they give resources for mental health in the community but they literally have no resources at the college. There is no club. No therapist. Nothing. It\u2019s horrible. And the community I live in has shitty help that people go to Corvallis which is a larger city an hour away because there are no resources here. A lady killed herself and her kids at the bridge here in my town because she kept going to the mental health community center for help but nobody would help her so she killed herself and her family. It\u2019s sad. But my best advice is you can\u2019t sit back and complain, if you want change you have to advocate for it. I have had enough myself that a friend of mine are starting a mental health club at our school in a couple terms from now. It\u2019s desperately needed as I hear so many of my classmates talk and struggle and ask for support but the school offers none. It\u2019s not just the school, but everywhere. There is tons of people struggling with mental health and there are very limited resources. You just have to step out of your comfort zone and advocate for change. Consider trying what I am and starting a club, or finding one and become extremely involved and helping to run it. We need more students like you who are struggling and want change, so be that person who changes the system and creates the environment you want for yourself.",
