  "title:": "[US, Graduate School] After this semester, I absolutely hate college.",
  "text": "I am doing a graduate school in Computer Science. I like the field, but absolutely hate college. I fucking despise it. Watching a professor with a dead look in his eyes go over PDF slides with a flat voice tone is just killing me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pandemic, or I am just burnt out, but I just want it all to end already. College is not a good representation of the real world. I have one more Final Exam and a Final Project. I have one more semester left, I  just want it all to end already. I am fucking done.",

You'll get through it though! I'm not sure if semesters work the same for you guys, but for most it's almost over.",

He\u2019s generally a nice and happy man but last semester was hard for him. He loves to be active and attentive with his students usually but he said not being in person really made him lose it.",

      "text": "From a professors perspective, after three semesters of virtual learning, teaching to a blank screen without anyone using a camera or mic, it\u2019s terribly difficult to muster the enthusiasm.  It just perpetuates the cycle - students think the profs suck, profs want nothing more than to feel like they\u2019re not talking to students who have logged in and walked away.  It\u2019s a rough go, that\u2019s for sure!",

Everyone is like \u201care you excited\u201d and of course I say yes just to avoid talking about it, but honest to god I\u2019m not. That\u2019s because this whole covid online thing has ruined college for me and I don\u2019t like it anymore. I do think it will be better this year because all my classes are gonna be 100% in-person and it\u2019ll be more like the traditional college experience (I\u2019ll be living on campus as opposed to commuting which I did in CC) but online learning has been a complete killjoy.",
