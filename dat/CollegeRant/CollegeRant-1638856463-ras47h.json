  "title:": "Finished the final, everything is graded. I am 3 points from a B and its my own fault because I missed a whole-ass test with no excuse and I turned a paper in 6 days late.",
  "text": "I mean, I have so many places I tripped up in this specific course. I did so badly on the quizzes and tests and so good on the written stuff(except the deadline thing). The prof has no space in the syllabus for extra credit and I feel like I did C work because I missed a whole-ass test with no excuse I just forgot about the class for a week! BUT its so close (397 of 500 points) and all I want to do is slip the guy a $1 per point and get exactly 80% and move on.\n\nEdit: emailed the TA, seeing if there is any possible extra credit. The cards will fall where they may.",
