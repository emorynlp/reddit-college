  "text": "I just started college and it's going ok I guess, however I'm told In 2 weeks that in getting my financial aid check dispersed. My peers are saying we can spend it on whatever we want a phone a car shoes clothes food Xbox ext. Is this true my tuition is covered by financial aid and so are my books. Do I get this check every semester and what do I use it for ?",

      "text": "Definitely don\u2019t spend it freely. You can actually reduce your loan if you don\u2019t feel like you need that much extra. Ideally, you get a loan that covers tuition, housing, and whatever other school supplies you may need. They do send you a check with your extra balance each semester. The total of that will change each year though most likely (it\u2019s simply your approved FAFSA student aid minus the tuition- there will be a billing page on your school website that will have a breakdown somewhere). Like others have said, I\u2019d keep the extra for emergencies and things you may need. I used a lot of mine for gas when I was commuting. The next year I used a good chunk of it to get a new computer for both school and home use. This year I\u2019m having to get dorm supplies and keeping a good chunk of it in case I have any car problems since I have a long drive multiple times a week. It\u2019s not free money, this is all going to be owed back plus interest after you\u2019re done with school.",

                      "text": "Okay, then you should be good if it\u2019s a grant and it fully covers your tuition. Just make sure it\u2019s fully covered by the grant each year when you re-apply for your FAFSA. I\u2019ve learned calling your financial aid office is quite quick, informative, and cuts a lot of the email questions, so I just call to ensure everything is set each year when they process my loans (or what would be a grant in your case). The FAFSA website will walk you through the aid information if it\u2019s going to be a loan. Generally a Pell grant would be a semester-by-semester thing based on family and the school. I\u2019d still recommend saving some of the cash in case you aren\u2019t eligible for the grant in future semesters by chance (if you\u2019re against a loan) or just school needs as it\u2019s quite expensive in every way they can possibly make it.",

      "text": "Every semester you will get one lump sum of your aid package. If your aid covers your tuition and there is still some leftover after that balance is paid, one check (or deposit if you have direct deposit) will be given to you with the remaining amount. You can spend it on whatever you want. Generally, I use mine to pay for things like rent or parking. The money won't drop until a few weeks in to each semester because they need to confirm your attendance. One of the reasons your professors are absolutely mandated to take attendance for the first few classes is because they have to report to the school that you showed up before they will give you aid.\n\nI do not advise using this money on things like video games and non school stuff. You're taking out thousands of dollars of loans for your education and you should put it towards that, like buying your books or if you need a parking pass. Or save it for an emergency.\n\nTo check on how much you will be getting in financial aid, you can generally look it up in whatever your school's dashboard for the bursar/registrar/financial aid stuff is. The website you would use to pay tuition and register for classes.",

I essentially was given more scholarships than I need, but since they are scholarships and not financial aid, regardless of what happens I get to keep what I don\u2019t spend. So I literally get paid to go to college right now. If you are getting money from FAFSA or something then your probably won\u2019t get that grant again. If it\u2019s a loan then you obviously have to pay it all back eventually",
