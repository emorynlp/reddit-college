  "text": "I want to start off by saying yes I know news papers/journalists need to make money to. \n\nI absolutely hate when I have to do research for a paper or project and I go to click on an article and get blocked by a pay wall. Like come on I can\u2019t afford to pay to have access for every major reliable news outlet. I just want to be able to do my course work for crying out loud without paying more to learn then I already have. Even the student rates they have add up when you need 10 different sources for a paper.",
