  "text": "It's very annoying to constantly have class end more than an hour before it's posted.  Like I understand the first week or maybe 20 minutes but why am I driving out here for a 3 hour class to be here for an hour and \"Enjoy the weather\" 3/4 weeks so far.  \nAlso why are we only learning this at the start of the class period?",

          "text": "It's a lab class.  First day we didn't do a lab and only stayed for an hour.  Second day we didn't do a lab and went over 1 example problem and talked about lab 1.  That could have been combined.   Second lab, we set up a lab for 40 minutes and leave early instead of going over next week or any lab that can fit the time.\n\nIt's seems very Counter productive to cut class early because I already set aside the time and know that I took a 3 hour lab class.",
