  "text": "So I\u2019ve applied and got accepted as a peer tutor, I\u2019ve been walked through the applications/software and stuff. So when I started, I realized there are scheduled tutoring sessions and drop-ins. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m paid with the drop-in ones. \n\nLike, do I only get paid when someone drops in during my hours or I also get paid if no one does? I\u2019ve sworn I read every file and I haven\u2019t seen where it is clearly stated.\n\nThis is my first ever job so I\u2019m kind of clueless. Hope you can help me understand this because I need to enter my time and I don\u2019t want to f\u2019 up.",
