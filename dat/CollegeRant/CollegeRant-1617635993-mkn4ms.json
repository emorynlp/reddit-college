Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love being a music major, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so much in terms of time. My Tuesdays and Thursdays I\u2019ll be at school from 8:00 AM (definitely earlier for parking) until my piano class ends at 6 PM. With 5 90-minute classes across the whole day. \n\nCurrently I have like 9 classes at 18 I think. So this will be a blast.",

      "text": "LOL @ the fact that I knew you were a music major just from reading the title. \n\nThey really do us dirty with these 0 and 0.5 credit classes and on top of that practicing our instrument for hours + lessons. And you're a pianist? (I am a piano major) so you have to memorize rep for juries/performances. Painful...\n\nThey work us so hard that spending the whole day in the music building straight from 8am-8pm or later everyday is normal... I'm sure someone told you this already but please NEVER forget what brought you to music in the first place. Unfortunately, Music Ed wasn't my passion so it felt like pure shit and I left the degree... But the students who choose music are VERY resilient people. Be able to see through all the stressful academic bs and mental testing they'll force you through and make the experience your own. You can get through this!\n\n It will feel SO good completing semesters from hell like this one, and you'll be even stronger for the next semester. I believe in you! Stay strong! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa",

My college does 8 week courses so I was in 4 the first 8 weeks and 5 classes the second 8 weeks. Balancing those plus 75 hours of field experience, a job, and health was a lot. I wish you the best of luck!",

I've found it to be manageable mostly because music classes are usually not super homework heavy, and the homework I did have I could get done between classes.  It still really sucks tho.  Hopefully you'll fall into some sort of groove and figure out a schedule that works for you.  Friends will make it better.",

              "text": "Yeah. This schedule is only T/R though right?  So presumably you have a bit more relaxed schedule the other 3 days (relatively).  Find a time in between classes that you can share a meal with friends, and a time that you can be alone.  Also it would help to aim to finish all of your homework by the time you're done with classes for the day so you can actually relax when you get home.  Just go in with an attitude of \"you can do it,\" because you really can.",
