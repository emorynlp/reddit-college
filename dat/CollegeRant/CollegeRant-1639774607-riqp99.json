I hated it with a burning passion.\n\nALEKS was also the only way to get extra credit but with very strict conditions. You had to spend atleast 30 minutes on it every day, complete one topic everyday and finish all the topic by the due date. Sounds like a lot so you should get a lot of points right? WRONG, you got 5 extra points for the next exam. And if you miss even on of those day then FUCK YOU no 5 points.\n\nIn conclusion, fuck ALEKS",
