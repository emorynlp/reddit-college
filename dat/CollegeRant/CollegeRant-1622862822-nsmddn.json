  "text": "Hi, sorry for the formatting i\u2019m on mobile. I just have to get this off of my chest. I\u2019m so sick of having to work while in school. I\u2019ve been working almost full time since my senior year of high school and i\u2019m burnt out. point blank period I am burnt out. My grades suck ass, I have really bad adhd, and It\u2019s been a constant battle for 5 years. I\u2019m graduating in December, but I\u2019ve had to take summer semesters for the last two years because of covid. I just feel like i\u2019m wasting my fucking life away and other people don\u2019t have to lift a finger to survive. I need a hug. that is all <3",
