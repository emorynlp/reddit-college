  "text": "to say i\u2019ve completely screwed this semester would be an understatement. i think something about classes being online just triggered a major depressive spell for me and my grades took a severe hit. i don\u2019t know what happened; i\u2019m usually an A student but now turning something in a day after it\u2019s due is an achievement. the motivation is gone. i pull up a single assignment on canvas and immediately get overwhelmed and discouraged and take a three hour nap to make myself feel better.\n\ni really hate this. i want to go back to being the motivated person i was. i\u2019m going to fail my first ever class. i\u2019ve never been this behind in this many classes.  i\u2019ve never just not turned something in and thought nothing of it. i\u2019m embarrassed by how bad i let things get. i just hope next semester will be better.",

And I made a schedule for myself so that I get every done by Friday night and shut my brain off for the weekend, so I know if I don't do this last assignment tomorrow, I just WONT. But here I am watching my fiance play the new star wars game instead. Not regretting it",

      "text": "I feel the exact same way. I\u2019ve been a very studious A student my whole life and this semester my mental health just dropped. No motivation to do anything, procrastinating every assignment and turning them in late. I had to drop calculus in the beginning of the semester because I was failing. I was failing Chem for the longest time and I just brought it up to a C. I have a D in my BioEthics. I stay up until 3 am, sleep in between classes, sometimes skip classes and just say I was sick so I don\u2019t get marked for it. I\u2019ve never blatantly lied that until now. Depression sucks man",

      "text": "i feel this so heavily. im in the same position as you. granted, for me, i've been like this since my freshman year of college (so it's not an online issue for me) but i was a ridiculously successful straight A student in high school. so i understand the contrast and how much it hurts to look back and see just how bad it got.\n\nfor me, my problem is that fundamentally, i dont really care about school. so, its a mixed bag of mental health and a sense of apathy towards academics for me. but just based on your post, it sounds like it's moreso a mental health issue than anything.\n\ntrust me, i understand just how absolutely impossible it feels to get literally anything done. and it's such a shitty cycle because the more we viscerally avoid our assignments and lectures, the more they pile up and the more anxiety-inducing it is to look at the list of things we havent done. so to compensate for the amount of stress that just flooded our brains, we shut down even more and thus miss even more school. it feels never-ending.\n\nbut here's my plan. we obviously need help. a couple days ago, i set up a meeting with my academic advisor to figure out what i can do. tonight, im planning on emailing the counseling center to hopefully set up an appointment for therapy or literally anything. i suggest you do the same. acknowledge that there is a problem and utilize the tools that your school gives you. the point here is to keep at least a low-level amount of effort going - because it's sure as hell better than nothing.\n\n(edit, added more: after you set those appointments up, i recommend doing something really difficult: compiling a list of everything you have to do. every missed assignment, every missed lecture. its gonna hurt like hell but its necessary. then force yourself to do one thing on the list. just one and nothing more. forget how long the list is - ur only focus is that one task. call it a night, and try to do the same tomorrow. all we want is to gain some momentum.)\n\nalso, feel free to dm me if you just wanna talk. im in the same situation as you, and support always helps :)",

          "text": "I\u2019m like you. I was such a good student in high school, but at university I\u2019m so bad. Failed many classes, maybe the reason is I hate the major which lead me to not care about school. Now I\u2019ll change my major, and I\u2019m actually getting better. So you should try to find yourself a goal. But I understand sometimes I\u2019m like I just wanna go live in a forest away from society just like the movie Into The Wild xD",
