  "text": "I feel like everytime my roommates bf stayed the night they do stuff while I sleep. A little background is he\u2019s apart of our friend group and he was all of our friends before they started dating. I feel like she she took \u201csince he\u2019s your friend too\u201d a little to hard. He\u2019s in our room all day long and is here from when we both get back from classes up until we go to sleep. He used to stay the night like 4 nights a week but after u talked to them it\u2019s up to me when he stays the night now you might be wondering \u201cwhat makes you think their doing stuff?\u201d (If you get what I mean) well for starters the first time they got \u201ctogether\u201d I was sleeping in my bed. They actively had relations with me sleeping a couple feet away from them. This is proven because she told me. They were under the influence so I don\u2019t hold that against them to hard. I still called them disrespectful and told her I didn\u2019t like that.  She said she\u2019d never do it again. But after that she\u2019s told me he\u2019s tried things. With me and even with another girl still in the room.  She said She would always stop him but I don\u2019t believe her. (She told me that he\u2019s tried to finger her while I was awoke in the room still) I want to trust her bc she is my best friend but I don\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night and there will be lots of shuffling and whispering coming from them. And another friend told me that she was told by my rm that they have done more while I slept.  There was a time when I thought they were sleep and got to use the bathroom and came back not even 5 minutes later and they were having sex. I would under stand if they never had alone time. But they do. I work and have class and I go home all the time so they have time to just be alone with eachother. They never go to his room EVER. I come home from class he\u2019s there. I come home from work at 10:30pm and he\u2019s there. He\u2019s in our room until like 3am every night it\u2019s just annoying and sometimes I want me alone time with her and can\u2019t even get it. We\u2019ve talked ab it and we\u2019re working on it but it\u2019s not enough it seems like we\u2019ve taken a step back.  She\u2019s friends with his roommate that\u2019s even how they met. I don\u2019t understand.I just feel disrespected. It\u2019s a gut feeling honestly that they do this but I just know it\u2019s the truth I plan on having another talk with her tm. Their both good people but I don\u2019t like the idea of them doing it with me in the room. We\u2019re adults and I shouldn\u2019t have to keep having this convo with her. It\u2019s basic knowledge to respect eachother. I would never do this to her. My boyfriend lives back at home but has come over and stayed the night before and we wernt even tempted to disrespect her like that. I thought I meant more to her then a random guy she met in august after we\u2019ve been close for years. I\u2019m leaving this school next semester and she\u2019ll have the room to herself. Along with that I\u2019m leaving early and they\u2019ll have a whole week before break of just being alone together.  I\u2019m going to talk to her and ask for him to not stay the night at all for the next week until I leave. Based on the circumstances I feel like she shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. I\u2019ll\nLet you guys know how it goes. Thanks for listening to my rant :)\n\nTL;DR: my roommate and her boyfriend have done things while I was sleeping and I don\u2019t feel respected.",

      "text": "I'm so sorry that you have to go through that. It is indeed very disrespectful to do that especially since you've already mentioned it to her and she still continues to do it. Some people are just inconsiderate and selfish. I'm surprised that they're so willing to do that with someone else in the same room. Yikes..\nI'm glad that you're almost done and out of there. Hope your talk goes well.",
