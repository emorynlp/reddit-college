Especially with idiots and their phone cameras making it easier than ever to get caught. So yeah, card everyone, limit the shenanigans, don\u2019t let randoms in, etc\u2026 \n\nAll that stuff (minus the carding) should\u2019ve been done with high school parties honestly but mom and dad are more forgiving than a school bureaucracy usually and teens are stupid. \n\nAnyway you partied a lot in high school clearly so count yourself lucky you\u2019re not the sheltered kid just now getting that chance.",

It's fucking hard, and if I do find people they immediately reject me when they know my age and I feel like an expired apple that had been thrown away because it's already too late to be out for everyone else to see.",

Secondly, if you're wondering how to start a party I reccomend asking r/bropill because those guys are really good at advice and would even have some words to say about how to pull yourself out of this social doomer mindset i see you have going on. And thirdly, if you dont know who to invite because you feel weird about it then throw a party for one class of yours! Pick a class and tell people \"yeah im having a party for this class, just like the people here so we can let loose a little, maybe talk to some of the faces we see every week. Its on friday at 7 if you want to come, if not thats fine\"",

I didn't find any good people in college either, because alot of them keep to themselves and live their own lifes, alot don't even want to be friends, since they live far away.

Find people with a common interest by joining a club or a job on campus. Then those people will throw parties that you'll actually want to go to because everyone has a common interest to talk about. Or those friends will have friends that have parties and they'll invite you and you can meet even more people.\n\nI use to be really introverted and shy. It seemed like everyone was having the \"college experience\" except me. and it really sucked. But if being social and going to parties is something you want, it takes time and effort, like all good things.\n\nBut it gets better, I promise.",

In reality the girls had both fake student ID\u2019s and fake driver\u2019s licenses so no one could have known they were underage. There were multiple of the guys their parents accused who said they had gone out with one of the girls multiple times and thought they were seriously dating. It was a deal with like a total of 13 guys I think. So now the ID checking is really to protect students from things like that, at my school at least.",
