      "text": "Best thing to probably do is get out of your house more. I know people that can't handle staying home due to the pandemic anymore. Take walks and listen to music, call up some friends, find some interesting outdoor hobbies. Then, you gotta ease yourself back in to relaxing at home. I've had issues during breaks before about worrying about assignments being potentially due when I have nothing. That stuff slowly goes away as you adapt. Assuming you're on break you just have to remind yourself you have no school work to do. It sucks, but that's how getting an education is its 24/7 stress if you wanna be the best and recognized for it. Regardless, school itself is a small part of your life, so you'll be fine.",
