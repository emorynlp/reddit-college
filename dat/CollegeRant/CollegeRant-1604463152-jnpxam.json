Hopefully caf\u00e9s and libraries will be open by then so I can get out of my four-walled prison, but even so...being STEM and online is ass. Being anything and online is ass. Rip our educations.",

I am also a STEM major and this was supposed to be a tough semester for me before all of this happened. I need to leave the house, I need routine, I need in-person lectures. I simply have not been able to keep up with everything online, and I'm consistently 1-2 weeks behind now because the only thing that motivates me to get work done is the due date (usually...). I'm honestly not sure how I'm going to make it next semester.",
