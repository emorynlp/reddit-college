I think I feel a little better now? Although not enough to really go back into the dreaded word document again. I don't even have a lot for finals, but I just can't bring myself to do the work. I want to get this over with but I keep getting brain fog and it's making it hard to even think sometimes. I see others going through like 5 final exams, 7 group projects, and probably a billion other things and I can barely even write my 2 page essay due 4 days ago. Nothing wrong with complaining about having so much stuff to do, I just can't help but compare my sheer laziness to people who probably deserve the anxiety and burnout, if that even makes sense at all. I don't know... I'm so anxious of failing cause I'm a freshman and who fucking fails their basic English class?? Actually, let me rephrase that. Who fails their first freshman, basic English class not because they had a bad professor or they didn't understand anything, but because they can't fucking motivate themselves to think of any possible words at various moments. What the fuck is this level of incompetence? Well me, cause my entire grade is dependent on if I write this 2 page essay or not and I just... can't... I'm so tired, I'm so anxious, I'm so incapable of anything. \n\nAnyways I'm going to try again. Hope this time I don't break down until after I'm done with my elementary level paper I'm too hopeless to do",

Have been awake for more than 24 hours trying to shift through the brain fog :/  At least I got an outline going\n\nAnd yeah, that seems doable. I kind of forgot about doing one or two small goals instead of \u201cyou have to complete this essay now you\u2019re running out of time\u201d. Thank you for that\n\nThank you! I\u2019ll try to do small goals once I wake up. :) Sorry I got so stressed cause a lot of my problems require a long-term solution and right now I need a short term one, and it hadn\u2019t hit me to do the most obvious one. So thank you of reminding me of that",

Basically just a short essay about what we learned in the class\n\nThe thing is is that our thesis is about why we deserve to move onto the next mandatory english class, and I can\u2019t help but think that \u201cno, I have no evidence to support that\u201d and then just cripple into a ball cause I\u2019m reminded of how I\u2019m a failure \n\nAnd I can\u2019t BS it too, cause this is the one essay that will be read thoroughly by three other english professors (we have to do a writing portfolio in our college, and three professors will go over your portfolio and discuss it. This will be the first paper in the portfolio they\u2019ll see), so I need to put some effort into it",

It should be regulated like gambling, drugs, and porn. Caffeine and fast food should also be regulated for minors. Like gems parents were worried about not doing illegal stuff because they had more fear about the anticipated early 2000s crime spikes, but they never considered that legal activities can be just as destructive to minors who do not have developed impulse control. You\u2019re gonna be ok. Just do some thinking and read a book over break to strengthen your reading/writing abilities.",

It\u2019s not simply social media. It\u2019s short form messaging (media/content/feedback). This is addicting and it\u2019s not regulated as carefully as it should be. It\u2019s new and was not labeled as dangerous, but collective use in high volumes actually diminishes so much potential progress. Even if you start out with poor attention skills, you can improve and grow, but this type of mental stimulation disrupts a child\u2019s trajectory for growth. It\u2019s really defeating to think about how many children will have stunted focusing abilities and reduced access to modes of consciousness because, collectively, we cannot efficiently organize societies.
