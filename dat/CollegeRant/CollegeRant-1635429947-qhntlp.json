  "text": "My college's dining hall is notoriously awful.  There are several pages of students and parents alike complaining about things from moldy bread, raw meat, PURPLE meat (which.. how?), spiders and flies in the food, and other random things that you can't even believe would be given out at a school.  (My personal favorite was when they put a piece of pepperoni on a hamburger bun or piece of bread and called it Pizza.  No cheese or sauce... just a single pepperoni.)  We use paper plates and plastic, disposable cups, as they don't want to spend time washing dishes.  The staff have been known to verbally and physically harrass people for 'getting too much food' (which can be 2 pieces of pizza if you're unlucky enough.)  The ice cream scooper is cleaned once a day, not every 30 minutes like it should be, so there's plenty of mixing going on in the different flavors.  They're open from 7am-2pm, then 5pm-8pm.  Sports practices end at 8 pm, but they don't care the athletes won't be fed, they say 'if you really wanted to eat, you'd leave early'.\n\nSo, we had a meeting with the staff.  Students talked to the maintenance, cleaning, and cooking staff, complaining about the quality of the food, the cleanliness, the hours, etc.  And they don't care one bit.\n\nThey say that they don't know if there's mold in the bread or not because they can't check every package of bread.  I don't know about you guys, but I've never had moldy bread as I don't keep the same container of bread in my pantry for months as they do.  I don't have pink chicken, as I don't just serve it after putting it on a grill for \\~1-2 minutes.  They don't want to have edible food for the students here as they don't care enough to change their faulty ways to accommodate the several cases of food poisoning coming in almost daily.\n\nI usually go out to eat now.  There's a few fast food places nearby that give us at least cooked meat, even if it's still shitty.  But I'm starting to run out of money fast, as buying meals gets expensive (alongside the cost of gas).  I would cook in my dorm if not for the fact some people in my hall have bugs and mold in their rooms, which makes me anxious to do much of anything in there.\n\nMy professors are great.  I love all the other staff here, just not in the mess hall.  The college is so amazing other than this, and it's really stressing me out.  Do I eat there every day all my meals, risking food poisoning, or do I keep eating out, risking going broke?\n\ntldr; College's food is making everyone get food poisoning, and they don't give a fuck.",

So many health risks, they\u2019re just asking to send someone to the hospital. Good luck! This sounds like an absolute nightmare and I\u2019m sending good vibes",
