  "text": "So I go to a college 30-45 minutes away from home and my parents don\u2019t mind driving to come get me every weekend. I always hear people say \u201cdon\u2019t go home all the time, you won\u2019t make any friends that way\u201d blah blah but I only have like 4 friends, I don\u2019t party and neither do my friends and I don\u2019t have a car so what\u2019s there to do on the weekends? My school is known as a commuter school anyways but I just don\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cweird\u201d for going home all the time.",

      "text": "As someone who does go home every weekend from dorm living, I really enjoy it. My group of friends here questioned me about it at first, but I just told them I like to see my dog and fam. I\u2019ll usually bake something over the weekend and bring it back too. Honestly even if they thought I was weird, I wouldn\u2019t care? I\u2019m doing what I enjoy. \n\nThat being said, we do typically go partying on Friday or Saturday nights, so I just schedule when I\u2019m going home based on that (Go home Friday after classes and come back late Saturday to go out). \n\nJust live your life man, no one really cares :)",

Do what makes you feel good. Going home every weekend gives me a break from the crazy at school, and I get to visit my cat. Just do what makes you happy :) don\u2019t worry about anyone else.",

Going home every weekend can somewhat take away from that. I'd say every other weekend is a good balance. Stay on some weekends, hang out with people, join clubs. Learn to enjoy being there on a weekend.",

Join an outdoors club, do some volunteering, clean your dorm/apartment, go to your schools library to catch up on work, etc. I dont know how far you live but if its far then thats a ton of $ in gas and time spent in the car. I guess if I went home every weekend I wouldnt feel settled at school",
