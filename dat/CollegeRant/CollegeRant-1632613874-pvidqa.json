  "text": "I'm sorry but I'm tired of waiting 4 plus weeks for some professors to grade a single, simple assignment.  I understand if they have a couple hundred students and an essay to grade for each of them, that would be understandable to me, but I've been waiting since week 2 for a professor to grade a single discussion board for one class.  I have to get everything posted before the deadline or risk losing points, but these professors can take their sweet ass time letting me know how I'm actually doing in their class.  I'm blind as to how I'm doing and I'm sick of putting up with their excuses, you can take an afternoon to just check if I did an assignment that took 15 minutes.  It's gotten to the point where they're going to pile up if you don't do something, and I'm sick of hearing how that's just the way it is when I KNOW they can do better.",

Assignments and reports get no feedback either. I'm just hoping my lab reports don't get low scores, despite being as elaborate as possible(It's a virtual lab..so lots of writing)",

I sent a lab, and after a month the teacher would reply saying what part of my logic was wrong \u2013 after that month, however, I already knew how to fix that old code and what particular part of the it was not being efficient. Due to this, I got an A- in my course. If it wasn't for the book and people on the internet, I'd be fucked.",
