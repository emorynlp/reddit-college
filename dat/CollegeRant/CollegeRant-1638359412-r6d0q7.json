  "text": "I\u2019m currently a third semester architecture student and i\u2019ve given up. \n\nChoosing architecture was my own decision since I wanted a fun(?) degree but the college I study in isn\u2019t my favourite. My parents actually applied here for me and I only got to know the day I got admission. I said yes to the college because the tuition fee is super cheap, it\u2019s a highly reputed college and I would get a placement 100% and I didn\u2019t really have a backup plan if i rejected it either. \n\nMy classes have been online for the past two semesters and they started regular classes last month. I couldn\u2019t take the workload and frankly unrealistic deadlines and begged my parents to let me drop out since the end of first semester. They pacified me for a while saying that it could get better and it\u2019s only hard because it\u2019s online and I agreed. \n\nThis past month has been hell for me. The professors don\u2019t teach anything that i think is essential (like how to make a plan or design your space), and I have to google every aspect of designing. They\u2019re even stricter with the deadlines and don\u2019t explain our assignments prior, and we\u2019ll have to redo them every single time. \n\nOn top of that we have to take on extra work for competitions every month (which the professors will not help with at all) if we want to even apply for internships. Side note, these competitions are part of the syllabus for other architecture colleges while it\u2019s not part of ours, and the professors don\u2019t grant us deadline extensions. \n\nI applied to another university for another major without my parents knowing and I got in, but the tuition fee itself is around 8x what I\u2019m paying now. Then there\u2019s admission, transport and other charges that add up. I feel really guilty about asking my parents but I want to change majors so bad. \n\nI had planned to take up jobs and help pay but I still feel I wouldn\u2019t be able to contribute to much. I also don\u2019t know much about student loans so I\u2019m a bit skeptical about them. \n\nSo, thoughts? Am I being lazy and irresponsible with work and this is what all architecture majors go through or am I reasonable in wanting to drop out? \n\nAlso some help on how I could earn money? \n\nTL;DR - I want to drop out of architecture school with cheap tuition fee to change to another major with high fees.",

      "text": "If you want change your degree and your parents aren\u2019t supportive, you\u2019ll need to weigh the pros and cons. Yes, it\u2019s hard right NOW but it\u2019s a few years and then it\u2019s over and you\u2019re not stacked in student loan debt and you\u2019ll have a great career waiting for you on the other side. OR\u2026 you change degrees, pull out a massive amount of student loans, go to a different school and have the realization that every single degree choice has a huge amount of workload and there\u2019s no getting out of this in an easy way. Look through this subreddit and you\u2019ll find everyone from all different degree choices just drowning in work every single semester. The grass isn\u2019t greener on the other side, it\u2019s not easy to see it now because you\u2019re struggling but in the big picture, I HIGHLY recommend you go where your parents are paying. I\u2019ve switched my degree plan at least 4 times because it was \u201ctoo hard\u201d but I\u2019m now realizing that everything is hard when you\u2019re first learning it, but if you can stay disciplined enough you will reap the rewards on the other side. Because I\u2019ve changed my degree so much, I\u2019ve added like 2 years of more schooling, don\u2019t be like me lol just get it done!",

      "text": "I\u2019m an architecture grad and my advice to you would be to switch majors early rather than later. The workload is only going to increase as your projects get more complicated and you\u2019re expected to do more. There\u2019s also a lot of software you\u2019re going to have to learn, and depending on the school, you\u2019ll most likely have to teach yourself. Eventually you\u2019ll start taking structure courses (unless your class is more design focused) and these can be brutal. Architecture history classes can also be pretty time consuming too. By my senior year I don\u2019t think I completed any project that was truly 100% up to my standards. \n\nAs an architecture student you can only do so much before it\u2019s deadline day and that means picking and choosing your assignments. It\u2019s kinda crappy but it does kind of reflect the reality of an architects life. I never really had to do many all nighters because I was fairly disciplined with my work and had NO social life, but all of my friends pulled more all nighters than I can count. It\u2019s not that the work itself is hard, there\u2019s just A LOT of work. \n\nAlong with all the coursework you\u2019ll also have to learn some software. AutoCAD, Revit, Rhino (and grasshopper), sketchup, Lumion, Enscape, VRay, Vectorworks (maybe), and Adobe suite products (like photoshop, illustrator, and indesign) are the majority of what I used. It seems like a lot, and it is, but most of these products are pretty easy to teach yourself with some practice and they can be fun! \n\nI\u2019m not saying any of this to scare you but I just want to share the reality of architecture school. And depending on where you live, you also have to go to grad school if you even want to obtain licensure, not to mention other certifications you\u2019d want to obtain like LEED AP. So that\u2019s another two years after your bachelors (although LEED can be done on your own time). I\u2019d say sit down with your parents and discuss all these things with them. Architecture programs can be very brutal so it definitely isn\u2019t for everyone and there\u2019s no shame in that! \n\nArchitecture school is also very fun since you become close with your studio and it\u2019s like a little friend group. Studio time was always so much fun since my entire class eventually became friends and we would hangout outside of studio too. So don\u2019t think Architecture school is misery 24/7. Hope this helps!
