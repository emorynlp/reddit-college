  "text": "I am a freshman in college. I have one roommate. Our room is pretty small so we have to have both of our beds lofted above our desks and dressers. A few weeks ago, my roommate suggested that she bring her futon from home and we could rearrange the room to fit it. At first, I was on board with the idea. The more I thought about it, the less I liked it. In order to fit the futon, she would have to dismantle one of our beds, which is a huge, unnecessary hassle. Our beds are currently parallel to each other, but if she brings the futon, our beds will need to be in an L-shape. This is a huge problem for me, as I need to have my own \"side\" of the room to stay sane. Additionally, she can barely keep her stuff on her side of the room without it spilling onto my side. Our room is small, and it's going to be an even bigger mess with her stuff if she brings a whole extra piece of furniture. She wants to bring her futon after Christmas break. I just feel guilty telling her I don't want it in here, but it's my room as much as hers.",

      "text": "Whenever she moves her stuff onto your side of the room, just move it back on her side. Let her know her stuff was on your side. Simple as that. You're not going to tolerate this.\n\nIs she bringing the futon for you to use too? If she is, then maybe try to work things out with her as long a futons are allowed per your living arrangements. If she isn't, or if a futon isn't allowed, I would tell her you're not cool with it. \n\nDon't overthink it. Just be true to yourself and say how you feel. It's a lot easier to establish how you feel at the moment of, vice later on down the road. Don't hold things inside and be mad, address it right then and there. Just be polite but firm, and remember that there are 2 people in the room.",

          "text": "If she brought the futon, we would both use it. I just can't see us using it enough for it to be worth the hassle and the extra space it would take up. As for her stuff, it's not necessarily on my side of the room. It's in a big pile and it's slowly inching further and further out into the middle of the floor. I think it would take about 10 minutes to organize, but I don't want to tell her what to do with her stuff when it's not technically in my way.",

              "text": "Well, the thing is, that's how a lot of problems start with most roommates. Most roommates aren't mean enough or inconsiderate enough to do things like throw stuff on your side of the room blatantly and in the open. What they'll do though is they won't pay attention to it until it's either encroaching or already on your side, then when you make a big deal out of it, then they'll say something. So it's better to stop it before it gets there because either way she's being messy. As far as the futon goes, if you would both use it, that's cool. But it seems like she should move her bed for the futon and not you since she's bringing the futon in.",
