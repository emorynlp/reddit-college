  "text": "\nso i made 2 good friends this year so far as a freshman. i go to one of the biggest party schools in the nation but for academic reasons (i\u2019ll party occasionally but it isn\u2019t my thing). \ni found two girls like me who had become some of my best friends. one decided to become an RA (lets name her Sally). Sally didn\u2019t tell me this and proceeded to basically ghost me even though Sally, Beth (my other friend), and I had apartment tours scheduled. I found out through Beth, who has a class with Sally, of this decision to be an RA, meaning she wouldn\u2019t be living with us. Fine, whatever, lets look at 2 bedrooms for Beth and I. We went on a few tours last week and decided we were gonna apply for the one we loved coming this week. Woke up to a text saying shes decided to live in the dorms as well next year. \n\nAt this point i\u2019m convinced there is something wrong with me, what are the odds both drop out within a week? Apartments are gone by November so I guess I\u2019ll be living in the dorms in a single like Sally and Beth will be doing. I don\u2019t trust going blind as it didn\u2019t work well for me this year. \nAny advice? How do I look at pathetically living alone in a single in the dorms as a SOPHOMORE? \n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never make a friend that truly wants to be my friend. (Every friend I\u2019ve had in the past has either backstabbed or left me unexpectedly with no explanation). I\u2019m sick of going to welcome events alone and looking like the pathetic girl with no friends.",

      "text": "have they stopped texting you, or stopped hanging out with you? Maybe they are scared to live off-campus, it is way more of responsibility than living in a dorm and that transition can be scary to some. \nAlso what\u2019s stopping you from getting a place on your own off campus ? maybe you can find different roommates (usually on facebook or college groups)",
