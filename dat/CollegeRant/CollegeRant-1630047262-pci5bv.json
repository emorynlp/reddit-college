  "title:": "My college won\u2019t allow me to take one last class to finish my second major",
  "text": "By the time of graduation next May, I will have 6 credits left to complete in order to meet my credit requirement. Luckily, I am able to walk with my class because my university offers early participation in commencement; however, I am only permitted to participate in graduation if there are no more than 8 credit hours remaining.\n\nBecause I am only 6 credits behind, I will earn my degree after taking the 8 credits. The issue is, I need 12 credits in order to complete my second major. This leaves one class that will keep me from finishing my second major. Do colleges make exceptions for these situations? If not, is it possible for me to finish my second major after I receive my degree? \n\nMost importantly, is it worth continuing classes in my second major if I can\u2019t complete it? Or should I pick up a second minor instead? Thank you for your help, I am stressed to no end.\n\nTL;DR I will be one class short of completing my second major when I receive my degree.",

By the way 12 units is a full semester; that\u2019s why they won\u2019t let you take 12 units over the summer. At that point, you\u2019re basically just graduating a semester late.",
