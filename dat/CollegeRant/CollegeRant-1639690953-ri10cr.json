      "text": "This happens to me sometimes, I usually attribute it to test anxiety, too much stress, or lack of sleep.  The best thing you can do is treat it as a learning experience and work on mentally preparing yourself for your next test.  You said you had been doing well jn math, so understanding is not the issue.  Maybe find some calming exercises you can do to recenter your mind, or make sure you get a good night's rest before.  Those both sound silly but knowing how to test and knowing how to prepare for a test are both skills that can be learned.\n\nCongrats on the B, it's still a good grade. Enjoy your break!",
