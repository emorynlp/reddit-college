  "text": "I'm a senior and it feels like everyone around me is getting really good grades (almost straight A's) and will be graduating with some kind of distinction. Meanwhile I am in my 5th year of engineering and have never gotten straight A's ever in undergrad. Even if I have near an A in a class, the final exam bumps it down to an  A- or more often than not, B or even C. I seriously don't get how every one has amazing grades. Feeling kind of low because my roommate just told me she would end with all A's and an A- and I am just struggling to pass my classes this semester. What the heck.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t sweat it too much. Engineering is by no means easy.\n\nI think people with straight A\u2019s just spend a lot of time studying to make sure they understand the material well. There\u2019s a good chance that they may have had to make certain sacrifices if they\u2019re spending a lot of time studying. They can also happen to be geniuses who put in some effort.\n\nThe point is you shouldn\u2019t try to compare yourself to other people too much and let it affect you.",

      "text": "I was only in chemistry for my first year, but I believe it\u2019s just \u201cnatural ability.\u201d Unfortunately, college is too short a time to develop it, and don\u2019t feel bad about a fifth year. It means much much less when you\u2019re doing just about the most rigorous college subject possible.\n\nI\u2019d just suggest going to office hours more. Many professors cannot reasonably teach the underlying reason why things work within an hour\u2019s length of time.",

      "text": "Senior burn out is a thing. 5years of school with short breaks can just eat at your mental energy . But i have the same problem i will have all a\u2019s and one B for a semester, and it is my \u201csenior year\u201d since im graduating early. At this point i just am so burnt out from trying so hard all the fucking time that a B is fine for me. The LSAC might disagree but whatever lmao. \n\nBe proud of yourself, and be kind to yourself. Just push as hard as you can handle and then you will be done and have your degree! Cheers to your work ethic!",

      "text": "So, there is always the ability to take fewer classes. I think that the biggest thing is taking easier classes. You can find if a class is easy on rate my professor. I did they for my first and second year of college. There are also people who are just naturally better at test taking. I think it's not as common as you think. You might just have crazy friends.",
