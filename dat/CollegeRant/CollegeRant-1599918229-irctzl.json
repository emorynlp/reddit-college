  "title:": "Completely Overwhelmed with Work Load",
  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and I feel like the amount of work I\u2019m being assigned, specifically by my history class is complete overkill? The class was assigned over 100 pages of reading over the course of 4 days, including the weekend which I have to work so I really only have 2 days to do it. How... HOW am I supposed to read 100 pages of complicated shit that I know I will have to reread and take notes on in 2 days???? Plus I have homework for THREE OTHER CLASSES!!!!! Let\u2019s just say this class isn\u2019t easy to begin with.. it seems really advanced to me and as though you need a background in history(which I haven\u2019t studied in two years) to understand what\u2019s going on.. tried to contact my advisor and she\u2019s not answering :D. I\u2019m so overwhelmed that I basically just broke down last night. So basically this is just a rant on how I will never realistically be able to complete my reading for this class in time, won\u2019t be able to participate in the discussions because I have no clue what\u2019s going on, and knowing that I will then be singled out by my professor for not participating !\n\nTL;DR: Having mental breakdown over 100+ pages of reading for history.",

This much reading in two days is impossible. I don't know if this professor is assigning more reading because he thinks he has to compensate for having online classes (assuming you are having online classes) or if he is just insane. I would ask people who've taken courses with him before if he's always like this. How much reading are you assigned in other classes? Definitely try the advisor again, sometimes they miss your email.",

The first conversation I had with my \u201cadvisor \u201c gave me the impression that it was one of the required classes for graduation. I was reviewing my schedule a couple days before classes start and realized that this definitely was not. Contacted my \u201cadvisor\u201d and they said it was fine, I need an elective, and my schedule looks great. Basically my school is super confusing because the person who helped me with my schedule wasn\u2019t even my advisor, and now I can\u2019t get a hold of my advisor to see if I can drop this class. I\u2019ve emailed her twice and I think a third time just isn\u2019t necessary. All I know is people that are upperclassmen in this class say you would need to have a good understanding of world history at that time period to understand what our professor is ranting about.",

      "text": "u/6elle i would use Quizlet. Try dropping the name of the book or literature into google. If you paste the name of the piece of literature into google, Quizlet will usually be one of the first search results that pops up. I will be a senior at the University of Arizona in January 2021. Last semester, i used Quizlet and bullshitted the assignments for my history class (History 203: Ancient Mediterranean Power & Identity) so that I didn\u2019t have to do the reading. I ended up getting an A or B in that class. That class was boring that it made me want to slam my head against the wall repeatedly. Sitting through the professor\u2019s lectures and esoteric ramblings was mentally exhausting.\n\nIt is ok to use online resources to crack the code, so to speak. I barely cracked a textbook last semester because i was able to find everything I needed online. Quizlet was a lifesaver for me last semester. I highly doubt that College professors expect their students to read every last word of an assignment. Work smarter, not harder.",

Also, I have a major issue with concentration too so notes would be the main way for me to remember what I read and to take notes I feel like I have to understand the work (which I don\u2019t).
