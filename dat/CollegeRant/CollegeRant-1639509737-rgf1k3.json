  "text": "Here is the original, basically just a rant about the shitty questions and shitty, ambiguous grading for the exams in this class: https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/rfp2mz/so_fucking_done_with_these_exams/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nI emailed the TAs and got an email back saying \"we don't have time to look at your exam again but here's what we were looking for\". They basically said they have tons of emails just like mine and they refuse to reevaluate this close to the end of the semester. Maybe *that's the problem*?\n\nEmailed the professor now because the final is literally tomorrow and I still don't know what her graders want in terms of short answer questions. I don't know what else to do. At this rate I'm going to have a low B or a C in this class and it's so irritating because I did well and learned the material and I otherwise have a 4.0 for the semester.\n\nAs someone said on my last post it's obviously not a good thing if most of the class has a C but for some reason she's inflating the average and acting like that's not reality. She sent an email out saying the average is a 63/75, and the mean is a 65, even though canvas clearly says the average score is an even 60.",
