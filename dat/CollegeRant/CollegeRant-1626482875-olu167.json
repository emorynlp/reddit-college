  "title:": "Professor effectively failed me for clicking the wrong quiz, and I might have to put college on hold",
  "text": "So, my all-online ethics professor has a kind of messed up policy. Once you start a quiz, (of which there are four, and these are the only graded assignments in the entire class) you have 105 minutes to finish. WIFI goes out, power goes out, server goes offline, anything, and the best possible grade you can get is a 75%.\n\nWell, I clicked on the wrong quiz. I meant to open quiz 2, and opened quiz 3. I had never even heard of the topic it was on, so I closed it immediately and emailed my professor with \\~48 hours to the deadline. He didn't even get back to me. I emailed him again with \\~24 hours left, and it took him 20 to respond. He gave me an unhelpful response pretty much saying, \"well, it's not my fault.\"\n\nI plead my case and 48 hours later, he hasn't gotten back. I was barely maintaining a B average (with an 80.95% in this class), and this dropped my grade to a 53. The term ends July 30.\n\nThis class no longer counts for my degree, I'm now ineligible for most of my scholarships, and I get out-of-state tuition next semester on top of that. My cost is now 5 or 6 times what it was last semester, and if I can't get back above a B average by the end of fall, (which I could barely hold) I might have to put my education on pause.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting this here. I'm not expecting anybody to be able to help. I don't think this is a matter for any kind of board, so I've pretty much used up my only option in emailing the professor. I guess I just need to vent somewhere.\n\nTL;DR: The title",

Your one shot is to kick ass on the remaining quizzes in the class and then go to the professor at the end and maturely take responsibility, and ask that the prof to meet you half way. This is completely your fault (as you acknowledge in comments) and it doesn\u2019t actually seem to me that the prof has even been unfair or unreasonable in any way; they have a clear policy that allows people to work at their own pace. Lots of comments on here are advising you to contact admin, this will do nothing other than make you look entitled/whiney. There is no way any of them will advocate for you in when this is so clearly your fuck up but it will royally piss of the prof, who is your first, last, and only hope. \n\nHonestly, not to be harsh but your post should be entitled \u201cI messed up and effectively failed myself by clicking the wrong quiz\u201d.",

Email and/or call the department head, ombudsman, dean.  This is such a small mistake that would have taken minutes for the professor to correct. It's mind blowing he chose not to correct it. \"Well, it's not my fault.\" doesn't cut it. There is no good reason why the professor chose not to help you. It shows he does not care about his students. It's wrong. Let the college know. Ask them to help you to take the quiz and have the ding removed. What the professor did is unacceptable. Don't go down without a fight. He is not the \"be all, and end all\" in this. He does have bosses. They need to know what he did and help you fix it.",

Given the consequences and the fact that you already had a B in the class, it shows that this was a mistake. People make mistakes and it shouldn\u2019t cost you that much. It seems pretty evident to me that you would do the 2nd quiz before the 3rd one, so the fact that you clicked the 3rd one was an accident.\n\nAlso I\u2019d assume the professor could monitor how long you were looking at the quiz so like? Idk why he/she is being so harsh.",
