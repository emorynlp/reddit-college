  "text": "Even if I didn\u2019t turn it in I would fail. I only completed like half of the questions and they\u2019re probably aren\u2019t even right. I went to the bathroom during it too. I\u2019m so stupid. I was freaking out because I thought the time was over. And the images on docs wouldn\u2019t show up so I couldn\u2019t turn it in. Then I realized I had ten minutes left and went back to finish my problem then when I was done with it I saw it was already time to turn it in. I\u2019m crying so much.",
