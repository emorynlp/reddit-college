  "text": "I\u2019m taking a COMP SCI class and from the start it\u2019s been a mess. Basically it\u2019s a graduate/undergrad course and all the students keep getting our answers marked wrong for some reason. For example we\u2019ll have a quiz with two questions and everyone gets the same answer but somehow gets 50s on them. \nI\u2019m so tired I\u2019ve got a 75 in the class which is a C but our final is Friday and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll pass at all. The final is 30% of our grade and I\u2019m so tired.",
