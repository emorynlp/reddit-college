  "text": "Next year will be my fifth and final year of college.\n\nI never really found my group of close friends or had a girlfriend or anything. The acquaintance level friends I did have basically all graduated this year.\n\nNow I'm just realizing that after not seeing anyone in person for more than a year, as much as I want a girlfriend I don't even have a crush on anyone any more.\n\nJust feels like a new level of loneliness to me. Because when you have a crush, at least you have someone to think about and talk to and plan next steps with. When you don't even have that, it's just... even lonelier.\n\nJust wanted to get it off my chest. Hopefully next year will be better and I'll make some friends and stuff.",

Like I've never been on a date and I've spent most of my life without many friends tbh. Not a complaint, it just is what it is, there's happy days and days where it's tougher, but that's true no matter what. \n\nI'm not saying I have the highest self confidence or anything (I definitely don't), but I guess I generally do feel comfortable by myself. I just would like to balance it out some and feel comfortable with someone else too haha. It's not that I don't like being alone ever, it's just that I don't necessarily like being alone always :)",

I don\u2019t even know why I have a phone.. no one talks to me. I have spent so many nights trying to find what the hell my purpose is. Where the hell I fall into. It turns out.. I am just a pure version of myself. No sugarcoating to make people like me. Just me. And by letting go what I fear (i.e what people think), I\u2019ve been able to learn new skills. Girlfriend front though.. it\u2019s kinda hard to love someone if you can barely love yourself. Still working on that one.",

      "text": "Having someone love you is truly a blessing and a romantic bond makes you feel like you have a perennial warm fuzzy blanket wrapped around you shielding yourself from everything wrong when they show their care for you. Their smell and a warm hug is all you need as medicine. I see what you mean when you say that you want a girlfriend that bad. HOWEVER. Trust me, having a crush on someone and seeing that person going out with someone else and not giving two shits about u is even worse. I understand where you are coming from because I was there not too long ago but when I finally did fall in love and it didn\u2019t work out the way I wanted it to... it is a whole different kind of hell. Maybe it is because I find it harder to get over people and it\u2019s been a whole year and yet I am exactly where I was a year ago. I have lost weight, I have become an insomniac... it is pathetic. When I was single and did not have a crush, did not know how it feels to be in love and feel loved (even if for a bit) I was much happier, you could call it blissful ignorance perhaps. I wish you all the best brother.",

Obviously neither is desirable but I kind of prefer having a crush, even if they don't like you back, personally... there's always the possibility that something changes with their feelings down the road (or at least you can tell yourself there's that chance), and even if they don't at least you still have someone to love yourself. Both painful in different ways, though. Keep your head up and I wish you all the best, as well.",
