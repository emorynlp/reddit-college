  "text": "My roommate is a child and I don't just mean by her age (18), she is a spoiled child. I am a busy graduating student yet I am able to do all my homeworks, studying, and projects along with cleaning any mess I make in the kitchen, cleaning my room, and doing laundry. All she does in her room is eat while watching shows or playing a game on her phone. Yet, she CAN'T take her laundry out or finish all her laundry or even clean up her mess. Her clothes have been in the laundry for more than a week and told me that after last week's laundry, she has this week's laundry to do. She is basically not planning to make me use the washer and dryer for another week. It's been almost 2 weeks already since I used our washer and dryer. She acts as if she owns it.\n\nEdit: she paused her laundry to let me do my laundry but asked if I can finish it all tonight. It's 10 pm btw and I have been studying.",

In short, she has more clothes to wash and then it will be my turn. I just think it is so selfish.",

Sometimes friends are better not rooming together, just like how some families shouldn't work together or sometimes your manager is an awful manager but is a really nice person. If you're still friends with your roomie I bet she isn't an awful person but if you can have a heart to heart I would try to. Explain that you feel like you don't have your own space bc she's always making any shared space dirty. Try your best to not say things like that you work harder or you pay for this and she doesn't or whatever. Easier said than done I know. If you want to stay friends with her try to still hang out without talking about the apartment/dorm. Or try to find somewhere else to live for the spring?",

We thought this would work since we have made rules to each other and came to an understanding with most of the stuff but I guess we didn't cover everything.\n\nAs I mentioned, we do still talk to each other and hang out and whenever I need to bring up the laundry  in the conversation when we are just in our room, I never mention any other issues because that is outside of it. Generally, I also try not to say 'I do more of this thing' to other people because I always try to find somethings that I am equal to the other person and not that I am better at handling my life. As I also mentioned, I try to understand because we are both students and I never mentioned I managed being an 18-year old student better than she is rn.\n\nI will definitely be living somewhere else for the spring.\n\nEdit:\n\nI replied to another comment and got confused so I kept saying as I mentioned when the previous reply wasn't to you.

I'm not saying that what she's doing is forgivable, but rather suggesting that the inconsiderate behavior may be indicative of an internal struggle to find motivation. It's not expected for you to help her, but i think if you put the behavior into a different context, then it may not become a personal issue for you. Living with other people is always a struggle and communication is super important to resolve small problems like these. I hope it gets better for you.",

I am venting and complaining but I'm not calling her to be a lazy ass right away or any other names, just spoiled. There is a lot of background to this and I will try to briefly go over it.\n\nWe were both in a bigger room and sharing it with other people and only the two of us would clean so we decided to separate from our other friends but now that she's only been with me, she's starting to be uncaring and selfish now because she knows I always try to be nice. I have also always been talking to her and I know that this 'laundry issue' is not because she is going through something. There's some other issues I get annoyed too but I always try to understand her. She is still motivated, she's been going to her class, her work, studying, cleaning, and cooking. She is a fellow student and I know how much we have to study or do homeworks and that's why I have been pretty lenient when she leaves it for 3-4 days because I just think she has been busy with school. However, this is the weekend and I have been in the same space as her the entire day and asked if she can be done with her laundry so I can do mine. She just said she will get it done but didn't do it. She still gets up and leaves her room to cook or grab some food, move on the couch to watch her shows, and be on call with her other friends. She did the same thing for 2 days where she didn't have any pressing matters to take of immediately, other than the laundry ( I asked her).\n\nIf we are going to use the excuse of being understanding because it might be serious, keep in mind here that I am the senior with graduation requirements to take care of, job applications to send and job interviews to schedule, homeworks, projects, and also a life. We are the same boat and I have tried to be understanding for the first half of the term. She is not thinking I might need to do laundry because I need my business clothes again. In this case, she is causing me more stress and the more this will continue to the both of us, she will eventually become too toxic for me and then my passive aggressiveness will be toxic for her too. This is already so stressful for me that I ended up posting this vent on reddit.",
