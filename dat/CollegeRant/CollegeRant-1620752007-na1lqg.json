  "text": "I have been attending college since I was 18. I just turned 26.\n\nI literally cannot graduate. I will be doing very well and then I always self-sabotage. I was on track to graduate this June. Finally. Four more courses. And then guess what? I started having panic attacks and withdrew socially, like I always do, and now I can't graduate because I had to withdraw from a course.\n\nAll of the summer courses are taken, so I can't try again.\n\nAnd just like that, I won't be graduating until December. If I can even pass, that is.\n\nSome people are not meant for school and I truly believe I am one of them. Yet I have poured thousands and thousands into a degree that is simply unachievable for me.\n\nYes, this is a pity party. No, I do not care that it is one. I've already accepted that I won't ever give up, but at this point I think I should.",

      "text": "OP I am 26 (soon to be 27) and literally a MONTH away from getting just my associates. I\u2019ve dropped out from college several times because of self sabotage. I did work on this in therapy but what really helped me was letting go of perfectionism. When I realize that sometimes I check out and fall behind I communicate with my professor and turn it in anyway, I\u2019ve done this MANY times and still passed each semester with As. I am also getting evaluated this week for ADHD and if I have it I will definitely be asking for accommodations as you should for your anxiety. (I have anxiety and depression as well but the medications And therapy im taking have been helping me manage). A lot of times the self sabotage comes from fear of failure, you\u2019ll tell yourself you\u2019ll fail because you always do so you withdraw instead to avoid failing. It sucks to fail, and that\u2019s definitely not the goal but try seeing things through anyway, you need atleast a C or D to actually pass and at this point you only have a few more courses. The next time you get these feelings, sit with them a few days, try to do a little bit of work each day, communicate with your professor for an extension and maybe shorten your course load to part time to reduce your anxiety and pressure! You\u2019ve got this, I\u2019ll probably be 29 or 30 when I finish my bachelors but I don\u2019t care lol Even if I have to take breaks and go part time. Go at your own pace! Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to or encouragement/support.",

      "text": "I feel the same way but am a bit younger. I always self sabotage. Turns out it\u2019s not just anxiety, but I also have a personality disorder that makes sticking with things incredibly difficult. You may try seeing another professional, maybe a psychiatrist? Regardless, you are not a failure for not completing school. I don\u2019t know what to say to help except that school is not the be all end all. If school is causing you too much distress, you can find entry level jobs and try to work up from there and maybe they\u2019ll even pay for your degree in the future. Or you might find a job you genuinely love and don\u2019t even need a degree for. There\u2019s technical degrees, which may or may not be up your alley. Also, it\u2019s never to late to go back to school. So, don\u2019t feel ashamed to stop now and go back in 10, 20, 30 years. I know many successful people with no degrees. My dad has a masters and works a job that only requires an associates. My mom has a phD and is a teacher. They\u2019re over educated. Point is, lots of people feel like they\u2019ve wasted time and money in school and you aren\u2019t alone in that. Also, the education system is seriously messed up and school is not structured for everyone. Some people excel, others don\u2019t. It does not mean you\u2019re dumb or will never accomplish anything in life.",

They can give you assignment extensions and other resources to hopefully make it easier to succeed with anxiety. For example I have anxiety (and other mental health issues), so I get time and a half for exams, homework extensions, testing in small environments, and reduced course load. At my CC, they even offered me scheduled tutoring sessions twice a week. These extensions do require a large amount of personal accountability though.\n\nLike you, medication did nothing for me. In fact, every medication I was on triggered rapid cycling or GI symptoms so I choose no more medication after 3+ years of suffering and hospitalizations. Obviously, see a psychiatrist since this may not work for everyone, but my psychiatrist recommended exercise as a treatment plan and regular appointments to make sure I\u2019m doing okay and remaining stable.\n\nI know you can do this. And I admire your perseverance. Sending hugs",

For you, just \u201cdoing it\u201d will take doing some other things first. Specifically learning about avoidant coping and how to replace it with healthier coping techniques, learning anxiety reduction techniques (sensory techniques, muscle relaxation, breathing), and talking with someone about what you really are afraid of, what the worst case scenario would be if your fears came to fruition, and how to keep those fears from being the loudest voice in your head.

Worst part is the grade won't even go in until AFTER commencement. So basically, I've invited my family to watch me graduate, but won't even actually know if I graduated. Makes no freakin sense. I know it sucks ass to be far behind. ESPECIALLY when bullshit keeps happening. I got so held up in comm college that it messed a lot up with university, and universities make it damn near impossible to smoothly transfer credits from comm colleges. That being said, it's one more classm it definitely sucks, but all you can do is try to pick a professor who is rated well on rate my professor and try to keep your head up. You'll at least be able to focus on that one class instead of 4. This semester was the first time in YEARS that I went to school full time in a semester and I had MANY breakdowns. You're not alone.",
