  "text": "Hey all.\n\nI went to school about a year before the pandemic and I was on campus in a dorm and I had the time of my life and friends. Mostly A's student and I thought I had a plan.\n\nI switch majors (engineering to psychology) and take off a year to work and save money.  Pandemic happens and no school.\n\nAt this point, it's been 2 years since I went to school last and I am going to a different school more suited for my new major. At first, everything was okay, I was just anxious and met with the school therapist. Then I missed one assignment in one class ant that snowballed into me now having missed 4 assignments for that class including an essay and I haven't started any of these. I do hate that class but now I am using that as an excuse. I just got a 68 on an exam for another class and missed an assignment for a 3rd class. I feel awful and I don't know what to do. I feel like I am changing for the worst and becoming someone I do not want to be, and someone who is unmotivated and doesn't want to do anything. I recognize all of this yet I am not doing anything and I feel trapped by myself. I know stupid this all sounds and I really just wanted to vent. I always hated people who only ever complained about their lives and did nothing to fix it when they could yet I am doing it right now.\n\nI am scared my major, forensic psychology, isn't the right one for me or I won't be able to make it and I know for a fact that if I keep it up at this rate I won't! my backup plans are also things I am scared of changing to like a police officer or clinical therapist.\n\nDoes anyone relate or have related to before? How do you cope or how did you fix it?\n\nI just wish the pandemic never happened because I feel like that has caused all of this. I had a plan and now I don't.",
