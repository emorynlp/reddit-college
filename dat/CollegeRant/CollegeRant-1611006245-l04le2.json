  "text": "Yes, we all know you didn\u2019t get a prom, or a graduation, or get to go to frats and tailgates first semester. And don\u2019t get me wrong, that sucks. No one is denying you that. In fact, everyone acknowledges that. Your hometown put up banners around town, your mom and dad had a yard sign outside, and the university is letting you come back to live on campus before anyone else. \n\nBut please, for the love of God, accept that this is life. And yes, it sucks, and you\u2019ll never be able to make up for lost time. But everyone in college is losing milestones and years of \u201cthe best years of your life.\u201d Don\u2019t try to \u201cout pity\u201d someone with things that happened almost a year ago, in a different city, in a different school. \n\nIf we\u2019re partners in a group project, don\u2019t tell me the reason you couldn\u2019t do your work was because you were out with friends, and then use \u201chaha high school class of 2020!\u201d to guilt me. Or get mad when a senior brings up they won\u2019t be on campus for their last semester and are graduating into one of the worst job markets in US history, saying \u201cwell at least you got three years of fun before covid...\u201d Or start petitions because even though there\u2019s a pandemic, you think your class ONLY should be given special privileges on campus. And next time someone shares how they have to take out more loans because they lost their part time job, just listen. Don\u2019t bring up how your senior trip to Disney got cancelled and you didn\u2019t get a refund.\n\nI\u2019m sorry high school and the beginning of college didn\u2019t go to the way you wanted it to. I understand these are formative years and milestones you\u2019ve looked forward to. But please be kind to the people around you, because we\u2019re missing things too. And if you would stop crying you didn\u2019t get a dance party with fluffy dresses, maybe you\u2019d feel more connected to the campus because people could then take you seriously. \n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to find your place as a freshman; it\u2019s harder when you distance yourself from everyone/make them uncomfortable with your constant complaining. I say this part frustrated, but also part lovingly, because this mindset isn\u2019t healthy: You\u2019re in college, start acting like it and move on from high school.\n\n(I recognize this is not everyone in the class of 2024. However, even my friends who are freshmen agree this is a common and toxic mentality.)\n\nTL;DR: College class of 2024 needs to realize they aren\u2019t \u201chigh school class of 2020\u201d anymore and actually try to move on if they want to feel welcome at college, not just fish for sympathy because they had an objectively bad senior year.",

It really sucks, but honestly I feel more bad for the Class of 2021 who has to go through this College Admissions Process and potential entire senior year remote learning. Honestly, I prefer college remote learning over High School remote learning. I have less College Classes and the structure of college classes fits better with being online (not that isn't terrible at times). I've moved on from \"losing\" my senior year of High School and now I'm trying to make my way in college which is tricky.",

Pretending that those feelings aren\u2019t there is counterintuitive as repression only hides those feelings for a while and makes them worse. \n\nIt\u2019s a continuous loss for those of us starting college. First it was all those end of year milestones and now it\u2019s our entire college experience. Not meeting people in person and the isolation that comes with it is brutal at times. I was hoping to meet with ppl over Christmas but BAM lockdown. That sucked. It continues to suck. Will I get on with it? Yes. Will there be better days? Also yes.

I am still loosing out on things to this day: \nI have had my first semester of Uni online, (which was meant to be a mix of online and in Uni). I have not been able to meet people or get to know my class mates properly. I hoped to do so over the Christmas break, and meet up with friends again but guess what? my country went into another Lockdown. So I lost out on that completely. I haven\u2019t been with people really since March. It freaking sucks. \n\nUntil the day that we stop loosing things comes we will still feel the losses. I think we have every right to feel how we feel wether that\u2019s being upset, angry or isolated and so on. Because it\u2019s still very real. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that people should wallow. What my point is that feeling sad or angry at the situation at times is understandable especially as they continue to loose out on things. \n\nEdit: I changed and added a sentence or two to better articulate my tone.\n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure that people outside of my year are even completely content with the way things are. Yes there has been a lot of focus on us but everyone has had their struggles and some continue to do so. They are valid.",

But once junior year hit they were just concentrating on getting their life on track so that they could graduate and have a plan post graduation. Ya it definitely sucks, especially since universities aren't handling COVID well. Like, at all. But at the end of the day you're not missing out from prom, you can make things happen with friends who you actually have a close connection to (because I KNOW that you've probably lost contact with people who were your best friend in high school), and you can actually focus on school without the distractions around. I know college is shown as being this fun experience. But honestly, even before COVID it's not lol it's stressful as fuck and the only fun happens if you split up time you could be using for studying to do clubs or if you party. Both which you end up not doing anymore because getting work done becomes top priority.",

Yes of course there is but that doesn\u2019t help take away your pain. \n\nI think what sucks particularly for freshers is not being able to meet other students. People who have been in college likely already have some sort of social circle. For many new students this hasn\u2019t happened. (Depends on the course tbf and what college has been doing eg online vs on campus). Keeping in contact with friends when you move to college is always hard but there\u2019s usually a natural new group of friends or social scene that replaces that. That\u2019s not happening for the freshers this year. Isolation is real and loneliness is a battle of its own.\n\nEdit: typo",

Additionally, you're not really supposed to be seeing anyone outside your household anyways so it's kinda a moot point whether or not you have friends in an area. \n\nI agree that Class of 2020 does have a unique situation and a hard time, but what I think OP is referring to is that class of 2020 aren't the only ppl having a hard time and lot of ppl within it are acting like they're the only ones whose struggles matter because they were robbed of spring of senior year and fall and onwards of freshman year",

I was in the car when I first read it lol. I guess I took it personally. What I didn\u2019t like was them saying to get on with it. Like yes we need to and I think for the most part are but there are definitely still some areas such as social life where people from class of 20 are still loosing out on. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to underestimate it.",

I look around and realise that I haven\u2019t made any real new friends this semester. Ive asked around and it\u2019s a pretty common thing for a lot of us in different Uni\u2019s and Colleges where I live. All of those emotions about isolation and loneliness just hit me like a truck. I realised that I had just lost a semester of social interaction. \n\nI don\u2019t know many that have wallowed in it. Just people who have lost out and feel like rubbish every now and again about it when they loose something more. I\u2019m not going to tell them that their feelings are any less valid because they are from the class of 2020 and have had extra attention and sympathy over the year. It doesn\u2019t take it away.",

Then you\u2019ve got the people whining about how they don\u2019t feel safe for their in-person classes if they have them.
