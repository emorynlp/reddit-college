  "text": "Tl;dr: English professor makes me feel that I may actually survive college \n\nI\u2019m failing math as a freshman, doubtful I\u2019ll do well enough to remotely pass finals for that class. But my English professor just gave me unsolicited feedback that an essay I wrote could earn me a scholarship or possible publication and to look into it. I really needed to hear something like that. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was cut out for college, but clearly I\u2019m good at something. Thank you prof C.",
