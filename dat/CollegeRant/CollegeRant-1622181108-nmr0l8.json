  "text": "well hello, SORRY IF ITS LONG BUT: i\u2019ll start saying that i\u2019m from argentina btw and i\u2019m studying to become a pharmacist. at the moment i\u2019m at third year (of five and a half) and studying six subjects this year (which goes from april to november)\nMy biggest issue here is that i\u2019ve got this subject (called analytical chemistry) which makes my life a hell. The last year has been completely online so i think i didn\u2019t learn at my fullest, for example, i had organic chemistry which i didn\u2019t get to do the practises at the lab yet due to the highest cases of corona here. So i think i\u2019m lacking knowledge.\nMoving forward my first issue, AQ is being very thought to me at the moment and i\u2019m spending A LOT of time on that subject, leaving behind the other 5 which are very hard and demanding too. I\u2019ve already had an exam which I had a very bad grade.\nMy dilemma here is that i don\u2019t know if i should drop it and wait till next year. (this will give me more free time that i can use on another subject and to learn the knowledge that i don\u2019t know from years before). The problem here is that i will get delayed another year because of correlatives.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the end of the world drop a subject \u2014which would give me less anxiety if i did i\u2014 but i\u2019m unsure. I\u2019ve never did it before so i don\u2019t know what to do.\nMy next exam is on the 14th. Should i take the test and see what happens or what? If you\u2019ve reached this far i\u2019m glad. I hope you have a lovely day.",
