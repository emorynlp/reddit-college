  "text": "So I'm literally going to have to beg my professor not to report me for accidental plagerisum again. I didn't realize I was plagerizing in the first paper and by the time I found out, I had already written and submitted the 2nd one with similar issue. I've never had this issue before this class and I really hate myself for it. I've sent him a email trying to explain myself but I feel like since it's the 2nd time he won't forgive me. Feeling super dumb and currently catostrophasizing.  I don't want a permanent mark on my record especially since I want to go to gradschool. Life is big sad rn :(",

      "text": "That\u2019s rough sometimes we have to suffer the consequences to really learn. You did everything you could by contacting the professor. Whatever happens try to learn from this. There are citation books you can read for free at your schools library. There\u2019s also websites you can go to for help with citations. Just quoting/building on an idea correctly isn\u2019t a big deal. Try Mendeley. Or ebsco.",
