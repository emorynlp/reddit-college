  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to contact my advisor about this but of course she never answers. This is going to sound ridiculous but I have a 92.95 in a class and I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m gonna failed the final. My professor ain\u2019t a harsh grader, he seems to want for every to pass, the lowest grade I\u2019ve gotten this semester in the class is a 77 C and that\u2019s the only low grade. However I\u2019ve convinced myself that I\u2019m gonna fail the final and end up with a C or worse (even tho I did check and even if I got a total 0 I would only get a B for the total course) so yeah my brain is playing the worst games with me at the moment and I half way though my finals project that\u2019s for Tuesday \ud83d\ude00",

      "text": "I feel it. I have huge anxiety surrounding grades. We just finished finals on Thursday and I have been obsessively checking for scored. The due date for scores is Monday. I just can't help it though! I have these thoughts that I'm going to bomb my finals and end up with terrible grades even though I know that's not really possible. I'm planning on talking to my counselor at school about it when I get back next semester.",
