  "text": "In my business class we have a group project. It is about the food business. There are 3 parts, and 4 of us in the group. For the first part, we all worked together and answered the questions in a split up manner. For the second part, our group President skipped our agreed meeting to draft our profit and loss statement. The three of us felt okay she can do the written part because it should take her the same amount of time we spent in the meeting. She said no. The professor tells us to give her our ideas, and this girl can conduct research and put them all together. Well, she did no work, and only used MY ideas for the whole part. I told the Professor, and said I have proof these are only my ideas (I texted them to the girl to help her form some of her own). The professor did not want to see the proof and said \u201cthese things happen. at least you\u2019re learning.\u201d This was about two weeks ago. I am just still very angry about it! Wednesday we are finalizing parts 1, 2, & the P&L statement. Then we begin part three, and I can\u2019t wait for it to be done! I hate this class, I hate this project, and I hate the girl in my group. I can\u2019t wait for this to end, and I hope I never have this Professor again, although I likely will. Sigh.",
