  "title:": "Why am I in school studying the program that I am in?",
  "text": "I feel that I am not the type of person who is smart enough for university. I hate it with a passion. I am not academically intelligent and I hate reading/writing despite being in a program that is heavy on reading and writing. I can\u2019t sit around studying all day because I\u2019d rather do something else. I am currently doing a research assignment but I have no fxcking clue what I am doing. I procrastinate like crazy which explains why I always do things last minute or even hand things in late. I\u2019m a mess and I don\u2019t give a shit about what I\u2019m learning but, somehow I was able to pass all my classes with a relatively decent mark. I have barely learned a single useful thing in college/university. I am wasting my life and I am $15,000 in debt. I just want to enjoy life and be happy about the things that I do instead of being so stressed and worn out. I have always been an artistic or athletic person since I was little but never really had the chance to do anything meaningful with it. I always thought that a career in these fields would be unsustainable. The people around me would say the same.  \nAnyways, thank you for listening to my rant :)",

      "text": "One important factor is how far into college you are. Also, do you happen to have ADD or ADHD? I don't think i'm the best on advice for college-related paths, but, since u posted that you're into atheletics, maybe you could join your college's sports team. It might also be a good idea to get out of that program. don't stay in college or in that college's path it's making you feel this way; you **will** regret it if you do.",

I feel like I should just push through it and graduate. Its not like I have to get a job in this field. It could be my backup or just something I could rely on when getting a stable job. What are your thoughts?",
