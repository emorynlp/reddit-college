  "text": "You have to go into a ton of debt and pour a ton of hours as well as suffer and be mentally tortured to get a degree. College is so hard as most professors don't want to help you and if you cheat because you don't want to go through college without sleeping, your whole life might as well be over and you might as well end your life there. Even if you do get a degree, that isn't somehow enough. You still need internships or whatever nonsense companies want from you only for you to still need to apply for over 100 companies just get rejections. Even then, you still need to pass background checks. If you committed a significant crime in the past because of how hard college is and how stressful life is, you might as well end your life there. I am honestly shocked that most people managed to make it through life without any major issues and maintain a normal social life. That is literally unthinkable for me.",

As for social life, I struggle with it myself but I\u2019m forcing myself to go out and reach out to people to make new friends. At the end, it\u2019s your life and you can choose to do anything with it, throw it away or actually having fun with it, it\u2019s your call.",
