  "text": "\nRecently, I feel like my life has been on a downward slope. What\u2019s bothering me most is my grades. I know as a freshman in college that shouldn\u2019t really stress me out but honestly it is. On my last test for chemistry and calculus, I got a c on one and a d on another. This leaves me with a c in chem and a c in calc. It\u2019s so defeating Bc I literally put SO much effort into studying for these. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s bothering me like no other. I\u2019m premed and the thought of not becoming a doctor is stressing me out. I have the finals for these classes coming up and I\u2019m feeling very demotivated and defeated. Just wanted to get it out.",

      "text": "Got an A in highschool calc, decided to \"challenge myself\" with honors calc in college. studied for a week and a half before a test for a min of 6 hours a day, got a low C on the exam(all my other test scores were also low C's). He crams so much material into one exam that there's no feasible way to master any of the topics. Calc final is in a week, but if it took me more than a week to study for a portion of the course, how the heck am I supposed to do well on the final with only a week left and other finals to study for... feeling similar to you, lets do our best",
