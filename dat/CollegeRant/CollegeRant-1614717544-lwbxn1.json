Fuck 1000 word essays for a dumb question that can be answered in a quarter of that. It feels like so much filler. It feels like its all useless. I shoulda went to trade school and got some marketable skills like wielding or some shit. I just hate this place more and more.",

I went from getting my stick rod stuck in the scrap metal the first 30 minutes of class to being able to somewhat make a \u2018meh\u2019 bead of welding lines in the last 2 hours of class(I\u2019m fucking up the professional way to say it). I still am shit but now I\u2019m a less stinky shit. \n\nI want to drop all college classes then do Christopher McCandless. But I missed the drop deadline and have currently boasted to my parents I\u2019m doing well and in fact I\u2019m doing the complete opposite. \n\nI\u2019m going through existential crisis again but I\u2019m happy at least I don\u2019t want to end my life :)",
