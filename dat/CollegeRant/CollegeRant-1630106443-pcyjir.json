  "text": "I just finished my first week of college and I'm an outcast I feel like no one wants to be around me or talk to me unless they have too for group work. I just wanted one friend to keep me company in class but I don't think that's gonna happen I'm a freshman at my college a bio major my dressing style is kinda alternative and everyone else is sporty and preppy so I feel like people don't like me cause I'm not like that and I just hope someone talks to me I'm mostly a reserved person to begin with lots of social anxiety.",

      "text": "Oof. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you. Even though I\u2019ve been out of college since 2018, I\u2019ve been in your shoes.\n\nYou have to remember that this is just the first week. Many students are just beginning to settle in, and get used to the college life. You have hundreds of more weeks to befriend people. \n\nYou also have to remember that friendships take time to grow. While I met some of my best friends in college, we didn\u2019t become close for several months. It took months of constantly talking and experiencing shit together for us to become close. \n\nIs there a particular club you\u2019re interested in? Join one, and you\u2019re much more likely to find likeminded people. It\u2019s much easier to befriend likeminded people.  Same thing with your classes. Find someone who likes the same stuff as you, and talk to them.",
