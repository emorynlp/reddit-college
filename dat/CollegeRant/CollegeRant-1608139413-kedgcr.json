  "text": "Like literally. It is unreal. I've changed majors, I've held a part time or FT job all through college while paying all my bills and living on my own and I AM EXHAUSTED. I finally cranked out one of my last semesters but literally bombed my final for a class so will probably have to retake the course either this winter or push back another semester and spread my classes out for a whole other year since I need that one as a pre req for another. I feel literally defeated and my parents probably think I suck. Sorry just had to vent. I hope everyone is killing it with finals.",
