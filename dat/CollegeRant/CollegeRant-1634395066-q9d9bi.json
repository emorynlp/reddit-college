  "text": "Sometimes I feel like my heart isn't in college at times. I'm trying my best, I love my major, and I even am working with one of my college's sports teams for my resume as well. I'm on track to graduate in a few years and am passing all my classes (although they're not all As). I shouldn't be feeling down about college because everything is going well.\n\nEven with everything going well, I just don't seem to enjoy college. I don't know what it is that has made me lose some of my heart for college three semesters in. I got so many questions to ask about it. Is it because I still haven't made any friends and still barely know anyone in college? Is it because I'm feeling way less pressure this semester than in the past? Is it because I perform better under pressure? Is it because I feel like I'm not doing my best when I am? Is it because I've been unhappier than usual over the past four-five months?\n\nIt's frustrating dealing with this. I WANT to graduate college and I WILL. I got a good and enjoyable major and I'm doing well, so I won't quit. I just don't know why my heart isn't always in college. Maybe it's because I've been trying to look out for myself? I don't know, but I want this feeling to end quickly.",

This is bc everyone is in their own journey. About not having friends just taking yourself out on dates, one will find friends when it\u2019s the right time. I think that it can be hard for a lot of college students to make friends bc we\u2019re all in a freakin rush. Take yourself out on dates. I do this I go to the store alone and go out to eat. Learn to Enjoy your own company, as a friendless college student as well this also has helped me bc it makes me fee independent, so I hope it can help u too! Just keep pushing past that feeling of uncertainty!

I think the bigger problem with taking a break too is financial aid and the possibility I won't be able to find a job during that time. I've been turned down multiple times.

      "text": "Whenever I find myself feeling like this, I find that the problem is a lack of challenge in my life. I don't mean challenge in some horrible event or injury or something, although sometimes that's unintentionally the case. I've learned that having a challenge that forces me to grow and learn is what makes me feel like my best self. \n\nFor me, 15 years of competitive gymnastics was my ongoing challenge to upgrade skills and make the next level. So when I got to college and no longer did gymnastics, I felt exactly how you felt now, and over time I realized that feeling was because I wasn't pursuing something important to me that forced me to evolve. It doesn't have to be something as drastic as a college major (although again that may be the case!) - it could be picking up a new sport like rock climbing or a hobby like painting. Maybe it's researching and applying to internships or research in your field of study that interests or excites you. Maybe it is a difficult course you're taking that is important and in order to pass it, you have to actually learn the material, not just regurgitate it. \n\nWhen I'm pursuing a goal or tackling a challenge that is bigger than a single moment, I find that is where a lot of my sense of fulfillment and drive in life comes from. That's not to say there isn't value in the simple things like nights out with friends or hobbies that aren't \"productive\" or challenging but relaxes you or brings you joy.  Obviously, this is just a personal anecdote of what works for me, and I highly recommend seeking help if you start feeling experiencing severe depression or anxiety. College is hard, and it's even harder right now. Sometimes we just need to push through the maintenance \"ruts\" in our lives in order to fully enjoy the peaks.",

          "text": "I definitely have thought that maybe I need a challenge as well, one that feels difficult, yet achievable, without sacrificing a majority of my mental health. I really began to think about this when I went through one of mt first waves of major reflection earlier this year. I realized that I didn't have many enjoyable hobbies, but I really enjoyed playing basketball (casually) and I believed that was due to me seriously improving my skillset as a player and witnessing my growth in pick-up games. Basketball always gave me a serious challenge, something that this semester really hasn't given me with such a light workload (only when tests come around do I feel like I have any serious pressure) and no serious deadlines. \n\nRight now, I don't feel anything I can challenge myself with within my academic field either. Like I said, I don't feel a serious challenge in my work (exception being the three small essays I have to write and the few tests I take). I could raise my expectations to aim for straight As and I always try to aim for those, but it becomes hard to keep up with when I'm always looking out for my mind as well. I'm not trying to overpush myself. I also am working with one of my college's sports teams and that's tiring enough as a commuter since that means I have to stick around on campus from 6 PM - 9 PM for 4-5 days a week, so I can't find an internship. So right now, a lot seems to be going in my favor. \n\nThroughout my period of reflection though, I've came to realize I've needed to challenge myself in my personal life. For the past few months, I've truly began looking out for my body more than ever. I cut off most of social media. I've cut out a daily habit of drinking pop/soda (I have a drink from time to time, but not often), I've cut out snacking, and right now I'm trying to lose weight. So far, that's gone well since I'm always at the college gym shooting around, but sometimes I still eat quite a lot during dinner depending on the meal. I'm thinking I need a few more challenges as well - one of them is figuring out how to become more social and make a few friends. I'm thinking that if I can successfully succeed in all of these challenges, I really might be able to find most, if not all, of my heart in college again.\n\nNow that I think about it, maybe the root cause of my current issue is that there's some sort of disconnect within me. It's something I can't explain at the moment, but I think what challenges I feel like I need to complete to truly have my heart back in college 100% can explain it. I really appreciate your comment to my original post though, that may have helped me a lot.",

              "text": "I'm glad it helped, even if it just got you thinking! For what it's worth, I've had a lot of time to reflect on things over the past year or so (between having an elbow surgery and also living in a studio apt, things are quiet haha) and the realizations didn't necessarily come quickly. Sometimes I make connections or realizations at the most random times. But comparing myself a year ago to myself now, I can actually feel the difference in a way. \n\nThe way I look at the world around me and my role within it has changed. Some of the things I so desperately wanted, like a fulfilling major/career, were impossible for me to see clearly until I did do that deep soul searching. Once I became more in tune with who I really was, without all the static of social media/other expectations clouding that image, things started to come into focus. \n\nA phrase I've found myself thinking a lot lately is \"I still don't know exactly where I'm going, but for the first time in a long time I know I'm walking in the right direction.\" I still don't know exactly what I want to do when I graduate in a year - my course schedule is literally split between finishing my business admin degree and taking as many geology courses as possible since that is my passion. I have no idea how those two things will come together in the future, but I've felt myself loosening my grip on needing to see exactly where I am going before I can go there. \n\nComparing all the things that \"felt right\" in the past to how I feel right now, it's a completely different sensation. In the past, I basically picked a predetermined goal to accomplish, and would feel unfulfilled even if I did accomplish it, which was rare. Now I have a sense that the role I am supposed to fill in this world is one not yet defined, and that path I've finally started walking is the one that will make me into that person. \n\nThis is definitely a lot of rambling and late night thoughts, but I wanted you to know that this feeling does change. Personal growth and insight into who you really are and what you really want out of life is the only thing that bridges the gap we all stare down that represents the difference between our dreams and reality. If you can see your dream perfectly clear right now, is it really *your* dream, or one you settled on because you knew you should be pursuing something and not because it is what drives you? This is the question I found myself asking a couple weeks ago, and it was a very defining moment in my understanding of why I felt exactly how you described in your post. I really hope things start looking up for you, and like I said before remember that there are valleys and peaks in life - the valleys aren't necessarily the lows, but the times that prepare you to make the absolute most out of the peaks.",
