  "text": "\nCurrently taking my final semester only two classes and one of them is kicking my ass. I have a 95 in the class but I feel so insecure with every assignment I do. I\u2019m always scared my grades gonna drop. It\u2019s so much work and takes up so much time and I end up feeling nauseous at the thought of even doing work. Worst is there is a 210 point assignment I gave in like a month ago and it still isn\u2019t graded. I\u2019ve never had an assignment worth so many point, I don\u2019t even know how the grading would work. I\u2019m scared that assignment will make my grade tank and I\u2019ll have no way of getting back up. It\u2019s the highest assignment of the semester. The teacher isn\u2019t someone who deliberately wants students to fail and he seems nice and wants to help but I don\u2019t like the class at all. Just struggling over here.",
