  "text": "Hello! I am freaking out about my next midterm (Tuesday, Nov. 2). The math class I\u2019m in is called \u201cMATH 3823W: Foundations, Sequences, and series.\u201d The class is entirely about proofs. \n\nBefore this class, math had been more so about finding an answer than proving something outright. \n\nNever have I struggled with math, but now I can\u2019t seem to figure out the concepts! Knowing how to prove something requires much more knowledge than knowing how to find an answer. Up until now, ive always considered myself good at math too. Now, I feel like such an idiot.\n\nTL;DR my confidence is being wrecked by a math class on proofs. It just feels like a headache and a half.",

To be blunt about things - you were succeeding at following directions with maybe some conceptual understanding, but not necessarily \"math\" in of itself. This isn't to say that you don't have the ability to understand \"real math\", but this is a learning moment to help you understand the difference between rote computation and genuine synthesis of the concepts.\n\nThat said, what you're going through is entirely normal; for the courses up until this point, simply following directions is really enough to get through. It's a sad consequence of how math is taught at times in the lower-levels (procedure and marks above creativity and understanding). Once you get over this hurdle, you'll begin to see math in a whole new way and, eventually, begin to understand exactly what is meant by my first paragraph.",
