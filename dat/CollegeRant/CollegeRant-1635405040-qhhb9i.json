  "text": "Isolation has screwed me up royally. I have done a lot of classes towards my degree, I'm quite literally 2 semesters away from completing, the current semester and the next semester, but my mental health has tanked. I've reached out to my mom already and she's been nothing but helpful and encouraging to get my mind on track.\n\nBut because of my mental health and anxiety, I've just not turned in a lot of stuff for 2 out of 4 of my classes, they seem too daunting. I've received multiple emails stating \"You're about to fail out of this class,\" and it just piled onto the anxiety where I'm basically paralyzed on the amount of work I have to do and have to turn in. I've already expressed the idea of just taking this and the next semester off since receiving a failed class on my record is worse than just dropping it. But I know on the other hand it's just 2 semesters and I'll be done but I can't get through that mental block. \n\nTime and money always comes back in the conversations, \"you've spent so much time, it's just 6 more weeks.\" I just can't",

      "text": "Babe! Take a deep breath! There is no rush! I took on an additional year at the end because I was mentally broken and needed to finish my thesis, remotely and at home. Best decision I ever made. It took a little extra time but I was home with constant support and less anxiety about being physically at the school, around triggering people and buildings. \nGo talk to registrar about your dilemma. I too have anxiety and the more authentic and open I am the better I feel. We are all different but I would take it easy and not rush these last two semesters. Don\u2019t fight and compete with yourself when you\u2019re so close to the end. The loans will be there and they will works themselves out.",
