  "text": "TLDR : I applied for a pretty selective internship program and was selected but was not given a place due to clash between college classes and the program.\n\n\nI applied for a national level Physics workshop/internship which accepts only 50 UG students nation-wide. Although it is targeted for people currently in their sophomore year or above (like most such opportunities), freshmen were eligible to apply this year.\n\nI found the brochure just 3 days before the deadline (although it was shared with the whole class about a month ago but since prerequisite to most such opportunities is being a sophomore, I might have not paid any attention to it earlier). Anyways, I applied (I had to solve some tricky physics problems). \nAnd to my surprise, I was provisionally selected. It was a pretty big deal. Because I am still a freshman and getting selected when pool size is of just 50 students nation-wide. I was quite happy. \n\nTo be finally selected, they required me to fill out a form indicating if my college's classes might take place during a given time bracket and whether I'd like to participate. I contacted my prof. to ask him what shall I do about the first question since some of my classes do take place during that time bracket. He told me to be honest and I felt the same so I marked \"Yes\" to both the questions. \n\nNow, I got an email from the Program Coordinator that since my college classes and program might clash, I am not being selected.\n\nBUT MAN, I thought it all through and I was ready to put in the fucking extra hard work. If I just wanted to attend college classes why would I've marked YES to \"Would you like to participate in the program?\". Its just so stupid. College classes suck anyway!!! \n\nIt was soo damn special for me because hell its a great opportunity for someone like me who is passionate about research. Also, I might have been one of the very few freshmen, selected for this very program. \n\nMaybe its not that big of a deal but I feel really really sad and I have no fucking idea about what do to. This could have made me stand out of my peers and might have had led to other cool opportunities but UGHHHH. \nI really feel like crying.",
