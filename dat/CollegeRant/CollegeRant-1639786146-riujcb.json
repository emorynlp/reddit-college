  "text": "The problems looked nothing like our previous exams even though my professor told us to review them so I was only able to solve a few of them. I probably cried at least 3 times while taking it (it\u2019s online so I can cry freely). When it was time to submit my work, the scanned photos looked like it was taken on a potato and there was no way I could make it clearer. I sent my professor a note about the photo quality in the submission just case but idk if he\u2019ll even acknowledge it.",
