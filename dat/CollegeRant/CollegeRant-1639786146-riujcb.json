  "text": "The problems looked nothing like our previous exams even though my professor told us to review them so I was only able to solve a few of them. I probably cried at least 3 times while taking it (it\u2019s online so I can cry freely). When it was time to submit my work, the scanned photos looked like it was taken on a potato and there was no way I could make it clearer. I sent my professor a note about the photo quality in the submission just case but idk if he\u2019ll even acknowledge it.",

      "text": "I had a terrible experience with a zoom final before so I know exactly how you feel. It was in 3 parts so we had to do a scan and submit 3 times :/ the time limits were super strict also and a lot of people were struggling to get the parts submitted in time. One girl ended up in tears bc her submission wouldn\u2019t go through and the professors + a bunch of students had to troubleshoot it *during* the test. Absolutely fucking nightmare \n\nAnyway I\u2019m done now and one day you will be too. Profs usually will be understanding with mess ups that happen. Maybe take clean new scans and send them to him too so he can forward those to the grader if need be.",
