  "text": "I go to a pretty large public university. This upcoming semester I planned on taking a certain VERY IMPORTANT class for me as a Junior both to stay on track with my major and for my upcoming internship this summer. I've been known to have terrible luck with class registration appointments as I am consistently getting later registration times than other students  (even those who have a similar amount of credits as me), and right before my account opened for class registration, this very important class and the waitlist completely filled up. Needless to say, I'm extremely stressed about this, as this may affect my ability to graduate on time and do an internship. I've tried submitting an override form but they explicitly state that they won't do anything about full classes. I tried emailing the professor and he basically just ignored everything I told him in the email and told me to fill out an override form. I set up an appointment with my advisor later this week but thus far all he has ever told me when it comes to any sort of issue I have is \"I'm new here so I don't know\". My major is relatively new to my university. This class was implemented as a core requirement for my major from initially being an elective for another similar major. Now I'm not gonna point any fingers, but something tells me that the majority of the students signed up for that class even now are students taking it as an elective and not a requirement. Not necessarily their fault per se, but you would think a university as large as mine has the competence to be able to prioritize kids who literally need the class to graduate. I'd even take it a step further and say that you'd expect a university the size of mine to have the competence to let's say oh I don't know DO THE BARE MINIMUM AND LET EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A CLASS FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT TAKE THE FUCKING CLASS, but hey, I'm only a student what do I know right?",
