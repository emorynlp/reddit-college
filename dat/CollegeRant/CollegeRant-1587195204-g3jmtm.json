  "title:": "Forgot about an online quiz. Im honestly tired of this life",
  "text": "\nSorry I just had to rant somewhere obviously this post will get ignored\n\nForgot about a damn online quiz just made me realize how tired I am of this life\n\nI still work cause I\u2019m an essential worker. I work the whole day and I don\u2019t get paid because it\u2019s a family job so 8-9 hours. I got so focused on finishing an assignment from one professor that I legitimately forgot about a quiz in another class. Furthermore I got caught up with the endless amount of tasks at work as well.\n\nShe obviously doesn\u2019t send out reminders (and I know that\u2019s not her job just mentioning the fact) and so I completely forgot. The quiz isn\u2019t 100 points or anything absurd but it\u2019s still a 0/5 points... and even if I manage a perfect score on everything else.. it\u2019s gonna lower my average for that section to a B. Furthermore, the only other grades are exam grades lol.\n\nI seriously am tired of this life I mean I work all day in the midst of this pandemic and I can\u2019t even catch a fucking break! If I even email her about this, I\u2019ll probably get some lame ass statement about how it\u2019s my fault (which is true so it\u2019s on me) and honestly I don\u2019t need to look like an even bigger idiot.\n\nRight now my grade is at an F lmfao.. nice way to get screwed early on",

I totally forgot and turned it in late and emailed him about my situation. He said that he still needed to take points off. But at the beginning of class in his intro video, he said that he'll be lenient and understanding. \n\nJust three more weeks of this bs.",

I miss all of my zoom lectures because of it, so I have to complete assignments using the Guess \u2018n\u2019 Check method, then on top of that I am too tired to even do the assignments after work. Yesterday I got home at 10:30pm and had to complete two assignments before 11:59pm. Ugh",

Who knows how well I\u2019ll do with the exams... in her class they\u2019re all short answer essays. And that\u2019s all subjective too. I just hope she takes my email seriously idk what else to do. Cause even if I get a perfect score.. with the quizzes, like I said it\u2019ll lower me probably by a letter grade even if SOMEHOW I did well on exams.\n\nFurthermore I\u2019ve seen other professors not help much at my school when it came to students who are suffering mental health wise due to all this but I took a chance and emailed her. Idk it seems ridiculous to get this worked up over 5 points but considering how we may not have any grades other than big projects and exams... I feel like I\u2019m entitled to freak out",

              "text": "You are entitled to freak out. This all sounds totally messed up. At the moment our professors aren't allowed to give us work since all big universities in my country are public (even though you pay tons) says we can't have class until every student has internet access and a laptop. South Africa is pretty poor. But even so they go under the radar and send out assignments with no warning on whatsapp and grade us \"unofficially\". I feel like I'm going to fail at this rate because our online classes have terrible signal and so many people can't even access them.\n\nThis is all just such a screw up. Maybe we both just need to wait for emails back from professors.\n\nGood luck. Professors are giving more work since they think we have more time. It's fucked.\n\nEdit: I took a leave of absence last year for physical and mental health. I did really well before that but the way they treat me this year is horrible. They pretend like I'm not even a part of my class. And these are professors in speech therapy - they're supposed to be kind and understanding. I'm so tired. If you ever need to vent I'm here.",

Luckily i am glad it was super busy but one professor keeps assigning things almost every day so naturally I focused on getting that done. I literally do my best to work ahead and just because of all this piled on shit AND goddam  job which I have to work I forgot.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re in a similar situation man like honestly I just I wanna say something as someone suggested since the only other grades in my class is a project and exams but who know what I\u2019ll be told.\n\nI hope things get better for you man.

Honestly, if it were me, I would definitely shoot the teacher an email & just be honest about how you\u2019re an essential worker & have been working everyday & made an innocent mistake of forgetting to do the quiz. The pandemic is stressful on students & it\u2019s hard to stay on track at home. Some teachers give exceptions especially under special circumstances like were in now!!!",

It\u2019s week 3 for me and the second week of having the quiz so forgetting makes sense since it\u2019s early on but I just expect the whole\u201dI\u2019d have to do the same thing for everyone else since it wouldn\u2019t be fair\u201d statement as well.... ugh it\u2019s like I either gotta face possible invalidation and embarrassment or just deal with a 0\n\nEDIT: looked at the late policy as well and it looks like it would have to be an emergency excuse if I missed something so she\u2019s bound to cite that as well but thank you for the reply. I honestly just came on here to complain since it seemed like a dead end lol",
