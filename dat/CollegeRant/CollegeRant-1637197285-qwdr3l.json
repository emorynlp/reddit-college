  "title:": "My professor does not give A\u2019s because \u201cin the working world, if you do what you\u2019re asked to do and you do well, it\u2019s still not enough\u201d",
  "text": "I am an honors student in the molecular neuroscience program at my school. I am a junior, and one of the requirements is to take a 100 level, 1 credit, class about analyzing research articles. \n\nFor the first six weeks of class, my professor lectured us and explained what belonged in each section of the journal article, and had us list the pros and cons.\n\nWell, the first assignment was hard and I got an 86. When she gave back the assignment feedback, I realized that she was expecting a much greater depth analysis than what she showed in class. I took this into consideration when I did my first discussion post. I did everything she asked for, and tried to go beyond, and I only received an 82. I want to earn an A so I decided to go to her office hours to see how I can improve for the next assignments. \n\nWhen I went to her office hours, she explained that my work was very good, and that I did everything she asked for and I did well. Then she said that I did not get an A because I did not go beyond the level of this course. She only said one example of how I could improve. Only one. I was trying illustrate that I am working very hard in class, and willing to put in work by saying I spent hours upon hours on the assignment. She basically told me in that in the working world, even if you do what it\u2019s asked and you do it well, it\u2019s not good enough. And I quote \u201cif you do what is asked, you\u2019re already behind.\u201d \n\nA few hours after her office hours, I had her class and she told the whole class that, and I quote, \u201cit will not be beneficial to you to give you a pat on the back and give out gold stars\u201d and that we \u201cknew that it was going to be hard when we signed up for neuroscience.\u201d \n\nI am just really frustrated because the only way to get an A in her class is to go beyond undergraduate level of analysis, and when I asked her how I could improve, she did not really give me an answer. She also dismissed my feelings by saying that \u201cyou should know it\u2019s hard.\u201d I never asked her to change my grade, and I didn\u2019t expect her to change her grading policy. I was only looking for ways to improve and she\u2019s basically just telling me to work harder even though I literally don\u2019t have enough experience to meet her expectations.",
