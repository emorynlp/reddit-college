It seems like you\u2019re not into the party scene (if I\u2019m reading that correctly), so maybe figure out what your idea of fun is. Maybe it\u2019s going on a hike with the outdoor club at your school (if you have one) or maybe you\u2019d prefer to just hang out with friends. Either way, maybe joining some clubs will help. I\u2019m not sure though, I\u2019m still trying to figure out things, too.",

Just try to be fun to be around and people will want your company. Bonus if you live on campus. \n\nYou can simply compliment someone or say something dumb like \"ayyyy party.\" Just be yourself with a little extra spice haha",
