  "text": "\nI'm failing 2 classes, a college algebra course and a freshmen 101 course. I'm going for an AGS in engineering. Just started working again aswell. \n\nI have 2 C's, 1 B, and 1 A-. Currently taking 14 credits at the moment.\n\nThe fact that one class I goto is in the morning, no attendance points, and just reads off PowerPoints that let's me be able to get a B no issue is just... Astounding. I don't understand why I'm paying for this if it's just stuff I can just be out and still manage to pass? I know this isn't healthy, and I need to make the effort to go, but I'm not sure why I can't force myself. \n\nCollege algebra I'm failing.. Badly, I have a 35%. The teacher is defiently not the issue, as she explains extemely well what we go over, i write down notes, and I talk to myself on how the formulas work exaclty for a better understanding. Homework I defiently need to try more on. This is the lowest grade I've ever gotten in my entire life. I have no idea how to improve for this\n\nCollege 101, I keep on forgetting to submit assignments I complete. I really don't know why I do this, I set reminders in my calender, but then I get distracted by one thing. Next thing I know I'm typing a reddit post at 1am knowing I need to wake up for that morning class,. \n\nMy engineering projects class, and a class in solidworks I don't really have any issue in, despite the projects being a C. It was from one assignment, and I'm finally finishing a project due on Thursday that I am really glad is almost over.\n\nI never really get out of my dorm, except for driving to work or getting stuff I need. I don't know anyone really, or this town at all. It still hasn't kicked in I drove 2k miles to college. And the idea of a 22k a year payment is stuck over my head from what my dad shouted at me before leaving. Maybe he was right with me not being ready?\n\nWhat can I do honeslty, I dont want to repeat with how I handled things in highschool. I don't want to just, feel like it's optional to try, or participate,if thay makes sense. .",

      "text": "If you can afford to quit your job. If you\u2019re in college your main focus should be your studies and your parents should agree with that notion. That will probably open up more time for you to complete assignments, find tutoring if you need it and maybe visit the professors in their office. I\u2019m not saying you messed up by having a job I commend you for trying to balance it all, but in the hierarchy of importance here having a job isn\u2019t exactly on top",
