My procrastination levels are a gamble IMO; on the low end, I would be getting shit done for one class (zipped through psychology textbook quizzes and only worried about the tests after that) or I would be pulling ideas out of my butt to post journal entries/discussion posts I\u2019ve been putting off for a week or 1.5 weeks lmao. Well that and I would often clean my room or bathroom to put it off thinking, \u201coh I have plenty of time to turn this in! But first, gotta clean my work space. Maybe even my whole room actually.\u201d",

But if youre in the same poopypants depressed whiny attitude you were in all week when you shouldve been working on x that night, you will get nothing done. If you couldn't get it done during the week, why would you in 8 hours? You need to fucking turn on. Bring energy and enthusiasm. Be focused, attentive, do the opposite of what your brain wants you to do. If you're feeling uncomfortable/over your head, good.",
