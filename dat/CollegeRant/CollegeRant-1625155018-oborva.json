  "text": "MyLab Math Homework and class material were totally different concepts. We never had homework problems from the book either. A power outage made it difficult to complete the assignments. So, I sat outside a McDonald's parking lot to use the WiFi and complete the assignments. Power came back on night before the final, so I stayed up completing the last few assignments I had. \n\nProfessor didn't bother to put MyLab Math into gradebook, even though they said it would be factored into our final grade.",

It's unfair to both the students that paid for the ebook and the students that worked their asses off to complete the required assignments in the face of a power outage",

In the future if you don\u2019t want to buy the book you can go on the website and purchase only the key for a less money. That way you don\u2019t have to buy the book. Sometimes libraries will also have the book.",

My university requires that you file with the appeal committee within 10 days of the end of the semester. If you go to your university's website they might have instructions on how to do it.\n\nAt mine, the committee reviews what happened. They ask the student, ask the prof, and look at the syllabus and make a decision. They can adjust your grade, but from what you've said the prof dropped the points for it, so you actually aren't out of a grade, you've just been screwed out of your time and effort because you did the work and it didn't get included. So a grade appeal might not get what you want.",
