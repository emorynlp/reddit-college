  "title:": "Lack of scholarships for 4.0 Honor College student",
  "text": "I am going into my Junior year of college and I\u2019m starting to get upset about the lack of scholarships offered for academics. I have retained a GPA of 4.0 for 5 consecutive semesters and have gotten little to no scholarship opportunities (and not for lack of searching). I usually have to find scholarships from outside sources such as UniGo, and they are usually very niche and require a sob story of an essay. I very rarely see my university offer scholarships for academics, especially to undergraduates.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a hard upbringing besides being raised by a single mother, but I feel like universities don\u2019t need to know about that part of my history. I feel as though college has become like Americas Got Talent: whoever has the best sob story gets the most money!\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to not be recognized for my hard work. I\u2019ve been on my schools Presidents List for 5 semesters and guess what I have to show for it. A. Fucking. Sticker. \nNo scholarships, no opportunities, nothing. Just a sticker and a pat on the back.\nI\u2019m also in the Honor College at my university, which I busted my ass to get in to, and got nothing in return but more work. \n\nI\u2019ve applied for scholarships specifically through my University and department (Liberal Arts and Social Sciences) and my degree, but have gotten nothing. I absolutely despise that I have to write a fucking dissertation on why the donors should give me money. I feel like my academics should speak for themselves to some extent. I have spent hours on several different scholarships sites (that I don\u2019t have to pay for, which it in itself is another infuriating point) hunting for scholarships I qualify for and usually come up with 2 at most. I\u2019m not first generation, I\u2019m not military, I\u2019m not below the poverty line. It\u2019s honestly making me less motivated to try and get a 4.0 and good grades in general because there\u2019s no incentive. There needs to be more scholarships available that are based on academics and not your history. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve been a 4.0 student for several semesters and have seen little to no scholarship opportunities that I qualify for and it\u2019s making me feel unmotivated to have good grades.",

      "text": "Your post comes across as very entitled.  I don't think that's how you view it, I'm just telling you how it comes across.  Using the phrase 'sob story' is condescending to those who have been through trauma as kids.  Those unfortunate souls would trade places with you in a heart beat.  \n\nAs for no scholarships, well....welcome to adulting.   It's a hyper-competitive environment.  I started college at 15 back in 1989.  It was HARD to win the scholarships.  My age helped separate me, but once I received the scholarship, I had to work hard to prove my worth.  It went beyond a 4.0.  It was being involved on campus, involved in university government, etc.  My senior year I did not apply for any scholarship because I didn't want to do the extra-curricular work. It's that hard.  I also wanted to focus on my career.  \n\nThere are no handouts.  You have to earn it.  Since not all GPA's are created equal, it comes down to extra-curricular activities.\n\nI assist some of my clients with hiring new college grads (in the finance sector).  That last round we did, we did not consider anyone with a GPA under 3.7.  You also had to have at least two extra-curricular activities in addition to the 3.7+ GPA.  Assuming you have those activities, your hard work will pay off.",

You have good grades, but if you have no connections with people, or are arrogant or cocky towards people, they are not going to want to give you scholarships. I have a lower GPA than you (not much, it\u2019s a 3.9), but I have gotten 3 scholarships in 4 semesters. But the thing about that is that I make connections with my professors, and I care about those around me. I had to write 0 \u201csob stories\u201d in order to get my scholarships, even though there are things I could write about. One of my scholarships I was nominated for by a professor I made a connection with! It sounds like you are doing the bare minimum but think that you can get anything you want if you apply for it. Grades only get you so far. What\u2019s going to happen if you apply to grad school? Are you going to talk in your personal statement about all the good grades you got? Or are you going to try and make the connections now to be able to get good LOR, a personal statement about something meaningful you did in your academic career, and have something to actually show for it? Universities see 4.0, honors students all the time. My schools honors college has a mug they mass print for if you get a 4.0 in a semester. What they don\u2019t see is genuinely exceptional students who blow them out of the water. Sorry to burst your bubble, but you are not an \u201cexceptional\u201d student because you have a 4.0.\n\nEdit: that is not to say that you are not a hard worker. It seems like you have worked very hard. But like I said, grades are not everything.",

I have had professors (especially ones teaching online classes, as they all have been for the past year and a half) just post the work for the semester and go MIA for the entire semester until finals. I would email my professors and TA\u2019s all the time with questions and have honestly connected with one professor (French, small class) who I got an LOR from.

      "text": "> I very rarely see my university offer scholarships for academics, especially to undergraduates.\n\nThat's because you're expected to do well. Especially in undergrad work. You're basically saying you want an award for showing up and doing what you're supposed to. That's not how college works.\n\nBy the time you're talking about scholarships for existing college students, people are looking to put their money where their own priorities lie: helping ease inequalities or supporting particular groups. What you call \"sob stories\" are in fact people telling others about their lives to drum up interest. Straight A's in undergrad is not interesting or rare. This attitude of \"I'm doing well academically, give me money\" is a high school attitude, not college.",

          "text": "I mean, I really don't think OP is necessarily wrong. I'm a boring middle class dude who did okay in CC but I got a transfer scholarship with a 3.5 GPA at the time through a frighteningly generic essay full of cliches I did for my application that paid for 2/3rds of my university tuition. While I'm beyond thankful to have had that literally life changing opportunity, there were many students who deserved that more than I for multiple reasons I consider objective in nature. Obviously, in addition to scholarships addressing inequality, a lot of scholarships are geared to those with \"something to give\" to the university, but I think high performing students give indirectly back to the school for a large variety of reasons in a longer term outlook; namely network development, prestige building, and graduate program recruitment with all that follows. I hate online discourse because almost no amount of text provides adequate context/nuance, but I think good organizations should engage with these students beyond pats on the back to foster relationships that justify the granting of a scholarship; which based upon the provided text, may not be the case here. I don't think the OP has a high school attitude for knowing their worth, they just need to adjust how they play the game, because quite frankly, that is what most of scholarship hunting is.",

I truly cannot wait to see you dismantle it so people who work hard and do well are successful\ud83e\udde1",
