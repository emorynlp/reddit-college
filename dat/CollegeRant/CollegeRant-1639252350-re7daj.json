  "text": "I am a slower learner and I hate hard-memorising stuff, but this is quite an ineffective to study. People getting good grade actually don't understand the principle behind either\n\nSo before getting into University I have already studied ahead the basic calculus material, I guess in the US u call Cal I, and I did quite good. And the more advanced course later on, I fail to understand what is taught. Say I had to take a course about optimisation encompassing simplex method Lagrangeian and KTT condition. The symbol are like alien language to me and I don't think I can cramp in all this shit in 3 months time. I fell so useless and I did horribly and I keep thinking I can't graduate. And just wanna find a place where I can learn slowly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have lost confidence already and I wanna leave.",
