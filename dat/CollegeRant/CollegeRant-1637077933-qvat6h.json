  "text": "This is more of a vent and to see if anyone feels similarly. I'm a UK student, for context.\n\nI didn't really wanna post about this initially, because my days go up and down. But now the \"ups\" are that I'm able to just about keep up with work, and the \"downs\" are incredibly awful.\n\nIn sixth form I was absolutely interested in everything I did. I excelled at mathematics and I was pretty good at computer science. I'm now a second year computer science student, and after the pandemic and the stress with assignments, I think I've fallen into a mode of being so harsh on myself that I no longer feel happiness anywhere. And that just sucks. I've started seeing a counselor, but it is taking a while for me to make any progress and I'm considering switching to a different counsellor. I've tried to get a diagnosis for depression, but the first appointment I had, the internet cut out and they hadn't bothered to contact me until a month after. The second appointment I had (before the time they contacted me), I missed because I couldn't get up in the morning. I haven't bothered since, though they are doing an appointment with me on Friday, so at least I've been sort of picked up by the system.\n\nI just don't really know what to do right now. I had a dream of getting a first and so many life goals and interest, and was so ready to put the work in before the pandemic hit. Now I am absolutely miserable. I can get by on the work but I am incapable of feeling happy about my achievements. Believe me I'm trying, but I get nothing out of it. I started regular exercise about 6-7 weeks ago; while this specifically hasn't had a negative effect, I still on the whole feel worse than when I started.\n\nAnyone else in a similar boat? Kinda just don't know what to do anymore. I need to finish this degree, but every day more or less is just torture now.",
