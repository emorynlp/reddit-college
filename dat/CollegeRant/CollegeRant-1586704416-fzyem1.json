  "text": "I kid you not but I have a headache everyday. I am so tired of staring at a screen all day. My eyes hurt so much. My head hurts so much. This transition to online classes is only hindering my ability to learn and retain information.\nProfessors really ask us how we're doing and how we're coping in this stressful situation and then have the audacity to send us 3 assignments back to back with a 2 day deadline. Bitch you are the reason I'm stressed out!",

Meanwhile I\u2019m going to tutoring and pulling 12-14 hour days mainly for his class. I\u2019m straight missing other assignments to try and pass something that I barely need to do anyways.",

I had a professor make a post telling us to listen to Happy by Pharrell followed by: an one page essay, 2 chapters to read in our textbook and q 3 paragraph response, and watch a 25 minute TED talk with another 1 page response. Posted this morning and due at 10pm on a holiday! But yeah just listen to Happy it's all good !!",

Obviously depending on the assignments though - and I can understand how it would be a stressful schedule if you\u2019re not used to it.\n\nAre you able to print anything out to help you have less screen time?",
