      "text": "Yea. What I did was check the extra credit assignments first. Most of the times profs accidentally make the extra credit x/10. If it says x/10 or another number, that means the extra credit is being registered in the system as if it was a mandatory assignment to your grade. Talk to your prof to remove the /10 or out of whatever number and only add the number of points that are extra. When I contacted my prof about this, she changed it for me and my grade increased. I hope I am making sense.",

My problem is actually that Canvas does reflect that my grade is 98.89%, but my instructor submitted my grade as 3.8 for my transcript. \nAt my school a 90% is a 3.5, a 92% is a 3.7, 94% is a 3.9, etc. To get a 4.0 you need to have gotten at least a 95% in the class, which I did. :(",

I have jumped to the conclusion that they think I deserve a 3.8 and I do not deserve a 4.0, and me asking them about it is going to be interpreted as causing trouble. (I have a lot of anxiety in general. I hope they are understanding and work with me to resolve this.)",

But another part of me worries it is true and I will burn bridges (I want to work for the company he works for) and that maybe it would then be a better idea to just take the 3.8. But I want to stand up for myself and what Is fair.",
