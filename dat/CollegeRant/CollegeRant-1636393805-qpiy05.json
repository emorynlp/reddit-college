  "text": "Hello everyone, I'm extremely depressed and sad and I need to ask for advice.\n\nSo I was a sophomore international student in undergrad. For this semester, I have a lab in o chem and due to some issue, I only have one left so I have to take it in other to be able to study other classes in the next semester. \n\nI never had any experience in the lab due to both my general biol lab and general chem lab being online and I think my professor knows about this. I prepare for my class, do homework, practice quiz and I always arrive on time. But I feel that my professor is kind of annoying when I ask questions related to the experiment. Then last week where the climate start, we did a synthesis, I ask the professor and he answer almost like screaming \" You've gotta learn and do it by yourself\". Then he walks away. I tried to change, I tried to learn but little of this build-up makes me so sad and I don't know what to do. There are times when said straight to my face that \"you are fine with the book but you are bad at practice\". I have to try to understand and hold it for 3 months. Even when I email him and said that he did not open the link on turn it in to let me turn in my discussion, he ignore me. but on the class day, other students said it and he do it immediately. \n\nCan you please tell me what to do or give me any advice about this? I'm I wrong in this?",

There are places for both, neither is inherently useless. The thing about Orgo Lab is there's a lot to do, but its all stepwise. Focus on the instructions one step at a time and you'll get through it. If working with glassware and apparatuses is difficult, there's plenty of videos on YouTube of people running through them and probably doing the same experiments you are in lab.",

      "text": "Does your prof know that you\u2019ve never been in an actual lab before because you told them or are you just assuming that they know? There\u2019s a pretty big difference there. \n\nIt also sounds like you\u2019re doing everything right prep wise for the class, but your prof for whatever just doesn\u2019t like you. Not too much you can do about that other than find ways around it. Talk with classmates about how to do things and get advice from them",

When you\u2019re in lab consider asking your classmates for help first then elevate it to your prof if you still need help. Other than that you just have to get through this class then you don\u2019t have to interact with this prof again",
