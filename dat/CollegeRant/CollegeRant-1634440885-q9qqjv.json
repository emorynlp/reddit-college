  "text": "I wish I had college friends I hang out with (almost) everyday. I hung out with this guy and his friends, and I was envious of how they all get along and connect like a real friend group. I wish I had a friend group like them. College hasn\u2019t been the best time. I wish it could at last be better when it comes to making and keeping friends. It would just be nice to hang out with people instead of being by myself most of the time.\n\nTL;DR - I\u2019m feeling envious of my friend\u2019s friend group and I wish I had that.",

You have to invite yourself to things. People aren't good at inviting people to join because it's just not something our generation picked up on. \"is it cool if I join ya?\" are golden words. just use that on anything.",
