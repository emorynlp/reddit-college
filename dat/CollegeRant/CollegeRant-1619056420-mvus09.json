It\u2019s like they don\u2019t see how they individually take part in impacting the economic divide we see today. The focus should be on teaching, growing, correcting errors, & students gaining expertise from them for future roles. Instead they chose to treat students as a monolith of lazy, no-good, cheaters.

Guess how you set up a meeting time? That\u2019s right, email. I had questions about the final exam and assignment. It\u2019s been a week and I still haven\u2019t received a response. \n\nIn another class this semester, the professor posted PowerPoint slides with zero lectures. The class material they provided were: YouTube videos from other content creators not affiliated with the school in any way, said PowerPoint with no explanation accompanying the slides, zero lectures, zero meeting times to have questions answered, and a smattering of handouts posted online. \n\nHow. How is this acceptable?",

Spent basically 3 hours in his office a week just to try and understand the lecture and he got joy out of watching you struggle basically... He would talk down to you and make you feel stupid. He would just constantly repeating himself and hope you got it by the 10th time and only after you stared at him for a good minute in silence  he would try a different way. Me and another student tagged team his work and cried many of times. I had mental breakdowns every week because of him. Hated going to his class so much but stuck through it.

I've found that professors that already ran online classes before the pandemic have better quality courses because of experience I guess? In terms of making things too easy, just make the questions in your own words so you can't google the answer and ask a few critical thinking questions. Having solid responses to questions helps a student retain the info better than just memorizing vocab. I can definitely see it being hard to find the balance between making schoolwork a challenge without making it too challenging. The fact that you're trying to find it is already more than the effort that half these professors have been putting in",

I\u2019m a grad student who has been through 6 years of undergrad and now 2 years into grad school, with one year of being a TA.\n\nI agree with you, and I\u2019d like to give my perspective. \n\nI don\u2019t think homework should be an option in our higher level learning; studying should be. Homework just to be homework is bullshit. We should be in a class to learn, requirement, elective, or core class, it doesn\u2019t matter. Yes we need to be evaluated and I think purposeful exams do just that. But they have to be purposeful exams and/or assignments depending on the field. Not busy work, not half-assed exam multiple choice questions, but real exams that test your knowledge, and more importantly, critical thinking skills in the field over the course of the class. In grad school, that starts to appear, but it\u2019s still not enough. \n\nI\u2019ve been asked as a TA to email students over and over again who haven\u2019t been up to par in terms of grading and I finally refused. We are all adults, we should all be expected to learn as adults, and I\u2019m sick and tired of the babysitting from all sides. This includes the busy homework, and the countless emails and reminders. I don\u2019t want to receive them and I don\u2019t want to have to send them out. The point of higher education should be to learn, no matter what, and I feel that it\u2019s been lost under tenure, societal pressure, and capitalism. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, emailing a professor or TA 3 days before an exam and not receiving an answer on time is unacceptable, I would never do that to one of my students. However, this highlights the main issue: the people in charge in this scenario don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care about you, your learning, or the people that work for them (TAs). They are only here for a job, and that\u2019s not fair to everyone involved. \n\nThat being said, most professors, and TAs for that matter, have to develop a way to filter out the bullshit they receive. When you care as an educator, you will be taken advantage of by students, and you have to learn how to navigate though that. It\u2019s a very hard thing to balance. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to give my thoughts on this subject because it\u2019s a wild experience being in the middle of both sides right now.",

Students don't learn shit if they don't practice the subject matter, and let's face it the only way to get any undergrads to actually practice is to provide an incentive in the form of marks. By giving them homework to do, it greatly decreases the likelihood that they're crash and burn when exams roll around.",

I\u2019ve never had one professor that tries to help or do what\u2019s best for the students. Guess you\u2019re just lucky. Then stop telling people that their experiences are invalid and go be thankful that you had great professors or something.",
