  "title:": "Anyone hate online examination?",
  "text": "Like literally every time during an exam, there are always a few other classmates bombard my phone messaging me \"How to do this or that?\" Like i DONT even know who are they, i mean i know their name, that's it. Whats funny is that they even message me when SOME of the exam doesnt require facecam, which means they can cheat, THEN go look at the book and stop messaging me, fuckers.\n\nTo prevent conflict, usually i just ignore them until the last minutes and reply \"i dont know how to do it too\". And some of them literally reply me \"Oh really?! Did you pass up blank paper? Take a picture for me to see\" LIKE SERIOUSLY? OMG\n\nIn some rare cases, when exam requires facecam, they went to the toilet and fucking CALL ME. My phone is in silence mode but god damn that vibration is irritating as fuck. Are they expecting me to go to the toilet and pick up the phone? NEVER, fucking dumbass\n\nTLDR: i hate when someone disturbing me, like messaging or calling me during exams",

There is one time where a question is missing something, i was confused and skipped it first, then later got the message to alter the question a bit.\nBut yea...its hard to deal with it, hope we can go back to school soon",
