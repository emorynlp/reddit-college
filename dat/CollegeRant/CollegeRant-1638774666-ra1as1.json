  "title:": "Semester 2 Schedule Pain",
  "text": "I was picking classes for semester 2 and it sucks basically all of my classes are \u201conline anytime\u201d and theres no choice for zoom or in person. Its stupid I\u2019m paying money for classes I can\u2019t even have a zoom or in person. Yes it\u2019s community college so its cheap but still ridiculous. Worst part is I need a set schedule or everything goes down hill so im basically screwed. I just want to get fit faster and get thrown into the military I\u2019m already sick of college and this is my first year. End of rant thank you for reading!",
