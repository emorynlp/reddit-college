Have you talked to your advisor? I failed a Bio class twice and my advisor was like why do you keep taking this class? Take a different one. Not sure if that was helpful in anyway. Also I should mention that the only way that class continues to haunt me is in $$$ wasted.",

There\u2019s two Sides . Idk what year you are in but you can retake the class and it replaces the grade and see if you can take it at a different school or community college. Or since it\u2019s your second time , I suggest talk to your advisor and see if you can possibly waive that class for you and see if there another way",
