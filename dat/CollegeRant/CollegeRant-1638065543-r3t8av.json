You're in school for a reason.\n\nSecond, the reason you're in school is to learn. Stop thinking it's a golden ticket because it's not. It's what you do with the knowledge you learned that will get you those \"big bucks.\"\n\nThird, you need to take the time to do these things yourself. Talk to your professor, learn about the industry you want to go into, start making plans. \n\nFourth, no one owes you shit. \n\nFifth, it sounds like you need to eat some humble pie. You're not going to get anywhere in any industry with an attitude that says, \"everyone is wrong but me.\"",

Sometimes you watch movies or shitty videos, like... wtf, seriously? When the exam comes, I need to memorize a lot of random shit. You don't even analyze nor think; you just literally memorize.\n\nMeanwhile, in my computer science class we read the mathematical and computational theory of an algorithm or a data structure, etc. Then we analyze how it works, and eventually we try to translate those ideas to code. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. You use APIs... Man, I love my degree because it makes me think \u2013 it has complex math, it has code and such things could be applied literally anywhere. I got to the point in which I just enjoy and have a need to learn more concepts. I sure want to materialize my effort, but it'd be a poor mentality to just care about money.\n\nTry to find something you actually enjoy, or change the way you've been doing things if you don't have another option \u2013 take more notes, take less classes if required so can organize your work schedule. Do things different, I'm sure it's possible.\n\nFinally, I don't think is \"miserable.\"",
