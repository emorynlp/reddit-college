  "title:": "Would it be insane to get married just to get college aid?? I\u2019m seriously considering it.",
  "text": "My parents make way to much money for me to get aid. My sibling is also is college and they already co-signed loans for him. If I did get married I\u2019m not going to make my partner pay any debt or do anything that would harm them physically,financially, or otherwise. I do understand it\u2019s a legal marriage and we would have to be divorced if we wanted to marry other people at some point. (Hopefully after four years have passed. Haha) \nThe person I\u2019d be getting married to is someone I\u2019ve known for years. We don\u2019t live in the same state but I have the opportunity to go to his state to do the marriage paperwork or whatever needs to be done. Unfortunately I already did my fasfa. \nI should be able to get threw my first year just barely. Haha \n\nSo is this crazy to do? I\u2019m just desperate and I want to be a teacher so I need to go to college.",
