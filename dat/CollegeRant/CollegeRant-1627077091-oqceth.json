  "text": "Don\u2019t be dumb like me and save and invest as much as you can during college so that you can get an early start on your wealth.. it won\u2019t work and you will have regrets..\n\nI\u2019m now questioning what\u2019s the point of me working 3 jobs in order to comfortably pay my student bill because now my student bill is going to become an even more uncomfortable cost\u2026\n\nEdit: I should mention that this advice/rant really only applies if you get need-based aid for college. If you already don\u2019t qualify for need-based aid (such as the Pell Grant) then your savings and assets shouldn\u2019t change anything.",

      "text": "THIS! I got denied financial aid despite having a single, unemployed parent who didn\u2019t make much $ to begin with. My school saw how much $ I make at my job so they didn\u2019t give me financial aid, however they failed to consider the fact that most of my\nmoney goes towards bills and helping my family. Or that the little house I live in is practically falling apart because my parent never had the money to repair it. It\u2019s completely bullshit because I know people who are set up by their parents and have no financial worries, yet are cashing in $5,000 checks each semester",

          "text": "Yeah I\u2019m in a similar boat. I live with my single mom who works a low-wage job and we live in a condo that\u2019s honestly falling apart. I also had to pay a few grand for my two sick cats who passed late 2019/early 2020 (they were old and needed lots of medicine and vet visits). I also adopted two kittens shortly after (idk i need my pets..). But that\u2019s a cost FAFSA doesn\u2019t even consider. I also planned to move out in early 2022 but I don\u2019t think thats going to possible anymore because I gotta either use my money or hide it somewhere in a way that\u2019s not suspicious- which likely means I won\u2019t have it available in time for apartment applications. \n\nI honestly wish I knew sooner about the 20%. It seems unreasonably high and makes it nearly impossible for a student to plan their money in a financially sound way. If I kept my same financial aid from my freshmen year I\u2019d be in a pretty stable financial situation even with my pets and moving out.",
