  "text": "I took the online version of general chemistry and holy shit. That class almost broke me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent so much of my time into that class. Studying, going to 2 different tutors, reading the slide shows, which side rant, was fucking bull shit. My professor told us it's best to listen/watch to his video lecture while reading the slides but the videos had poor audio, he barely followed the slides, he did problems on what I think was on Microsoft paint and you could barely read what he wrong. I brought this up with him and he told me, \"Just reading the slides is good enough.\" I'm paying this guy to send my power points for me to figure out on my own.\n\nFor homework, we had to use some program called ALEKs, which will walk you through step by step on how to do the problem then tell you you did it wrong. It basically breaks up the unit into different topics and you have to get a certain amount of questions right before you can move on. What really pissed me off though is that those ALEKs topics were the only way to receive extra credit in that class. If you want FIVE extra points on your next exam, you need to spend at least 30 mins on ALEKs EVERY DAY, get at least one topic done EVERY DAY, and finish all the topics by the due date. And what happens if you miss even one of those days? FUCK YOU, YOU DON'T GET THAT F I V E EXTRA POINTS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent so much god damn time in that class studying and practicing only to get shitty grades on tests and finals was even worse. It was an online proctored exam at 7 in the fucking morning, so not only was I anxious and stressed for this test that would determine my final grade but I was also exhausted because I had just spent the last few nights staying up to study for this bullshit exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I finished that class with a C and I guess I should be happy with it. But with all of the time and effort and mental breakdown I faced in that class, I deserved more than a C. but now it's over but the trauma will never be gone. Best of luck to you chemistry majors out there, I don't know how you do it",
