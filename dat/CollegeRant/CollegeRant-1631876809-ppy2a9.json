  "text": "(UK based for reference)\n\nHonestly so furious! Currently studying Higher Childcare and it's my final year. We have to do a lot of groupwork and so far, I've always been the top of the class due to me overstudying. (I'm very passionate about studying and learning this course as it's my dream job) \n\nWe were told last week to do research on a specific topic and then split into groups who also studied the same topic. Now, we're all doing online learning still, so it's face to face.\n\nI was put in a group of people who refer to their lecturers as \"big Sandra\" rather than their actual name which is just disrespectful. They're also the same people who complain about failing stuff when they haven't even handed in anything.\n\nI did my research obviously. My laptop isn't the best so a different girl had to write and share her screens. Throughout the whole group work, I contributed my notes that were relevant to the work and the girl writing the notes? \n\nShe ignored every single one of my notes!\n\nWe're studying childcare so every note we had had to be about children or children and their parents! \n\nThey wrote crap about poor people living in poverty and when I tried to guide them by saying \"Oh, well, what if we mentioned a couple things about children too?\"\n\nAnd they ignored me. I thought my mic was muted so I asked them if they could hear me and they said yeah. \n\nThis continued for half an hour before I snapped and asked them why they weren't adding my notes despite me putting it in the chat box over and over again. Then the girl told me to keep my weave on and ugh, I couldn't be bothered.\n\nThey all seem like they're in their own 'clique' because they all just graduated high school frankly, I couldn't be bothered with them.\n\nThey sent in crappy notes. The lecturer yelled at ME to which I explained my notes consisted of child related ones. She asked me why I didn't contribute and I explained the situation. She told me I should stop being childish. \n\nScrew her and screw them.",
