  "text": "I convinced college is a scam... why does a student need to jump through hoops just to learn something that is a \"requirement\" just to get to major specific classes?!?!\n\nI am currently majoring in Accounting and Finance.  \nAccounting, its easy. Record transaction. Simple, plus and minus  \nFinance, easy. Buy low and sell high.\n\nWhy do we need more classes to justify our damn majors? Not only that, what is with professors with a hard on for written assignments?!?!\n\nI feel like I am wasting my life in school... I honestly have no choice... my parents expect me to attend college.... being raised in a time where college actually meant for something... and was WAY cheaper...\n\nAll I literally want to know is how to do my damn taxes.... I don't need any of these other classes....",

I feel like after my diploma I should be able to go straight into a master of forensic psychology. All up it's going to take me another 4-6 years on top of the 4 years I just completed and it's already making me feel discouraged. (My bachelor should've taken just 3 years but I went through a shit ton of set backs in my first year with death of a family member and my own major health issues then I also had a kid in my last year so had to keep going from full time to part time) and now I have to put off starting my diploma because I'm pregnant again and there's no way in hell I'm making the same mistake of studying with a newborn \ud83e\udd37 so I think college/uni isn't always a scam but there are definitely more steps then there should be in some instances.",
