  "text": "Ok idk how screwed I am. Also I made a mistake taking 18 credits.\n\nI have one essay thats like supposed to be like 5 pages due friday. So far I have read like 80 pages worth of research and highlighted some quotes to use. Finals exams are next week. I also have a quiz for chem this Thursday and final for it on Tuesday. I have a final for calc on Tuesday. I also have a final for physics on next Thursday.\n\nHow screwed am I? I haven't studied for like chem or physics.\n\nI already cancelled like therapy cause I have to focus on this shit. Should I cancel some other appointments this week?\n\nI feel so anxious. I just need a 3.75 to stay to get into a program. I don't know if my planning will go well.",

You\u2019re halfway there with the paper. Finish that up, knock out that draft without putting too much thought into it, just get it turned in. Then review for that quiz. Study for chem Friday and saturday, and calc Sunday and Monday. Then ace those exams!! After that spend Wednesday studying for your physics final. You can do it!!",
