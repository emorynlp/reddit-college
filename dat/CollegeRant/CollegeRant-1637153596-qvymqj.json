  "text": "I entered college for the second time, after laying off for a year due to choosing a degree I didn't like.\n\nI'm just about to finish my 1st semester in a month from now and, as it was the case last year, I still don't have any friends or acquaintances.\n\nI'm more introverted nowadays than in my highschool years, but I wouldn't say I'm an introvert at all. I have no problem in talking to strangers nor talking in classes nor asking for help or information.\n\nEven if that's the case, friends or acquaintances don't just appear with time, at least it doesn't seem to be that way, or that it will be anytime soon.\n\nI know Covid makes everyone worst by covering faces and smiles, or by inducing distance between people, closing places and stopping parties and gatherings, but this is not a Covid problem.\n\nDo I need to be a full blown extrovert to make friends these days?\n\nI don't know if this is a vent or an ask for advice, or just an expression of some sadness with myself and the situation.\n\nAll I know is that what they say to you about friends in college is not actually what it seems, it can be though, and if it lasts for months, you can start doubting yourself.",

              "text": "First, you got to realize that making friends is a numbers game. What I mean by \u201cnumbers game\u201d is that you have to talk to a lot of people; and most of them you will never talk to ever again, some of them will become your friends, and only a very few will become your close friends. \n\nSecond, you have to join clubs and talk to the members. I would recommend joining clubs with few members because the smaller the group, the more likely it is for everyone to know each other. \n\nSo you talked to a lot of people and joined clubs, yet you have no friends. The reasons can be: 1) you have a crappy personality 2) you just haven\u2019t met the right friends.",

It sucks cause I was a transfer student during covid and essentially went to a wierd small private school. If I'm being completely honest the real way I made friends post High-School was usually through part time jobs or when I'm gaming. I still have a few close friends from high school that I keep in contact with but as we get older things really do change. A part of life is realizing that sometimes we're going to be alone but we can still try to find happiness with ourselves during those periods. Nothing is forever.",

Usually conversation goes from class work to to stuff outside of school like work or something(through the course of the semester) that you can connect with people on. I would ask people to meet up in the library or cafe to study in the least for tests and stuff. You don\u2019t have to be besties immediately but regularly meeting up with someone will start and maintain a friendship. And just the general stuff about being active on campus and going to the events and clubs and meeting people in a place where there is already a common interest always helps",

It definitely helped the friend situation, but it really depends on the school + chapter you get into.",
