  "text": "\nHave you ever had a so bad that you simply cannot stand to hear their voice? So bad at teaching that by the time they finish the question 20 minutes after they stated it. you forgot what the original question was? Or that they speak so slow you can speed up the lectures to 1.5 times speed and it\u2019s still not at a regular pace? There writing is so bad that you ant possibly read it without listening to them talk at 2 words per minute???? \n\nI swear to god that she died 50 years ago and no one told her. Ive spent all weekend trying to learn off of her videos and made less than zero progress. I come out more confused then when I went in. Not to mention you need the volume to be at 100 with headphone in just to barely hear what she says. Absolutely the worst person in the world to be teaching anything to do with mathematics. She singlehandedly dropped everyone\u2019s GPA when she taught us calculus. No shit everyone\u2019s marks were 15-20% lower in her class then any other class we\u2019ve taken.\nThat\u2019s all for tonight but I\u2019m sure i\u2019ll have more to rant about before the end of the term.",
