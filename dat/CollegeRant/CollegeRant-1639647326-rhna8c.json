  "text": "One of the classes I registered for next semester\u2019s professor had initially no reviews. I took the chance. Well, I didn\u2019t have much choice as the other section was filled. Big mistake. I just checked and there are reviews available and they\u2019re not good at all. Pretty much 24/29 of her reviews rated her a 1. Any other class I can think of taking next semester has a filled waitlist or it conflicts with my other classes.",

      "text": "Same thing happened to me this semester, for stats. The prof had 1 decent review so I took a chance since the only other alternative was a very poorly rated professor. A few days before the semester started and suddenly there were a ton of negative reviews for him. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nI chose to stick with him and wowsers, the class ended up being a nightmare. Literally worst Prof I\u2019ve ever had\u2014he was rude, short-tempered, inconsistent, kept adding a ton of work on top of an already hefty syllabus, and legit made me fear speaking up in class because if you answered a question wrong or took too long answering he\u2019d make you feel like the stupidest person in the world. If you said you didn\u2019t understand something he\u2019d literally berate your for not paying attention because \u201che just explained it and it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to understand.\u201d\n\nThe semester just ended and I feel like I\u2019ve aged ten years. I had to kill myself for this class.\n\nGood luck. \ud83d\ude1e",

          "text": "Yeah. It also sucks if the class is required for your major/minor or a prerequisite for a required class. A way a professor handles a class can really affect a student\u2019s ability to learn the material. I remember I took a math class and I could barely grasp the material because of how the professor taught and dismissed the class\u2019s concerns. I barely passed and took the following math course and had a great professor and did a lot better in that class. \n\nI decided to drop the class and will taking it during the Spring/Summer semester. I was able to sign up for a different class, although there is slight time conflicts with the class ending 10 minutes before my next class begins. I have to take the second class as part of my Language requirement and it held only at one time slot. The professor is nice though and doesn\u2019t mind if students are a little late as long as they are not being too disruptive upon entering. I might be lucky though and be able to leave the other class a little early.",

          "text": "You\u2019re right. My concern comes from my understanding this professor treats her students as if they are in a PhD program and should already know the material, and is not good at expressing what she actually wants for her papers and all she grades are essays + discussion boards. \n\nAlso, during the winter time my mental health starts going to shit so it\u2019s already a struggle. I barely made it out of this semester without losing all of my motivation near the end of it. I worry that the combination of my mental health + a class like that would not be a good combination. I know sometime I am going to have to deal with a class with a shitty professor- especially since I only have about a year left after this and higher level courses have fewer sections. \n\nBut, I found a different course I can take next semester instead. :)",
