          "text": "100% agree with studying through the course to avoid burnout + cramming ! \ud83d\udca1 Which is why I suggest to start focused study now (a month before exams to avoid that!) Starting a month before allows for spaced learning + active recall practice. Another consideration is that some people need a refresher if they have not been studying consistently throughout the year. Also lots of other factors come in. Maybe they have a kid or someone to take care of + don\u2019t have the time to study all day everyday. Idk it\u2019s just a short session and a friendly reminder that finals season is approaching :) Good luck with your exams !! \ud83c\udf31\u2728\u270f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcd4",
