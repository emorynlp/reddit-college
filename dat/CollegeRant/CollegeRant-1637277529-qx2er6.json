  "title:": "I\u2019m having the hardest time dating in college",
  "text": "I (19F) understand what people will probably say about this, like focus on yourself and stuff like that but, I just have lost hope in dating. I broke up with my ex boyfriend a year ago, we were together two years. As of two month ago, I decided to start trying to date again. I took the time needed to heal and work on myself. But what\u2019s hard is I\u2019m still online mainly. My major also is mainly girls so, I haven\u2019t met any guys at all. Anyways, the first guy obviously only wanted me for sex, he did drugs and drank a lot, so I dropped him. The thing is I don\u2019t drink nor do I do any type of thing like vaping and smoking or drugs. It\u2019s been really hard to find people that don\u2019t do that either you know? Well the second guy I started hanging out with, man I like him a lot but every day I find out something new about him that I don\u2019t like at all. Here\u2019s what\u2019s hard, I have feelings for him but, today he called me controlling because I asked if he could try to not get super drunk at the tailgate tomorrow. I am hurt by those words. My question/rant is are there any college aged guys that are not constantly partying like this? I\u2019m just feeling hurt. Thank you.\n\nSide note: we don\u2019t go to the same college (he\u2019s at a university, I\u2019m at the community college) and he invited me to the game. I just don\u2019t know anyone there and would feel more comfortable if he was drinking a tiny bit less so I could still have someone I know.",

      "text": "There are plenty of college aged men who are not into drinking heavily or partying. Just be upfront about what you want when you go out on dates. Tell everyone that you \"aren't into partying and heavy drinking.\" You'll weed out the men who are more into that sort of thing.",

      "text": "Hey! I agree with Valky above. Usually college kids do like partying and smoking and stuff, but I\u2019m sure there are people out there who don\u2019t because I am one. It sounds like your English isn\u2019t perfect but I doubt there\u2019s any miscommunication between you and your bf. Better to talking straight to him, my loved one also drinks a lot (like 6 beers) every Friday because his job sucks, but other than that I do let him know I won\u2019t be happy if he\u2019s too drunk and yelling (I\u2019d be very angry actually, for someone who doesn\u2019t talk much or show emotions). \n\nAlso, you need to understand that your relationship right now might not last forever because the career would very likely to be in the way. So find one that you actually are comfortable with, avoiding being lonely by being with someone who you\u2019re unsure about isn\u2019t gonna help, because it\u2019s about enjoying, not coping. Hope you the best.",

      "text": "I am man. I feel like I grew out of that bit hitting junior year and only drink every so often now but there are plenty of guys who never did it. I had a friend who would never drink or party at all. Alternatively, I had girls who would hookup but not want a relationship when I did, make sure you\u2019re clear on what you want and keep that special arrangement when you believe it will be more than a hookup game.",

      "text": "I understand that as a man in college rn yeah most of us always drunk and high but just be straight up like it's OK to drink but don't be a drunk and if you don't want them smoking just ask. If these guys can't respect your request then screw em. Fr yeah it hard but from what I read it sounds like your not telling them not to drink or smoke but just not to overdo it and go crazy. That's perfectly fair not controlling",

      "text": "Find guys who prefer to spend their Friday nights at anime or gaming clubs. Usually those things involve watching anime, playing board games and people who tend to not prefer psychoactive substances as a way to decompress. I was in an anime and gaming group, we played board games. Everyone there was pretty damn cool. If you're worried about their level of social skills, just go to a club and see how they interact with each other. I met one kid who felt awkward around me, but because I was so charismatic he felt comfortable being around me within a day or two (he said it was because I was a girl, but later on he revealed he joined the club to make friends, so I guess being female just added a 10% extra to his anxiety, even though there was one other girl there). The rest of the club members were super comfortable around me, it's because my interest was also anime and gaming. Though I really appreciated their board games even though I was new to them and they were patient in explaining the rules. They were also patient with explaining the deck building games.\n\nHave you considered asking yourself why you want to date first of all? I'm not going to tell you to work on yourself. I notice that people date because they feel it's some experience they want in their life oppose to actually finding a compatible partner because of the romanticised idea which people have about \"youth\" and \"experiencing life to the fullest\" which leads to people thinking that \"dating is a need\". You don't have to explain yourself, I'm just suggesting something which might help you, because there are people who unfortunately see dating as just an experience, but not as a phase of a relationship to check compatibility and to bond. Many activities don't really require participating parties to be in a legitimate relationship with each other, such as consensual sex.",
