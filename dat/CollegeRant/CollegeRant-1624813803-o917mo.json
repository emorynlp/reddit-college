  "text": "I just feel so disappointed by myself, I feel like a failure. I didn't have motivation to study at all, I don't know what happened and why do I get so distracted whenever I try to study. \n\nAs much as some exams indeed were harder than we all expected, I still have no excuse. I just couldn't study. I feel extremely bad, guilty, and all sorts of emotions, since I've never been in a situation like this one. Just needed to vent.",

What I recommend is avoid doing work or studying at home, the library is the way to go. Throw on some headphones listen to classical music/Lofi music. It takes time and patience. Write down your strengths and weaknesses. Like I used to hate using agendas, now I\u2019ve gotten better at it, and I also tend to make lists with the most important tasks on top to the less important tasks on the bottom. Make those lists realistic and short. It\u2019ll make you feel a bit less overwhelmed. But all we can do is take it day by day. You got this. :)",

      "text": "It's absolutely no problem (especially after the covid thingy with every university changing into a specific system different than other universities confusing everyone) I failed the second semester of last year (when covid was in its prime) , but  I've recovered in the last semester and now I'm just doing a couple of courses (my university has a stupid system but couple of weeks from now and I'm starting finals so hope me luck) and working on things related to my major outside uni which brought me lots of joy and actually had a good time doing it. One thing I want to highlight: DO NOT LET IT BREAK YOUR SPIRIT. Take a breath, have it easy on yourself, and don't let it effect you. You can't go back in time to change anything so just let it go",

      "text": "We've all been there  so don't beat yourself up over it.\nI will say though that you need to break out of it anyway you can.\n\nFor me it was just failing upwards, it has taken me almost 12 years  and 4 different community colleges to earn a 4 year degree because I wasn't serious enough. \n\nFor me it was just adopting a never quit attitude, like literally show up to every single class and do every single assignment, I have still failed exams but it's been awhile since I failed a class.\n\n Now I'm currently 5 classes away from graduation with a 3.1 gpa, and believe me I am not the smartest person in the room. Also my degree is in computer engineering so it's not cake walk even for people smarter than myself.\n\nJust never give up on yourself and try to do better then the previous semesters, and try and learn the lesson faster then myself haha",
