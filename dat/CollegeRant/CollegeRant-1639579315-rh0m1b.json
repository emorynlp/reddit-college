  "text": "I\u2019ve been with an agency for my human services degree program since October. From then until now, I thought I was doing well my supervisor told me I was doing good, but today after I got my evaluation I got low scores. Apparently I\u2019m not good enough so they fired me. I\u2019m so depressed I can\u2019t stop crying. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.",

      "text": "What happened? Do u have any idea what it was that made them unhappy/did they give you good feedback or are you actually clueless? \n\nIf it\u2019s the first one then there\u2019s nothing to do but work on the feedback. Take the criticism constructively not personally and be happy that now you know about some blind spots you previously weren\u2019t paying attention to. \n\nIf you dk why you got a bad eval or it\u2019s lacking in details that you can actually work on, I would write a nice professional email reaching out to your supervisor and ask them where it was you were lacking (You can reference that you\u2019re sorry you didn\u2019t meet their expectations and want to improve going forward, but don\u2019t get emotional or personal). In fact it might be good to send an email like that anyway even if you know how you messed up bc it makes you look good.\n\nAnyway yeah. I know it\u2019s upsetting to fail nobody likes that and it\u2019s valid to feel sad for a bit, but use it as a learning opportunity to improve yourself. Work on your weak areas and you can take that new confidence into ur next internship/job.",

They probably just had some budget thing that went wrong and were like \u201cdamn guess we gotta find an excuse to fire the intern.\u201d \n\nThey should expect low performance out of an intern and teach them to perform better, that\u2019s like the whole thing. So firing you at the first sign they give you that you need to improve, instead of giving you feedback and trying to make you better at your job, is pretty weird and not your fault.",

Firing you would be a drop in the ocean. They have bigger fish to fry (lay off).\n* your supervisor is so busy that saving the 5 or 8 hours per week they spend with you would be super beneficial. But even then, they would just give you more independent menial tasks rather than lay you off.\n\nnormal Companies don't fire interns for sucking. Too much paperwork. They'll try to train you to be productive. If you are simply untrainable, they just try to get you to do the most basic things (more basic than what interns usually do, if there's such a thing), write you off as a lost cause, then they'll gossip (\"god that intern was terrible... we should have better interview process or look for other qualities in candidates\").",

My supervisor kept giving me feedback but I kept misunderstanding what she was saying so I would try to change but she still kept saying I wasn't doing it right or I wasn't listening to her. Plus it seemed she was very unforgiving of mistakes and when she told us once to fix ourselves we have to immediately do it or else. I've been at other sites where making the same mistake was still okay and they would give us another chance but not this site. Also, it looks like they didn't understand that covid affected our experiences which was why I couldn't perform the way she wanted me to. I was let go just recently. Now I may need to change my career since if I don't it will affect my graduation. So let's cry together and make ourselves feel better.",
