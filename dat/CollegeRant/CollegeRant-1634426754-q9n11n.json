If you already dropped out and switch majors before and you want to drop out again, I would advise you to take your time and decide what you really want to do with your life.",

If you're also failing the classes for your major, you seriously need to up your studying game, change your major, or simply drop out instead of wasting money if you're not on a full scholarship or anything. I don't know how you can assume that you will fail a class in the future...if you have time for reddit, you have time to study",

My organic chemistry professor keeps telling us if you keep doing bad on the tests, then you need to change your study method. I will remember that whenever I do bad on a test. \n\nSome people can do a group study and think they know all of the material and bomb the test. So now they know group studying doesn't work. They can only read the textbook/powerpoints and still fail. There are plenty of studying methods that you can try, but clearly whichever one you have right now isn't working. You have to find one that works.",
