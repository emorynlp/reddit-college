  "title:": "Tired and lost",
  "text": "I (19M) am currently a second year college student (Commuting and living with parents) and I'm completely burned out from the last 2 years. As of now, I'm currently friendless, with no goal or dreams and it seems like I'm living my life on a constant repeat. I barely leave the house, with the only exceptions being work or the gym. Although I have no goal or idea as to what I want to do, I still continue to go to college due to guilt of my mother paying for my tuition. I still do well and don't let these thoughts affect my academics, but I've slowly been pushing towards having suicidal thoughts for the past few months or so. I've told my mother about how I felt (avoided the suicidal aspect), but she essentially ignored my plead for help and I can't seem to find the energy to help myself (Nor do I know how too). I get even more miserable about myself when seeing my siblings go out and about, as they seem to have some sort of goal or friends to keep pushing on. At this point, I play some sort of fictional role of being a goofy happy person, or lie about having friends to cope with feeling empty.",

      "text": "Hello! I\u2019m in literally the same exact boat and I know to the T how you feel. It\u2019s a dark spot especially when it comes to the whole topic of college I feel like in certain types of family dynamics (I\u2019m assuming here feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong) a lot of people will hear you\u2019re in college and instantly think \u201coh good this kid isn\u2019t going to be a loser\u201d even if you might be incredibly depressed and lonely and drained. Here\u2019s the thing - is a college a good thing? Sure it is. But it stops being a good thing when it starts to drain the life out of you. Everyone goes through burnouts and ruts and I\u2019m currently in one. And it\u2019s awesome you don\u2019t let it affect your academics you\u2019re already a step ahead of most people like myself who do unfortunately let it affect their academics. You\u2019re practically pleading for an out and you\u2019re the key to that. I know it\u2019s hard and may not feel like a good decision cause you\u2019re scared you might fall back or what not. But you should really consider taking a break for however long you need to. Take care of yourself first always because if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t be able to take on all the tasks of life to the best of your ability. The body you\u2019re in right now is all you got in this life time so take care of yourself. That body is your ship and it\u2019s gonna take you everywhere you\u2019re gonna go in life. It\u2019s okay to put yourself first right now despite your mother\u2019s input. This is your education, your well being, and it\u2019s starting to come down to being a threat to your own life if the stress of it all is making you consider taking it. \n\nI want you to know so you don\u2019t feel alone that I\u2019m in the same spot - I\u2019m thinking of taking a break - and yeah my mom is pretty upset and disappointed too but you know what? I think our moms might prefer us alive taking a break rather than dead doing what they wanted us to do. \n\nAs for your siblings, again same spot. I know it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier said than done but try not to compare yourself to them. Whether they\u2019re older or younger they\u2019re your blood and y\u2019all share the same home environment but you\u2019re different people. And who knows? You mentioned you\u2019re good at being the goofy happy person on the outside maybe they\u2019re good at pretending to cope to? Point is - you\u2019re the most important person in your lifetime and you\u2019re the center of your own universe. If you don\u2019t take care of yourself nothing else is going to work the way you want it to. I know it\u2019s hard OP but put yourself first in this situation. You matter a shit ton and losing your life to the stresses and depression of college life isn\u2019t worth it. You\u2019re worth a whole lot more than that and I support you whoever you are. \n\nYou got this!",
