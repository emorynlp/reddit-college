  "text": "the past 4 days I have been extremely sick with a fever, migraine, chills/hot flashes, aches, etc. luckily this started over the weekend so i didn\u2019t miss any classes, but i still have been sick and missed classes on monday and tuesday. the policy at my school is that the absence can not be excused without a doctors note, which is important because many of my classes take attendance for a grade, which affects my grade. \n\ni was unable to go to the campus doctor/urgent cares because many students are being turned away at the door due to full capacity. right now at my campus, covid, bronchitis, pneumonia, and strep are all going around. \n\nbecause of this, i had my boyfriend pick me up and drive me home to go to my family doctor and get a doctors note. i tried to get an appointment with my family doctor as well as another doctor, but they were fully booked through the rest of october and did not take walk ins. \n\ni then tried to go to my local urgent care, but i was unable to afford the $100 minimum appointment fee, even with my insurance. \n\ni have spent three days trying to get a doctors note. but i can\u2019t. i feel as though this is extremely unfair and frustrating. i broke down in tears when she said urgent care would cost $100, because i only have about $50 right now. \n\ni have emailed my professors about my situation and explained how i tried to hard to get a doctors note. i just wanted to vent about how upset i am.",
