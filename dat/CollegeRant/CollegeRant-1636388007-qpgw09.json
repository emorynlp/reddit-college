  "text": "At my college, a lot of the courses aren't taught every semester but only during the spring or fall semester.  Well, this one lecture class that I need only has one section and it only holds 20 people. Now I may not be able to get in it (registration for me is Wednesday) and I'll have to wait another year, oh and I'm a senior. It's stupid, I hate it and I wanna cry but I cant because I have to go to lab soon.\n\nTL;DR: I need to register for a class but may not get to for another year because it only has 2 seats left.",

Failing that, email your program\u2019s chair and explain. Often, they can substitute classes for program requirements at their discretion.",

But since this is a smaller, probably upper level class, I doubt there will be very many no shows and it will be obvious that you are there without being registered for the course. Doing this will more likely than not annoy the professor and decrease your chances of them doing you any favors.",

If you want to attend the first day of class in a full class without being registered, you need to email that professor first. If an unregistered student showed up to my class without talking to me first and took classroom space from one of my students that is registered, I'd ask the unregistered student to leave and not be too happy about it. To remedy this situation, if I was sent an email beforehand and asked about the class and being wait listed, I would provide the student with the syllabus and information about my office hours where I would gladly go over the syllabus and any questions they might have.",
