  "text": "So, a little background. I did not score bad to speak of. My grand total was 348/400 in the end term examination. The highest is 349/400 which has been scored by someone who has been trying to sabotage me since I got a seat at this college. This course has been my dream since childhood and I knew that I would do really well once I am in it.I have been working really hard since day 1.  I have been extremely responsive in the class and I have been doing really well, my classmates and teachers have been acknowledging this .People will think that I am just a show-off now and I have no real talent. Not sure how to take it",

A person can retain little knowledge of a course yet still study hard and pull off good grades, especially if they do all the work. Resorting to blaming the professor for having favoritism or behind the curtain points instead of accepting that someone did better than you or put in more work is very childish and borderline egotistical lol",
