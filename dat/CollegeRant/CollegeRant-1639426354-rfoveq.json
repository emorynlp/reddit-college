  "text": "Hello! My name is Kamran Shams. I am a student ethnographer. I am studying student eating and grocery shopping practices. This is NOT asking about how healthy your diet is; I just want to know how you make decisions about what and when to eat. This is a study of juniors and seniors only, all of whom must be living **off-campus.** **You must be at least 18 to participate.** If this applies to you, I would greatly appreciate you taking 5-10 minutes to answer 23 multiple choice questions. Thank you. [https://s.surveyplanet.com/ofx6w0ef](https://s.surveyplanet.com/ofx6w0ef)",
