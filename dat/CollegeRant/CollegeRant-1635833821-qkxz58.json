  "text": "My university cited me for not having a parking pass, but prior to receiving the citation I had already paid $109 for one. I can't control how long it took to get it delivered to me but eventually my citation was reduced to \"failure to show parking pass.\" Since I had a paid for a pass prior to getting cited, shouldn't I be allowed to get rid of this citation? It seems like a valid reason to get my citation voided but I think my schools parking services is trying to get money out of students any way they can.\n\nIf they don't void my citation, is there a general higher authority one can contact? The citation is only $10 but I paid a lot of money ($109) to not get cited and it's frustrating that it still happened.\n\nAlso, am I wrong to be mad about this or am I overreacting?",
