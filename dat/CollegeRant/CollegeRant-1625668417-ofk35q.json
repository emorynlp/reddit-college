  "title:": "(undergrad, final year) I\u2019m just burnt out from university and I don\u2019t understand why.",
  "text": "Just wanted to find somewhere to vent. The funniest part is that I\u2019m far from being as busy as compared to the semester itself, where I had to juggle a volunteer job, various school club committments and attending theatre workshops on top of my study load - and managed to have outings with friends and family (within COVID guidelines at where I am).\n\nThe only actual committment I have is a summer subject I\u2019m taking, and it\u2019s not even hard or draining. It\u2019s actually a really interesting and fun subject, and I really enjoy it. But I feel like every day I\u2019m just doing the bare minimum to get by, and have that one random spike of energy where I get it done. The subject coordinator just released our first assignment to be done, and I\u2019ll say I\u2019m that kind of student which will immediately panic and start early. Thing is, I don\u2019t feel like starting. My mind knows what I need to be doing, and I keep painting scenarios in my head that if I get up and start now, I\u2019ll get that A that I really want. But my body doesn\u2019t really follow,,, and so I\u2019m stuck on my bed. \n\nWhats worrying to me is the lack of attention im paying to other long term goals that I should be catching up on over the holidays. Like making professional connections on LinkedIn. Connecting with seniors. Going for Job Ready Sessions. Sourcing for internship opportunities and research opportunities. Revamping my portfolio.\n\nI\u2019ve many emails that I haven\u2019t replied to; and all I did today was to go to the doctors to pick up skin medication and attend class. And after that I just felt emotionally exhausted. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what gives. Anyone in a similiar situation like myself?",

Some people may need one week, some may need 3 months. \nIt can also be that you find this course not interesting, engaging, and/or motivating. Or why not a combination of both!",

      "text": "I was like that last semester... it really tripped me up. I barely managed to get by with straight Bs at the end of semester. I know it doesn't sound like a shit grade, but because I want to apply to medical school.... I need to keep my GPA high.   \nBurn out is real. The best I can offer you is to make a rewards system for yourself. \"if I do x,y,z then I will let myself play a video game\" ect... It's hard to do it, but it works!",
