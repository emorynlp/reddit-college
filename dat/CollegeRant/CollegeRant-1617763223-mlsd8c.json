      "text": "I've taken summer classes throughout my college career to catch up faster since I was so behind. It definitely sucks having to still do class stuff when everyone else is on break. HOWEVER, I ended up just doing 2 classes in the summer (1 for each session which is pretty manageable) and then that allowed me to just  take 3 classes in fall and spring without sacrificing credits which lessened the work load during the school year. I know it sucks but it's at least 1 program that you don't have to add during the school year when you'll be stressed with other classes as well. Just try to focus on getting your stuff done then enjoy the time you do end up with. 6 weeks is like, a month and a half which sucks but isn't your entire summer.",

Cheer up!\n\n  \nI know it's a total bummer to hear about taking stuff then, especially stuff you don't *want* to do, but it takes up such a minimal amount of time in reality. Plus, it keeps your brain active. You don't get the weird mental hangover when returning to school in the fall.   \n\n\nYou've got this, just jump through the hoop and get it finished! :D",
