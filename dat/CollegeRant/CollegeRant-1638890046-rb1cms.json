Face it, on a closed book test, the easy parts of the assessment are going to be \"can you remember this thing\". Eliminate that as a variable, and now you're left only with \"do you understand this thing\" which is always a more difficult proposition. But also has a bonus of being a more reasonable assessment of your mastery of the course material.",

I went way above requirements to keep from getting docked.\n\nI bombed another prof's similarly formatted final, but tbf I was dealing with detectives because of some wild shit that happened that week that I'm still having to deal with in January. I almost got doxed that week by my own damn neighborhood.\n\nETA clarification.",
