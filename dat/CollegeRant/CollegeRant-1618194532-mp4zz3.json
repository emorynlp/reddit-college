  "title:": "Anyone experience burn out so bad, you just... stare at your assignments?",
  "text": "TL;DR: I'm so burnt out, the only thing I feel like I can do is aimlessly stare at my assignments even though it's the final stretch.\n\nBecause fuck me, this sucks.\n\nSo basically--Final exam is this Friday, and the professor opens up all of the former homeworks. They were due tonight, and believe or not I DID try to relearn the material and finish/complete what I didn't do before tonight, but I couldn't finish. Now tonight at the due date, I'm just jumping between all of the assignments, and all I could do is stare at the screen or do anything else (which is why I'm on Reddit instead of trying to finish as much as I can). I just feel like nothing is going in or out of my brain anymore. :(\n\nI can't bring myself to think anymore, and I just want to go to bed, but I can't even do that with the work on my mind.\n\nI'm just coming to accept that I'll have to take the class over for a 3rd time (no, I'm way too far to change majors, and to drop out--I'm officially a senior credit wise), and just let things be. And you know what sucks about this? It's literally the last week! I couldn't even hold on for one more week. At least I'm passing everything else. \n\nMaybe others won't relate much, but it's nice I have somewhere to type out my feelings without feeling too ridiculed or judged.",

What\u2019s actually unproductive is forcing yourself to sit at a desk for hours on end agonizing over assignments that you\u2019re too tired and uncomfortable to focus on and guilt tripping yourself every time you take a break.",
