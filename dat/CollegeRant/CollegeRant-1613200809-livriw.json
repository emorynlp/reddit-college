So I want to know what\u2019s the point of trying anymore.",

It was basically a soft coup.\n\nIf we got everyone on an open field, and everyone that wanted their vote to count had to show up, the supposed 80mill\\~ vs the 76mill\\~ all on the same field. Then if they wanted their vote to count, they had to fight, I already know that no where near that 80mill would even show up.\n\nAgain, your original post was a question asking what the point of school was, I answered it for you in the previous comments.

Those things happen regardless whether you go to or finish college or not.  College is easier in the end than being stuck in a job that you despise, with miserable people who also despise their jobs.  In the end, having a college degree will help you land better jobs, in your profession or not.  You will find higher paying jobs in your profession or not.  It gives you a heck of a lot more options and possibilities than someone without a degree.  I think you may just need a change in perspective and attitude, it makes things easier.  It's worth finishing school.  GL!",

You'll be at square 1 regardless of a bachelor's degree anyways, and job searches are a complete bitch unless you have recommendations/offers lined up.\n\nI was failing classes during my junior year to the point I'd decided to cut my classes down to 4/semester to 3. then to 2. Did fine at 2, so I went back up to 3 and failed another course and broke down mentally. Whatever identity crisis that was plaguing me for those 5+ years I'd been in uni caught up with me in full scale to the point I just went AWOL from uni.   \n\n\nI didn't take any classes for months and eventually got my shit together to at the very least man up to get an associates degree just to show for SOMETHING. I could pad my resume with relevant courses I'd taken from university anyways. Who the hell is going to care about the irrelevant forced History/Government classes you took when applying to a job?

College is hard, believe me I get it.\n\nI'm gonna hijack this for a second so I can share my story a bit and try to help provide some wisdom that I've learned. Right now I'm 21 and as it currently stands at the uni I'm transferring to, I'm only a second semester sophomore. My first semester of uni I got hospitalized for suicidal tendencies and dropped out. My mindset at the time was remarkably similar to yours now. I was extremely stressed about school, I was uncertain if I'd even get a job after, and I was far behind my peers in classes (CS major, like half the students I was attending with were born with a keyboard in hand).\n\nAfter that I spent some time dicking around at a local CC before finally truly settling on CS (did a major swap to electrical engineering for like a year). In that time period I still struggled a lot with understanding my situation; I still stressed money and school, and while my grades were good I was struggling as a person. Somewhere along the way though, I just learned to appreciate it all as it was in the moment.\n\nYes it's uncertain if I'll get a job, and it's unknown if I'll ever get one within the field of CS I'm focusing on. But in realising that, there's a vast amount of freedom I achieved. I can enjoy the process of studying, learning for its own sake rather than checking boxes on a job resume. I started hanging out with classmates after school and shooting the shit at a pool table, rather than going home and isolating myself to attain perfect grades (I still have a 3.325 average though).\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say here is that you should \"accept everything just the way it is.\" The future is uncertain but you shouldn't let it wear down on you so much that it's negatively affecting you as a person. There's so much more to college than just getting a piece of paper. \"Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won't see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you'll miss the entire forest.\" I know I'm spouting proverbs but life is far too short to spend it worrying about the tomorrow all the time, let alone years from now. You shouldn't rush this type of thing, because it'll only make you miserable.\n\nI'm not advocating for blindly rushing forward in life btw, but you should; Take a step back, take a breath, and ask yourself. \"Why am I doing this?\" Look in the mirror and ask yourself that every day until you have an answer that isn't \"because this will earn me lots of money\" or \"because I need this piece of paper to get a job.\" These are results of your actions, not your reasons for taking them.",

I would absolutely love taking a year off, but most, if not all of my tuition is being covered by financial aid and scholarships that I just cannot afford to give up.  It absolutely sucks getting a lackluster education right now and not getting anything close to the experience you were advertised when you enrolled, but a gap year for a lot of people means a difference of tens of thousands of dollars in debt by the time they graduate.",

              "text": "And I'm not going to disagree with you. But if the difference is between being so burned out on school that you don't see the point in even participating and hating it vs genuinely enjoying the experience, I'd take the second in a heartbeat, even if I was shouldered with insane amounts of debt. It sucks that our educational institutions have become parasitic leeches that put us in financial ruin for years, but at the end of the day money is money and happiness is happiness. It sounds like hippy bullshit but focusing so directly into such things rots the soul like nothing else. Do what you want to do and happiness comes, but if you do something for money and no other reason you'll wind up hating it.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm able to say that because I'm fortunate enough to be in a situation where debt isn't able to touch me too bad (my w/utilities is around $375 a month and tuition is only $5,000 a year at the uni I attend, plus while I went to CC I worked my ass off to tuck away some cash) and I've hit my lowest already, but I'd rather be happy and in debt than where I was 3 years ago.",
