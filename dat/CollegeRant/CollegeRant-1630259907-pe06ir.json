Get a day planner. Block out every waking hour. Free tip for you. Everyone who does this finds the time. Also, they don't spam reddit with 150+ alts asking the same questions and refusing to take any of the very good advice they're given. \n\nPlus you reported recently you got As and Bs so you're obviously not struggling that much. Your therapist will tell you this too.",

Apparently, no one graduates on time, and that's okay. Consider taking a semester off for your internship, or only taking 1-2 classes during that semester. Internships can also be started after college, there's no set timeline that you have to follow. Best of luck!",

Internships during summer are the best and when u don\u2019t take classes. Are you in level 400 classes in EE? Those sound terrifying to me I had to take level 200 EE requirements for BME and I hated them lol.",
