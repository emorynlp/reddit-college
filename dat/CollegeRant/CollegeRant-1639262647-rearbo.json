Anyone who's taking courses that are easy to ace is at a degree mill, not an institution of higher learning. You're **supposed** to be challenged.",

All the shit that happened during the semester is merely how we get to that point.\n\n> What about someone who has an A average but gets a C or D on the final for whatever reason. \n\nI mean, I get that \"for whatever reason\" might be a reasonable excuse like illness or something of the sort. But if they just dropped the ball when it came time for the final, then I think it's safe to say that they didn't really know the material all that well to begin with. \n\n> So then I ask, does mastery mean much if you do well on the final but forget it soon after?\n\nAs opposed to your stance which seems to be that you think it should be reasonable to have students forget the material even before the final, but still get a good grade?",

I am finishing undergrad and I have not seen a course that had finals weighting over 20 % and I am in engineering. I am sure other other applied sciences courses are very different and this could extend to professors and institutions.\n\nBut from what I have seen, other ways to asses mastery are done via a culminating project similar to a capstone.

The entire point of exams is to provide an accurate assessment of the student's mastery of the course material, and then use those assessments to assign a letter grade. It helps students collectively for that assessment to be as accurate as possible. People need to trust the grades assigned reflect reality after all.\n\nThus to do that, making the final exam, the cumulative assessment which covers the entirety of the course material worth a lot goes a long way to helping ensure the accuracy of the assessment. \n\nWe're not in the business of helping students get high grades. We're in the business of providing resources and materials to aid the students in learning, and then assessing how well the students availed themselves of those educational opportunities. You seem to be treating grades as if it's the goal of the course; it's not. It's a by-product.",

That's just grossly undervaluing the final.\n\nLike when I clicked on this thread, I had thought that you'd be complaining about a final worth 60%. 20% is far far less than I would ever consider weighting a final.",

The other was my final portfolio, which is just running all of the statistical tests related to my research for my thesis, I also got a 100. But like I said, grad courses are more conceptual, so in my opinion they\u2019re a bit easier to get 100s in. At least at my university they are.

In their class, all 5 exams were worth 20%. The final was exam #5. So if a student were to be getting their ass handed to them on the first 4 exams but aced the final, they prob would not pass the course. But the Professor had a policy that a student who could get 80+ in the cumulative final exam would automatically be getting a C/passing the class regardless of their scores on the other 4.",

I literally never took a final where I scored more than 5% away from my course average overall anyway. Your grades are supposed to reflect how well you know the material going in to the final so if you\u2019re being dropped that much then you had puff grades anyway. Learn the material better and this won\u2019t be a problem.",

I started taking a new medication that I didn\u2019t know you were supposed to eat on right before my first diff eq exam and felt so sick that I couldn\u2019t focus. I got a C. The next exam, I studied the exam same way and got an A. The only difference was I was feeling better and could actually think. This is just one example, not everyone is going to get sick on test day. But there are other things that can contribute to a bad day, anxiety, not enough sleep etc\u2026 a person shouldn\u2019t be judged on one thing and one thing only. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good to have multiple tests and even better to have a mix of tests, homework and projects. Tests don\u2019t always accurately reflect how much someone has learned because a lot of people get testing anxiety.",
