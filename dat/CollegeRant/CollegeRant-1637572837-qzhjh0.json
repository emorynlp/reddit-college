  "text": "I am a Freshman (Sophomore credits wise) majoring in Computer Science and I feel like I am failing already. I am going to end this semester with somewhere between a 2.8 and a 3.0 and I really enjoy school, I just kind of feel like I am sucking at it and I don't know what to do. Any tips? I'm currently at a 3.3 gpa. Is that bad? Being a grad student is something I have considered so I want to keep the door open. Is it normal to have bad grades after moving out and starting school on your own?\n\nTLDR: I feel like my grades are already bad and I don't know what to do about it.",

              "text": "Yeah just take some weight off your shoulders. Remember that it is not about doing as much as you can all at the same time, but it is about getting the most out of your education. There is a balance to strike that allows you to retain and synthesize information and also fulfill requirements/take a variety of courses. It is hard to separate ego and grades because human instinct is to latch onto rankings as a sorting function. Try to pass this instinct and place more importance on holistically honing your sense of consciousness and your skills for work (in whichever order you see fit for your life).   \n\n\n*(Personally, I see humans as perceiving machines, so the ability to perceive and process information is the essence of what drives me. Although, survival is the most fundamental goal.)*",
