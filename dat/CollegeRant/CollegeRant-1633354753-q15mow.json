  "text": "I\u2019m just not ready to graduate. There\u2019s still a ton that I want to do on campus, but my major is already over ninety percent completed. I have to register for my last semester this week and it\u2019s making me sad.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I want to do with my life post-college. I don\u2019t feel ready for graduate school, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll just end up living at home for the foreseeable future.",

      "text": "I feel this so hard. I lost all motivation halfway into my degree because my mental health nosedived and I pretty much just did the bare minimum to keep a decent GPA. Now I have very little experience, only a handful of connections and overall just don't feel like I'm ready for a job in my field. I also have been questioning a lot if I chose the wrong major or if I should've double majored, but it's my last year so it's just too late. Have you decided for certain if you want to go to grad school or if you want to get a job after undergrad?",
