  "text": "So I worked my ass off to get scholarships so I didn\u2019t have any student debt. actually right now I\u2019m getting paid to go to college. Well one of my scholarships is &\n$2,500 per semester. That\u2019s a lot of money but it requires me to keep a 3.0 GPA.\n\nThis drives me nuts because sometimes you just get a bad professor. Some classes are impossible to pass with a B. Right now I\u2019m working my ass off to get a D up to a C while keeping all of my other grades at an A for a buffer. It\u2019s really starting to stress me out because I can lose this scholarship!!",

This pandemic hit and I lost 15 points in one month in my hardest class. I could have passed with a B and now I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll pass at all. Everything else is going to shit and I can\u2019t even process much of it because I have to do all this class work",

I tried my hardest but I couldn\u2019t find a teacher who would do one with me, even over online chat. The other classes I\u2019m taking are intro to classroom management, intro to music, bio, weightlifting, and American history.",

              "text": "I mean if you get all A's in the rest of your classes your GPA would be a 3.5 which is well above what is required to keep the scholarship. You know 3.0 really isn't that high of a required GPA. However I would be careful, because if you get all B's and the D you have right now your GPA would be a 2.6. If you get one only one A and one D and the rest of your classes are B's then your GPA would be a 2.8. However Getting two A's would be enough for your GPA to be a 3.0 for this semester even if you get a D in that class, as long as the rest of your classes are B's. \n\nI personally wouldn't worry too much about this class, I personally think you should focus more on your other classes and make sure you keep your grade up in those classes. However, it also depends on what GPA you have in the past semesters if the scholarship requires you to maintain a \nCUMULATIVE GPA  of 3.0 which is different from your semester GPA. \n\nWhat grades do you have for past semesters? What's your cumulative GPA right now(Not Including this semester)? I mean if the scholarship only looks at your cumulative GPA and your cumulative GPA for the past couple of semesters is high enough I personally wouldn't worry about getting the best grades possible if your only goal was to keep the scholarship.",
