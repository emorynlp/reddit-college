My field definitely requires a degree and pays really well and due to in state tuition + pell grant + other scholarships/grants I\u2018ve barely paid any tuition. Plus I like college. So all in all it\u2019s been worth it. (Or will be fingers crossed\u2026) However, a friend of mine is 25 making 6 figures and dropped out of college. He hated school and basically taught himself software development and cyber security. Controversial opinion, but unless you\u2019re planning on going into academia, 75% of majors are not super helpful for getting a job",
