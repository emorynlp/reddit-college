  "text": "This is just my first semester so I'm not going to beat myself up too much over it but it was bad. I struggle with my mental health and a lot of things happened this semester that made it very difficult for me to get things done. It was so bad by the semester therapist changed me to her year-long client because she's too concerned to let me not go on with therapy for too long. Last week she subtly suggested that I may have borderline personality disorder. She didn't say it because I don't think she's 100% sure yet but she asked me I relate to the symptoms without telling me what it was and all of them attacked me like a brick. I ended up looking it up because I was curious but now I regret it because I'm so paranoid. It's the last week of classes and I'm panic cramping everything else I have to get done. Trying to force out essays and make them sound decent is so frustrating and I can't wait for this to be over with. During this break, I really just want to do absolutely nothing. I just want to read my books, go to museums and take a bunch of naps. Hopefully, I finish everything so I could relax for once in the last 4 months.",

      "text": "First semester of my college I was put on academic probation then I was suspended the next semester. I went to six colleges before I finally graduated with a political science degree. Now I write political articles and I get published fairly often. I had mental health problems. I wrote about it on my profile under the title I went mental. There are five articles and they were all published in my local newspaper. I would like to make a comic book out of them. It's a tough time to be a person at your age. Why are you in school? Do you know what you want to do? Maybe college is not the best place for you. It wasn't the best place for me at that age. I was really doing it because it was expected of me and I liked the social aspect.",

          "text": "Im proud to say I\u2019m going to school because I want to. My parents of course wished for me to go to college but they didn\u2019t force it and told me to do what makes me happy. Im a film major with a music minor and I actually really love my school. I just did adjusting to the the nature of college and dealing with everything else in my life is weighting me down. Your story is inspiring though and I appreciate you sharing it.",

      "text": "College is a big adjustment for many people so don\u2019t feel you are alone in not doing as well as you wanted or struggling with your mental health.  I commend you for recognizing your need for counseling and getting it!  Give yourself permission to rest over the break as you see fit and plan on starting back after the break with a clean slate.  Look into resources offered at your school such as student mentors, time management help, writing center, and maybe even group counseling.  Hang in there and know even people like me who don\u2019t actually know you, genuinely care :-)",
