I won't lie I have cried but I feel like I'll persevere. I'll probably also be put on academic probation but I've been there once already, and hopefully I can use grade forgiveness on these classes and then retake them. \n\nIt's tough but it's nice to see that I'm not alone, here's to spring hopefully going better.",

So I probably won't do as well this semester, kinda sucks, but I tell myself that worrying ain't gonna change anything, i might as well enjoy the time i have right now. School has taken a lot of time from me afterall, why should i let it take more of it. Just be zen and don't worry until the results are out :)\n\nThe time spent worrying could be time used for having fun. Both have the same expenditure in terms of time, but the experiences they lead to are very different. You only have 1 life to live, try not to spend all of it on worrying about things you can't change. Soo try to enjoy your post-finals break for now",
