They will say, \"Oh, that's not my preference.\u201d People seem to have a lot of trouble understanding that they can set earlier deadlines for themselves if they don't like the class deadline - especially if the deadlines are known well in advance.\n\n11:59 is probably the easiest for everyone, though. I make everything 11:59 and only get occasional complaints (which I ignore since the vast majority prefer it that way).",
