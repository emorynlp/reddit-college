  "text": "Ok so spring 2020, the semester we went online I struggled with the switch at first and my grades definitely reflected it. So last semester, I did my absolute best and ended with straight A\u2019s (1 A-) to boost my culmulative. This semester my classes were much tougher, so I didn\u2019t expect straight A\u2019s again but I expected majority A\u2019s and like 2 B\u2019s. Well now we\u2019re coming to the end I have an A an A- 2 B+ and a B. The thing is tho is that one of the B+\u2019s is literally 1.17 away from being an A-. So I nice asked (I did not request, just ask) if she would be rounding final grades for the class this semester and if not that would be completely fine. She completely ignores my email and sends one to the class w like the stats from the final and says \u201cI will not be taking final grade requests\u201d, basically throwing shade at me even tho I never said \u201cchange my grade to an A-\u201c I just asked if she would be rounding for the whole class. But I\u2019ve literally gotten 98%-100% on every single homework and I have B\u2019s on both exams (it was hard to get an A on an exam as each question was worth 13.3 pst so you could only miss like 2) but I\u2019m still 1.17 short of an A-. Anyways, getting a B+ in this class drops my semester gpa to below a 3.5 so now I\u2019m not gna be on the deans list that I worked so hard to try and get on again. And to add salt to the wound it\u2019s gna lower my culmulative gpa by .2.  Now I know to some these may be good grades and they definitely are but the reason I\u2019m so concerned is because I\u2019m planning on applying to grad school in the fall and having a low culmulative isn\u2019t great. I had a 3.41 and now I\u2019ll have a 3.38. I wanna apply to competitive top schools but now I fear that my grades are really gna hold me back. I just can\u2019t believe that 1 fucking point can cause so much damage. Like if I was 3+ point away I\u2019d be able to accept it but I can\u2019t accept that 1 damn point may ruin my future.",

      "text": "Most professors do not round, and those that do certainly are unlikely to round over a point. Your future is not ruined by (more than) 1 point. You gpa is not a 3.38 because of that (more than) one point in that one class. It is a cumulative reflection of your work in all classes from all semesters. Grad school is going to care about more than your GPA - entrance exam score (GRE, LSAT, etc.) and recommendation letters are huge. Your professor sent that email because you weren\u2019t the only one she got one from, and it\u2019s easier to just address the issue with everyone at once. It\u2019s not personal.",

          "text": "I\u2019ve actually had multiple professors round grades if ur super close. My management prof just rounded everyone who was 1, 2, or 3 points away from the next grade. I had a comm prof who did the same thing. A lot of profs at my school do it. I didn\u2019t assume she would but I just wanted to ask. And yes I understand it\u2019s easier to send an email to the whole class but she could\u2019ve at least responded to me as I emailed her a while ago while everyone else started emailing her after the final. The main reason I\u2019m so annoyed is because I worked so hard this semester got 95-100% on every single homework and high B\u2019s and I did all that to still be 1 point off. And I\u2019m annoyed because I\u2019ve worked extremely hard these past semesters to raise my culmulative and so yes this B+ is dropping it because I calculated w the school grade calculator and if it were an A- I\u2019d still make the deans list and my culmulative would go up instead of down.",

              "text": "Except that B in the other class is bringing you down more. So it\u2019s your work in that class that hurts more (and how poorly you did with the switch, which is why you are having to work to bring the cumulative GPA up in the first place), not your 1.17 with the B+. Effort isn\u2019t graded; knowledge is graded. So while working hard is nice, it doesn\u2019t matter in relation to your grade. Your exams are a measure of you knowledge, and there you got B\u2019s. Other professors rounding isn\u2019t evidence that this one should; it\u2019s evidence that other profs are contributing to grade inflation and giving undeserved points at worst and adjusting for things they thought might have been too difficult at best. It has no bearing in your current course. I\u2019m not going to keep arguing with you because it\u2019s clear you are not interested in believing anything other than your prof screwed your over, and the only reason I commented in the first place was to offer a professor perspective.",
