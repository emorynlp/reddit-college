  "text": "First, for a shitty unit test comprising mere 15 marks they give out the portion of the ENTIRE FUCKING SEMESTER, without actually teaching anything. Then they refuse to repair their god forsaken computer system through which they were conducting online classes and hence failed to record attendance. Then, they give you 0 for attendance for not meeting the required cut off which happened because of their shitty mechanism in the first place and refuse to compensate in marks. Thus, bringing down your GPA like a house of cards.\nOn top of it all, assholes that are in your class taunt you for something that you didn't do, which will ruin your reputation and your chances of winning the council elections.\nAnd you have no idea how to deal with it.....",
