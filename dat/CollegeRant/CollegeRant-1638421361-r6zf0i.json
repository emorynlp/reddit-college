  "title:": "I\u2019ve hated this professor all semester because of lack of information and disorganization, but I finally hit my breaking point today because they were incredibly rude to me- to the point where I am now very anxious about attending class and worried for my grade/GPA. Please give encouragement/advice",
  "text": "This is my professors first semester teaching, and you can tell. There wasn\u2019t a Canvas page until halfway through the semester, and I still don\u2019t have any grades posted. Content of exams and/or assignments was not explained at all. I don\u2019t even know how many points the discussions we did were worth. Both the TA and professor took days to reply to a simple question when I reached out to both of them through email and direct message on Canvas multiple times. \n\nThe syllabus had little to no information on it, the attendance policy was \u201cshow up it\u2019s mandatory\u201d Yes, this is about attendance. \n\nI\u2019ve skipped this class a lot. I don\u2019t know the how much specifically, but based off of their email I\u2019m going to say I\u2019ve skipped around half. I\u2019m not here to make excuses- I know I\u2019ve messed up. But when all the prof does is read the PowerPoint word for word (and then eventually post them online) and attendance is only worth 10% of my grade I figured why not?\n\nI decided to try to get back some of my points today because there were some classes I was late to but I attended. This professor takes attendance by passing out a sheet at the beginning of class, and I arrived after that sheet was passed out. My solution was to take a picture of the board with my phone because it was date and time-stamped so I could show my professor I actually attended class. \n\nI talked to them after class in-person today about it and it was a weird conversation. I explained that I was late several times but I had proof I was in class, and they cut me off to ask how many classes I\u2019ve missed. \u201cFive or more?\u201d I had no idea what they why they were asking me that but I said it\u2019s been around five (it\u2019s actually been eight.)They then said that I would be fine because of the \u201cfive day unexcused absence policy\u201d but I need to get better at getting to class on time. I tried to restart the conversation about I had proof, but they once again cut me off to ask if I signed the attendance sheet. They then said it was my responsibility to sign the sheet no matter when I came in. After that I left because I was so shocked that they weren\u2019t willing to let me talk.\n\nIn hindsight this is where I should\u2019ve provided the professor more information, like the fact that I tried more than once to sign the attendance sheet but I couldn\u2019t find it. But I didn\u2019t, so oh well.\n\nSo after explaining the situation to two of my closest friends, they both agreed that I should email the professor explaining the pictures as proof (I think I asked if the pictures could count as my signature on the attendance sheet), and to ask what the five day policy was because I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere in the syllabus or on any official university documents.\n\nI got the nastiest, most passive aggressive, disrespectful email of my life hours later. Words were bolded, underlined, italicized, you name it. The first line was just reiterating that I should\u2019ve signed the attendance sheet. After that they berated me for missing so much class, more than eight, which I \u201cclaim\u201d to have only been late for. I think they thought I was lying. I don\u2019t think they even looked at the document I provided with the pictures, dates and times.\n\nAfter that they went on a rant about how it\u2019s their class not the university\u2019s and they\u2019re allowed to make any policy they want. They they told me that I should be incredibly grateful that they allow five unexcused absences before they start taking points off, and for other policies they have implemented that help students. \n\nI was shaking I was so upset, and I didn\u2019t really know what to say so I just emailed them back thanking them for their time, that I understood and respected their decision, and that I was grateful for their policies.\n\nBut I\u2019m so worried about them taking out their anger on my grades. I only have two things left that count for my grade and one of them is currently being graded right now. Also, I\u2019m an honors student and I just got my total gpa up to a 3.5, which is where it has to be for me to graduate with honors. If I don\u2019t do good on my last two assignments this could cause my semester gpa to go to a 3.25. I also want to go to a top 50 law school so if they take their anger out on me it might ruin my future. I can\u2019t even imagine facing my parents. I\u2019m also super afraid they\u2019re going to call me out in front of the class.\n\n\nTL:DR- I\u2019ve skipped maybe around half of a class because it was boring and because attendance was only worth 10% of my grade. I showed up to 8 classes late and wanted to get credit for them so I talked to the professor after class but they wouldn\u2019t let me explain myself, and they also mentioned a policy that they never explained and wasn\u2019t on their syllabus. I sent them a respectful email actually saying what I wanted to and asking them about the policy. They sent me back an extremely disrespectful email, and they seemed so angry that I\u2019m worried they\u2019re going to take it out on my grades and/or be mean to me in class. Please help!",

      "text": "They probably aren\u2019t actually angry, and they aren\u2019t taking anything out on you or your future grades. They are likely annoyed or frustrated that you knew attendance was mandatory but blew off class and then tried to get points back outside of the procedure they\u2019ve had since the beginning. Pics can be taken by any phone and sent to you; that doesn\u2019t mean anything as far as proof goes. Even if it did, the procedure is that the sheet has to be signed. They already said this once, and then when you again asked via email, it probably make them feel the need to be firm with their language and emphasize the points they had made before (likely coming from annoyance that you\u2019d ask again after already being told no).\n\nAlso, their giving you five free absences really is generous. There are some professors who don\u2019t allow any unexcused absences, and in some departments, missing more than two or three classes without good reason results in course failure. This is a good lesson for the future - accept the procedures for attendance (or drop if you don\u2019t like them), and don\u2019t skip class.\n\nAs for the lack of course organization, if you have student opinion of instruction surveys, you can take that opportunity to provide that feedback. If you feel it was egregious to the point that it interfered with campus policy, you could also raise the concern with the department chair.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Pretty much agree with PHDapper.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about them taking it out on you grade-wise. It sounds like this person is in over their head and is incredibly stressed, so it may be a case of transferring some of that frustration. \n\nAnother silver lining is that if they haven\u2019t graded anything yet, they are going to have to grade your previously submitted work very quickly, and if they are fair-minded that often results in grades higher than possibly deserved because of only looking over assignments superficially.\n\nTake a deep breath, do your best for the rest of the semester, and good luck to you.",

Thank you for explaining their point of view, that actually really helped. \n\nI guess I didn\u2019t understand that they were trying to say because they didn\u2019t explicitly say they wouldn\u2019t accept my proof- they only implied it (until the last email that is.) I also didn\u2019t understand that the attendance sheet was the only way they were counting attendance because they didn\u2019t explicitly explain that procedure. Looking back now, it\u2019s so obvious, and I\u2019m upset with myself. That seems to be a common theme with myself, I always need things explicitly stated, and it sucks. \n\nI just don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m disrespectful or that I\u2019m trying to take advantage of them because that truly wasn\u2019t my intention. I just thought they misunderstood what I was trying to say, and I articulate myself better through written language so I thought I\u2019d email them. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t care about their decision at all- I made the decision to skip class so I deserve the consequences. I know it sounds stupid to say, but I\u2019m honestly hurt that they seemed so mean in their email.",
