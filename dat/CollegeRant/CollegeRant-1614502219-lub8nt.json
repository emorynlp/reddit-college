Online is not doing you favours, not sure if youre a freshman but college is way better in person. First year taught me good study habits, good work ethic.. Its hard to learn that online... Not the best environment. Im in my third year and im ok with online, only because i was allowed the privilege of in person classes, taught me work ethic.",
