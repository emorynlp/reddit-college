  "text": "This is something that is near and dear to my heart. I am trying to find women that have attended for-profits to tell their story for my Ph.D. program. \n\nI am a Ph.D. student at Cleveland State University and am currently looking for participants for my dissertation about the experience of women that have attended a For-Profit College or University. Participants will need to be available for a 60-90 minute zoom interview. **All participants will receive a $20 gift card!** Personal Information will be kept confidential.\n\n**Participants must be:**\n\n* **Women who are first-generation college students**\n* **Students who attended a certificate/trade-based program in a for-profit educational institution**\n* **Students who are no longer enrolled, having completed the program one or more years ago**\n\nMessage me if you are interested!",
