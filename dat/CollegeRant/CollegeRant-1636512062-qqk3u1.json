  "text": "I have always had some group of friends around me to support and hang out, but it\u2019s not like that anymore.\n\nI am a freshman, and I tried talking to people, but usually they just never follow up or respond in such a way that shows how uninterested they are. I tried joining clubs, and that also didn\u2019t work out well. Thinking about joining different clubs but it\u2019s almost the end of the semester. Everyone has already more or less established his or her circle. \n\nI am also falling behind on some of my classes, mostly because of this constant social pressure that\u2019s just always on my mind. The only student with whom I can talk to or hang out is my roommate. I\u2019m not complaining, he\u2019s a great roommate. But it\u2019s just not the type of socializing that I\u2019m used to.\n\nWhy does it need to be so hard are stressful \n\nThanks for reading my rant \n\nHave a nice day",
