  "text": "I talked to my English professor about it yesterday after class, and it turns out she never got it because I emailed it to the wrong person lmao. I submitted it 6 minutes before it was due and because she didn't have it after it was due, she just put a zero in. I ended up with a 100 on the essay lol",
