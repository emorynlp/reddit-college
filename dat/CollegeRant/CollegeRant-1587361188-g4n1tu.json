  "text": "My workload isn\u2019t /that/ much. I mean it may be a little more than usual, since homework is assigned to make up for the fact that we don\u2019t have classes. Still, I just cannot get it done. Every day getting up to sit at my computer and watch a lecture and then do some homework and not bother to get dressed because all my clothes are dirty and I can\u2019t leave the house anyways... spending weekends doing Sunday-midnight-deadline homework only to continue work once the week starts again... watching as my parents who work real jobs get to enjoy their evenings and weekends without homework... I\u2019m just so burnt out. I can\u2019t even count the many things I want to spend my time doing but can\u2019t because I\u2019m stuck to my computer all day. And don\u2019t even get me started on how draining it is to manage multiple different subjects at once with no in-person classes to divvy up the attention. Even though I spend most of my time just resting and procrastinating my work, it feels like my responsibilities never end. I just want some air.",

      "text": "Ugh me too. Dad is more or less done at 5 (occasionally has to do some emergency computer work after hours), mom is usually done by the early afternoon, and my HS freshman sister usually only has like 2 hours of work that she\u2019s done with by 11 am (which says something about our public K-12 system but that\u2019s a topic for a different post). Meanwhile I\u2019m stuck trying to slog through completing final projects and studying for/taking exams and putting in work for my virtual internship while dealing with frequently changing deadlines, being in a different time zone than my physical college (and therefore having to remember to adjust for submission times), and trying to not get distracted without the ability to go somewhere like a coffee shop or library to work. On top of all of that I\u2019ve been getting more migraines than ever from the 40-50 hours a week I spend looking at a computer screen and my body apparently thinks sleeping 12 hours a day is an appropriate way to deal with stress even though that barely leaves me with any leisure time after doing my work. Ofc my parents\u2019 response is \u201cwell we\u2019re all stressed\u201d which isn\u2019t helpful or comforting in the slightest.",

My professors just keep piling on extra problems and moving around due dates. Maybe take a break when you feel like you're procrastinating, its not like anything productive will come from sitting there.",
