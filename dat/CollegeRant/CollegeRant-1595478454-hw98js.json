  "text": "but at this point, why the hell are we just not staying home?! my university is opening for the fall, but a week after housing contracts were signed classes went hybrid/fully online. not only that we have to wear masks at all times on campus (totally understandable and necessary for health). BUT on top of that, students are being pushed out of hybrid classes and we have to be tested for COVID before being allowed on campus. some of us have actually avoided people all summer, sorry i don\u2019t want something shoved up my nose when i literally live alone and havent been with others this entire time!!!! and on top of that were being charged distance learning fees when we signed up for in person classes!!!!! at this point why even open campus back up? keep everyone home!\n\ni feel better getting that out now lol",

This is bullshit. A waste of housing expenses, my time, and unnecessary risk. The worst part about it is if we get some surging going on in campus they\u2019d probably send everyone home anyway, making the whole thing worse. I\u2019d bet money this will happen. I\u2019d rather just continue the remote stuff they setup at home and if they get a vaccine by January, you can get it and then come back with no restriction.",
