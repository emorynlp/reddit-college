  "text": "Long story short I\u2019m in college scheduling classes for next semester and the one Spanish class I wanna take it says there\u2019s an error and I don\u2019t meet the requirements for the class ?? ( when I\u2019m taking the prereq already, however there is a chance I can\u2019t even take it bc of another prereq) anyways I emailed advising but they might not respond till Monday and idk if all the classes spots will fill up so what should I do??\nA. Make a new schedule without the Spanish class\nB. Keep my initial schedule as is and hope I get the Spanish class\nThe thing is, If I don\u2019t end up getting this Spanish class, I have to change my whole schedule then for times sake so",
