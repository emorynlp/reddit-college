You have to work with other people.\"\n\nYou think I don't FUCKING know that? I've had real jobs already, you tenured cunt. I was in the military for a single tour (only 4 years) and I've been working since I was fucking fourteen! In the REAL world, your boss will fucking fire you if you refuse to do your job. In college it's just \"Oh whatever, the project got turned in. Who cares who did what.\" Fuck my life for having two classes that are extremely group-heavy.\n\nThat is all.",

A lot of workhorses get the shaft.\n\nGroup projects are often more congenial than office work and it is easier to demonstrate when someone is slacking. It is also really much easier to get someone to care at college.\n\nMost students don\u2019t take advantage of academic dishonesty requirements; that is if another student is claiming your work as their own; report them. Not just to the professor but in the appeal of your mark.\n\nIf all students in these kinds of projects appealed their mark when they had issues the projects would be (and could be) structured much better. \n\nI appreciate your rant, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. I just disagree with your premise that people get fired.",

There\u2019s the group that means well, but no one knows what they are doing. Once again we barely get by, or pass with luck, but we all have a great time together. Then there\u2019s the group where half the people get the work done while playing Where\u2019s Fucking Waldo with the classmates that disappeared into thin air so they can do their part. Lastly, the golden group. Y\u2019all get it done and do it well. \n\nI will always offer to be in a group, but if anyone of my classmates believes that I\u2019m doing all the work then they are in for a rude awakening. I\u2019ve had to unfortunately report some students for leeching off of the group for an undeserved grade. \n\nWorking alone will easily be the best choice though. I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t had anymore group assignments in a few years.",
