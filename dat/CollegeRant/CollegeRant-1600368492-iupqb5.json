  "title:": "How the fuck does someone like to go to college!? - UPDATE",
  "text": "So I made it. I fucking survived what was literally the worst, most hellish part of my life. I FUCKING FINISHED MY MASTER'S! My thesis has been presented, I passed all the classes and I'm finally free from that goddamn shithole that I should've never put myself into...  \n\n\nAs for the job market? I started searching for a job 2 months after my thesis's presentation. I went through various tests and assessments and, as I saw many other people around me with better soft/technical skills, I thought to myself \"Well, you're done for, my man...\". BUT NO, I actually got the job and I'm currently in an intership at the company I applied for!  \n\n\nAt first I was extremely anxious because literally EVERYONE on my college told me that \"the job market is way more intense\", that \"if you can't handle it here, you won't last a week at your job\", AND, my personal favorite: \"in the job market no one's going to teach you anything\". This undoubtely filled me with anxiety, and I suffered a lot beforehand. But guess what:  \n\\- **THEY ACTUALLY FUCKING TEACH YOU STUFF, YOU JUST NEED TO ASK AND THEY'LL DELIBERATELY PROVIDE HELP**  \n\\- **PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG WILL (AND LOVE TO) TEACH OTHER PEOPLE**\n\n  \nAlso, in the group of interns, we're **ALWAYS** hanging out and helping each other when need be!\n\nConclusion: I just wanted to give you guys an update on my current status, since my last post here caused quite a stir and loads of people actually related to it. Also, from my story I want you to understand that **THINGS CAN AND WILL GET BETTER ONCE YOU LEAVE THAT FUCKING SHITHOLE THAT YOU'RE IN! BE STRONG, COMRADES! IF I DID IT, SO WILL YOU!**\n\nOP:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/ghb1s0/how_the_fuck_does_someone_like_to_go_to_college/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",
