  "text": "I'm holding a job as a full-time student and maintaining a 4.0 while being a member of the International Honors Society as well as enrolled in my colleges honor seminar, but I don't feel successful.\n\nI'm stressed all day and everyday, I feel detached from my body, I feel overwhelmingly sad and anxious 24/7, and I feel empty inside \u2014 I feel like I'm just living to exist though my existence consistes of nothing more than work that is meaningless. This work has done nothing but erase my quality of life to the point that there is truly no point in living. \n\nI have no friends, I don't have family to talk to; I'm alone. \n\nI feel the opposite of successful. I feel defeated; a defeat I'm unable to escape and will most likely never escape. I'm sure I'll be alone for the rest of my unsuccessful life.\n\nI envy, and deep down despise, those who are genuinely happy.\n\nThis is all that I feel currently. \n\nI've been reading a lot on the existentialist Sartre, and I genuinely believe he's fueling my depression by stating nothing but the truth of our reality.\n\nI don't want pity responses, instead, I hope whoever decides to comment under my post will bring me much needed advice and help me start my journey to finding meaning in this life.",

I under stand the job and good grades but why devote even more of your time to the honours society AND the Honours seminar. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d scale back on the responsibilities and give you time to relax and try to have a little fun. \n\nIn 10 years from now it\u2019s not going to mean a whole lot of you hate what your doing. You\u2019ve proven you can do it but at what cost? Think about your mental health and happiness.",

Work is really the only thing I have and the only thing I can rely on. \n\nI've lost all of my friends due to bad seclusion habits of mine, though sometimes I think maybe it's a good thing I don't have friends for they're a distraction. On the contrary, I yearn for human connection. Very contradictory, I know. I'm sure I'll make new friends soon, but just as i make them I'll lose them because social interactions exhaust me in a much different and prolonged way than work seems to. \n\nThings that I used to enjoy aren't enjoyable anymore. The only thing I consistently do is lie down on my bed, usually for one to two hours, and just stare forward in a dozing off kind of way. I wouldn't say it's a hobby though, just something that helps me to relax for a short bit.\n\nAnyways, do you have any other advice?",

I convince myself that I'm going to fail my tests beforehand and during my tests, as well as my assignments. I have to check my answers 3 times, but not all at once. I must go down my papers answers number by number and repeat that 3 times starting from the too and making my way down. After the test, I'm still convinced that I somehow failed though I've made top marks in all classes thus far. It's a grueling system of mine, I'm always the last to finish my test as you may have expected.\n\nI physically become ill when I stress like this, which is often. I don't think I could recieve a B after everything I've put myself through, and saying this confirms that my routine of stressing will remain the same.\n\nI know I sound psychotic after re-reading this comment, it sounds stupid, childish, and ridiculous, but this is how I think. \n\nThank you for reassuring me nonetheless. I will come back to this comment often to reiterate the idea that my grades are uselessly \"perfect\". Maybe it will stick with me the next time around.",

I generally don\u2019t have negative side effects to antidepressants so I\u2019ve been fine trying so many but I also just haven\u2019t responded much to them. In approximate order I tried zoloft, effexor, wellbutrin, cymbalta, trintellix, prozac, lamictal, lexapro, and viibryd. Prozac and Effexor both worked for a while and I\u2019m on Wellbutrin and Viibryd now which work well. I\u2019ve been on Wellbutrin since 2018 and increasing the dose for that this year to 450 helped a bit but Viibryd has been the biggest game changer so far. \n\nThe worst thing about treatment for depression is that we don\u2019t know what works. I really can\u2019t recommend anything without knowing what you\u2019ve been on but it just takes time unfortunately. I don\u2019t regret my journey at all though because, like I said, idk if I\u2019d even be here anymore without the meds. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be where I am now.",

I've received a lot of invitations to honor societies \u2013 I don't give a shit about that and will never accept any. I don't care about awards, I don't care about honors, I don't care about grades anymore. Like you said, they don't bring any satisfaction and at the end of the day you feel lonely and think about that party you avoided, etc. You think in the \"what if.\"\n\nI read magic realism, dystopian worlds, scifi, and I've read Sartre as well but meh... Lately I've been just reading about algorithms, data structures and computer architecture because I'm curious and love my major. People does not longer invite me to events, and I don't have a girlfriend and that's fine. It's okay to feel like crap when you see how other people has fun talking about trivial things or thinking which photo will give them more likes, rather than other things that are perhaps more important, or beneficial.\n\nPeople have already stopped inviting me to parties (like I said) because they bore me; I'm not interested in dancing, because I can't make sense of it... I can spend hours and hours reading, but I can't stand a minute watching a football game or any other sport. Television seems to me an infamous waste of time; group talks end up annoying me after a while...\n\nAnyway, my interests do not coincide with those of the rest (most of them, obviously), and if that is why they call me boring, but if being boring is liking what I enjoy so much, I am happy to be boring, more when I never get bored doing \"boring\" things.\n\nFollow your natural inclinations. Your concentration will take you very far, where you will never take the practice of activities that do not interest you and that most likely do not go from being ways of killing time without much benefit...\n\nYou will never be very popular with girls, but from time to time you will find someone who will appreciate how special you are and will value you for it. After adolescence (I'm 20 years old) we will no longer need so much the company of other people of our age nor their approval. We will stop feeling uncomfortable about being ourselves, I hope. \n\nTry to go as far as possible in your biggest hobbies. That's what you are really worth, not what others think of you. It's okay to not study (I have an exam tomorrow and I don't care; I'm tired and I'm going to be bed because that's better for my health).",

No matter what it is, painting, taking walks, or even collecting stickers, and schedule time for yourself to just unwind and relax. Also, I would recommend finding someone to talk to - even if it\u2019s just for 5 minutes a day. I promise it feels so relieving to just speak to someone and have them listen. Try to make some friends, even if you limit it to short, shallow conversations. You could also reach out to me if you ever need to talk about anything. And finally, reflect on why you push yourself so hard? It obviously doesn\u2019t make you happy. If you need to get a few B\u2019s or even C\u2019s or drop a few classes, for the sake of your mental health, then do so. You don\u2019t want to burn yourself out because that can be really hard to recover from. I used to spend every summer since the 10th grade taking classes, and then once I got into college, I forced myself to take 18-21 units a semester, and ended up so tired and miserable that I completely gave up on everything. I developed really bad habits to cope with how miserable I was,\nthat I am still working on undoing. Make yourself happy first and foremost and worry about everything else later.",
