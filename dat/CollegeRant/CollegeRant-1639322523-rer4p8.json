  "title:": "My group partners for a project won't respond to my texts",
  "text": "We are three people. They always take literal hours to respond to my texts, it's like they're only alive at midnight. Sometimes, I can see that at least one of them saw the text, still no response.  I am so annoyed. What's driving me crazy is that BOTH of them are like this. And then sometimes when they do respond, they ignore half of what I said. How do I get them to respond?\n\nAnd it's like, even if you're busy, it literally takes a few seconds to say 'I'll get back to you'\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind comments. I've been dealing with this for over a month and we're presenting our project tomorrow, so it's too late to change partners or go solo. They did eventually get most of their work done. We're going to meet in person today (if they respond to my texts) and I'll ask them to do the rest of the work during the meeting. The professor also said in the syllabus that we're all going to get the same grade, so I don't think he'll be willing to take back what he put in the syllabus if I told him about what's going on",

      "text": "I always have this happen. No joke, in almost 3 years of school and numerous group projects, I had ONE where more than one person participated.\n\nAfter a few days of no interaction from anyone else (it depends on due dates and when stuff needs to be done, obviously. Sometimes I\u2019d be able to wait a week) I email the professor and let them know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not waiting on y\u2019all and getting a bad grade because you guys are lazy or want to wait until the day of to panic and sort it all out. No thanks. And I\u2019m typically a \u201cday of\u201d or even \u201chour before it\u2019s due\u201d procrastinator, but with group projects IMO it\u2019s just inconsiderate and rude to not communicate. It\u2019s not just your grade.\n\nMore times then not, I\u2019d get zero communication until the day before/day of the project being due. At that point I\u2019d nicely reiterate how many times I tried to contact them, at this point everything is finished, and suggest they reach out to the professor to see what they should do.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, it fucking sucks to be honest and it would always make me anxious as hell. I always would feel like I\u2019m the reason someone is getting a bad grade bc I chose to move on, even though my grade would be affected if I didn\u2019t.",

They shouldn\u2019t be getting the credit if they refuse to do the work, Period, but unfortunately, some profs aren\u2019t like that. Talk to the Prof and see what they say, if and ONLY if you\u2019ve tried everything else and you think it will seriously affect your grade. People can be lazy, expect you to do all the work, but yet put their names on it too, so they can get the same grade as you for nothing.",

      "text": "For a normal team where you actually have the ability to discipline them, the way to handle it is simple. You just give them ownership and put more responsibility on them. However, in a school project where you don\u2019t have this authority, it\u2019s much harder. You really have to try to explain to them why you need them to do things, rather than just telling them to do so. This might work, and even if it does, probably only for a few days. So many students wait until the last minute to do stuff. Best thing you can do is try to push them, making sure to explain the WHY, and keeping your professors in the loop. \n\nLastly\u2026 the majority of students are unorganized and procrastinate, and only put in enough effort to pass. This is normalcy to them. Once you understand that you\u2019re the oddball for trying, it gets a little easier. But most importantly, understand that every time you hold the line on something, you lose a little bit of capital. Make sure that it\u2019s something truly worth holding the line for (IE: if you keep screaming a dogs name over and over, they eventually quit listening to you).",
