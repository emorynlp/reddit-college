  "text": "So I have a trip on Thursday, coming back on Monday. And I feel guilty. I have a few assignments but they\u2019re due in two weeks so I have enough time to catch up when i come back and I due plan on taking my laptop with me anyways. Plus im not missing any classes. But I still have this guilt. Like\u2026I shouldn\u2019t go. Which is shit because I\u2019ve been having a horrible semester and feeling super depressed and now that my trip is almost here\u2026I feel like I don\u2019t deserve it. This happens when im feeling overwhelmed with work, I don\u2019t deserve to take any breaks and instead need to suffer through eveyrhing I have. It sucks. Because then when an opportunity rises for me to calm down and relax all I feel is anxiety. It sucks",

      "text": "This isn\u2019t anxiety about not deserving a break. It\u2019s hidden anxiety about the prospect of having to return to a bunch of work after your trip. You have two options, of which I recommend the first. \n\n1.\tGet ahead on the work\u2014just a little. Outline if it\u2019s a paper, do those first few lab questions, or simply cobble some notes together. You want to complete whatever the first step or two of the assignment would have been upon your return. This will assure you that you\u2019re prepared and that you need not worry about being overwhelmed when the vacation ends. \n2.\tLearn to accept that you\u2019ve earned a vacation and that the work will get done when it gets done.",

          "text": "So the assignment I have is to create a podcast and interview someone for the podcast. The whole episode has to 5 minutes. I\u2019ve already got someone to interview. The biggest thing for me is that we are using Adobe audition which is new to a lot of people in the class. I do plan to just play around and figure out the basics during my trip when I have off time plus figure out a name for the podcast, introduction. I guess the basics so when I come back it\u2019s just do the interview and edit.",

Even if you have to cram when you get back (which it seems you won't have to), it would be worth it to create those memories. \n\nLife is short. Let go and go have fun for a while",
