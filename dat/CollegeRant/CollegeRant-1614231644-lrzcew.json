  "text": "This is just the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard of and felt the need to share. \n\nI can\u2019t even remember the last time we did *actual* drills like this, as adult college students. Do they really expect us to get on webcam... and do what? Hide under our desks at home? Evacuate to our front yards? Lmao f*** off. \n\nTLDR: College is the worst, most demeaning, patronizing experience ever.",

Most of those states haven't updated those laws to say \"nevermind, not if you're virtual.\" Colleges need to comply with the law to avoid getting in trouble with the state, even if complying is stupid. Your issue is with the state, not the college.",
