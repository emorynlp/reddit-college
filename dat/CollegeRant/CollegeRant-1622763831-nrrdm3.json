  "title:": "is college depressing or is this just covid???",
  "text": "for context, i went to precollege summer programs at one university for six years and another university after my junior year of high school. i was SO excited for college when i was in high school because those precollege programs were SO fun and gave me the best community and i met my best friends there. now that i\u2019m in college, i just,,,, don\u2019t get the same happy vibes??? but the friends i met at those precollege programs are literally thriving and idk what\u2019s wrong with me but i\u2019m so attached to the memories i made there and college just isn\u2019t living up to how happy i was then. like it sucked that i couldn\u2019t get the full dorm/dining hall experience (my dorms shut down early) and my classes weren\u2019t in person but now i\u2019m just wondering if i put myself in this position by expecting college to be as great as what i experienced growing up. i recently applied to transfer and got into the school i spent six summers in but my gut feeling is that transferring isn\u2019t the solution here. idk i just wanted to rant about this somewhere and see if anyone else had this experience because my sister had an amazing college experience and i just have not been feeling it. i\u2019m also home for the summer and aggressively depressed bc i have no friends at home so it\u2019s just been a month so far of me doing absolutely nothing lol and i\u2019m questioning everything ab my life.\n\nedit: i don\u2019t think i will be accepting the transfer acceptance because i don\u2019t think it will solve my problems and my current school is better for my academic goals/major (current school is top 4, transfer school is ranked as about 13 for my major and has less opportunities)",

      "text": "College in my experience is pretty depressing, I mean I don't even care for the friends or \"college experience\", I just want to get my degree and go make money. I have a few friends and whatnot, but it's just like high school 2.0 all over again. I think covid and zoom classes have only exacerbated the effects of it to a whole new level. I spoke to many of my peers and they all said similar things, they wanted to drop out, leave, never do it again, many were hopeless. While many people just look to the short term, I think long term it is going to stick around. This is going to be an experience that our generation will never forget and will always hold to a personal level. I am very curious to see the dropout or \"year skippers\" numbers, I want to know how badly this affected students across the globe.",

      "text": "It\u2019s both. I started college in 2018 and got a year and a half of actually university. Before that I spent my senior year of high school in community college - not a high school/cc program, I just went to community college on my own in my own time. As covid restrictions lift you\u2019ll see what you expected come to be but you also have to realize college isn\u2019t a pr\u00e9 college program. I went to one of those too, mine was at UC Berkeley. I too loved and adored it and the friends I made. Real college is harder socially, you have to go out and find your people and sometimes that takes a while. I hope your transfer helps and I hope you don\u2019t get discouraged if it takes a while to find your group. I\u2019m a senior now and it took me until my junior year to find my group\u2026and I don\u2019t even like all of them all that much, but they\u2019re my people.",

          "text": "thank you for responding <3 having an absolute mental breakdown about this right now so it\u2019s nice to hear from others hahah. i guess i need to wake up and realize those precollege programs weren\u2019t as realistic as i hoped. i miss sitting in the lawns of prestigious schools with my friends and organized field trips to the city and running around college towns and libraries like i knew what i was doing there lol. i hope once covid restrictions relax i\u2019ll be able to find my people and form a group for myself \u2014 i go to a prestigious public school and it\u2019s pretty big and with covid it\u2019s just been really hard mentally to assimilate. i went to my precollege program at northwestern, and although the campus brings back great memories, i don\u2019t think my problems will be solved by transferring so i don\u2019t think i should give up my current school and risk feeling even more defeated. thank you for sharing your experience and letting me rant, it\u2019s been a tough time and feels good to let it out:)",

              "text": "Of course and while no one is going to be organizing field trips for you or putting you together with people so you\u2019ll form friendships here\u2019s what you do have: you now belong in those libraries. You grew up and earned your spot on those lawns and the ability to lay on them any time you want. Those lab classes and lecture halls might feel duller but don\u2019t let them, they won\u2019t look the same now but they hold so much more opportunity than they ever did before. \n\nAnd where will you find your friends? Well I couldn\u2019t afford to go to the really good public school I wanted to go to (I study Agribusiness, my first choice was UIUC) so I went to a large public school closer to home (OSU) that I liked visiting better than the other good option nearby (Texas A&M) and offered me lots of scholarship so I could graduate debt free (that part I don\u2019t regret). Since my current school isn\u2019t at the same level as where I wanted to go, I\u2019m in the honors college. Not only that but I\u2019m actually on the board working to expand our program offerings and I serve with one student from each other college. I lived in the honors dorm my first year too so when I rushed I rushed with those girls and when I went to my honors sections I saw the people from my residence hall. That\u2019s where I met my best friend of three years and so many more friends who have come and gone from my life. Going greek helped too. I met my roommate there, two ex boyfriends, and more friends who have come and gone as well as life long ones. I\u2019m also in an econ club that has connected me with people and a religious one that gives me a community. Joining social clubs and groups helps you find who your people are (and aren\u2019t). I have full confidence in you and know you\u2019ll find more friends and real connections this year, it may just take a while.",
