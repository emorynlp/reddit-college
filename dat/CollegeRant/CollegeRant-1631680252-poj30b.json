  "text": "Hey guys, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety throughout the school years. I've tried talking to a school professional and it wasn't a good experience and that made me hesitate to try again. I've been really down for the pass two three years but I have to keep up a front because I feel that I have to be strong to comfort and support others around me. Because of this I have pushed aside my own feelings like they don't exist, but I know they're still there because of my constant mood swings or that I take things really personally at times. Through all this though, I still have to put on a smile and pretend I'm happy or that nothing is wrong just so I don't bring other people down with me \n \nEntering my third year of school with post-bach plans creeping around the corner brings up all these feelings again and I come to face the fact that I don't really have someone to talk to about them. Sometimes (more often recently) I contemplate if it's just worth it at all.\n\nim a junior stem major. My original post Bach plan is to go on to med school, but now I'm not so sure. I don't feel like I'm cut out for med school and I don't feel adequately prepared to do anything else. I feel a constant lost of direction now that my original plans are not what I thought they would be",
