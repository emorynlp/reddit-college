  "title:": "ENOUGH WITH THE FUCKING PRESENTATIONS",
  "text": "Seriously, I've been doing this fucking shit since middle school and it hasn't gotten any easier for me. It feels like fucking torture at this point. I can barely talk to most people I don't really know without my body and voice shaking, so I always feel like shit afterwards, especially when I know I didn't do a good job. I'm sick of making a fucking fool out of myself in front of so many people, when I know for fucking sure that I'm actually good at other things that aren't at all relevant to the class.\n\nFfs, how about professors actually teach the fucking material instead of making students do it for them? Why don't they fucking understand that some people just aren't extroverted???\n\nI was in a group of 4 for this presentation and 2 people couldn't be there for understandable reasons. However, my prof decided 2 of us should still present the whole thing, even though half the information was shit I knew nothing about because I wasn't the one who added it!",

If it\u2019s to the point you get debilitating anxiety before them (because many people get anxiety before a presentation and work through it fine), then go see a therapist. Blaming your teachers and professors for training(or attempting to train) you in a critical workplace, educational and social skill is wrong.",
