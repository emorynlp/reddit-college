  "text": "Nice living on campus but when there\u2019s a shared community bathroom, there\u2019s a chance of the showers still having hairs from the previous users. Can we have some decency for fuck\u2019s sake? Do not put your hairs on the shower walls, it\u2019s just gross. Just rinse it off, it\u2019s not that hard. Honestly I feel sorry for the cleaners that have to clean up the hairs off the wall. It\u2019s already hard and gross enough during the pandemic\u2026\n\nTL;DR Please make sure you leave the showers clean for the next person to use it.",

He\u2019d always leave some puke laying on the side of the toilet for others to find. His excuse? He felt \u201ctoo ill\u201d to flush a toilet \ud83d\ude11",
