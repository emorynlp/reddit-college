  "text": "I transferred into my first choice college this semester and I\u2019m honestly starting to hate it. My friends aren\u2019t great (they\u2019re smart but boring) and hanging out with them makes me feel very lonely. I\u2019ve joined multiple clubs and people just don\u2019t reach out to me even when I have to them. I don\u2019t feel like I fit in, and I only see my \u201cfriends\u201d once or twice a week. My one closest friend here who is pretty good isn\u2019t reliable and can take a day to reply to texts.\n\nI\u2019m so lonely and bored here, I had a much better time at my previous (but with few opportunities and a poor quality of education) school. I\u2019m not big on partying or anything like that, I just want friends that will maintain a conversation that isn\u2019t small talk and that do fun things on occasion.  The academics, opportunities, and professors here are great though. This is what I wanted but I\u2019m not enjoying it.\n\nMy poor social situation has left me so unmotivated and distracted. I tried studying for my finals but have just given up.\n\nTLDR: Transferred into my dream college but my friends suck and I\u2019m the loneliest I\u2019ve been in years. No motivation to study due to feeling disillusioned and lonely.",
