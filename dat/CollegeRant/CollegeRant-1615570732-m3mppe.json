  "text": "I have never felt so unmotivated in my life. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong me. I\u2019m behind in every class and then I study it last minute. I even missed a homework assignment that\u2019s like 10% of my grade because I didn\u2019t go to class. I\u2019m becoming who I didn\u2019t want to be. I just feel so tired and I can\u2019t focus and I feel like I\u2019m not learning and I don\u2019t know how to get back on track.",

      "text": "I just want to tell you- you are not alone. It seems like most of us on the college/ (probably high school students also) reddits are feeling this way. Most of us are vitrual and things arent the same. We are over exhausted and burnt out. \n\nFor me, I personally relate to you. I feel like I havent stoop so low adademic wise. Im failing 2 and more classes. one class is beyond challenging on average half a class fails. Most of these classes I need to pass. The other is just too much work to keep up with. I cant drop anymore classes. My Movivation has gone out the window. Its sad because I dont care anymore. its a bad feeling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP we are going to get through this. Keep the faith and talk to the school counselling center, mental health comes first. Its hard trust me.",

      "text": "Hey, it sometimes happens and don\u2019t worry it\u2019s okay. If you feel like you feel like this all the time and unhappy in general, then I suggest you talk to someone about it. My biggest tip would be to figure out what you want to do in life or like a purpose. And I say this because if you want to get somewhere and do what you want then you have to work for it. If you don\u2019t know what you want to do, then maybe figure out what\u2019s your end goal like helping others etc. But honestly don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, enjoy your life, and balance. Take it step by step, make time for what\u2019s important and for what\u2019s mentally good for you. I hope this helps! Take it step by step :)",

      "text": "hey babe! I definitely feel you. It\u2019s really hard to be a college student rn. \n\nIs there any possibility for you to take a break in some way? Maybe go home to your family if that\u2019s good for you, or take some kind of medical leave? I know lots of my classmates have taken leaves from school bc of the pandemic and what it\u2019s doing to their mental health. And, in addition, it might be a good idea to look into therapy, if that\u2019s an option for you (that you\u2019re not already using). Many colleges have counseling services and therapy can help you develop ways to cope.\n\nIf that\u2019s not possible, then I would suggest finding  little ways to alleviate stress, ie, taking walks, spending time with friends, chatting with family, etc. And, most importantly, remember that at the end of the day, this is just a blip. How much do your classes rn really matter in the grand scheme of things? Try to find ways to put things into perspective, and that\u2019ll help some.\n\nI wish you the best and good luck! \ud83d\udc95",
