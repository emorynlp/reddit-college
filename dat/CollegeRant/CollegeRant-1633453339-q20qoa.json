The professor taught like the entire class was going to college to be a math teacher when in reality none of them were. \n\nWe can see the highest and lowest test grade after all grades are entered, as well as the average. On every test, the average was less than 50. \n\nWhen the class started, there was 31 students. It ended with 9. I don\u2019t know how many of them passed.",

              "text": "I recently had a similar problem in my physics class. Our quizzes were worth 40% of our grade and the only other assignments we have are homework which barely does anything to the grade and our labs. I did good on all the labs so far but I ended up missing one quiz (it\u2019s an online class and I missed it because of a family emergency) and that brought my grade down to a 54 when it was an 89, I\u2019ve done good on all the homework and labs (which can be difficult) but they barely bring my grade up at all so I basically have to rely on doing very well on most of the quizzes to make up for the one I missed and bring my grade up. I feel like assignments need to be weighed better it just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to me. Why have other assignments like labs when they don\u2019t really help your grade out.",

I'd be more inclined to blame institutions which have been increasingly lax about standards than the students and teachers who are merely going through the motions.",
