  "text": "So as of now I\u2019m in my \u201csenior\u201dyear of college .But since of covid and personal issues my grades have dipped and as of now it is a do or die situation. Where I need to pass all my classes to stay and graduate. If not I\u2019m kicked out from school. If I do not pass this semester I\u2019ll be kicked out from school and I\u2019ll be at home. Being at home is fine and all but I am more concerned about finding a job if I do fail out how am I going to get a degree to sustain myself and not be a complete disappointment to my family?\ud83d\ude2d",
