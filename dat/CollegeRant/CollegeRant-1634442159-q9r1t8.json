  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm writing this on a Saturday night in my college dorm room. I don't know where to post this but I really need to get this off my chest. I'm a junior transfer student, and I've been here since sophomore year which was unfortunately completely virtual. I have no friends here at all, and I'm 3 hours away from my family. I only have 2 (very close) friends that I am grateful for from back home and much like me we never go out. We would always talk on discord being that we saw each other in high school everyday. As a junior in college now I really want to go out and meet people. I find myself always making small talk, but I always end up alone. I really try to make conversation and I'm never invited to anything. My parents ask me how things are going and if I've made friends and it really hurts to tell them I didn't really make any friends yet. It hurts to see people laughing together, to see people having conversations while I'm eating alone, to see two people holding hands in front of me while I'm walking. I just want someone to talk to as pathetic as that sounds, nevermind having someone to love. \n\nI try to keep positive everyday and be the best version of myself but it's really hard. I make sure I do well in my classes, and I workout six days a week. I'm 6 foot 6 and decent looking, and can't remember a time where I had a real conversation with a woman. I get spurts of motivation that push me to get up early every morning and hit the gym, or go for a run at night. Sometimes when I'm walking on campus a cute girl smiles at me and just that could make my day, just being noticed. The answer seems simple, find people to hang out with on campus, but it's so hard for me. I can never get past small talk and make many acquaintances and no friends.\n\nI have confidence in myself and I know I deserve to have people to count on and someone to love me. I want to be counted on too. I'm the guy that holds the door open for you, and who you forget about after that. The thought of graduating college without ever being invited to a party, having made good memories with friends, and still being a virgin just chips away at my confidence and I'm reminded of this whenever I see people having fun together. It just makes me feel like a loser. People in my family always say college is the best years of your life and you'll make so many lasting memories and it's really depressing given my situation. \n\nI could write so much more but I'm forcing myself to end it here. Thank you to everyone who actually read this far.",

      "text": "If you are athletic and all, maybe join a club sport. Rugby is tough, but I know many people on the rugby team who have developed very close friendships because of the sport. Since it's an uncommon sport, any experience level is usually welcome. Usually really chill guys are on there. Also, maybe go check out your local rock climbing gym if you can. Super chill people there too. Improv can sometimes be an accepting group of people.  \n\n\nfor talking to girls, just try not to have any expectations. Ask them what they think of the college. Personally, whenever someone gives me the opportunity to complain about my school, it usually turns into a long conversation because I just rant lol. Also, I am always too afraid to talk to tall guys haha. Also, I've been rejected by guys which stings and so I drop pretty obvious hints, but I always have guys make the first move. \n\nIf you see someone alone at the dining hall, not studying, then just ask \"hey is it cool if I join you?\" I have done this a lot, you will get turned away sometimes, but other times I've ended up having great conversations.   \n\n\nAlso, being a virgin is definitely ok and not the biggest deal. You will eventually have sex and when you do you will likely think \"oh that was it, what was I worried about\". I know at least 5 women off the top of my head who are virgins, so *you are not alone*. Women have a really hard time with virginity too because men don't like when women get clingy after the 1st time (which definitely happens). If you end up talking to a woman and you want to move things to a different level, then invite her to watch a movie at your place. She will likely understand what that is hinting at. Just offer her a beer when she gets there or something.   \n\n\nYou are not alone. It will feel more comfortable with more social experience. Don't be too hard on yourself. You can make a small gradual change now like trying one new social event per week like shabbat dinner, then eventually you will have friends and look back and see that you came a long way from now. It takes a while, but have patience and reflection and you'll be good.",

      "text": "same here. i\u2019m a sophomore right now and i don\u2019t know anyone at all. i just transferred to a new school this semester and i\u2019m in my own apartment for the first time. i like living alone, a lot actually, but i don\u2019t know what to do outside of my apartment. the people in my classes seem pretty nice, but i\u2019m terrible at making new friends on my own. also, the dominant political/religious leanings of my school are quite HEAVILY against my own, so it makes it that much harder to really connect with people. i don\u2019t have anyone\u2019s phone number or contacts at all and i feel like i\u2019m wasting my college life on being a shut in, making music, art, watching movies, or playing games that never produce any sort of real value that lasts. i\u2019ve never understood how people get connected and are just naturally social, it doesn\u2019t work out that way for me. \n\ni\u2019ll also cut myself off right here. i feel your pain. we\u2019ll figure something out.",

          "text": "More specific to your situation, but (I assume your school is christian-y) maybe you should see if your school has a weekly shabbat dinner. It's a jewish sabbath, but anyone is invited. You can't be on your phones and you say a hebrew prayer before eating, but that is pretty much how religious it gets (sometimes there is handwashing if you go to the intense denomination). It is usually way better food than the dining hall and you can find other people who are not christian and who are at shabbat more as a cultural community thing than as a religious service. usually happens once a week on fridays, then you can ask other people at your table what they are doing the rest of the night and you can ask \"is it cool if I join?\" some people don't think that you want an invitation until you ask for one. you can probably get their contact info at the very least. I met some amazing people at shabbat.",
