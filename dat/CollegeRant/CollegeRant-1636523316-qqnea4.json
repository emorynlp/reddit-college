  "title:": "A moment of social awkwardness with group mate",
  "text": "He was telling my a story about how when he was talking to another groupmate while working on a project.\n\nHe asked her casually that we should all get together after the semester is over and celebrate (he was just brainstorming he wasn\u2019t committed to that) and she said that now that she doesn\u2019t have a bf she might actually have the free time to do that.\n\nSo he asks casually if she wanted to see a movie sometime, and she claimed she didn\u2019t want a bf. He said that that wasn\u2019t how he meant it.\n\n\u201cWhat wrong with people?\u201d He says.\n\nI was a bit nervous at this point. This guy is more social than\u2026 literally everyone else in the class. Or at least in our group. So I can see how he thinks that way but\u2026 I can kinda relate to groupmate 2.\n\nThat\u2019s just cause I\u2019m introverted though, and am fine with my small circle of friends.\n\nI also think it might be an age difference thing? Everyone else is in their early 20s and he\u2019s in his early 30s. Oh I was also nervous cause I knew he was going to ask me out to the movies too. And based on his previous story I expect this conversation to veer into awkward territory. I don\u2019t wanna do social things once the semester is over. I wanna fuckin fuck off.\n\nI knew he was also going to ask the dreaded question \u201cwhy?\u201d. God its the worst. So instead of answering his request to go \u201cwatch a movie or go bowling\u201d was to first complain about how I hate sports.\n\nI then asked if there were even any good movies coming out? He didn\u2019t know. But you see, what I did was show a negative response to his request. It\u2019s a subtle way of saying \u201cno\u201d, without being a complete asshole, while also avoiding the dreaded. \u201c\u2026BUT WHY?\u201d.\n\nI know I\u2019m overthinking, that\u2019s what I do. But goddamnit that\u2019s what this subreddit is about!",
