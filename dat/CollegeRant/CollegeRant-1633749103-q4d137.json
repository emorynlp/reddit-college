  "text": "Fuck all of this! I have a 96% in the class, I studied for 2 days straight, I have never felt more prepared for an assignment in this class, but I don\u2019t think I did well. \n\nI hate this so much. There was stuff on the exam that we haven\u2019t even gone over. But the worst part is that the professor made basically every question a trick question. What\u2019s with making questions harder than they have to be? Why purposely ask vague questions hoping that we fail? What the fuck?? I thought the point of an exam was to prove you know material? But I guess now it\u2019s all about trying to decipher what the question even means. \n\nAnd the grades won\u2019t post for weeks cause he never grades anything quickly. Fuck me.",

      "text": "What kinds of questions were asked that made them trick questions? I only ask because sometimes, exam questions will test how well you understand a concept (ie, through application/examples or extrapolation of material) as opposed to testing just pure rote memorization, and students sometimes get frustrated with that approach and view those as trick questions.",
