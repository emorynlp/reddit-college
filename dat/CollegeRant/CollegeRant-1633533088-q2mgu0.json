  "text": "So i study a healthcare course at college (remote learning) and we got put into groups just for a short time to discuss a question in our module and i ofc was grouped with a bunch of 16-17 year olds. I spoke on the chat and said \"so what are everyone's thoughts on the question\". To which one of them told me to shut up then started joking around with another one and i was like \"hello?\" And he replied \"goodbye\" I was like \"right are we actually going to do this work or we just gonna act like children?\". Then goes \"obviously going to act like children what else do you expect?\" I was like \"well considering this is college and not the playground actually expect people to participate in what we've been asked to do\" then just as me and another girl started discussing it we got put back to the main chat room. I spoke to the lecturer at the end of class as did one of the other guys in the group and we told her what happened she said that \"she'll keep an eye on future groups and that if she sees people acting like that she can kick them out the class and their money will be affected.\" \n\nBut that's my rant anyway. College is a huge priority and i really cannot be bothered with people like that affecting my learning.",

      "text": "Don't deal with it. There's a certain level of maturity required for college and they're still growing up. \n\n\nEven if you were going to college at 30, you'll notice immaturity with younger students who have only had high school as \"life experience\". \n\n\nOur professor told us when we started groups that if anyone is blatantly not pulling their weight to let her know. It wouldn't effect our work or grade but only theirs even if their portion is critical to the overall product. \n\n\nNot a fan of group projects either",

          "text": "But it is definitely possible to be in college at 16 and to not act like that (not saying you implied otherwise it\u2019s just on the same topic as your comment). I\u2019m 16 as a freshman now and I\u2019ve never done anything like that myself, no had such an experience with anyone else. I actually can\u2019t believe kids in college would act that way, even in my junior and senior year of high school people didn\u2019t act that way. This feels like 13-14 yr old energy to me (then again maybe I just think that because I\u2019m younger haha).",
