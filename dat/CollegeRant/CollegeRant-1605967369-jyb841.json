  "text": "uhm hello all,\n\ni don't know how to start this post. i have been thinking too much, especially for past 2 weeks and i literally feel heavy so i wanted to share everything occupying my mind in somewhere and that's why i joined reddit in the first place.  i hope the weight on my chest will be lifted a little when by the time post this, anyways.\n\ni was a good high school student. i graduated with 3.98 CGPA as a high honour and ranked 2nd among more than 150 students. my biggest strength in high school was that i knew myself, my interests, the subjects that made me feel excited. i was not a student who is good at everything, i was just studying enough to get a good grade if it's not something i was interested in but if it's a math/science course, i study more than that. i literally loved to learn more from what thought in those courses, even if it's out of the scope or advanced for a high school student.\n\nafter that, i took the college applications test (something like SAT but different in my country) and i was in the top 1%. i looked at different majors i could enroll and the one that intrigues me the most is the electrical&electronics engineering and i ended up applying for it. i am now a student from the best college in my country regarding this field.\n\nhowever, everything has changed since then. it doesn't matter how much i study, i always ended up getting Cs and Bs, i am now a 2nd-year student and have 2.72 CGPA, which i expect to go down to 2.60 at the end of the semester.  i knew that college is a tough place and i knew that the people in this college are the most successful students in my country so i kept warning myself that i shouldn't be too confident just by looking at my high school results but, 2.72 i mean... seriously?? ofc, 2.72 might be fine for someone but it was definitely not something i expected from myself.\n\nand that's the point i breakthrough and lost all faith in myself.\n\nas a person who lost their grandfather to cancer and spend a great amount of her life in hospitals, i have always dreamt about working in a medical field, especially diseases related to the heart and lungs. i mean not to cure them but maybe design more accessible and safer systems for people. i have always wanted to be someone who makes people say \"i am grateful that she was born\",  be an inspiration for someone. i wanted to bring people health and happiness.\n\nnow looking at all of those, it seems too far away, out of reach. i started to believe that i am incapable of doing such big things. i really enjoy studying at this department but with 2.72 GPA... it's too low for myself and for my dreams. i mean i don't believe that high GPA directly correlates with success but i do think that GPA demonstrates hard work and dedication of an individual together with the understanding of a certain topic and i clearly failed myself.\n\nlooking at all the people i admire, they all did exceptionally well academically at some point in their lives. this makes me feel that it's too late for me to take action.\n\ni don't know what to do and i have been crying for past 2 weeks. changing majors is not even an option for me. i cannot imagine myself in another major because i love and enjoy ee engineering very much.\n\nfor past weeks, self-doubt has been eating me alive. i lost all of my confidence and dedication and i don't know what to do. i am hopeless.\n\n**tl:dr;** my grades are too low that i failed my own expectations. now i feel like my dreams are one size bigger for me.\n\nso if you have any suggestions or opinions, i would appreciate if you share it with me. i am not expecting a pep-talk or something like that. i just want your honest and sincere thoughts. if you just want to share your story, i would be happy to hear that as well.",

      "text": "Dear OP,\n\nI can understand what your going through. I was in your position last year. I graduated at the top of my class in high school, aced my pre-university foundation studies. Currently I am pursuing Chemical Engineering in a top university in my country. I loved chem and phy during high school and that the main reason why. I performed really badly in my 2nd year and so my grades plummeted ever since. I currently have a 2.85 CGPA and this has been hindering me from applying to internships I have dreamt of. Most of my friend I admired all are top scoring students, got into dean's list and all (top 1%) and they are extremely all-rounded with multiple leadership positions and extra-curricular activities meanwhile all I do is study and well look at my grades. This has caused my mental health to deteriorate and I had to get counselling every now and then.\n\nConsidering that we are under quarantine rn, I have decided to completely focus and direct all my efforts and energy to my studies. Never went out of the house for 2-3 months at a time. Very seriously, no social media (except reddit), minimal time spent on YouTube and absolutely no NETFLIX AT ALL. I am well aware that I will be doing this semester all alone (I live at home, not in a uni dorm). I know that I am below average in my course and this year I decided to do things I would never do. Don't worry, my mental health is still in check :)\n\n1) Started blasting email to my lecturers/tutors whenever I do not understand something. \n\n2)Even during Zoom classes, I was the only one who had the guts to unmute the mic and directly ask questions because I wanted to learn and I didn't care what anybody thinks of me. I would schedule private consultation sessions with the lecturer just to clarify any doubts I had. \n\n3) MADE SURE I finished studying each week's topic by the week itself, no procrastinating or dragging lessons in to the next week. Completely get rid of the thought \"Oh, I will study this before the exams, its not really important now\" BS, do it now. Engineering is a brutal degree course, never never procrastinate.\n\n4) Write out your own notes during recorded lecture lessons. Do not rely on pdf/PP slides only. There's something about writing your own notes that makes studying more effectively for me.\n\n5) When doing tutorial, do not refer to the solutions first. Attempt it on your own! Only then you will realize your level of understanding, and after learning your mistakes you can refer to the solutions. Ask the tutor to explain if you don't understand anything\n\nSo far these tactics have been working for me, I PRAY TO ALL GODs that by CGPA/GPA will improve this year. Remember CGPA is more than just a number, its dedication, hard work, level of understanding, ability to apply a complex concept to solve engineering problems and most importantly confidence in your ability. \n\nPlease fell free to start a chat with me if you need someone to talk to",

      "text": "Please don't give up on your dreams.  Your GPA and your academic record aren't everything that you are.  I've got one hell of a rollercoaster ride on my transcript from undergrad, including semesters where the only thing I passed was one class and that was a pity C.  It took me 3 tries to pass Orgo II.  There were multiple people who told me to not even consider grad school.  I went through that period where I lost faith in myself completely too because of all of that, but I had my passion, my love of biology, and ungodly stubbornness that made me keep going and in the end, I pushed and applied to grad schools anyway.  I'm sitting here typing this as a 1st semester PhD student at an R1 university.\n\nYou say that no matter how much you study, you're still having problems.  Maybe that's more indicative of needing to find a new approach to studying.  I went through hell figuring out what type of learning worked best for me, maybe you need to experiment some and try different ways to work through things, including some unconventional ones.  (If at the beginning someone told me that I would be writing out all of my diagrams and notes on dark paper with light pens, I'd have laughed, but it worked)  You obviously have passion and determination, I can tell from your writing.  Remember that your GPA absolutely does NOT define your worth.",

      "text": "If u ask me what is the valuable lesson that I learned from college, it's that talent or brain alone won't make you get through it. Let alone highschool grade. IMO and from my experience, it's more about discipline, hard work, diligence, grit, and more than that is friendship. They'll help you, give you support, and if you have any problems you could talk to them. \n\n\nAnd for bad gpa, I also had the same experience, except its much more lower. But since I'm not as good as you in term of highschool grade or grade of uni (not the best in the country, but still top 10), so I think we have the same experience. After some contemplation, I was thinking, if my life is just a straight line to the top, then how can I inspire other people?\nHaving a bad gpa just means you are a human. Nothing less.",

      "text": "10th grade - 9.8 cgpa\n\n12th grade - 92%\n\n*College*\n\n1st semester - 7.24\n\n2nd semester - 6.24\n\n3rd semester - 7.91\n\n4th semester - 7.13\n\n5th semester - 6.62\n\n6th semester - 7.91\n\nAggregate - 7.19\n\nI think you can see how much of a roller-coaster ride college has been for me. I am currently pursuing my BTech in MechE from a college whose MechE program is considered to be one of the best in Asia. I was *depressed* to the point that I wanted to drop engineering altogether and do photography (brought this up in front of my parents as well and got a typical Asian parents' reaction lol - why I didn't drop out ultimately is a story for another time). And though I can't blame everything on how shitty some of my profs are, how bad the labs are or how sometimes things were just not in my hands, ik that I didn't perform well because I don't HAVE it in me.\n\nBecause I know I do. \n\nI just landed a decent *coding* job, got a killer score in my GRE (332), have 5 research papers lined up to be published in the next 6 months or so and will prolly pursue a PhD later on. \n\nBelieve in yourself. Go through the course material thoroughly, talk to your mentors/professors and discuss material with your friends.\n\nYou might have to put in an extra bit of effort to bump up your GPA, but try to sail over the minimum requirements first, atleast - whatever minimum you need to sit for placements, apply for Master's etc. And do projects; loads of them. I forayed into research in my 5th semester and have never looked back. Doing projects/research helped me to understand which concentration of MechE I was more interested in, and being fluent in the concepts of that concentration helped me to understand the other sub fields better as well. A lot of these things are interconnected and if you become well-versed in a particular concentration, you will have two major advantages -\n\n1. You'll get out of your rut of not being good/productive enough, and\n\n2. You'll have a better grasp over your other subjects (also because I think you will be able to choose your electives 3rd year onwards)\n\nDon't lose hope! You've got this! Good luck \ud83c\udf40",

          "text": "This happens to a lot of people and I think what bites them is that they don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen so they slack or maybe they underestimate college. \n\n\nI did well throughout grade school, won awards, etc. but my last two years of college are killing me and that\u2019s no exaggeration. I never felt like I needed to try so when I didn\u2019t immediately understand things I became frustrated and hit walls. I\u2019m a science major so that just adds to the drama. I wanted to be a doctor as well but I\u2019m done. I\u2019m graduating and working as a microbiologist. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, it happens and you may be feeling worse because your comparing yourself to others or expecting way too much of yourself. If you still want to go into the medical field there are so many options. I didn\u2019t read your whole post but when I really wanted it I was willing to even go to the caribbean for med school. I\u2019m just tired and don\u2019t care enough anymore.",
