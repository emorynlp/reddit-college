  "text": "Im honestly tired of crying my eyes out every night. I\u2019m so stressed, i have been working non stopppppp! I\u2019m not failing any classes but in my math class I\u2019ve been trying and trying and trying so hard. I\u2019ve been pulling all nighters just to study but literally I\u2019ve been doing worst :( IT SUCKS WHEN YOU GIVE IT YOUR ALL AND YOU END UP DOING WORSE THAN WHEN YOU WERENT GIVING IT YOUR ALL!!! I literally can say that out of this semester I have not even had a chance to just take a break and breathe. Online school has messed me up so bad. I don\u2019t even wanna become a doctor any more because I\u2019m just tooooo stressed at this point. To many, this class is like an easy A and literally to me it\u2019s just soooo hard. Algebra sucks, I feel like precalc and calc is easier than algebra :( Ik I\u2019m dumb so please don\u2019t mention it, I already hate my self.",

      "text": "I'm in the environmental sciences. I 10000% agree that calc is easier than algebra - i'd go as far as to say it's also easier than precalc. I dunno, each brain is different. Don't let the current global situation lead yourself to feel like you're inferior where you otherwise might excel. \n\nLiterally my lowest grade of my entire academic career was in algebra & precalc. If your heart wants you to be a doctor, then it's worth persevering. Especially with COVID & such, graduate schools will be much more tolerant of GPA declines than they have ever been before. Absolutely zero people are able to say what your odds of becoming a doctor are at this point. The modern world has simply never gone through so much unilateral turmoil before, so my advice would be to just keep doing what you must to reach your passions.",

You\u2019re not dumb, I feel like math is another language that sometimes isn\u2019t taught as well. Many people have been struggling with school especially with covid around, you\u2019re not alone. Maybe you gotta change the way you do things, change the way you handle your time and try and get homework/studying help. Does your school have tutoring? Consider using Chegg or khan academy too",

      "text": "I feel you. This semester has been rough. Would it be possible for you to take a semester off to work and see if this is what you really want to do? Being a doctor is a huge commitment and you don't want to regret anything. Also there are so many jobs in the medical field that are equally fulfilling. If you can't take the semester off just try to hang in there to the end of the semester. Hangout with friends & family or take some time for yourself. Going into STEM is rough on most people so don't beat yourself up.",

I\u2019m only saying I\u2019m unsure is because I\u2019m taking these classes and trying so hard and not getting the best results not knowing if I\u2019m not even going to be accepted :( sometimes i sit and think: \u201cwhy am I forcing my self to do so well if it\u2019s not even guaranteed\u201d I\u2019m more or so worried that I won\u2019t make it. I\u2019ve had some experiences in the medical field in other positions but everything that I do will always revolve around my passion of one day becoming a physician. If I don\u2019t make it in the states, Caribbean is the way to go !!!!!",

I truly feel your frustration especially when it comes to courses where it\u2019s already difficult and you try a different study approach but still end up with the same results or grade for assignments and quizzes. The only time I\u2019m able to get a breath this semester is when I get my wisdom teeth taken out next week lol. Bottom line is I understood pain and you\u2019re not alone in this (I know it sounds clich\u00e9) I hope it gets a little easier and if not, that this all pays off in the end.",
