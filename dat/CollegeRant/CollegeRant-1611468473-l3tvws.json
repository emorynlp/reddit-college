  "title:": "Wished that the classes with optional Zoom meetings listed the time and date of the lectures before registering",
  "text": "So in my school, there\u2019s two different types of online classes, one is labeled as \u201cCanvas\u201d which lists a time and date of meetings, and then there\u2019s \u201cOnline\u201d, which is asynchronous. I have two classes labeled as \u201cOnline\u201d, however, I just found out they have optional Zoom meetings and one of them almost overlaps with a \u201cCanvas\u201d class. I understand that the Zoom meetings are optional for the \u201cOnline\u201d classes, but I wished that it was labeled as \u201cCanvas\u201d instead before I registered. I get that it\u2019s not a big deal, who cares if I leave 5-10 minutes early or don\u2019t even bother attending that class, but it\u2019s nice to know this information beforehand, ya know :/ \n\nAnd just for clarification: The \u201cOnline\u201d class ends at the exact same time as a \u201cCanvas\u201d class will start, which is at 12:15 PM\n\n\nTL;DR: Wish that the classes with Zoom meetings, optional or not, listed the time and dates of lectures when registering",
