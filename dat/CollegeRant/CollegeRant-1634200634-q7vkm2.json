  "text": "I have a couple classes where discussion posts are graded and mandatory.  This includes writing an original post and replying to others.  Here\u2019s an example of some low-effort shit:\n\n>Reading this short article, I don't think nothing will change, until 10 years later. Because in the article, it has 4 points that states, accelerate the phase-out of coal, curtail deforestation, speed up the switch to electric vehicles, and encourage investment in renewables. Well, if we were to speed up the switch to electric vehicles, you can't just speed up the switch, because if you rush into it, it could go wrong. However, this article also indicates that we need to work together to enable and encourage countries affected by climate change, how are we suppose to encourage other countries? As of right now, I don't think nothing will happen or change, unless these topics become a headline on the news everyday and get other peoples attention. \n   \nIn another class, I get this bit of word salad:\n\n> \"No state consent can be deprived of equal suffrage in the Senate.\" All the states have equal say when it comes to change their natural right. I think the amendment of the constitution was to be changed, they should let 2/3 or 3/4 of the states that don't have the larger population of white people. Or the most racist states to change the law of slavery. Such is because if those states' legislative work, together with having hate towards black people, they can make slavery happen again. Going back to references to slavery in the firth fourth and ninth section of the article says, \" we do slavery.\" If there is a time for this to be changed in the constitution,  it should not be allowed. The states play a key role as they hold federalism and separation of the government power, both national and state government. \n   \n  \n\nI get what they\u2019re TRYING to write, but this is college, please make it coherent.  Take the time and write the post.  Have your post run through a grammar checker, or read it out loud to someone who understands English.  \n\nMy grade is contingent on writing a reply to your shitty posts. Write like you give a fuck.",
