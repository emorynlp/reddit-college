  "text": "i emailed him about it and was very apologetic but he still hasn't responded and i'm just really worried. i'm so fucking mad at myself for not waking up at the alarms i set. and for fucking up my sleep schedule so badly. i literally only had to be awake for 5 minutes and i couldn't even do that\n\nEDIT: he got back to me and said don't worry about it and also i have a 98 in the class LET'S GOOOOO \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89",

      "text": "These things happen more often than one would imagine. I had a student miss an interview for a position at my lab, he wrote a very apologetic letter and we re-scheduled. I ended up hiring this student, that incident did not impact my decision. We developed a great relationship and he's doing amazing. My point is, this mishap doesn't define you, you need to be kinder and more forgiving to yourself. If the professor has not answered it's likely because he receives tons of e-mails a day and may take time to get to yours.",

Well, it wasn't a shocker when the professor said that the highest grade ended up being a 73.",
