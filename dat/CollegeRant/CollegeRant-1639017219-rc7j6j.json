          "text": "I had a chemistry class where the teacher refuse to let anyone leave unless she dismissed us and if you left before that you were not counted for the day. There were times we were there later because of that.\n\nAnother time I had a pre calculus professor who would often go over the scheduled end time. One time he did this he ended up saying we could leave which caused a few to leave. However, a few moments after they did he took attendance for the day. And to make matters worse he said those who left weren't counted for the day despite him telling them they could leave and class going over the scheduled end time.",

I just wanted to clarify the attendance policy, because I noticed I wasn't counted for the day on 11/11/11, despite being there from 6pm to 8pm. It seems I wasn't counted because I left at 8:00pm, despite class running over. I've CCed XYZ from Academic Affairs to help explain this to me, but was wondering if you had any input. Thanks!\"",
