  "text": "I have a couple of assignments for different classes that haven't been graded and it's making me a little anxious.\n\nI have an essay that we submitted about a month ago worth 10% that hasn't been graded yet, but smaller assignments for the class have been. Usually the turn around for essays is quicker so I'm like, \"Oh no something is wrong\".\n\nI have a programming assignment that was submitted almost two weeks ago and I haven't gotten a grade back yet, also worth a lot, but a smaller project got graded within an hour of submitting it.\n\nI know with the thanksgiving break and professors trying to tie up loose ends etc. theres probably a massive backlog but I just wanted to check in and see if anyone else has a similar experience.",

      "text": "One of my classes we get the test marks back but not assignments. I'm so nervous for the final because I have so little to go on, I don't know where I stand. Usually I calculate it beforehand like, I need 73.6% on this final to get the minimum grade I went for the class, or something like that. But I can't do that. This entire semester, I've only gotten marks back for 25% of the course, and going into a final worth 30%. That other 45% is going to make a significant difference but I have no idea what it is.",

My professor still hasn\u2019t graded it.    \nIn another class (taught by a different professor), I submitted a quiz on November 1. My professor hasn\u2019t graded this quiz.    \nIt sucks because I\u2019ve waited 3 months for one assignment to be graded, and 1 month for a quiz to be graded. I submitted the test and quiz before the due date. It\u2019s disappointing when I have to wait a long time to receive my grades.",

I handed something in awhile ago that I got an extension for (so it's only my paper she has to mark cause everyone else's is long since finished) and I haven't heard anything. Now the paranoia is setting in: did I do SO bad that the prof is trying to figure out how to break the news to me? Are my cited sources super shady and she has to do an extensive check? Did I somehow send in the wrong document? God help us all",
