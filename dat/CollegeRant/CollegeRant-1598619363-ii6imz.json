  "text": "I'm a guy and left for college across the country today. Since stepping off the train to take the ferry, I haven't been able to stop crying. Not only is it embarrassing because I'm on public transport, but also because I'm not quite sure why. Part of it may be the fear of not making new friends in a strange town, part of it missing the friends and family I had back home, and part just straight frustration about not having a good reason to cry. \n\nIs this normal? Does it stop?",

      "text": "This is completely normal. When I was a freshman I didn't cry till right before I was leaving and then I couldn't stop. I managed to calm down until right before they dropped me off, stopped enough to meet my roommate and she left for marching band, and then I completely lost it for another couple of hours and multiple times during the first half of the semester. You're human who is stressed out and in a new situation (not that covid is probably helping either)so that is going to build up and bring out a lot of emotions which your body is responding to by crying. Just cause your a guy doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to cry either, I feel like a lot of problems would be fixed if more people would cry and get pent up emotions out of their system.\n\nTLDR: It's completely ok and normal to cry in stressful situations and no one will ever fault you for it, pretty much every freshman is going through the same thing rn",

      "text": "Give yourself a full week. Almost like if you were super sunburned and you would just think \"well, it's just gonna hurt for a while, nothing I can do, but I will feel great again *and* I'll be \u2728 tan \u2728 once it's finally over.\" The first week of college is kinda like that where you have to accept that for a short amount of days, things can feel just catastrophically different, it could feel like you're flailing in the air with nothing to hang onto. Same we we feel if we jump into a pool the first time or whatever. It starts off very uncomfy and then we go \"oh wait that's not so bad\" and doing this in the year of COVID makes it even more like that!\n\nOne funny thing I've noticed as someone who moved across the country for a college once, but also moved just across town of my parents house for another college, is that the first 3-7 days were equally as strange feeling! So I think it's more about the transition to college life than it would be if you were, say, just on a trip to a new city. After you get settled into the college life, I bet you won't be feeling as *sad* or *hollow* about missing your family and friends and hometown. It will be more like \"yeah I miss them but like it's chill though and I love it here and I'll see them soon on breaks or whenever \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\"",

Maybe it was the case for you now too. Going away for college is the biggest life change you've had so far in your life. There's nothing embarrassing about being emotional about it.",

So if you do feel homesick you can contact your friends and family. Crying because you are leaving home to go to college is a good reason to cry. Better you cry and lay all your emotions out than to bottle them up. Dont mind crying in public. You are going through soemthing new. Anyone who gives you shit about it is being bitter because we have all been there before.",
