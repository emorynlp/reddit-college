I feel like she is just being incredibly lazy because literally every other online professor I\u2019ve had had provided us with something other than \u201cwatch this YouTube video and read.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nTL;DR My class consists only of being told to read the book and watch YouTube",

On top of paying for tuition and various fees, I'm also getting charged $400 in access codes to access a temporary e-textbook that disappears after the semester ends and be able to do my quizzes/exams. If I don't pay for these access codes I literally would not be able to take the quizzes/exams. None of my professors even post lectures or respond to emails. Wtf am I paying for? Why am i even paying for tuition at this point? College is an absolute joke.",

Kind of crazy that they can even do that imo.\n\nI'm taking a bio class right now and it looks like he's using recycled material from years ago for the same class.
