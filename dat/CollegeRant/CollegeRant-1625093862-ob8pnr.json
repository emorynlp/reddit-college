  "text": "We all know about discussion posts. Most of the time I can easily do them and then when I look at others answers, I get a good laugh. Today I fucked up and probably have been laughed at by the other students. I basically gave the exact opposite answer to the question. Thankfully the teacher doesn\u2019t immediately grade them because I would have gotten a big fat zero. It\u2019s only 10 points so not the end of the world, but I feel like an idiot and I\u2019m usually a bit more on top of my game. He says we are able to edit the post until he grades it but after that there is no chance of editing it. Again, glad I realized and can fix it. SMH at myself \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
