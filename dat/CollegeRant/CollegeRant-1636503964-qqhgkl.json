  "text": "I'm really terrified and need advice. During my class, we were doing a coding problems, a classmate asked me about a HW problems, I didn't think much of it and type in a few word (I barely type a sentence) on her laptop, the prof spotted us and sent us charges for Academic Misconduct and we will get 0 on that assignment. Does this mean I'm not getting a job ever, since employer don't choose student with academic misconduct? Should I go to the college hearing panel to explain to them the situation?",

Cheating isnt aa disorder that requires a diagnosis, its a 1 time act that anyone can do at any time. \n\n>Shouldn't there be a degree of violation to be considered as cheating?\n\nThats something you bring up to the panel. You say \"while I acknowledge that what I did is against the rules, I want to request leniency due to the relatively small impact that this had on the grade of the other student\". \n\n>I barely assist her, not even enough to make a coherent sentence, am I a cheater?\n\nYou didnt answer my question. Was it made explicitly clear by your professor that the assignment was individual? If yes, then yes. You helped another student on something that you werent supposed to. If it was such a small easy thing to do, why did they need your help? And if anything, why couldnt you verbally help her? This was honestly really dumb. I dont think this is worth punishment, but theres generally a 0 tolerance policy for this kind of thing.",

I have no idea why some of these comments have such a strict take on this - in my opinion, colleges should be encouraging collaboration, helpfulness, and peer support, not punishing it",
