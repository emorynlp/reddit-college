  "title:": "How the fuck does someone like to go to college!?",
  "text": "After finishing a bachelor's in math and currently finishing a master's in applied math, I can say that, without a shadow of a doubt: college is LITERALLY the worst fucking thing to waste our money and time on. At the beginning of my college days, I was stupid enough to believe that \"college was going to be the best years of my life\" and that \"I would be learning with the best professors in the country\" (my bachelor's holds the title for \"best math course in the country\" where I live in). It sounds like people are paid to boast the college they were in because my college was literally the biggest clusterfuck LMAO.\n\nI had around 20 different teachers but only 4-5 of them actually took the time to make sure we learned the material as best as we could. The rest? One of them forced us to TEACH THE FUCKING MATERIAL! Yes, literally he told us that \"I'm not in the mood to come to class and start yammering about the material, here's a list of topics you'll be presenting\"; other couldn't give less of a shit about us, she didn't teach us anything, only gave us books to get the material from and never responded to our emails when we had any issues with our learning.\n\nAnd don't even fucking get me started with the \"but college teaches you how to learn, you have to go get things on your own, in the job market no one's going to teach you anything\". If college is all about learning by ourselves,what the serious fuck are teachers doing there, you fucking idiot!? They're supposed to give us the necessary tools in order to learn more efficiently, which doesn't fucking happen. And most jobs need specific skills that you'll learn there, you normally go through a internship and people actually take the time to guide you until they deem you can be autonomous enough, because guess what: NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING GENETICALLY MUTATED, SELF-TAUGHT GENIUS, EVEN EINSTEIN AND NEWTON HAD SOMEONE EXPERIENCED GUIDING THEM. STOP BEING A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS, PLEASE!?\n\nEven though most of the things you learn in college are meant to teach you problem-solving and other soft skills, the way that they're thought totally defeats the goddamn purpose. Instead of teaching stuff in a way that we'll understand and apply them to exercises and further work on real-life projects, no, you're studying things you half know of so you can regurgitate them on an exam and forget them when (or if) you'll use them again. Outdated courses are also an issue but that's a rant for another day. The only positive aspect of this expensive shitshow is the friends we make along the way, otherwise it would be an useless and painful piece of shit of a process we all go through if we don't want to starve to death.\n\nAnd fucking hell, man, it ruined my self-confidence, my brain \"jams\" when I try to learn anything, my potential is being squandered, I fell into a horrid depression which I'm still trying to get rid of. If college are the best years of your life, I might as well get cancer if it's all downhill from here, right? Or the people who say that \"college years are the best\" are the ones who peaked there, just like with high school? Here's some food for thought...\n\nFeel free to tell me that \"I don't deserve to have a master's\" and that \"I'm in for a rude awakening when I get a job\", I don't give a goddamn shit, I hate college and I can't wait to be done with it LMAO\n\nEDIT: I'm talking about MY experience in a specific college, on a specific degree. If your college experience was completely different from mine, I'm glad you didn't have to go through hell, like I did. My experience is still valid and I'm not generalizing or hating on you because college were your best years, if you feel offended by this post that's on you. Try not to invalidate my experience just because my college doesn't match with the good times you had in yours, it makes you look like an idiot, try to be more empathetic with people who were unlucky in their college, as the \"best years of your life\" generalization is just that, a goddamn generalization...",

It\u2019s so important to make connections in college with co-ops, summer internships, going to career fairs, maintaining a high gpa, volunteer to learn skills, doing personal projects, having an indeed account and networking by asking people for advice, getting RELEVANT certifications, being signed up for student newsletter, getting help from the career centre in your university, and becoming friends with people who do well, so that they can help you find a job later.",

This narrow-minded mentality is present even on STEM majors, which are undoubtedly the hardest and most \"delicate\" courses someone can graduate (delicate in the sense that, more than any other majors, they require an experienced professor teaching us stuff, due to the difficult nature of the subjects).",

Do you even know how jobs work? Do you honestly think that every job is le McDonald's or Burger King, where you only flip burgers?

If you cultivate self-discipline and force yourself to follow a certain schedule, you'll see that you can learn as (or even more) effectively than in school, trust me. You do realize you need to keep studying so you can always be ahead, even at your job, don't you? Most useful things you'll need for life you don't learn at college, that's why companies always offer training to interns and even mentoring programs, because they know that college doesn't do that much for learning anymore, unless you want to be a researcher. \n\nAlso, the fact that you refer to online learning as \"simply reading facts or information off the internet\" just shows how, as a self-proclaimed \"lifelong learner\", you seem pretty narrow-minded and about self-teaching yourself, my man. E.g., most colleges don't teach you how to program, the best programmers are all self-taught and learned thanks to the plethora of online resources there is. Can you imagine how insulting that ignorant comment of yours is to people in the IT field? Most (if not ALL of them) ARE SELF-TAUGHT, THEY actually took their sweet free time and invested in it, WITHOUT COLLEGE, WITHOUT ANY FORMAL AUTHORITY.   \n\n\nHave you ever heard of Coursera? Those courses are really well-structured and made by top class universities and instructors that ACTUALLY know what they're doing. You can go at your own pace, you actually learn something instead of just sitting in a class listening to some idiot who hates their job. Never said it was a substitute to college, just saying that it's an effective way of learning by yourself while making sure you consolidate the material, with tests and practical assignments. Are you still on about how \"college is the last chance to learn anything\" or are you gonna get your head out of your ass and start taking charge of your learning? I know what I'm gonna do ;)",

If you take yourself more seriously, you'll see that learning things by yourself is one of the easiest and most rewarding things you can do. It might take time but you'll get to a point where learning without a formal authority just seems WAAAAY easier than normal.\n\nLearning in school depends heavily on the professors that are in charge of the classes, so no, it doesn't necessarily \"\"\"engage us with the material and forces us to pay attention\"\"\". However, instructors on Coursera actually know what they're doing and you'll be able to learn things way quicker than in college. Again, if the only way you're able to learn is with a formal authority, I don't know how you consider yourself a \"lifelong learner\", bro, lifelong learners actually take responsibility for their own learning, they take the time to search for learning resources, commit to a certain schedule and are self-taught in some areas, they don't need to be in school in order to learn. If your learning ends after graduating college, I'm sorry but you can't call yourself a \"lifelong learner\" LMAO\n\nI understand that work and family might take time off our learning schedule but guess what: TIME MANAGEMENT IS A THING! You might not believe it but if you manage your time better, you'll actually be able to learn everything you want! I know right? You might not be able to understand it right now but I hope you start getting out of your bubble soon and create some self-discipline. It'll do you wonders, trust me!",

A lot of your time is taken up by studying for rigorous classes, (in my case since I'm a computer science student) studying different skills in your free time and/or completing side projects. There's little time to be social and have fun in college, especially if you work at the same time. \n\nNot to bring anyone down but if I was majoring in communications or psychology or a similar major then I'd be having the time of my life but I chose computer science in order to have a career that is high in demand. I lose the fun of college for the most part but it works out in the end.\n\nThat being said, I fully agree with OP. Doing this shit takes a bunch of determination and grit so I don't understand how someone, given they are studying something very rigorous, can enjoy college and want to go on to get PhD.",

I\u2019m happy for the new mindset I gave myself, the connections I made myself, and the goals I achieved on my own time. That\u2019s all due to college, but at the same time not at all. I don\u2019t even know what I would have done otherwise. Still, I can\u2019t help but feel that the curricular part of college is a absolute ripoff and the upper-level staff are all vultures and/or people collecting paychecks and waiting to die. \n\nOh, and they don\u2019t even give enough of a shit to do a virtual graduation. We\u2019ve all been invited to next years, even though they don\u2019t have the facilities to seat the family of a single graduating class, let alone two.",

It is the shittiest and the most toxic environment I have ver had to be in. \n\nMost faculty members don't have any industry experience, their only qualification is having graduated from the college that they are now teaching at. \n\nThe course hasn't changed in over a decade. We had a subject about communication theories and we're being taught theories from the post world war 2 era. The presentations we are taught from literally have 2010 written at the bottom.\n\nThere are also super dumb rules like not eating in the classroom. (which I understand if it's a lab or something) but it isn't. It's a shitty classroom with old ass desks. And our cafeteria is tiny with not enough room to hold even 70 students. \n\nThe only productive classes I have had where I felt like I learned something was when we had guest faculty. \n\nAlso, we have like 10-12 subjects each semester. And a lot of times the same faculty member teaches upto 3 different subjects. Like wtf? \n\nAnd if you fail in even one of the subjects, you will be allowed to give a retest once, fail that too and you repeat the entire semester. Which basically means you will be an entire year behind. \n\nMost of the time students don't fail the semester because of their own fault, rather because of the faculty being super petty and not liking the student in question. \n\nI hate this place. I'm in my last semester and I can't wait to just get the hell out of here. The faculty members are all extremely unprofessional, gaslighting ego maniacs.

I dropped out of engineering school and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but I'm better off for it honestly.\n\nBA in Psych will probably teach you a lot, but you can learn so much more on the internet faster and in better ways. College is good at getting you to spend time learning things you wouldn't learn on your own.. But if you are not willing to learn it on your own in the first place, it's probably not a good use of your time. \n\nCerts are the shit. PSIA level 1 ski instructor certification is $300 and you're overqualified in North America for entry level, and you don't sit in an office and you get to work with cool kids or adults teaching something cool. It's not for everyone, but there's an analog in every industry.\n\nThe world is dying and everyone's in debt.",

I can confidently say you cannot learn as much from the internet as you can from being in class. The hands-on learning and discussion is the most integral part of the class. Granted, I attend a smaller school, but I never would have learned the proper ways to implement certain techniques or stumbled on to the more minute details of psychological concepts without my professors and cohorts. College has made me more motivated to go into the field compared to what I was researching on the internet previously",
