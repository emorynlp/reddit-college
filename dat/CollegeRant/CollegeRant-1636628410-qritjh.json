  "text": "I'm currently a Junior in college. When I first started college I didn't want to go to a big college because I didn't want to worry about paying for too much. I go to iupui. I have a scholarship that is paying for my tuition for 4 years of undergrad. This includes books fees you name it. Everything besides housing. I also didn't go to s big school because I would have to pay for it my mom has her own stuff going on and I didn't want to bother her with adding my extra school cost. She already does so much for us. ( My goal was to try and eliminate being in debt bc I don't like \"owing\" people back. ) This summer I visited IU Bloomington and fell in love . I then had my heart and hopes set on moving on campus in either an on campus apartment or dorm. With my still living at home I share a room with my sister. I really need my own space now and it irritates me. I'm thankful to still have a roof over my head but come on... who doesn't have there own room? It makes me sad sometimes and pushes me to work harder to find my home away from home. I know only have 1 year of school left but I don't care . I just want the actual college experience . It seems fun and I will be around other students my age which I can relate more to them. I really don't need any help I just needed to vent. I talked about moving out etc to my mom, and other family\nmembers but of course they say \" you're only 20 you don't have to move out just yet\" but I feel like they don't fully understand that I'm 20 sharing a room with a 13 year old. I definitely need my own space and I'm sure she wants her own space too. It's not that I'm trying to \"move out\" to prove something I feel like I've just outgrown and I don't want to overkill my stay LOL .Thank you for\nlistening.",
