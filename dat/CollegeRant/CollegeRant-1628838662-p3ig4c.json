  "text": "Made a Throwaway to post this and let me just start off by saying I am feeling downright abysmal. \n\nIn a week I\u2019m going to move to college out of state to start my sophomore year. The problem you may ask? I\u2019ve never left home before. My family and I have always been super close, however because of the pandemic we got even closer. The WFH lifestyle and my Mom got me to stay home my freshman year and now that I actually have to leave I\u2019m starting to not want to. This all being made worse by my Mom saying \u201ceveryday it\u2019s one less day to the last\u201d. And fuck, I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t find things to fill my time, I can\u2019t pack, and I really just can\u2019t focus on anything other than spending time with them. \n\nTLDR: I am homesick before having even left home",

      "text": "Idk if this will help but I find myself to be almost the complete opposite. Im back home for a month or so in between leases and i cant wait to move back in two days. Dont get me wrong I love my family, there hasnt been any issues, but I find the \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cindependence\u201d really enjoyable. Its not like my life here is overbearing or anything but I honestly just enjoy heading off into the world to do my own thing. I also hate feeling like a financial burden which was a big issue with my parents previously so even if im broke and barely scraping by myself buy I feel better. Idk.",

      "text": "I've felt that feeling several times in my life. I probably cried every time. It was scary and I had separation anxiety for a while. However, the fear fades and you increasingly become comfortable in the area you live in. You get to know people, get the know the area, etc. Every single time I've had to move or experience some major life change, my life got so much more interesting. I actually pity people who *don't* experience the change you're about to. You're about to go on a journey where you get to learn about yourself and experience culture chock and all that life experience that comes with it. That's living life. Being thrust out of your comfort zone and into a new life IS scary, but it's going to be great for your development as a person. Sure, be scared, but also know that it's going to be greatly beneficial for you in many ways.",

      "text": "Same here. Thankfully I\u2019m only going 3 hours away and can drive home for weekends. I\u2019m expecting some brutally long weeks though. I don\u2019t see myself making many/any friends at school, nor being the fun type to enjoy it. I\u2019d suggest in your case though to make sure to FaceTime with family frequently, make trips home on vacations if possible, and try to make some friends at school. It would be a lot less stressful when you\u2019re not feeling so alone at school. It\u2019s a rough time for certain, but things will work out for us hopefully.",

      "text": "Going into my senior year. Every year I am excited for school but then the last few days at home are always bittersweet knowing I won\u2019t see my family for a few months. \n\nGoing to college and being independent is scary and uncomfortable at times but also freeing, giving you the independence to live your own life, set your own schedule, and start growing into an adult.\n\nYour apprehension is a testament to how much you enjoy your family\u2019s company, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but also evidence that you have a lot you can gain from this experience. Make the most of this opportunity. You can miss home, but also don\u2019t miss out on college. It is a really wonderful place where you can discover who you are and what you will be in the future.\n\nAll good things in life come to an end and this is just the next chapter of that. Embrace the adversity and you\u2019ll do great. Cheers!",

      "text": "I feel you.  I as 15 when my parents dropped me off at my dorm (1990).  My dad did not even get out of the car.  His motivational speech was \"don't fuck this up\".  Thanks pops, really felt that in the heart.  Mom came up for about 15-minutes.  I had a Muslim roommate that hated America and Americans.  He was there because his parents forced him.   We eventually became very close friends.  \n\nWhat helped me was joining a lot of organizations.  Keeping busy.  I also invited my friends to stay with me on weekends.  \n\nIt's amazing how much you grow when you can spread your wings...even when you don't really want to spread your wings.  \n\nRemember, nothing is forever.  Give yourself a semester, if it goes good, give yourself another semester.  Invite your parents up.  I had my mom visit me at least twice a semester.  A lot of students do this.    In the end, if you need to go to college closer to home so you can live at home, so be it.",

      "text": "It can be hard. Our family wasn\u2019t even that close and I still had a hard time leaving. Later I realized that the anxious feelings stemmed from the idea of leaving a known comfort to go to a situation with unknown factors. \n\nI gave the Fall semester a shot, I didn\u2019t like it, and I transferred to a closer university for the Spring semester. Over the course of the summer, I ended up moving back home to take courses online from home. It just didn\u2019t work for me and it wasn\u2019t during a pandemic, so I imagine that\u2019s compounding a lot of emotions. \n\nAlso, maybe the countdown thing your mom is doing might be her masking her sad feelings. If she projects excitement, then you won\u2019t know she\u2019s anxious too (at least that\u2019s what my mom logic brain thinks your mom may be trying). Maybe while you\u2019re doing something together, just casually mention that you\u2019re feeling anxious about leaving and have an honest conversation about your feelings. You may feel that your family feels the same and create a support system for each other that you didn\u2019t anticipate. Maybe phone calls or other regular chats, emails, etc are something that can help ease the gap?",
