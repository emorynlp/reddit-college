  "text": "I\u2019m just really upset about this. I studied well, took great notes, and actively participated and listened during lectures. I got a 48/60 on an OPEN NOTES test. I took the whole hour to do it, too, it\u2019s not like I rushed. It\u2019s not the worst grade, I know, but it brought my current grade down a bunch, and I\u2019m disappointed that I got the grade I did considering what I thought was good prep. I\u2019m trying to do my reading for Monday now, and the grade is just bringing me down. I thought writing this down and ranting I guess might help.",

And she wouldn't let us see tests afterwards to see what we missed .",

I\u2019d go talk with your professor and/or the TA\u2019s. It\u2019s so aggravating when they won\u2019t work it out or show what you got wrong, but I\u2019d definitely tell them that you\u2019d like to know to benefit your academic success. I\u2019ve gone through similar in particular with a pompous a$$ of a food chem prof, who turned cooking and baking into pure insanity plus sucked the joy out of it. It was all open notes but we would barely pass, I got with the TA and my professor, plus my advisor. However, after an email in which said professor called us \u201closers and worthless\u201d I had to leave, it was too much on my mental health. Between straight A\u2019s on all my labs/quizzes and my baking project only to then be destroyed in the exams was too much. I\u2019m not saying this will happen to you, as this was out of control but I\u2019d get your TA, Prof, and even advisor in on this",

I had a philosophy professor who was the worst of the worst. She would only respond to student emails 2 days a week, and if you sent an email outside of those two days or using a different format than the school provided email, she would not respond. And it was for that exact reason. She was so arrogant and rude, that she avoided all possible accountability with tests and assignments. Even if the entire class missed the same question, it was wrong, because she is the professor, and you are the student, making you automatically wrong, no matter what. Teachers like this need to retire and stop picking on kids trying to learn. I felt her only purpose in still teaching was to be a bully.",

              "text": "That would be recommendation - review your test. And depending on the course, it may simply be a difference in style. Ask to see the test or to meet with the professor to understand what they want.  \n\nFor example, I had a literature class about southern US writers. Most of the books we read were very flamboyant, dramatic, full of style - but our professor wanted our papers on them to purely analytical and dry.  Talk to your professor to figure out what they are looking for.",

I love the class and find it very interesting. The exam was 50 questions, 2 pts each, and I was expecting maybe to get an 85-95. But I guess the world had other plans, because I ended up with a 68, and I had full access to any and every resource in the world.",
