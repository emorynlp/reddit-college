  "text": "I transferred from an online CC to an in person university to finish my BS. The classes are ok but it\u2019s all of the walking up the hills which are consequently tearing up my feet, the other students talking/not paying attention in class/disrupting class and profs doing little about it, the entitled behavior of other students, students getting away with murder and getting slaps on the wrist, students barely following Covid rules that they agreed to follow so that we could stay open, the exhaustion, the poor quality yet expensive food on the meal plan, the ageism against non-trads, and especially my family being so stupidly against higher education that some family has ghosted me and others keep calling me and repeatedly forcing me to justify my decision to be in college (they just \u201cdon\u2019t understand WHY I decided to do a degree\u201d, etc. ) even my rl  best friend (not in college) had counseled me against going to school and then decided to ghost me now for going back to school. All of this is making me regret my decision. And my degree is going to take way longer than previously thought.",

      "text": "Do you come from a very conservative background? I wonder because they often view higher education as an elitist institution that brainwashes otherwise 'traditional' conservatives. It's terrible to discourage people from pursuing higher education. Get your degree and spite them. Surround yourself with people who value expanding their minds and taking in many different perspectives.",

Even the young members of the family started having baby after baby right away. Some of them dropped out and never bothered to graduate.  I\u2019m desperately trying to get myself a career now after having shitty low wage jobs for years.\n\nAnd thank you!!",

      "text": "I'm a fresh transfer student and this semester is online, but I graduated last spring with my associates from CC, and holy fuck I want to scream sometimes, my university acts as if cc gave me no tools to handle myself at all and continually puts me in social situations with the fresh out of highschool teenagers. It's degrading.\n\nI'm from an extremely conservative background and my family has stopped talking to me for other reasons (mostly the gay stuff, but they're upset about my atheism too) and agree, it's exhausting having family members stare you down and demand to know why you want a degree and don't want to just destroy your entire body for decades. I wish they could be happy for me but they just seem perpetually disappointed. \n\nThankfully, I've built a solid support system, and I hope you get the chance to do so too, OP! You deserve it. My degree is also taking longer than expected, and it definitely comforts me to be able to look towards my mentors and know I'll make it eventually. An extra year (or two!) isn't the end.",

          "text": "Thanks! I appreciate your response and that you understand where I\u2019m coming from. I managed to make a couple of acquaintances for a support group but most other students cannot relate to me, and my unique situation, so it makes me feel isolated. Most other students have supportive parents at the very least, or at most parents who extremely involved with the school or their education. \n\nMy school is also extremely incompetent so making an appointment to talk to a member of staff is like pulling teeth. I regret coming here but not starting a degree. My school also treats us all, including transfers and non trads and VA students like we\u2019re 18 year olds.\n\nWhen I tell family repeatedly about my degree and why I\u2019m doing it, yet again,  and then they ask me a question that makes it obvious they weren\u2019t even listening, it makes me scream. They focus on the trivial: The fact that girls are \u201callowed\u201d to play sports instead of cheerleading only, that I wear short shorts to exercise in, the fact we have coed dorms. Stupid shit like that. They complain that exercise, and gyms and swimming is coed. Some of their comments are so mind blowing it\u2019s like they\u2019re stuck in a time warp.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve already told me they\u2019re not coming to my graduation, \u201cif you manage to graduate\u201d. So that\u2019s nice, lol.",
