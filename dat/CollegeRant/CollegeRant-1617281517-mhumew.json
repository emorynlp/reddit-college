  "title:": "College readings are impossible",
  "text": "Am I the only one who get super frustrated trying to read an article for a college assingment where the author focuses more on pumping out as many five-dollar words in a row as they can than actual readability or comprehension? (I know, ironic given my run-on, but cut me some slack. I've been reading anthropology articles all day). Anyways, if I have to google every other word, I'm probably not going to finish the article. I get it, it's nice to use complicated words that express your meaning better than simpler ones, I like to use them too. Still, as a college student I would at least like to be able to read and comprehend what I'm supposed too in a reasonable amount of time. It's really annoying and I wish college professors would choose articles with simplified wording for complex topics. I'm not getting a whole lot out of an article if I can't understand it.",

What I do, is I just read the entire thing without stopping, maybe taking occasional notes on what I\u2019m getting, and then see if I come come up with a general summary. Also, looking up whatever you\u2019re reading + summary (although a lot of the stuff I read, and perhaps you read, is so down the rabbit hole it won\u2019t be on the internet) and then when you think back to the details of the paper it will all make sense hopefully. Good luck, it\u2019s still hard as shit though.",
