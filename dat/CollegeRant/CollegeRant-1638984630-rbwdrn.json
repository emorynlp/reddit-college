  "text": "im struggling. so so much. my schedule got messed up and i got stuck with mostly online classes, which i do NOT do good with. adhd + an \"out of sight out of mind\" way of thinking really fucks things up. i have 16 missing assignments in my english class, which is the only class im truly struggling with. i did this to myself though so i cant be upset about it. i couldve just done the work and wouldve been fine. why didnt i just do it? i did this to myself. im such a failure. my gpa has to be above a 2.5 to keep my scholarship, im definitely gonna lose it. i have a week to turn in 16 assignments along with studying for finals. wish me luck lol",
