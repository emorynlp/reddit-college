  "title:": "Anybody else a bit frustrated that your parents think you'll find a job straight out of college?",
  "text": " This is a bit of a rant but my parents are constantly thinking I'm going to make six figures straight out of college and I'll find a job. My parents are on the younger side of Boomers. They keep asking me things like where I'll work, when I'll be employed, how much I'll make, if I need a car, and other things that are just nonsensical at this point in time.\n\nWe're in the middle of a pandemic, a pandemic with lasting economic repercussions. Everybody I know that had a job doesn't have one anymore, everybody I know that was guaranteed a job only got broken promises, everybody I know that has/is graduating/ed does not and can not find work.\n\nUgh, I'm just so frustrated because they don't understand that the job market is dead now and will probably be dead for a while. They think everything will be fine once vaccines are mandated.\n\nHow about you guys? Do you share the same sentiment? Are your parents bombarding you with the same questions & messages?\n\nPlease let me know! Thank you!",

      "text": "Mine keep asking me what I am going to do with my degree. I know what I want to do with it and just need steps to get there. They also seem to want to bug me to change my academic plans, when the other schools I looked at in my state have per credit hour rates of $1340 or higher. I cannot afford them, unfortunately. I tell them this, but they still fight with me about it. I am not going outside my state because that will also cause me to pay more tuition, and I do not have more money.",

      "text": "I am really, really glad that my parents understand the situation. I plan to graduate with my bachelor next year, but still need to do a 3-6 month internship for it. They agree that it\u2019s better to push the internship till I can do it in person opposed to a home office situation and they are fully onboard with me going for an MA after my BA instead of trying to find something on the job market \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nMaybe let your parents take a peek at the job market and the statistics on employment for fresh graduates. They might not really see/understand it until you\u2019ll deliver them the hard facts.",

      "text": "That\u2019s very true. I tell my mom the statistics of college grads who are unemployed or underemployed and all she thinks is that I plan on dropping out. While it\u2019s important to keep a positive outlook on the future. It\u2019s just what it Is. she thinks college is the end all be all and that your future is secured once you get out if college. Easy looking for a job, great salary and career. Like lol, I\u2019m just using this for security and in the case that I love what I do when I graduate then I will strive to keep getting better but if not I\u2019m out . Doing whatever makes me financially independent and great future for my family.",
