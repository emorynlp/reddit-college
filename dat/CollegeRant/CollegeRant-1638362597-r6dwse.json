  "text": "So I get the shittiest fucking day to register for classes for spring. Of course I do. Of course I would get the short end of the fucking stick right off the bat. But you know what? I fucking suck it up and deal with the fact that I\u2019m not gonna get the awesome class schedule that I had all planned out. Fuck it. Fine. Whatever. But then I get waitlisted for Spanish. Of course I get waitlisted for Spanish. You know what? Fine. Fuck it. Whatever. I\u2019m number one on the list. SOMEONE will drop. It will be okay. BUT THEN I get this bullshit email at 11:00am yesterday saying \u201coh a seat has become available but you have like 20hrs to fucking register or else fuck you.\u201d NOT FUCKING FINE. Of course, I, the fucking paranoid shit who checks emails religiously I\u2019m talkin 5x a day, misses this fucking bullshit email, and now I\u2019m fucked six ways to Sunday. I\u2019m no longer on the fucking waitlist, I\u2019m stuck with 12 fucking credits, my advisor probably won\u2019t respond to my email for 2 weeks, and I\u2019ll probably get some shitty email from a robot at the office of registrar that basically says \u201cboo hoo fuck you.\u201d I can\u2019t explain how infuriated I am. I\u2019m sitting at my fucking desk absolutely livid. I\u2019m on the verge of just driving my fucking Honda off fucking 78. Why. Just why. WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SEND THIS FUCKING EMAIL LESS THAN 24 BEFORE I NEEDED TO FUCKING REGISTER. why is this school so fucking intent on fucking me over. I and breaking my fucking back to be here. I am barely hanging on and now this shit? Are you kidding me? What the fuck did I do to myself. Why did I think I was okay enough to go to college. I feel so fucked and helpless. I\u2019ve never felt so shitty. It\u2019s like being robbed and then your robber come back and take a piss on you. I\u2019ve never done this before. Nobody is fucking helping me. I know it\u2019s not the end of the world but im already on edge. Im already closer to losing my shit. This year has fucking abused me and I don\u2019t know much more I can fucking take. \n\nTLDR: im about to go fucking crazy sorry for saying fuck sm",

I really hope you\u2019re able to get in or at least find another suitable class. Getting started is rough, but once you get into the swing of things, it does get better. Try to hang in there. Beat the shit out of pillow\u2014it helps.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this will help or not, but your post made me giggle. Thank you for that :)",

You are justifiably upset.)",

          "text": "Also came to ask this. It very normal for freshman to get the later time and dates to register for classes because junior and seniors get the earlier dates because they need to have first dibs on classes since they are closer to graduation. Your registration date will get better as you move up. You can always move classes around to take them different semesters. Sometimes that\u2019s what you have to do if you can\u2019t get that specific class this semester. It does suck but trust me things can get moved around and there will be plenty of time to squeeze in all the classes you need by graduation. Lots of us have been where you ate and it\u2019ll work out, even as frustrating as it feels right now!",
