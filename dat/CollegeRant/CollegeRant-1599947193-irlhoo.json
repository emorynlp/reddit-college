  "text": "I feel like not too long ago there was a balance between work life student life and personal life but after reading lots of post since going virtual, a lot of people have had a huge workload dumped on them, myself included, and the retention isn\u2019t high because most people just want to get the assignments in and get a good grade. I\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t be challenged or even push ourselves to work harder but there is such thing as too much and there needs to be a balance between classes as I\u2019m sure professors know everyone isn\u2019t just taking one class. Some people can take on five while others can only do two or three at a time. Now that we have gone virtual a lot of us are seeing the needlessness in pushing more assignments and programs on us rather than actually teaching the material and most of the people who make these decision and even most professors didn\u2019t graduate 5 or 10 years ago. My own professors got their degrees in the 70s and 80s and I promise u if they took their own class they probably wouldn\u2019t even get an A let alone a B. When did getting an education to better ur life become an obstacle course of depression hardships and stress? I know life can be that way sometimes but it shouldn\u2019t affect the majority of the student population in this way. I\u2019ve never heard so many people upset with the quality of life college has given them.",

It just takes away from learning and adds anxiety and frustration. They forget (or don't care) that we have other classes and personal things to take care of.",

      "text": "I noticed that online courses tend to be poorly taught if the professor has no experience teaching that way. In this case, COVID forced many to teach online for the first time.\n\nThe good courses I noticed are clear, organized, and rely on maybe 1-2 weekly assignments. There is maybe a chapter of assigned reading plus a short nongrade influential quiz to review.\n\nAll the extra stuff like youtube videos, articles, and etc. are optional. They supplement but don\u2019t overtake the core focus of the course.",
