  "title:": "Why are professors allowed to be so bad at their jobs?",
  "text": "I am in the last class required for my major and have a 3.8 GPA in my major to date. This class has caused me so much stress that my hair is falling out. Here's a rundown of how the class works:\n\nOnline lectures where the professor projects his typed notes onto the screen and reads off of them nearly word for word. These notes are essentially just the book paraphrased. There is also one midterm and one final exam that make up most of our grade. \n\nThe midterm was rough. I failed and upon reaching out to my classmates, realized that everyone who I spoke with failed with the exception of one who got 1% above failing. The professor refused to tell us the average on the exam and refused to curve. I asked for clarification on his grading on one specific question and he pretty much told me everything was technically correct, but I had forgotten to check one of eight things so I got nearly 3/4ths of the points taken off. On top of being a hard grader, he gives us the hardest problems from the book for our homework. My tutor is even unable to help me with some of the problems and he has a graduate degree in the subject. The professor also does not have office hours, instead he asks that we send him emails to ask questions. The catch is he doesn't respond to every email. Even when he does help, half of his answers are just stating that something is easy so we should do that part on our own. The class has shrunk greatly in size from the start of the semester due to people withdrawing. \n\nI have reached out to my dean to raise my concerns about the professor. They said they will speak with him and get back me, but I don't feel like they will do anything.",

      "text": "This might seem a little long but bear with me:\n\nA reason i found is usually they aren\u2019t hired because they teach great but because either they have a lot of notoriety in their field or because they are great researchers who can get the university lots of money. \n\nUsually with professorships there isn\u2019t that much qualification you need besides having a certain degree or experience in that field. At my school, you just need a masters in order to be an adjunct. Meanwhile to be any other teacher, you need to go through countless background checks, a certified program, get fingerprints, spend so many hours observing, pass the praxis, student teach, get a degree, sometimes get a masters, etc. etc. \n\nAnd on top of that there\u2019s a ton more rules you have to follow because teachers tend to be held to a higher standard: some teachers can get fired just for dressing \u201cprovocatively\u201d ie in a pencil skirt and a blouse, whereas another teacher no joke got fired because she said she was depressed. \n\nOn top of that, colleges are more willing to cover up when a professor does something wrong. Or a student doesn\u2019t report them because they\u2019re older or it doesn\u2019t seem necessary. There was a professor I had who wouldn\u2019t give a girl an extension on her midterm because he doesn\u2019t accept late work; said girl had a concussion and her doctor told her not to look at a screen or she\u2019d make it worse. If this was grammar school, he\u2019d get written up. In college, she didn\u2019t feel like reporting him. \n\nNot only all that I just mentioned but professors hold your entire life in their hand. If you have a bad teacher in high school, your parent could complain or you could just go to summer school. In college, you could lose your scholarship, have to spend more money, etc.",

      "text": "We're not allowed to be bad at our job -- there is actually an extremely high standard -- but our job, as evaluated by the administration, is research, not teaching.\n\nTenure, promotion, salary increases -- everything -- depends on producing high quality research. Good teaching is not rewarded. Literally, the only way that teaching is rewarded is through feel-good rewards like \"teacher of the year\" but these are meaningless and don't help our career at all. \n\nThe only thing that motivates us to be good teachers is knowing that we have helped students grow and improve. In other words, intrinsic motivation derived from positive relationships with our students. Typically, young faculty put a lot of energy into teaching even though they aren't rewarded for it because they are optimists and believe students have good motivations and a sincere dedication to learning. That naivety wears off slowly, as one gets to know students and their deceptions, and once the well of optimism has run dry, there is no reason to put more than the absolute minimum into teaching.",

Like, I think he might have docked me a point simply because I circled my answer instead of drawing a rectangle around it. Needless to say, I filed withdrawal paperwork within a day, and took the class the following semester with a different professor.\n\nThen, there was this guy at my current university - a primarily teaching university, mind you. Nice guy, but the homework was somewhat difficult and he was not that great at teaching the material. I attended labs with his TA's to complete the lab assignments, and I still only eked out a B+. At the end of the semester, he asked me how I thought the course went. I decided I had to be honest with him, and he said he could understand and that the next semester would have a different syllabus. The problem was, his hands were somewhat tied because of other professors who just use his syllabus.",

So, my boyfriend took a film class asynchronously because it overlapped with another class that he needed this semester. Well, instead of the professor recording the lectures (like literally EVERY professor does) he instead writes out the lecture word per word, without formatting, and sends it to my boyfriend after every lecture. There is another student who's asynchronous in the class as well and both of them have been struggling all semester. \n\nThe only good thing is that for exams they can just ctrl-F through the lectures",

The tutor is not equipped to support you on the assessment\n\nYour university will have a process around this, and it will be specific and time-based so enquire as soon as you can and get moving on it. Appeal at every point you can. \n\nThen, set up a zoom meeting with the Dean, and invite everyone else from your class. Get them all in on the meeting and let him know that all of you are going to formally appeal every assessment from this professor while you are in the unit. \n\nInvestigate which options are available to you outside the university (in my country there is a government authority over universities you can appeal to once you have exhausted all internal university options).\n\nGo to the university publication, and indicate there is a student movement against the poor teaching in the department and refer them to the dean to comment. \n\nAt the start of the next online lecture, let the professor know you will be recording him for the purposes of reviewing his teaching and marking as per the assessment. \n\nThe kind of professor you describe is exercising a criminal abuse of his power. He is an ass and he needs to have the students use his people power to push back. Other opportunities:\n\n1. Contact the industry associations he belongs to and complain about his unprofesionalism. make sure all complaints have a variety of signatures on them.\n2. Contact the student guild/union and find out what services may be available to you. \n3. Contact the University president outlining all of the steps your class is taking on the matter. \n\nSee if you can find his other students or ex students to join your actions. \n\nThe goal is to get the Dean to have someone take over the class while you are in it.",

If the TAs helped most of us with the code, then the students and the TA would go down for academic dishonesty. The TAs were terrified to help. God forbid a couple students work looked the same after they got help from the TA. The professor also made his own Chegg account to answer students questions to catch them that way too.

I also (very) strongly agree that that devaluing is rooted in misogyny.  We as a society devalue the work of women in many, many ways, and shitting on K12 teachers, a profession you correctly pointed out is disproportionately held by women, is definitely one of those ways. And , to some degree, overvaluing \u201ccollege professors\u201d is also an artifact and living example of our institutional and societal misogyny. I do not disagree with that at all. \n\nHowever, in addition to that, there is still a lot of difference between the profession of \u201cK12 teacher\u201d and \u201ccollege professor.\u201d  And my point was that one of the biggest differences is the amount of training and support higher education faculty get on \u201chow to teach.\u201d I don\u2019t say that as an excuse to defend bad teaching by faculty (I am massively critical of bad teaching at universities), but to point out the reality that the jobs are different and it\u2019s not appropriate to judge a college professor\u2019s teaching skills to those of a K12 teacher. \n\nI know this because I have had careers as both and currently work as a professor in a \u201cteaching first\u201d small liberal arts college, specifically in teacher preparation. I also provide instructional workshops on how to be a better teacher to other faculty at my institution and elsewhere. In general, these standalone workshops are the only formal preparation/training professors get on \u201chow to teach,\u201d and this is at a \u201cteaching first\u201d institution. Professors at larger, research focused institutions get even less. I don\u2019t think most college students realize just how little formal training in pedagogy, instruction, etc. most higher ed faculty get, which was my main point. \n\nI like to point out the semantic difference between he verbs \u201cto profess\u201d and \u201cto teach\u201d as a way of highlighting the way the professor position has traditionally been conceived, which manifests in the job requirements, professional expectations and, in my point above, how much instructional training and support faculty get. \n\nLastly, you also might be surprised at the pay.  I made more money as a K-12 teacher (Middle School ELA) than I do as a college professor... and I wasn\u2019t in a particularly high paying state or district, and I\u2019m in a very good position now- a tenure track assistant professor. You should do a search in r/Professors to hear the horror story of faculty pay for non-tenure track professors.",

A lot of them are a pain in the ass not just for students but also staff. I know because I know advisors that work at a research institution. Lots of complaints. However, that\u2019s why I mentioned that not all of course. Some are able to juggle their responsibilities and do them right. I don\u2019t mind tenure if I feel like I am going to get my money\u2019s worth and the professor cares. The issue is when they are careless and we (the students) suffer or get half ass education from it. We pay a lot of money to be there and it\u2019s important to bring up the issues that also surround this topic. Many abuse that power. Again, not all so both your perspective and mine stand.",

Professors' working conditions are students learning conditions. That applies no less to tenure incentives than anything else.",

It is unfortunate so many subscribe to this model as it is ruining education. No, we do not owe you to meet your expectations and to give you the grade you want. \n\nThe only argument you might have is they are not fulfilling the university requirements for office hours and since you did not cite such other than to say they don't without providing what their syllabus says and what the university says means they probably are and you are just not utilizing them. \n\nThere is a bit of difference, your opinion is not one based on knowing anything about the structure and model of the system. Rather, it is based on what you want to be given. If you want to learn something you would pay attention to people who can actually tell you what is going on rather than just rallying around your complaining without knowing anything about how Universities work.",
