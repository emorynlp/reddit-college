  "text": "ok so i have 2.5 hours left to write 10 pages double spaced on some stupid fluffy environmental bs. (i love the environment ofc it's a priority for human survival, but this class sux mad dick) I know that I can do this. I know I should have started earlier. I am not motivated without a pressing deadline. I've heard that other people have this same struggle with motivation/procrastination and productivity. I just really don't like this super isolating way of working. I like to be around people and talk things out. I like when someone checks that I have hit certain progress milestones and makes sure that I'm on track. This helps me sustain productivity throughout a heavy project or assignment. I know this seems very high school. HOWEVER, my college costs upward of $52,000, so I have a right to some personal expectations.   \n\n\nAll of the information presented in this class, I could learn online. Why spend so much money to attend college? For the curation of content, for personalized assistance, for the social accountability that comes with having a professor, and for the shiny degree. Are these expectations met? Fuck no!\n\nI like to compare college to taking a workout class. You could find the exercises on the internet. You could create a regimen for yourself, but the curation of exercises and the pointers and the motivating force of competition, of surveillance add value because this is supposed to be an efficient approach to working out your body. You put the work in, but it's easy because the trainer pays attention, gives you praise, gives you breaks, and accommodates your weaknesses so that you can develop the standard of strength you desire.  \n\n\nWell, I am trying to work out my mind. I have disengaged professors who do not try to sincerely connect with any of us students. (I'd understand not getting close with everybody, but they don't connect with *anybody.* I'm in my third year, still taking required classes unrelated to my major. There is no personalization in teaching styles. I know this comes across as weird private school entitlement, but this is an idealist's picture of education and I think for $52k+ we should be a bit closer to the ideal than where we currently are. Also, more than half of the students at my school pay full tuition, so it's not a dilution issue. Why isn't my academic experience better?? I WANT IT TO BE BETTER! 200K+ for professors who couldn't give a shit less who their students are??? They are the failed ecologists that passed down environmental burdens to us! Fuck them. They are not trying. I know this is harsh, but it's a harsh price tag. Maybe they aren't getting paid enough to care. That's probably the case. I don't know their salaries. There is serious mismanagement of funds and of hiring. \n\nTL;DR  professors should be more hands on. i don't work well alone.",

      "text": "This bothered too for awhile, and it still kind of does sometimes, but what I\u2019ve come to realize with college is that it is mostly guided independent study. We\u2019re ultimately responsible for the learning experience we get. College is also a universally recognized achievement we need in certain jobs. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nYou wrote a lot in this college rant, and it flows really well. You essay is going to be great. Good luck.",

          "text": "Still: ~54 million spent on instruction ~37 mill spent of \u201cacademic support\u201d I read the financial statements and I understand that the college pays for more than just professors. Tuition is high - quality is mid. I understand that I pay the school that distributes budgets to administrative offices, then some offices hire, train, pay professors. Yes money gets lost in the system. I am not satisfied with the academic experience that I get. The system can be more effective. If it was currently up to my standards, then this course would be better. Tuition at my school has doubled since 2004 and student satisfaction has not doubled. It\u2019s bad value.",
