On moodle right now, my stats grade shows as an F, despite the fact I got all A\u2019s this semester. It\u2019s just because my stats prof chooses not to use it to post grades (he emails us instead).\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is don\u2019t freak out until you confirm with your professor which final grade they submitted to the school.",

I currently serve as tech support for online college classes, and a lot of teachers manually put final grades in, and a lot submit what\u2019s in the LMS.\n\nA lot of my job actually involves fixing the LMS\u2019s grade book for the professors that do the latter, and as a college student myself (though attending in person, not online) I can say that I take making sure the grade books are right very seriously, because I absolutely do not want anyone to get screwed over. Many of the professors doing this method care a lot too, which is why they reach out to support, since they also want it to be right and fair.\n\nAlso, I think fakin is right about manual submission becoming more common. Most of the professors I\u2019ve had myself do the final grades manually, and keep the students updated so if there is an issue it can be resolved. It\u2019s been really nice to see this level of care becoming the norm!",

                          "text": "Some of this behavior is obstinance on the part of professors who just don't want to learn new technology. But speaking as someone who is really invested in cutting edge tech, I think I can say with some authority that the gradebook systems in most Learning Management Systems really sucks. They are almost always needlessly cumbersome and constraining, and while they often do possess a certain level of customizability, this customizability is usually buried behind a horrifically cumbersome UX that requires slowly forging through pages of slow loading pages with overly complicated but not very powerful drop-down menus. (Brightspace D2L is one of the worst offenders by far.) The situation is often made even worse when IT decides to either lock down permissions on, or simply not implement, broad swaths of the functionality that does exist.\n\nI'm sympathetic to the fundamental problem of getting a mostly non-tech-savvy user base to adopt a new system, but the current situation at most places is kind of terrible. Professors are either going to be Luddites that want and should be given a bone-simple spreadsheet model painted directly to the screen, or they are tech-savvy and deserve a responsive set of programmable configuration options in a single-screen app and a programmable API. LMS like Brightspace split the baby in half in a way that serves nobody. I'm not surprised that adoption is low, and that the solution appears to be simply to just have a dedicated group of real people running around putting out fires.",
