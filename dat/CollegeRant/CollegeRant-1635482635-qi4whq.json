  "text": "I\u2019ll keep it short. Had a group project in math and was quarantined for 2 weeks as soon as we started, I was texting our gc every other day or two asking what I could do and they never responded, thanks guys.\n\nCome back from quarantine, project is done and I barely did any because I had no idea what to do, ended up getting a 44% on it and it\u2019s 15% of my grade \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nI have two more projects left in the semester (worth 38%) and realllllly hoping I can get my 70 in the class to an 80. Y\u2019all think it\u2019s doable?",

My biology teacher kept pairing me up with the same person (who was always complaining that we\u2019re never gonna get this done, while I was very calm and optimistic about it all). \n\nSo we got this project assigned and she suggested using Prezi, and I just suggested that we use Google Slides bc everyone has that. \n\nI had to leave for a doctor\u2019s appointment that class, and later I texted her if she wanted me to do anything, and she either didn\u2019t say anything or she said no. \n\nNext class, my teacher calls me over to tell me that this girl told her that I did nothing, and I explained to the teacher everything that happened, and she made ME apologize. \n\nThat teacher never liked me, and made it very obvious all 2.5 years that I had her. \n\n\nAnother time in freshman year of high school, I was paired up with a girl for a Spanish project. \n\nOnce we finally finished and presented, the girl complained to the teacher that I did absolutely nothing, which was totally untrue. The girl also bragged about it to the rest of the class, in front of me. The teacher thought I was lying when I stuck up for myself.",
