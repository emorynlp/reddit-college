I do this as I believe it will help students. \n\nI do not know which tool(s) your professor is using so it may indeed be as you say they are removing them but none of the recording systems I have used asked me if I wanted to remove the CC, I had to make an active choice to include them.  There is old adage to never attribute something to malice when it is more likely to be ignorance.\n\nIf you need the Closed Captioning then contact your disability office as they can ensure this is done to meet ADA requirements.",

I don\u2019t know - I don\u2019t remove them because they\u2019re helpful, and even if they weren\u2019t, we aren\u2019t allowed to remove them for accessibility reasons. They probably shouldn\u2019t be removing them, actually, if they have offices similar to ours who oversee accessibility.",
