  "text": "Hi everybody, yesterday I was trying to clear my to-do list in my student center. I was trying to clear my transcript ADT information. This situation has not been resolved since June and it is July . Mine you I am about to pay my tuition, housing and meal plan. I called yesterday and they told me that they received my transcript and I was fine and I had right information. One hour later I get an email from same person saying I am missing the ADT in the transcript.  I have also called admissions to check again if it is the right information, I have getting different answers from everybody. I resubmitted the final transcript but I am just confused. I have been having anxiety and having slight depression because this process just sucks.",

          "text": "Yes I know understand this is a standard process but typically the admissions does not take that long to process their transcript over a month. Usually they would take 2-4 weeks to evaluate the transcript. The saddest part of this process the emailing admissions because they don\u2019t respond until a month later when the situation is already resolved. There was no financial verification, I was just stating that this week or the next week I could completely pay tuition in full with financial aid and as well housing and the meal plan and the admissions still would not been able to completely solve situation yet. The ridiculous part this process is that they use the covid 19 excuse way to much. This should not have been a messy process but it is because of the admissions is unstaffed due covid regulations and hiring new operators that don\u2019t know how to resolve shit. Those are not excuses, this just shows how incompetent the admissions is when it is in pandemic.",
