  "text": "So I know a fellow student that has a cold (at least they assume it's just a cold that I assume onset today or over the weekend). They work at the Dean's office for my college and I have two classes with them. Despite the schools guidelines of staying home when ill, they went to work this morning and plan on going to our class that starts in about 2 hours. No one in the office is enforcing the guidelines and sending them home. I've linked them the guidelines personally and told them directly that they shouldn't even be on campus. They don't care and dismiss everything saying \"it's just a cold\"\n\nNo one should come to campus if they have any kind of transmittable illness, period! I think ever, however this close to finals just feels like a really shitty selfish move.\n\nEdit:spelling",

      "text": "Yeah this has gotten very frustrating. Had a student come into a class with a lot of sniffling and coughing and you know what she fuckin did? TAKES HER MASK OFF FOR AWHILE TO DRINK. Now if she was lowering it to take a drink and putting it back on that would be fine, but she left it off for about 5 minutes all while coughing and sniffling everywhere. She even sat down directly behind me so I made a big deal out of moving, I wasn\u2019t risking getting whatever she had.\n\nDo you know if this person has gotten tested though? If they got a negative test they may feel obligated to show up despite being sick.",

          "text": "Wow, she took her mask off? Just wow. \n\nThey refuse to get tested because next week is their wedding in Vegas and they don't want a potential positive test to get in the way. \n\nWorst part is that I sit right next to them. My school packed classes at full capacity so every seat is taken and I have no where to move to. I did move my seat as far to the end of the table as I could.",

What happens if they do have COVID and they give it to everyone there??? Just UGH think straight yall! It\u2019s also pretty stupid that your school packed every class like that, mine thankfully cut down the maximum.",
