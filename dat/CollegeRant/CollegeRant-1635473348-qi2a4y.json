  "text": "Hoo boy, it's time for an essay.\n\nLast year I was sure I was gonna be a Doctor. This year I decided all the Biology wasn't for me and I switched into Physical Sciences and Chemistry. I'm not even half way through first year yet and I'm starting to reconsider my options. I started getting interested in science in around grade 9, and since then I'm confident I want to go into STEM. Chemistry in principle is very interesting to me, but there are a lot of things in the three chem courses I'm taking right now that don't catch my interest as much as I'd like. The labs can be really tedious to write, and there's a lot of stuff that don't sit well with me because it feels like we're just being taught to memorize it and not intuitively understand it. I like the concept of Thermodynamics and Electrochemistry, but even in second year courses they essentially just tell you to use more complicated formulas and go from there. There's a lot of stuff in Chemistry that I do find really cool, but it all feels so procedural and illogical because they don't teach you whats going on behind the curtains yet. It could be that they're just hesitant to get into the nitty gritty since it's still early in the undergraduate, but I just don't like feeling in the dark about things I want to understand. I've never been a math guy--not that I was ever bad at it--but ever since, I wanna say, two or so years ago, I started getting really interested in math. I have no idea why I began feeling so strongly about it, since people who really enjoy math are usually born liking it and breathe math for their entire childhood (like my brother), but maybe having him show me lots of mathematical relationships and intuition have changed my perspective on the subject. Anyway, I'm currently taking Chemistry and Physics/Math courses, and some of the most fun I've had this year has been studying physics and math. I love getting that \"OOOHHH!\" moment when you finally understand how something actually works, it's the best feeling ever. However, I'm in my second year of University and I'm taking some first year courses because of my switch. I don't wanna upset my parents by switching into a new program that I'm clearly not even certain I'd stick with again. That said, I'm also a bit terrified of upper year physics and math courses because I've been told they're quite challenging. So basically, I don't know if I want to keepndoign what I'm doing right now and hope it gets better later on, or switch for a second time and see how she goes. Not really sure what to do at this point, so I thought I'd do what any sane person does and vent about it on Reddit. Thanks for listening, cheers.\n\nP.S. My hobbies are G A M I N G  and playing the Piano. Not sure why or how that would tell you anything about my academic choices, but I'm just gonna include it anyway.\n\nTL;DR feeling lost among the sciences, not sure which one to choose and feeling anxious because of it.",

      "text": "it's really nice to see another person genuinely interested in STEM not just for the money but because of the challenge and satisfaction that comes with learning. I'll admit I'm more partial to chemistry and Biology than Physics... I'll be honest I HATE physics. I can't seem to understand the different values if I can't picture them.\n\nI decided I want to go towards a chem/bio major because I want to do forensic pathology. It combines chemistry, biology, medicine and LAW which I love! Not to mention it is pretty high in demand!",

      "text": "I'm in a similar spot, just not in STEM. Thought I wanted to be a linguist earlier this year, realised it wasn't for me. Now I'm majoring in Indigenous studies. I know I'll have to go to postgrad for a better chance at a job but there's way too many options to choose from. \n\nI've thought about doing chemistry too, I was good at it in high school, but haven't touched it since 2016 and would have to do some maths and a chemistry pre-req. It's the only thing holding me back.\n\nI want to try out a lot of things without consequence but I'll have to figure it out. \n\nTL;DR I get your feeling, in a similar boat but more in the humanities/social sciences.",

      "text": "I enjoy physics and math, but I could barely keep my head above water with my college algebra class, needing to meet with a tutor almost daily. It was taught way to fast. My prof would teach us 3-4 different concepts, demonstrate them once, have us do one of each on the boards, and then have us do 10 for each concept for homework. Sadly, I don't think i have the personal dicipline to learn that stuff on my own.",
