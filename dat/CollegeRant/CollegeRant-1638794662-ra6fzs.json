  "text": "I have a 69 in Pre Cal, I have to make a min of a 71 on my final to get a passing grade. I failed 2 out of 3 tests thus far. \n\nBack story: I was just in the hospital with my husband for two weeks due to complications with his gastric bypass surgery. I studied so hard while in the hospital with him and I still failed my last test. \n\nSo then this last week we are back and I\u2019m studying for my final, as things are getting back to normal, when they come in to tell me that my 4 month old niece stopped breathing. \n\nI postponed the final until the end of this week, I can only take it this week and we are still waiting to hear about when the funeral is for her. \n\nI keep trying to study, but focusing is so difficult while you\u2019re watching your whole family fall apart (and you\u2019re failing apart as well.)\n\nShould I cut my losses on this class? Has anyone ever been in this situation and made it out with a passing grade? I feel hopeless right now, wondering if it is possible.",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation\u2014I was doing okay in a math class, but then my triplet sister died. Came back after two weeks with tons of missing work, struggled to keep up with the lessons that I missed and new lessons, and eventually had to drop it because I wouldn\u2019t be able to pass had I not. \n\nI wanted more than anything to pass the class and get it over with, but I had to consider my own health and needs. What I needed was time to grieve. I could hardly function sitting in that class when I returned. \n\nIf you really feel confident that you can pass, I would try and take the final. If not (which seems more likely considering your attitude) I would drop the class and give yourself a break. You\u2019re dealing with so much right now and need this time for yourself to heal.",
