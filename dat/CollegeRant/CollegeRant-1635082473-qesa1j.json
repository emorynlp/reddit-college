  "text": "Every time I had a group project in high school it was always the same story. I would do all the work because I wanted to get an A and we were always told that it\u2019s our job to encourage our group to do work because that\u2019s how it\u2019s like in the real world. Pretty sure you would get fired in the real world if you didn\u2019t do your work. Can\u2019t wait for my college group projects now",
