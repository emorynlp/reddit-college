  "text": "Is that really so common for students to ask them to bump up their grade? Every Professor I have always makes a massive deal over this at the end of the semester. I have never once asked a prof to bump up my grade. \n\nHowever, I have only been on the border once in the past (years back): Finished with an 89.5 and he still didn\u2019t round up even with me running an A all semester but I was like, whatever, I took my B.",

      "text": "Some of us teach large lecture courses filled with pre-meds. In any given semester, at least a half dozen students whose grades are on the shady side of a border email with reasons why they should be bumped up. If I bumped up everyone on a border, then a whole new set of students would be on the border. And if I should bump students just below a border up, should I also bump as many students just above a border down?\n\nIt's also impossible for lil' ole me to sort out the real excuses from the made up excuses, and exhausting to try, so I allow students to drop the lowest exam grade and the lowest quiz grade. This policy, however, does not prevent the grade-bump requests.\n\nMost of us would be uncomfortable sending our loved ones to doctors who got where they are by cajoling profs into boosting their grades, so I continue to be firm about those borders!",

It is rarely \u2018I need a bump because it\u2019s hurting my GPA\u2019.  \n\nThis past semester, I had a student email me 40 min before grades were due with a bunch of late work (they had a credible story about having problems the last month of the semester). I have other students just ask generic broad questions about what they did wrong with some assertions that they know they did everything right. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s family issues (sibling on suicide watch). Sometimes it\u2019s work issues (job has been asking a lot lately). Sometimes it\u2019s funerals.\n\nBut I get at least a few anytime grades are being reported and very few questions early in the semester or before assignments are due.",

I make a point of acknowledging to students that life gets in the way sometimes, and I do what I can to be flexible. \n\nBut from what I hear from other professors, there are a range of beliefs/philosophies/personalities about student attendance, policies, punishment, etc. Some are well thought out and others seem to just react and dismiss the issue altogether\u2014at. The same time they range from super strict to super flexible\u2014And they range from organized and detail oriented to barely aware of student situations at all. \n\nWhat you wind up with is an unpredictable reaction from class to class.",
