  "text": "Especially for my stats final. The only way I\u2019m gonna pass the class is if I somehow get an 85% on the final exam bc I\u2019m genuinely doing terrible in this class. Plus the final will cover ANYTHING that we\u2019ve gone over class and there\u2019s a handful of things that I still don\u2019t completely understand but can\u2019t identify which right now. I\u2019m seeing a tutor and the assignments right now aren\u2019t that bad but I\u2019m still not confident that I\u2019ll know most of the content in the next 9 days.\n\nBut then again, this is the only class that I\u2019m struggling with. I have A\u2019s in my other courses and one them doesn\u2019t even have a final. With that being said, hopefully I can spend more time studying for my stats exam.\n\nTL;DR: Super stressed for my stats final bc I need to get an 85% to pass the class. Not sure if I would be able to grasp most of the content in the next 9 days even though I\u2019m seeing a tutor.\n\nEdit 12/10: Turns out the the final isn\u2019t actually worth 80%, I just misread the syllabus. Still gonna study hard to get a B though.",

                      "text": "Just my opinion, but your time may be better spent just listening during lecture tomorrow. \n\nThink about your end goal. It\u2019s very unrealistic that the professor would (or even could) split the material into two exams at this point. So, one downside is you spend crucial lecture time discussing something other than exam material. And depending on how that discussion goes, you risk angering the professor who might end up making the exam more difficult (even subconsciously). \n\nOn the other hand, a private verbal or electronic message along the lines of \u201cI hope you will take the fact that the exams are now combined into consideration when grading the final\u201d *might* result in something positive. \n\nGood luck to you. I\u2019m proud of you for all those A\u2019s!!! Now, close Reddit and get back to studying for that final!",
