  "text": "I'm an uprising senior doing a BS in chemistry and I know I have to go to grad school. I originally had a plan and was excited to go through with it but lately I've had a change of heart for what I want to do and an extreme loss of motivation to do school after a tough year with Covid. Is anyone else just really unsure and unmotivated (due to mild anxiety) to look into what to do for their year after college? I feel behind, I don't know what I want to do with my life other than that I really like some things within my field. Just hate being so unsure especially when people are starting to ask what I'm gonna do afterward.\n\nTLDR: unsure about future and feel pressure from people to know what to do about grad school after college",

              "text": "My parents were pressuring me as well but they fortunately got convinced when I assured them that I will use this year productively to self study. Getting a stable job is a priority for me rn, for which I will have to give national competitive exams next year. With everything that has happened last year, I just can't keep up with preparation for competitive exams and also pursue my masters at the same time. That's why I told them that this way, I can finally get mentally cleared and focus. Rushing through grad school with all that baggage is not worth it and I can seek higher degrees later in life as well. I hope things work out for you, and even if you have to do grad school this year, take some weeks off for your mental health before school starts. All the best! You got this :)",

      "text": "I got into a funded phd program in chemistry having graduated this spring. I understand where you are coming from with the anxiety to graduate. I think a lot of my anxiety stemmed from not being sure how to pay for the titanic money sink that is undergrad. Right now I'm going to give grad school a shot. Worst case is that I don't  like it and drop out, at no real cost other than opportunity cost. My goal is to get a decent paying job in industry.",
