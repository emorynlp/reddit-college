  "text": "I am now a junior in college and I am still struggling to find my group of people. I played a sport my first year, but my friends and I all left the team and now it seems everyone but me has made a solid group of friends. I\u2019ve tried to chat with people - but I can\u2019t seem to click with anyone super super well. \n\nI\u2019m just curious if I\u2019m alone in this? It\u2019s seriously no fun seeing everyone have fun all around you so I just want to know if there\u2019s hope -lol.",

      "text": "I know exactly how you feel. Im a junior and I transferred and thought it would be super easy to make friends since most juniors haven\u2019t been on campus for a year and half and most sophomores have never been. I am getting along with my roommates but I feel like I\u2019m clinging to them and I\u2019m kinda being forced to be friends. I don\u2019t know anyone but them and I\u2019ve been trying to branch out but its really hard. Idk how it seems like everyone has all these established friends when most of us haven\u2019t been there in forever. I did go to a club meeting tonight and had fun but didn\u2019t really make friends. Also I\u2019m gonna go to a couple more but its just SO hard. I just get so jealous of people who have all these friends when it\u2019s impossible for me to even talk to one person",
