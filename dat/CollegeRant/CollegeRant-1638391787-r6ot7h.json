  "text": "It\u2019s my 4th year here, I have a few friends now but it still sucks. My way of coping with stress is going for long walks. Well that\u2019s not very possible here there aren\u2019t really sidewalks\u2026I have no car and public transportation isn\u2019t a thing here so for 4 years I\u2019ve been confined to stay on campus (Uber rides add up quickly). It literally feels like im trapped here. The school food sucks and there\u2019s no grocery store in the neighborhood except a crappy Walmart. Even if I did cook it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a fridge or any place to store the food. My room has no privacy, me and my roomate\u2019s beds are side to side with each other and we have to get changed in front of each other. I\u2019m hungry tired and stressed. \n\nMy freshman year was rough but I though \u201cwell this is just rough because it\u2019s my first year I bet it\u2019ll get better once I get used to life at college.\u201d Nope it still sucks. And since I don\u2019t have enough credits to graduate I get to stay another full year here. Isn\u2019t that just great. \n\nVent over.",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts on here that are more whining or blaming, but your situation sounds awful. I commend you for sticking it out this long. Hang in there one more year and hopefully you\u2019ll be able to move somewhere that provides nice walking opportunities.\n\nI know some people might think it\u2019s minor, but I\u2019d go nuts if I couldn\u2019t walk regularly.\n\nI\u2019m a geography nerd - if you are comfortable messaging me the name of your university, I can search for outdoor opportunities you may not be aware of, (ex. There is a pond on our campus with a walking path around it, but it\u2019s hidden behind a set of trees. 95% of the students I show it to had no idea it existed.",
