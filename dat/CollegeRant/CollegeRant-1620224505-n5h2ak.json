  "text": "I dont even know how i could\u2019ve failed - its a freshman intro class. I guess thinking \u201chow hard can it be\u201d while taking five other classes at the same time was not a good idea. \n\nOut of six classes, this was the only one that i failed. I was pulling a\u2019s and b\u2019s in the others. I needed a C to get credit for the class and i got a D+, lets hope there\u2019s still space over the summer or bye-bye graduation.",

Depression + online school really put me down and I just stopped caring about it. Don't worry about graduating on time, there's no time limit on this stuff. Just get it done and be proud of your work.",

I had to take the class again since it was mandatory and I passed it, the point is that although I know it sucks; go ahead and do what you must.\n\nEdit: if you take it over the summer then be ready to literally cry at night lol, summer classes are fast-paced and most professors will not give you a pass.",
