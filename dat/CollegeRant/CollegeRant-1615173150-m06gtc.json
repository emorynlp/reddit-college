  "text": "This semester I\u2019m taking c++ programming, bio 112 and calculus while working. How am I supposed to litterally teach myself 80% of what I need to know and not have massive holes? So far my grades are okay, I think around the low A mark, but I don\u2019t think I am understanding anything. I\u2019m just waiting for a test to come around and totally end my whole semester. This is almost the end of my associates degree and I have absolutely 0 idea what I\u2019m gonna do. I think I\u2019m a little bit smart, but I feel like I\u2019m not smart enough to do anything I want to do. I\u2019m a hard worker, but sitting down and doing any homework with any fervency is really really hard for me. I\u2019m so discouraged and depressed I have no idea what I\u2019m gonna do... maybe I\u2019ll close my eyes and pick something random... \n\nTL;DR online college is leaving me with a crappy education and no hope for the future.",

      "text": "I feel the same in a way, before pre-Covid I fell into a hardcore depression which lasted about a full yr and a half, before that it was medium depression (I\u2019m doing a bit better now), but everything has just been so crazy along with the world moving quickly. I personally think most students should have just taken a break from school during this time because I was forced to take classes during COVID and that made my depression worse along the side of 3 people I knew passing away 3 months in a row, shit was hard. I don\u2019t like school and I try to find a way to make myself happy when I learn. I just didn\u2019t have that experience at all and was always drowned in school work and anxieties from quizzes and tests. Honestly fuck school. But hey I\u2019m almost finished graduating and now I\u2019m being forced to stay 3 more semesters because of an opportunity in teaching. I don\u2019t want to teach or become a teacher assistant and I probably won\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s just so god dam hard when ur stuck with parents during the pandemic",

      "text": "I feel you man. You definitely aren't the only one feeling this way. I am a first year college student and also taking C++ programming (along with several other courses). Doing not too bad *so far,* but I breakdown almost weekly thinking about the amount of work I have to do - at least 2 quizzes, a three-hour lab, and at least 6 assignments due every week - not to mention I have almost zero motivation and have to self-teach. You mentioned that you were thinking about a CS minor and as a CS major myself, I am struggling with C++. My midterm for it is in 2 days as well and I am just waiting for it to all crash down on me. I really respect you for even exploring a bit in a field that differs vastly from your intended major. I can't give you an exact solution for your predicament but so far what has helped me (temporarily) is just finding a quiet place and listening to music (especially ones I haven't listened to before) while doing my work. It's really important to take breaks when you need and hydrate yourself! Good luck man.\n\nAlso since you are just thinking about a minor in CS or learn to code a bit, I'd suggest to not torture yourself with college CS courses and just learn coding in your own time. There's a lot of Youtube videos with pretty good coding tutorials (you'll have a lot more freedom in what you create!) and covers a lot of the basic to intermediate-level CS concepts (which I'd believe are the same level covered by CS minor).",

That right there is how most people fail. CS is somewhat easier, is much more manageable and jobs are everywhere. \n\nIf you think that CS degrees are being less relevant, you must live under a rock. Everything you see these days require people who know how to code. This app for instance.. is built specifically by people who know how to code. The rockets that go into space have computers and controllers that are built by people who know how to code.\n\nThe planet would literally have to be wiped out and even then, the way out to another planet for humanity to survive would require someone who knows how to code. Biology is going to be automated pretty soon and the people who are going to be doing that will be primarily people who can code. So, this whole notion of \u201cbiology is the best option\u201d is total bullshit. \n\nIf you can do biology, are committed and care about helping people, do it. Majority of people can\u2019t but, do not sit here and give advice like you know what you\u2019re saying. \n\nAlso, to your friend who\u2019s earning more than anyone else. Great for him. He\u2019s probably still paying off debt. And no, salaries are actually rising to match the increasing cost of living as is almost every job that\u2019s out there. \n\nCA - $200K/yr Avg because the cost of living is so high. \n\nGA - $140K/yr Avg because the cost of living isn\u2019t as high. \n\nBoth of these states fluctuate based on experience but, this is roughly how much you could make at a competitive company with 2-4 yrs of experience. \n\nBoth have been rising quite a bit as technology has become more increasingly important.",

It's not like you go out and start screaming your salary to everyone, so I don't know how much he's making. \n\nDude, look. I know  what I've seen. As far as I know, I don't have any hallucinations. Bullshit advice? Haha. \n\nThere are two conclusions here: we're two motherfuckers living under two different rocks. The second one is people are too stupid because get degrees in fields that don't pay off, like biology and CS. \n\nI don't have hallucinations.",

My mom is in the biology field and that\u2019s what she told me so, I\u2019m gonna go with that being correct too. \n\nMost people don\u2019t share how much they make but, a rough estimate can be found on Google. \n\nThe \u201ctwo motherfuckers living under two different rocks\u201d is actually a funny statement. I might use that line.\n\nI think any degree pays off if the right opportunity falls into place. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to classify them all as \u201cdon\u2019t pay off\u201d.",
