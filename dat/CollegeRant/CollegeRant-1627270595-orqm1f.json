  "text": "i got an email earlier today that i qualified to join this club at my school. i was genuinely excited because joining would look good on grad school applications. BUT, i just looked at who else got this email, and i saw one of my \u201cex friends\u201d got it as well. and i promised i wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with this person at all. everything that happened with this old friend was so bad to the point of actually looking into switching campuses, and now i\u2019m starting to feel like i should\u2019ve. but at the same time, i\u2019m way too far into my degree that it wouldn\u2019t really make sense to switch anyways. i promised myself that i would have absolutely nothing to this person (because they\u2019re just a horrible person lmao), so idk if joining this club would be a good idea.",

      "text": "Whatever club that is, be better than that ex friend. Don\u2019t look at them eye to eye, act like they don\u2019t exist. Have fun. This shows them that you\u2019ve moved on and you\u2019re doing better in life without them. Life is too short to be worrying over someone. Work towards the thought of how good your grad school application would look. I also hope that this club is something that you like",

      "text": "Look, I'm gonna be real with you.. I have to work with my abusive ex husband. He got hired a couple months ago KNOWING I've been working there 4 years. Ignore and focus on your future. The anger and shakiness will be hard at first depending on the situation you endured, but it's going to be okay. I promise you'll get past this. If they try to cause any issues your club advisor will see it and see you being professional and your ability to handle tough, personal situations. This will help you get good recommendation letters as well. \n\nBesides, who is to say this \"ex friend\" will actually join.",
