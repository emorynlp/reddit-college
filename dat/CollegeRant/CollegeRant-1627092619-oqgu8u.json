  "title:": "Might not be happy during graduation",
  "text": "I am an upcoming college senior, who has been through a lot of emotional distress ever since sophmore year. I\u2019m at a point where I might not be happy the day I graduate. This happened when I got my driver\u2019s license too. \n\nThe main reason is not because I don\u2019t see value in the degree at all, but how I put myself in a situation that I did not want to be. I was happy getting the associate\u2019s, but I wished I stopped there. My family has been bugging me to get bachelor\u2019s for years and this adds more burden to me. It\u2019s like as if their \u201cverbal abuse\u201d just took the pride away from me. \n\nIn other words, I feel like this bachelor\u2019s degree was just to make my family proud, but I am not fully proud of myself. Am I the only one that feels this now? I know some of you will say that my feelings are nonsense, and that\u2019s ok. I just been having a mental breakdown for days about going back on campus and such.",

The problem is that they don't believe I can be successful at a university. I'm not entirely sure why they would think that, they haven't even been to university themselves to know exactly what to expect",
