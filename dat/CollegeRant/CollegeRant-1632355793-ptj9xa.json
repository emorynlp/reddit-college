  "text": "Starting my senior year of college, my school implemented a no excused absences policy. How absences at my school worked was 3 absences your safe, the 4th you\u2019re knocked down a letter grade, and the 5th you fail the course. The thing is I went to art school, we had 3-5 studio classes a week. We\u2019d often use those 3 absences to catch up on assignments especially during midterms and finals, cause of how long some of them take. This new policy however included medically excused absences. A legal doctor\u2019s note stating by a medical professional that you could not attend class that day would not be accepted. Essentially I could be walking to class fully intending on going to get my education and get hit by a bus on the way, thrown into the hospital for weeks unable to attend class, and it would\u2019ve been counted against me even if I had a note from the hospital explaining my situation. It could be like: \u201chey, I was trying to go to class, it\u2019s not my fault that bus ran the red light and I had to spend a 6 weeks in a full body cast at the hospital!\u201d This added a whole level of fear and stress on top of our work. My teacher told me once about a student who came to class all scratched up with a bleeding leg, and blood on her hands and underneath her fingernails. My teacher looked at her and asked what happened and why she came to class. She apparently fell on the streets of NYC (which are substantially dirty) and came to class because, and I quote, \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna be marked absent\u201d. My teacher, pissed off by this knowing it was about the policy, marked her present and instantly made her friend who was with her coming into class and when she fell to take her to the ER to get patched up and didn\u2019t want her to come back cause she needed to be safe. This policy angered the rest of the student body and petition (which I signed myself) went around that gained nearly 500 signatures in the first 2 hours. Eventually it made it over 2000 signatures! This, of course, still didn\u2019t budge our administration. The spring semester of 2020, my last semester of college, came around and Covid was a recognized issue spreading through the world. Spring break began on February 28th of 2020, Covid was spreading through Europe and Asia, and at least 50% of my school\u2019s population were international students, a majority of them from those regions. 2 days before spring break ends, we get an email by the school. It said that if you left the country and visited any regions where Covid cases were located that your were required to quarantine, it was mandatory. Two weeks of quarantine to try and prevent the spread of the virus is totally fair, right? Yes, i agree, that is until the school said that a mandatory quarantine by the school forcing you to stay home and miss class, would not be an excused absence and would count as 2 of your 5 absences. We were livid. The school had every opportunity to tell us beforehand that this was the case as Covid was a well known threat, but no, they wait until 2 days before spring break was over to tell us this important information. I\u2019m pretty sure half of the students wouldn\u2019t have left if they knew this was the case. These were two absences that people may have been saving to catch up on finals, or two absences that they used already to catch up on midterms as they just passed. Just taken. Soon during that week,  the school went remote, so luckily this two week quarantine BS wouldn\u2019t have been an issue because it was all online, but it was just so BS. I graduated in May of 2020. I\u2019m sorry that this ran so long, I didn\u2019t expect it to. I know I only had to deal with this for one year, but I had so many friends who were underclassmen that I couldn\u2019t stand to leave them to deal with this for the next 1-2 years. I\u2019m grateful for what I\u2019ve learned there, but I hated my schools way of how they treated their students, not just this policy, and unfortunately from what I\u2019m aware of, the policy hasn\u2019t changed (I just hope for future students I\u2019m wrong about that).\n\nTL;DR My school implemented a no excused absences policy starting fall of 2019, including medically excused absences. Essentially a legal doctors note by a medical professional would be denied and you\u2019d still have that absence held against you. 5 absences and you fail the course instantly. It stressed everyone out to the point where we had a petition go around to try and budge the administration, which still didn\u2019t work. It got worse when Covid hit and mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks was implemented for students who left the country and came back during spring break, which still, the school refused to excuse! They forced us to stay home and still counted it against us.",
