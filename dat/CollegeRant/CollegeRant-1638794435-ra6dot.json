  "text": "I just got a letter from the school about my suspension and they were asking me if I want an appeal. I said yes. Here\u2019s the story:\n\nI was having multiple breakdowns and my mental health was getting worse by each passing day. My Professor messaged me and said that I have to finish the activities within the day. With my mental health declining, I rushed it and didn\u2019t double check my work. Turns out I plagiarized a lot of stuff. I asked if I can make a new and better essay but she declined and said she raised it to the higher administration. Here\u2019s the thing. The process of reporting an incident DOES NOT GO LIKE THAT. First the Professor must consult and possible solve the problem with the student, next is with the adviser, subject coordinator (who happens to be her), Year level coordinator, program director and finally the Vice Dean of the entire college. She skipped all the process, didn\u2019t even asked me Why I messed up the paper in the first place. I went through the process explained it to the investigating team. And the decision was to suspend me. Last thursday I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with someting to do with depression. I appriciate my friends who were helping me but I realized I don\u2019t even want to be helped in the first place. Whether or not the higher administration will accept my appeal then I will accept it. My final and probably last battle is with myself. Either to continue living or stop living.",
