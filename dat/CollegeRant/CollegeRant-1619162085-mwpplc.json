This semester i\u2019m making all A\u2019s and decided to continue attending this school. This semester really made me enjoy college.",

I understand that professors shorthand critique so that it fits on paper and he wasn't a dick about it. It just blew out my confidence and crushed the last bitvof motivation I really had. I'm ready to just half ass my portion because I'd at least come out with an 80 in the class, but I don't wanna bring down my groups grade. Idk just sucks.",

          "text": "Don't give up! That critique shows that your professor believes you have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to (1) learn from the feedback and (2) apply it to submit work that meets a higher standard/is better quality. Remember, this is all to help you learn and grow, and believe me, professors who care also provide the best (and sometimes harshest) critiques. If he didn't care, he wouldn't waste his time on it. \n\nIf his feedback is mostly about meeting assignment requirements (e.g., length, formality, structure), maybe you just needed that extra guidance from the professor. Or maybe it's about meeting your field's reporting/writing standards. That takes a lot of practice before it becomes more natural to you. \n\nKeep it up - I know you can do this.",

I'm having a followup with my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks and I definitely need way stronger stimulants but if she increases my wellbutrin dose I'll have a seizure and if I drink more caffeine it might cause seizures.\n\nSo I'm either getting a real adhd med or a that's rough buddy.",

Pros and cons.\n\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t opt for wellbutrin is because I already have 0 tolerance for caffeine, had 2 red bulls and felt like I was going to die.

                                  "text": "Not depressed anymore so no ssri needed.\n\nTwo redbulls is quite a lot of caffeine and near the maximum safe tolerance for many people.  Basically wellbutrin stops the reabsorption of norepinephrine and dopamine both of which caffeine causes the release of so they amplify eachothers effect.  It's also a smoking cessation aid so it massively reduces cravings and stops withdrawal from caffeine.\n\nFor me stimulants relax and focus me and make me not feel like shit and they let me sleep regularly.  The caffeine and now wellbutrin have been all perfect, the world seems physically brighter and I can feel joy again so that's nice.  The only tiny negative is that my tinnitus is a tiny bit worse and my resting heart rate is about 10bpm faster than normal sitting at 65bpm now.  Also my heart rate goes up quicker with light exercise to around 114bpm from cleaning or walking  but it feels fine and isn't really a problem since my max heart rate stayed about the same so it's all fine.\n\nI would 100% recommend trying it if you think it might help.  Some people feel way better and less anxious like me while others turn into sweaty jittery anxious messes on the two extreme ends.  It actually makes you slightly warmer by raising your basal metabolic rate by about 100 calories a day and also promotes sweating and suppresses appetite.\n\nIt's actually used along with an opiate blocker to help with weight loss in severely overweight people.",
