  "text": "Honestly, Im worried about how everyone going back in person will go. From elementary, middle, high, and college alot of them are going fully in person. I'm just scared of what will happen, there's so many unknowns rn and im just sittin here like wellllll. my CC stayed mostly remote bc they fear of the worst and dont want to deal with covid lol. What do u think will happen? Are u nervous to go back? Are you staying remote? Do you think we could potentially have to switch back to online, go home, or will lockdowns go back?",

I at least know what college was like before coronavirus, but I wanna stay remote cuz I ain\u2019t got no motivation for my upcoming semesters due to my dislike of school. Also, this is my first time since my first semester in college having only in-person classes and my schedule is kinda fucked up.",
