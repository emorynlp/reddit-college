  "text": "Anyone else having problems with professors not respecting class schedules this semester? Or just generally making this semester harder?\n\nI go to a decent university and never really had much of a problem until this semester. Maybe i just have really bad luck.\n\nSo far i have one professor who will talk well over the class time limit. Im talking 30 minutes past the end of class. Sometimes not even about class material. Will go on long rants and have an attitude if people leave the zoom call before they finished. Has also told us the class may start being held outdoors On campus instead of online because in person teaching is more comfortable for them.\n\nI have another who unfortunately had to be quarantined the second week of class. and just announced that we need to make arraignments with our schedule because we will be going over the class time once class is back in session. This professor is giving us the two tests we missed due to him canceling class plus a lab experiment.\n\nAnyone else got horror stories so far? Figured might be a nice place for other to vent their frustrations\n\nAlso to professors who might browse here. If your one of the ones that go above and beyond to make classes less stressful during covid. Thank you.You have no idea how much it means to us students.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t imagine how international students are dealing with all of the online stuff...I\u2019m on week 2. It\u2019s absolutely awful, being in a science field our labs are supposed to take place outside specific on our campus, which I don\u2019t have simple access to. I can\u2019t be in person for any lab and I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything at all because of that, I\u2019m a very hands on person.\n\nWe had the option to do in person, but because of the pandemic I\u2019m doing all online for my own personal safety. But I can\u2019t learn anything if I\u2019m not in lab, it\u2019s unfortunately not just looking up a YouTube video on it and watch a demonstration of a chemical reaction. I have to document things in person in the environment. And that\u2019s just one class.\n\nI somehow manage to get double the homework in classes that are not major related compared to my own major and minor, and it\u2019s not just because my major and minor happens to come easily to me. I took 5 hours on one history assignment when I could catch up on a lecture I missed in history because something went wrong with the zoom software at the time of class (adding more homework because I had to show I watched the lecture by doing an assignment to get \u201ccredit for attending\u201d).\n\nI can\u2019t even focus on my actual major based classes, which are not as textbook based because they\u2019re more creative and demonstrative, making them absolutely doable for online courses. I have to take so much time for history that I have to speed through my major based courses that I actually enjoy taking the time doing and learning.",

      "text": "I'm just annoyed because I have had issues a few times so far, (my first day was last Monday), with professors talking well past the end of the class period. Most of my classes are back to back so I only have about 20 minutes between them at most & they are early in the morning so that's usually when I make a quick breakfast and eat before my next class. \n\nIt's been mentioned but professors don't seem to care, unfortunately. I've also had this happen IRL where the professor seems to think their subject is the greatest and only thing to matter, (looking at you shitty, bitch of an Econ. Professor), and will talk like 10 minutes after class ends even though they have another class in 15 minutes. I really just don't like college professors tbh",

When my school went remote last March, we lost three weeks worth of lecture and I was taking chemistry, I really needed that lecture and our professor knew we weren\u2019t going to get out of what we paid for the class.

I have mangement 3120 and Mkt 3000.  Both use Mc GrawHill Smart book, and says it will take an hour and a half or so to do the chapters.  Yet I have to do two chapters a week for both, and i try to take notes on what I am reading... It takes me like 4 hours a chapter. Not including all the other assignments from the classes. It's just like I know I could get the assignments done faster, but what's the point? Just speeding through the assignments due to the vast quantity and tediousness of them.",

The logic of taking non major related classes to make us a well rounded individual is complete shit. Its just about money for the school. \n\nBest advice i can give you is just try to bare with it. I find when it comes to reading boring material. Break it up into sections and give yourself a break. Say 20 minutes between each section. eventually you\u2019ll get to the classes you learn things in. I hardly remember anything I learned in my non major related classes",
