  "text": "So this is an elective. A difficult elective, and the only class I\u2019m failing. The instructor is very sweet and has let us turn in so many late assignments.\n\nGm and I were working on a mini project, and got a shitty grade. Our instructor let us have a rewrite. She has been the reason that we\u2019ve been missing our deadline for the rewrite. \n\nIt\u2019s because she\u2019s going through a lot, sure. She told me things have been kind of crazy in her side. But she always texted me back that she would work on the rewrite and turn it in.\n\nWell today I saw my grade. A fucking 67. Wtf. I should at least be passing with the rewrite. So I asked her about 30 mins ago if she turned it in. Still no reply.\n\nI said fuck it and turned it in myself literally just now. Grades are due tomorrow so there\u2019s still a chance.\n\nBut I\u2019m pissed. I\u2019m fucking pissed. I looked at the rewrite. I see NO DIFFERENCE in her sections!!! You\u2019ve got to be FUCKING kidding me.\nUPDATE: The instructor got back to me and he just says \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d UGHHH HES TO SWEET FOR THIS WORLD",

It\u2019s not fair for most students, relying on someone else to get their part done. \n\nWe\u2019re in college, we have our own lives and things happen and it can affect group projects. \n\nI\u2019ve got work, family stuff, and other things going on and there\u2019s no way I can do group work because things come up at the most random times for me. \n\nTalk to your professor about this. This doesn\u2019t sound fair.",

      "text": "When working on a group project, i always work as if it were a solo project. People NEVER do a good enough job. It sucks, but thats the way it is. I always make sure i\u2019m the last person to work on a projet, i reread all of it and rewrite a bunch of things before handing it in. Ofcourse before i hand it in i check if everyone is ok with the edits i made. \n\nLast group projet i did, we had to write about covid tests from 4 different perspectives. Tolerance, measuring range, nature of the test (quantitavie/qualitative), and efficiency or ease of use. \n\nMy part was measuring range. The guy who had to do tolerance just edited the title of my part to \u201ctolerance and measuring range\u201d. \n\nThe girl who was suposed to do ease of use just didn\u2019t do it\n\nThe girl who was supposed to do nature of the test actually did a good job.",

      "text": "I just completed a final project by myself that was assigned to groups of 4. \n\nI was the only one who had done it by myself.\n\nI did everything. One dropped out and all the remaining two assholes had to do was read a script I wrote for the presentation listing all of our statistics and facts, but they didn't even do that.\n\nThis presentation took me HOURS to compose.\n\nThey're on my colleges basketball team and are free riding while failing their classes and were so selfish as to not do the most simple of task: read the fucking presentation script. \n\nI was utterly sympathetic when they complained about our professor reporting all of their academic failures to their coach; I was willing to do all of the work and rate them a 30/30 (small percentage of points derived from us rating eachothers efforts) if they simply read my statistics (I have horrible anxiety and would never be able to present which left it to them, otherwise I would have done it all myself)... It really hurt that they couldn't even do that after they acknowledged how I've aced every test in that class, placing top marks each time, and studying hours on end to maintain my 4.0 because my single disabled mother will never be able to cover any of my academic fees. \n\nAfter my Professor witnessed this shit show, I couldn't help but realize how my life was over \u2014 goodbye scholarships. It was quite clear with the questions she asked, and the immensely disappointed face she wore, that my grade in her class was doomed. \n\nAt the end of our lectures that day, I waited for everyone to exit class before practically running to my professor and spilling everything. I gave her my presentation script outline and she took it home and reviewed it. \n\nThe next day, I was requested to stay after class and we spoke of my home struggles and the effort I poured into this project. She completely understood and personally gave me a 100/100 on my presentation. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to show your professor those personal messages even if you don't want to be a \"snitch\". That girl took all your sympathy and RAN with it; she clearly thinks so low of you as to blatantly ignore your messages and throw herself a pity party in hopes you attend it. She selfishly put your grades at stake and it's clear these messages won't effect her in any way since she has already ruined her chance of passing that class.\n\nLet's hope your professor is merciful enough to understand.",
