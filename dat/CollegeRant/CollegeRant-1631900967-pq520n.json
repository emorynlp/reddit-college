  "title:": "Violation over my head",
  "text": "This seems like a good place to blow off some steam- Here we go.\n\nGot an email saying that I violated the student conduct, specifically the cheating portion where I helped some students with the assignment.\n\nThey were very confused about how to approach it, and I gave tips on how to go about it.\n\nGranted, I did do a small video chat where I walked them through the steps of setting the assignment up. That was probably more than I was suppose to do, so it seems reasonable that I get this violation.\n\nAnd it's just one grade, not for the entire class that gets the 0. Just that one assignment.\n\nHonestly it isn't that bad, but I'm just making it out to be and I feel so so so bad about it.\n\nIs it bad to be helpful? Too helpful- yeah probably me.\n\nI plan on having a discussion with the instructor about boundaries on Monday, but my spirit is crushed till then and I feel terrible- right after I was starting to feel good about too.",

          "text": "A complaint like this most likely won\u2019t go anywhere at most places. The unspoken understanding is that all work is to be a student\u2019s own, and many times, there are instructions that working together is prohibited. Most of the time, no one follows through if people are helping each other out, but in the event that the policy is enforced, there\u2019s not really recourse to be had.\n\nOP, hopefully, you will be able to gain some more understanding of the situation and of expectations when you speak to him.",
