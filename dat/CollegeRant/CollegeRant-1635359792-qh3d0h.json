  "text": " Hey so I\u2019m a first-semester sophomore and currently an exercise science major in which i wanted to pursue PT, I recently transferred to a state school from CC and once i got here i realized i don\u2019t really like my major anymore. So now with my credits from the past year and a half are now practically wasted I\u2019m not sure what i really want to do. i have a few things i may be interested in such as Criminal Justice, psychology or architecture. i just feel like once i get into something i like I don't find it intriguing after about 10 minutes about learning about it. it\u2019s a bit odd but i don\u2019t know why it happens. I also don\u2019t want this to be a continuous cycle of me switching majors and wasting money.",
