  "text": "I'm a college freshman on scholarship currently residing in Hungary. My first semester is almost finished and it is currently the exam period. I started college believing it would be a wonderful experience as everyone says but so far its been more or less one of the worst periods of my life. During my midterms, I did quite well. I wouldn't say that I'm really good at studies but I have managed to go through high school maintaining good grades. But it's not the same now. So far my exams have kind of sucked. Although I have managed to score good marks in my other subjects but I don't know why I feel like I can't this time. I have been having a lot (a lot) of difficulty studying. Every time I think about sitting down to study, I can't bring myself to it thinking it won't be any use since I won't be able to score good anyway and probably end up failing the subject. I've barely made any friends, although I'm not the type that does. I come from a background where mental health is treated as something that is non-existent. I have talked to some of the people, my friends, girlfriend thinking that it would help but surprisingly it hasn't. Everyone keeps saying that I have to be strong and that if I can't do something, I have to force myself to do it. Another problem is that my roommates are all scoring really good and it feels like they are not at all stressed about anything. It is not even like they study all the time. They literally sit down two days before the exam and end up acing it. I admit that I have had mental problems in the past but given the non serious attitude of my family towards mental issues, its hard for me to recognize what exactly it is that I suffer from. I have had almost five panic attacks in the last seven days. Most of the time, I feel like being on my own. I've been crying a lot alone in the bathroom since I can't really do it in my room cause of the roommates. Also I have been feeling really homesick. Sometimes I am able to somehow make my peace with the fact that it is okay if I don't do well but things even as little as seeing people talk about exams as if they know everything and seeing my roommates doing acting like brilliant know-it-alls makes me feel immensely depressed and borderline suicidal. Although I feel like maybe what I need is some friends that are going through the same thing but no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to just go up and talk to someone random even if it's just saying hi.",

Your more nervous than your supposed to be i guess stop taking stress because it won't make anything better for you and focus on your upcoming exam or assignments instead of stressing about things after that.",
