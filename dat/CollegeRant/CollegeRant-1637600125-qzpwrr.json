  "text": "Long vent, sorry, this has just been weighing on me for quite some time. I don't really have anywhere else to go and say this. \n\nI've spent a lot of my life as a sort of misfit, I've never really fit into a group of people. I am the first in my family to attend university, the only one from my friend group to go to college, the only person in many of my courses trying to study molecular biology in the context of agriculture, and my career goals are unorthodox to say the least. During COVID, I made a friend who goes to my university and we became essentially \"the cowgirls from hell\" (coined by my mom). We'd go for really long walks, talk about our dream jobs, friends, family, and other classes. She was the first person I met here who truly understood my draw to be a molecular biologist in the field of agriculture instead of pre-med student like everyone else in my coursework. We signed a lease for the following school year and everything seemed like it would be great. In the spring, we gained a larger group of people, but things seemed great because we all lived our lives and had topics to contribute. \n\nFast forward to now. She has them over for days at a time and is always pushing for these same 3 guys to come over. They are here more than I am here. There was one time they started hanging out at 5pm, I went to bed around 12am because I had an 8:30 Zoom class. I woke up to all of them passed out, went to a full day of in person classes and got back at 5pm the following day to all of them still hanging out. They get rowdy drunk 3-4 nights a week, are constantly getting sick, and skip their classes on a daily basis. The one guy in their group is bragging about how he is going to fail 2 classes and stay here an extra semester (he's a senior). My friend is missing her exams, getting poor marks on her projects, and receives 50% on the exams she is taking. Every other word that leaves their mouths are complaints about how bad school is, tailgates, football, basketball, or bar/booze. I have practically nothing in common with them anymore. I feel like a snob when I tell them about my life because everything is going swimmingly. \n\nI know there is no clear solution to my issue. It breaks my heart to see everybody throwing their lives away under my own roof. I knew her for a whole year before our lease and never saw her drink until March of this year. I don't drink, refuse to skip classes, have earned two scholarships for my research/projected to get published as 1st author by the summer, starting my MS in May, triple major/2 minors, set to end the semester around a 3.5/3.6, and projected to graduate with 2 diplomas this spring. Whenever I hang out with them now, it feels like they're down in the dumps and I am riding on a different wave entirely. I've started hanging out with people in my major and research lab. Two of my friends have met the whole group and want nothing to do with them. \n\nIf you've read until the end of my vent, thanks for listening. I do feel better and I am well aware that there isn't anything I can do to force them to change. Nature will take its course whether it be in their benefit or not",

      "text": "I am 3 years post grad and am also moving on from undergrad friends. I had an episode where I learned how many people in my life truly cared and how badly I was lied to in college. \n\nit is very hard to move on from some of the stories. There are crazy stories that are fun then reality hits.\n\nday before thanksgiving, I had my best friend blow up at me over she's abroad in grad school taking X grad classes and she stopped talking when I said I was also taking classes but I was working. Reality, this girl has a drinking problem. I can handle her abroad but wouldn't be nice for her to put up pictures of her travels?? she doesnt put anything up. But will tell me how she had 7-10 glasses of wine in a sitting.",
