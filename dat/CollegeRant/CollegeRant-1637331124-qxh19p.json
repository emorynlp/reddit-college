  "text": "Hey guys so I have been struggling with my biology class a lot but was determined to push it through. I was at an 80 average and was able to pull it up to an 86 w a lot of hard work, and bam. I get a 70 on an exam. That one hurt a lot bc I saw all of my work go to waste and my grade dropped down to an 80 again. Either way, I still didn\u2019t drop the class because I was sitting at a B and thought I could bring it up by studying the hell out for my next test and the final. \n\nAnd I literally did just that. I started studying two weeks in advanced, made Anki flash cards, signed up for tutoring, and did practice exam questions. I was feeling confident coming into the test and at the end of it expected at least an 80. \n\nWelllllll the grades for the test comes around I get a freaking 62. \nMy professor doesn\u2019t curve the grades and I really don\u2019t know what to do or what to do more of. \nI just feel really numb to this and honestly it\u2019s affecting my self confidence. I\u2019ve always been a straight A student even with AP classes and considered myself smart in highschool, now I\u2019m struggling to make a B. \nI really don\u2019t want it to yank my GPA bc I\u2019m switching over to engineering next semester and it\u2019s important to stay above a 3.0.",

      "text": "It's so frustrating when this kind of thing happens. You can do it, though!\n\nHave you met with the professor to talk about your approach to preparation and how you might improve? When you got tutoring, did you work specifically on how to prepare for exams, or was it focused more specifically on learning the content itself? It might just be the way you are preparing that is not quite aligned with the way the tests are designed to assess your learning.",
