  "text": "I just got back after leaving Friday night. And my one of my 3 roommates had some friends over when I left, loud and annoying but whatever. My other two roommates left this weekend too and I don\u2019t think there back yet so yea. But I came back like 2 hours ago and the suite stinks, shit all over the couch, some chair from a community space in the dorm, the fridge is disgusting, cabinet dorm are left open, light in the loud ass bathroom is one, etc. and it\u2019s just like\u2026\u2026. Why can\u2019t you clean up after yourself???? Its basic respect for your other roommates. I know it was her cause my other roommates are super clean and she leaves a lot so you can tell when she comes in the dorm. But don\u2019t get me wrong I have my personal room looking crazy at times but that\u2019s MY space not something shared with my other roommates therefore it can look a mess but the moment I step outside MY room all of that is over and I clean up every single thing I have before going back in my room. Is it not common sense/curtesy to make sure you clean up the spaces you share with someone else even if your messy? And yes I have spoke to her over text but I want to wait to talk in person, she said she was coming back but I think she probably won\u2019t come in here until tomorrow but whenever she comes I\u2019m making it known I WILL NOT be cleaning that shit up now or ever. (Don\u2019t think my other roommates are aware because like I said I think there still gone)\n\nUpdate: I just talked to her and she basically looked at me like I was stupid and thought it was no problem to have the community kitchen chair in our personal living room. She cleaned up tho so I guess I\u2019ll see if she keeps it up.",

      "text": "YES. This is exactly what I'm going through right now. I have deep cleaned the kitchen and bathroom routinely (where I am it is apartment style dorms) and take the trash out after they overfill it, and I can tell who it is because the amazon packages have their names on them. I have to do their dishes all the time because these slobs are too hung over and high to do it themselves. Nasty women. I have mentioned it numerous times, but they always brush it off. I made my RA a pecan pie so I can bitch relentlessly about these wretched, disgusting people.",

Most of the time she just comes in to get stuff so I\u2019m waiting for her to come back. This is how I know it\u2019s her because the other two are a breeze and are there most of the time.",
