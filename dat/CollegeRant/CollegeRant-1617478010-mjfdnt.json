The sentiment is so bullshit because everyone was forced into it. No one has agency (professors or students) unless we all just...quit?\n\nI'm especially heated rn because one of my professors doesn't bother to the point where all the links he posts to \"teach\" us are BROKEN or use flash. He literally said \"make sure you can use flash player\" when browsers don't support it anymore. I think he made his online classes years ago and never checked to see if his shit still works. That PLUS at-home labs with hardly any instruction.... screams into the void endlessly",
