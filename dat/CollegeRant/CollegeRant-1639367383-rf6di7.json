  "text": "This fall semester was if not the hardest I\u2019ve ever had. I took a total of 15 hours which I have done before. This time I felt that professors were jerks and the amount of work due was ridiculous. I however put aside many things like my mental health and having fun for school. I sacrificed sleep and would go the extra mile for every class. I consider myself an average student but I do struggle when it comes to comprehensive exams. And boy were there many. I had so much to do everyday and I poured my heart into everything I did at school. I worked so hard all semester and when I recently got my final grades I was disappointed. My grades were not what I expected and I feel so defeated. I feel like my best wasn\u2019t good enough and I\u2019m not proud of myself. It\u2019s causing me to be uneasy back home for break and I don\u2019t wanna be upset the whole time. I just want to know if I am being too hard on myself.",

      "text": "I'm in the same situation. I have a math final tomorrow. Which I know for sure I'll fail. The teacher pretty much read word for word from a PowerPoint. I ended up deciding to go back to my community college there I'm pretty ill not have to take math classes since I completed the math requirement for that degree there. Idk but I felt most semester I'm going to not be successful. Specially since my degree that I'm at requires business calculas(I've never taken calculas of any sort). I talked to my counselor and he pretty much suggested a major tyat didn't require so much math.",

      "text": "Dude please don't beat yourself up. A 15 hour course load is a *lot* and the fact that you're still standing after a semester like that says a lot about you. Don't give up!\n\nAlso, don't feel bad about taking less classes per semester if you need to. Especially if you have a lot of other things going on like work or volunteering or anything that will end up helping your career in the future. Don't force yourself into 5 classes unless you have to. Nothing wrong with taking 3-4 classes at a time to really give those classes focus. If you're worried about finishing within a set time period, you can always take classes during the summer.",
