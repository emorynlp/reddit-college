  "text": "I went to talk to my RA about changing rooms today. I just don\u2019t know if I should or not. My roommate is very messy and I have OCD so I always come back to our room stressed and I am the only one that cleans. She also has her girlfriend over everyday and she stays the night often. She uses my stuff without asking anymore. + I go home every weekend and come back to the dorm trashed. Should I change rooms or is this just normal? I am in the library late every night studying because I can\u2019t study in my own room bc her and her girlfriend are so loud. Also can\u2019t take a shower half the time in our dorm bc her girlfriend showers EVERY DAY in our dorm. I keep sending signals that I\u2019m pissed without the awkward tension. Should I just move rooms this weekend?",

      "text": "I would confront her about her gf staying over so much and you guys can hopefully find some middle ground. Talking to the RA is the best thing to do, they are there to help! And with the mess, as long as it\u2019s on her side of the room, that\u2019s normal. But if she\u2019s leaving a mess on your side as well, that\u2019s a problem. And I would talk to her and the RA about touching your things, that\u2019s not appropriate at all.",

      "text": "Currently in a similar boat. I have ocd and was supposed to be in an accommodation but it fell through, so I got placed with two girls who happen to be dating in a suite. Constantly loud, blood on the toilet seat every month, trash over flowing even when it was just taken out. If there\u2019s any vacancies in your building, I\u2019d recommend changing rooms. If not, you might have to sit down with your roommate and set some ground rules and boundaries\n\nEdit: a word",
