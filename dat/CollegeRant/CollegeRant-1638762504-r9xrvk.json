  "text": "One of the things I have really disliked in college is having readings and homework due right after we had an exam for the same class. I mean at least give us some breathing room since we had to spent so much time reviewing all the material before bombarding us with even more. Do not forget that we have other classes to focus on as well. I can only remember 1 or 2 classes that actually took this into consideration.",
