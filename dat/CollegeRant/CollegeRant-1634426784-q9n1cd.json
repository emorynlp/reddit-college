  "text": "I have been repeatedly denied opportunities to prove myself, to make friends, to feel like a f@$&ing human being, etc. You are supposed to start working and gain experience once you turn 16. You are supposed to find your \u201cpeople\u201d in college and university. And yet, I was deemed unworthy and forced into isolation. Between the useless student clubs, and the petty asshole classmates who refused to give me a chance, I didn\u2019t have a prayers chance in hell. \n\nSo when I heard that students at other universities were receiving fines and suspensions for partying in large groups, I was feeling some schadenfreude. I was never allowed into their club, because I wasn\u2019t deemed cool enough to experience college social life, these jerks deserve these fines and suspensions",

      "text": "Don't hold yourself to past standards. Look at your situation now and reassess what can you do to adjust your approach. Other people are not always going to become your friend especially right off the bat. The goal upon meeting somebody is not instant friendship. It's a second meeting. On average, it takes 6-8 instances of \"hanging out\" with someone to form a friendship.   \n\n\nYou are not supposed to \"find your people\" in college. Even people from my college who had a rich social life who graduated now have a really lonely-seeming post-grad life. You are supposed to develop your interests and values in college. I'd say if you have low esteem for your school's social offerings, then maybe do a volunteering thing off campus and reconnect to the real world, not the college world. Personally, the lack of age diversity on college campuses really doesn't gel with me because I love hanging out with old people. You got this. Just breathe and remember that you're current situation will change if you make adjustments to your expectations now.",

      "text": "I don't think the issue is the world. I think what is holding you back is yourself. All of your issues seem to stem from preconceived notions.\n\nPerhaps the reason the students participating in the clubs deemed you \"unworthy\" was your belief of them being \"useless\". Whether you voiced this opinion or not, people are able to pick up on your attitude towards something fairly easily. Don't shit on something that someone likes and dedicates their time to and expect them to want to be your friend.\n\nAdditionally, coming in with the expectation that your classmates are petty assholes and treating them as such is certainly not the way to befriend them.\n\nYou need to open up your mind and look inside. Be willing to realize that something you do or something you say in interactions is off-putting to others. In social interactions, people mainly just care about how you make them feel.\n\nIf you need help doing this, there is no shame in talking to a therapist who can give you an outsider's view of yourself and walk you through improvements.",
