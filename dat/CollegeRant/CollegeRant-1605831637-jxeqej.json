  "text": "I fucked up this semester hard.\n\nI just got a grade back for one of my cs assignments worth 10 percent of my grade. I got a 4. Out of 100. I don\u2019t even know what to do or how to feel. It\u2019s not a mistake\u2014even as I submitted it I knew the assignment was shit. But still, a fucking 4?  It sucks too since this assignment comes so late in the semester that I can\u2019t recover my grade. My grades in that class have been decent, but that one grade dropped my class gpa from a 90 to a 75. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m having a panic attack. That is on top of another class that I\u2019m in that I bombed the test on(haven\u2019t gotten the grade back yet), but this semester is looking to be screwed. Everything fell apart in the last week. My gpa was a 94 for the semester before this week, but I think that\u2019s because my shitty grades haven\u2019t come out yet. Now, it\u2019s looking to be in the low 80s maybe. Those two classes are gonna get absolutely wrecked. I\u2019m also on the verge of failing a pass fail class(I\u2019m not yet, but I\u2019m a couple of points away).  \n\nThis semester I had such a shit mentality. I was lazy as hell, I know that. I didn\u2019t realize how much my gpa would be affected until this week when the grades for my assignments finally started pouring in. I seriously fucked this up. I still haven\u2019t told my parents about the grade(I\u2019m doing distanced learning rn). I want to cry. \n\nI talk with my friends and they all seem to be killing it this semester. Gpa wise, they say this one is the best theirs has ever been. That just made me feel even shittier. \nThis week, I procrastinated without realizing how much I procrastinated. I\u2019m realizing now that I haven\u2019t given myself enough time to really do my best\u2014again!  What am I doing...",

The semesters almost over, just try your best to push through until you can take a break. This pandemic has taken a toll on a lot of people, so try not to feel bad if you don\u2019t get the best grades.

There were two lines in my code that had the wrong variables. He is now accepting resubmissions by people who only need to change one line of code to get it to work(I guess a bunch of people emailed him after the grades came out). I just emailed him asking whether he could accept my change even though I changed two lines instead of one. Here's to hoping he accepts the change because that could conceivably bump my grade up significantly.",
