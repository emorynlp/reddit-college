  "text": "Hey guys, a little backstory, I love music, it's my biggest passion by far, and has always been my dream to be a musician for a living but I'm sure we all know that's not the most promising gig to rely on.  I don't want to be a teacher, so there's not many other options for me as a musician that I know of\n\nEver since I have decided music is unrealistic, I have been desperately been trying to find a \"new dream\", at least, something I would still equally enjoy, as well as make a living. And, be able to travel (because that's my end goal is to be able to travel).  I have exhausted countless ideas from being a photographer to a pharmacist to actuarial science, up to now, I decided out of nowhere I wanted to be a dental hygienist. Why?  I'm not even too sure\n\nYeah, the idea sounds like something I would find pretty fun to be honest but in reality, it's like a 9-5 job, with no promotions really because the higher-up IS the dentist, which takes muchhh more school than me.  And, because I don't have much control over my schedule, I won't be able to travel like I want to so badly\n\nWithout thinking about any of these aspects, I started school, as a dental hygiene major.  This was literally like two weeks ago that I started my freshman year of college.  But to be honest, I did it mainly because of my parents pressuring me to.  I couldn't decide on  what I wanted to do and they had rushed me and pressured me so heavily that I picked the next thing I could think of and went for it\n\nAnd the truth is, I'm completely MISERABLE\n\nI hate college, truly hate it and I'm not even a month into it.  My classes are spread out with anywhere from 3 to 5 hours between each one to do absolutely nothing, and my car needs repairing so my boyfriend has to drop me off at school so i literally just have to sit in a chair for up to 5 hours between classes.  It makes the days so long that on mondays, I'm at school for 13 hours.  It's actually miserable and it's caused my motivation to plummet down to where is was by the end of high school, in under 2 weeks.  It just makes me wanna not go back next semester, ESPECIALLY because I have absolutely no desire anymore to be a dental hygienist.  I was sitting (during one of my 5 hour breaks today..) in a chair today and I was so exhausted and miserable I just started crying in front of like four other people \n\nMy anxiety gets so awful from school that i bite my fingers, nails, and lips.  My lip started bleeding yesterday and literally would not stop. \n\nBut I'm at a complete loss with what to do.  I've gone back and forth about dropping out, getting a job, and working toward getting my real estate license, but I'm nervous to do something that I'm unsure I will take-off with.  But with real estate, I could travel whenever and work as much as I want to, so it sounds great and all but I just don't know anymore. \n\nI'm sorry for this ridiculous rant.  I'm not even too sure what I want out of it or what kind of advice to ask for.  I'm just struggling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have no dreams, I don't even want what I'm majoring in, I'm two weeks into my first year of college and I hate it and am considering dropping out.  My anxiety is debilitating and is pushing me to want to drop out even more.  Am considering dropping out and getting my real estate license",

Just wanted to say I\u2019m older than you and technically a sophomore (dropped out for a whole year, and am probably about to do it again while I\u2019m writing this. I really relate to how you feel. I don\u2019t have any motivation or \u201cpassion\u201d anymore, it\u2019s all been sucked out by seeing my dreams come to nothing (I\u2019m not good at anything), and just feeling beat down and like i tried too hard (alienated myself, guess everyone thought I was stuck up when really I was so worried about trying to impress people). Good luck to you in whatever you choose \ud83d\udc95. Just wanted to say you\u2019re not alone.",

      "text": "I understand how you feel. However I would recommend you go into a associates in arts program it's a basic degree and it's great if your undecided. College will get better I am going thru bullying right now at my college so don't feel bad, however just gotta keep on going forward I would ask to transfer over majors to arts and you can take music classes in the program as well.",

      "text": "What about a traveling nurse? They make pretty good money and you can move around as often as you'd like. Also there's a lot of levels of nursing; if you decide you only want to be in school for 2 years, you could still get a decent job in nursing. To me, it sounds like you need time to explore what you really want to do. There's no shame in dropping out, honestly if I were you I would drop to community college and take a variety of classes to see if you love anything, while working part-time to support yourself. If worse comes to worst and you realize you have literally no passion for anything, I'd  1. Work full time at a retail job while producing music on the side, or 2. Find the highest paying major and struggle through it. I know it sucks, but a lot of people aren't passionate about their jobs, and if you aren't passionate about anything you might as well get paid the most money to do something you hate. Good luck, and realize that it isn't the end of the world, and that lots of people have similar struggles.",

      "text": "It's good to be persistent, but remember **it is OK to quit**.  \n\nI don't know how old you are, but how do you know you cannot make a career out of music?  Yes it's tough and a lot of people make money by waiting tables or side hustles and never make it.\n\nWould you be happier having 30-40 hour a week job that pays OK, but you have time to do gigs on the weekends or evenings?  Or happier with a secure job that pays pretty well with more normal hours?\n\nIf that answer is the first - talk to your family.  Let them know what you are thinking. Maybe agree to finish the semester, but put time into your music - see if it brings you the joy you want and that the others can see your talent.  If you wind up hating the music too, at least you won't regret it for the rest of your life.  \n\nThere are other careers in music too, producing, writing, accompanying, sales, radio.  You can explore a career with a degree or without.",

      "text": "I feel this (fellow nail and lip biter). I'm a psychology major (junior) with zero life dreams or hobbies or interests. My anxiety + depression have basically sucked the personality out of me. I don't know what I want to do with my life, I barely have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and I have no marketable skills or interests that'll give me an edge in the real world. I'm also seriously considering dropping out, but then what? I'll probably end up working at Walmart or some other equally soul-sucking job. I only picked my major this last spring after being pressured by my parents and advisor to just pick something. \n\nI don't really have any advice for you, but know that you are not alone.

Plus, that way you can take music classes that you actually enjoy. I bet you will make friends in those classes too.",
