All by Wednesday for multiple classes. Then I can start my 7 peer responses for each class on Thursday and have them in by Sunday.\n\nAnd they don't even foster discussion. No one responds to my comments or answers the questions I ask and I only get \"hi I like this post because of the thing you said thank you\" comments on my post.",

The second part is due to online formatting, most students feel like they are teaching themselves. Third, there should be a distinction that every adult needs to have time to take a break. That regardless of being a professor or student, you need time to clear your head and have some free time. That isn\u2019t laziness, that\u2019s a human need and breaks are beneficial for learning. \n\nMy comment and others in this thread may not even apply to you. This is a generalisation, from someone who isn\u2019t in your class or even attending your school. But this is the difference I\u2019m seeing in the adaptation to online format. Professors are assigning an overwhelming amount of busy work, that is by definition a time sink and unhelpful. It\u2019s not helpful because it\u2019s having the inverse effect. I am not learning or getting my money\u2019s worth this quarter.  High quantity required reading/assignments, low quality studying. My entire quarter has been sat in front of my computer reading, cram studying, attending class, regurgitating what I\u2019ve learned. Forgetting and moving on to the next topic or module. There\u2019s no time for synthesis. There\u2019s no time to go over previous sections or modules. I\u2019m burnt out because I spend most my time doing required reading. For example in one class the average is: 3-5 chapters, 6 case studies, 20 articles a week, on top of biweekly essay assignments and a group project for the quarter. I\u2019ve done the reading and taken notes, attended class/participated, and turned in homework. But it\u2019s completely worthless because there is no reprieve between that class and my other classes. \n\nLimit assigned reading to what gets the message across in a concise format. Limit assignments to applying what you learn in that week or modules topic(s). Or even better, assignments don\u2019t *have* to be essays, projects, and quizzes every single week. Just because some students are passing your class with good grades, doesn\u2019t mean people with lower grades don\u2019t care or aren\u2019t managing their time effectively.",

Except perhaps *explain* to students why you have things the way you do, and some suggestions for them to strategize and make it work for them.
