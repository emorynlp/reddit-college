  "title:": "SO FUCKING DONE WITH THESE EXAMS",
  "text": "FUCK. I'm so fucking ANNOYED.\n\nJust got back my fourth midterm for my general ecology course :) 60/75 which is the same fucking score I've gotten on all of the other exams, matches the class average. My grade is a C still because the exams are weighted so heavily and there are almost no actual assignments to compensate for them. \n\nIt's *fucking bullshit* how they phrase the questions on these exams. About half of the questions are multiple choice and these are the ones I get right, and the other half are short answer and they just look like they arbitrarily subtract points and offer no explanation as to why. The questions are vague as fuck to begin with so I usually end up writing several sentences to back up my reasoning for whatever I *think* they're trying to ask. Last question on this midterm was \"what is the single greatest thing you can do to reduce your impact on the environment\" and I said lower individual carbon footprint (for example by driving less, etc). 2 out of 4 points. Zero explanation. *Why. What the fuck were they even looking for*. The only two things they talked about in terms of individual action were driving habits and and eating less meat.\n\nLost points on other questions I clearly answered with *examples from the lecture slides*. Random ass results like 3.75/5 or 1/4 on questions I thought I answered correctly. And I know for a fact I'm not bad at ecology because I have over 100% in my plant eco class. I have a research position in a forest ecology lab. This class is literally the only one I don't have an A in and it's because they suck ass at teaching and testing the material. \n\nI don't even feel like emailing the TAs at this point. Emailed them after last midterm and one said \"oh I don't know why you lost points there\" and the other said \"Birth rate and death rate are measurements, not factors\" even though I was talking about the factor of fewer pop members reaching reproductive maturity to *give birth* and more dying *due to competition*. The final is in a few days and it can replace one of the midterms but like what is the actual fucking point of that if it's going to be structured in the same way, intentionally ambiguous and frustrating. I'm so fucking annoyed and to make shit worse I have this same prof *every semester*. She's a community project advisor so any class with a community project component you answer to her. I had her for intro to ecology as well, got a B there too. It's irritating as hell.",

      "text": "Yeah sounds frustrating asf I\u2019ve had many exams form lower level courses like that built around ambiguously worded MC/TF/SA questions and it seems impossible not to miss at least a few each one bc ALL the answers seem like good ones. For the SA questions ig I am lucky tho bc I\u2019ve rarely been docked many points on them. I will always squeeze the biggest paragraph I can in there to cover every possible keyword they\u2019re looking for. \n\nI\u2019m assuming the TA does the grading right? If you really feel like you were grades unfairly on them go ahead and email them but also email the prof since one weirdly strict TA might be your problem. A lot of TAs who are new-ish to th\u00e9 US also might have trouble getting your point due to the language barrier so you never know. I mean for me death/birth rates do sound like factors for overpopulation and I really don\u2019t get how their can be one answer for the environmental impact one, unless this info was in the book not the slides and you just missed it.",

          "text": "Yeah the TAs are the ones doing the grading, and I emailed them already but I think I'll reach out to the instructors as well. The info for the last question isn't on the slides but I'm assuming they wanted us to say eat less meat lmao.\n\nThe profs are really against students asking them about test questions but since it's the end of the semester I think I'll say fuck it and ask them to take a look. Even the TAs aren't giving me real reasons why I'm receiving these grades.\n\nThanks for the advice, I appreciate it :)",

      "text": "Had a biology professor whose exams were almost entirely hypothetical questions. I fucking hate professors who make questions like, \"If Susie were to get ten apples and she sold them at an apple stand. What is the probability that 5/10 people will NOT buy an apple?\" Those little details just set you up to get the question wrong for such a simple question. My only withdrawal is from Biology 1108K just because the professor's class weighed so heavily on exams. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAND ANOTHER THING, fuck any professor who thinks that their grade average being a C is a good thing. You should strive to make sure every single student passes with an A.",

              "text": "Agreed. Plus, \u201cmake sure every single student passes with an A\u201d makes it sound like the student has zero responsibility for actually earning that A - which, by the way, indicates an excellent level of work that outperforms the average. C\u2019s used to be the average level grade, and thanks to inflation, that\u2019s probably more at a B level now. Still, that means there\u2019s some level of delineation among performance levels. If everyone has an A for a course that is anything other than a super easy filler, then there\u2019s something wrong with the way assessments of learning are done in that course.",
