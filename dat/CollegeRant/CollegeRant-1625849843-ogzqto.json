  "text": "I have been in college for a year and a half now I\u2019m gonna go into my second year soon enough and I really don\u2019t know what bachelors degree I should get but I thought by now I would have already found something that I wanted to do and I\u2019m still sitting here clueless as ever and now my counselor is telling me that I should start really thinking about what I want to do so I can start taking classes for that degree and I really don\u2019t know like nothing interest me like I really don\u2019t wanna work at all. so I figured why not just go to college maybe I\u2019ll find some thing that I would like but can\u2019t find anything like everything just doesn\u2019t seem like something I would want to do and I\u2019m just sitting here stuck.",
