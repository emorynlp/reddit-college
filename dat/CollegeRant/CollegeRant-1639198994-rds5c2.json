  "text": "This semester and the last one have been extremely rough. I had some shit happen back in January and basically lost all (2) my friends, and moved out of my apartment with them to be home. I had many breakdowns and tons of medication changes with my psychiatrist. I went to multiple therapists. Last semester I only took 3 courses and got Cs (which hey, Cs get degrees lol), but this semester I originally had 6 and dropped 4. One class was only from late Aug to mid Oct so the past couple months I\u2019ve only had one class. All my classes were online last semester and this one.\n\nMy final is due at midnight. I didn\u2019t start it, and I\u2019m not going to. I have a 12% in that class. My mental health has been all over the place and even if I ace it, my grade would only go up to 17%. \n\nIm just exhausted and losing all my motivation. My parents berated me when I had a B- average, but I can\u2019t tell them I got a fucking 12% in my ONLY CLASS. \n\nIm just starting to not care about anything and education is definitely not my top priority, but at the same time I\u2019m just so disappointed in myself. Im so scared that with my 6 classes next semester the pattern will repeat. I only have 3 semesters left (maybe 4 if I do the same shit). I don\u2019t even like my major all that much and was planning to do something I\u2019m interested in grad school but I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll make it.\n\nMy mental health is ok at the moment, but if anyone has any advice or if anyone has gone through a similar thing, please comment.\n\nEdit: what makes it worse is that I didn\u2019t get a refund for 2 of my classes. My parents don\u2019t know that. My dad pays for my college so I feel so fucking awful about that.",

Even lived at the tutoring center). If I'm right I won't have to take as much math at hacc. Idk your parents but maybe be honest with them. Ive failed a math class. I had a class one semester were I just barely passed. Got exactly 70% in the class.",
