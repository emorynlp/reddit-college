  "title:": "Why do lecturers assign readings that are literally impossible to get through?",
  "text": "What\u2019s the point? What does it actually achieve other than making students feel inadequate, overwhelmed and stressed out (thus reducing their ability to concentrate + retain information) and only having a very shallow, short term understanding of the content? \n\nI\u2019ve been prioritising the readings bc I learn best from reading and the lecturers have accents, tend to drone in a monotone voice, talk about important topics without including them on the slides, then include things in the quizzes that weren\u2019t in the lectures. \n\nI always thought I was good at reading but it takes me 2 hours just to get through just 5 pages. I can\u2019t reasonably get through 1.5 - 3 chapters of science content in a week, 2 hours of mini lectures, another 2 hour lecture, a weekly quiz worth 40% of my grade, as well as other little bits of video/content and taking notes and actually absorbing and understanding it all. I\u2019ve been putting in 15+ hours a week just for ONE unit and still barely making a dent in the content, while completely neglecting my other unit. \n\nI\u2019ve heard people and my classmates say they don\u2019t actually expect you to get through it all and you don\u2019t have to read everything but then why say it\u2019s prescribed/essential? Why not just call it background reading?\n\nPeople always say, JuSt PrIOrItIsE but why should you have to in the first place? Why not just prescribe a reasonable amount of weekly content that can be read and actually understood thoroughly?",

I look for real world application and interaction.  I am a undergrad, took a webinar that a professor at my school gave, she said most graduate programs don\u2019t even want or allow you to site from the textbook, so I ask them, what\u2019s the point of the textbook? Why is it required?\n\nBesides, the textbook usually adds a bunch of uselessness around the main point, by the time I have gotten to the main point, i haven\u2019t even absorb it.

      "text": "Honestly, with regard to the \"just prioritise!\" people, I feel like the lecturers who assign such a ridiculous amount of reading are the ones that should learn to prioritise. When teachers are passionate about their field it can be easy for them to go overboard in wanting too share too much all at once, but they need to understand that they only have a limited amount of class, and students have only limited amount of time to do the work for that class. \n\nAnother factor that plays a role I think is that this would require teachers to put in more time and effort to narrow down which information is the most crucial to their course. I imagine it's tempting for teachers, who are also very busy themselves, to give students a big list of reading and let them figure it out for themselves. They rationalise this by arguing that it's valuable to learn to evaluate information yourself, but I think it's more the fact that they simply don't want to bother doing it themselves. Teachers who assign a more focused reading every week and list the rest as background demonstrate that they're willing to put in time and effort to make it easier for their students. I've had teachers like that, thankfully, and they were great. You could tell that they really cared. That's why I do think we need to acknowledge it takes more effort on the teacher's part to develop a more concentrated course plan.",

To make up for the 4\u00bd hours we were to meet in person, she assigned \"2 hours\" of reading and 2 \u00bd hours of videos to watch. Her 2 hours of reading was more like 4-6 hours of reading for us. She assigned journals/scientific articles that were 20-30 pages long each. On top of that, she made sure we had work for the amount of hours we were to spend on her class each week (I think around 13 hours per week) so she made sure we had assignments to work on which was about 3-4 hours, 1-2 hour zoom meeting, and then the rest was our field experience... I hated it. I called her out on it and told her I basically wasn't doing the reading because I didn't have enough time considering I'm a full time student in other classes (we all were and no one had the time). And of course she asked questions about the readings in the meetings instead of teaching us so my grade was impacted but I also called her out on other issues with the class so I'm pretty sure my grade was also impacted by that. In 4 years of college, her and her class is what caused me to start drinking. I legit was having a breakdown every week (do was one other student...we kind of did the work together even though we weren't supposed to and participated the same and yet somehow she did better than me...like we shared documents, had the same amount of good information, and format)...",

Remember that the average in your final years is more important than your average at the beginning. When we review student transcripts, if a student has B's or C's in their first year but solid A's in year four, we will consider them to be an A student. It shows personal growth. \n\nOne other point of advice -- the thing that most helps you remember and understand is synthesis, or putting the ideas to work. That means that using the knowledge, or re-writing in your own words, or teaching it to somebody else are all valuable activities. Don't waste your time highlighting every sentence.

They should reinforce each other, and it's best not to do everything all at once. The trick with the pandemic is setting a routine for yourself.\n\n2.) As for time spent, almost all accredited universities use the credit hour system. The credit hour system tells professors how much time to assign for homework for each class. Most classes are typically 3 credit hours, but there are lots of exceptions. The standard course load for an American student is 12-15 credit hours per semester/quarter (4-5 courses). \n\n The golden rule here is that you should be prepared to spend 3 hours studying/doing homework outside of class for every 1 hour in class. This means for a typical 3 credit hour class you will have 3 hours of lecture + up to 9 hours of study time. In total, a 3 credit hour class could take up to 12 hours per week. So, a student with a full course load has up to 60 hours per week of school -- more than a full-time job!\n\nThis is how the system was designed and courses are built to fit this system. This presents very serious challenges to students who are working full or part-time jobs. If you are balancing school and work, I would expect it to be extremely difficult to stay on top of a full course load.",

For my Modern Political theory course, my professor assigns too many pages of reading, and since the texts are difficult to understand I spend a shit ton amount of time annotating the texts, then reading a summary to make sure I got the gist of it, and then watching YouTube videos to really make sure I got a sold understanding. But doing this for each chapter and section of each chapter, which is several pages long, is just a long and tedious process. If this were my only course, I would be able to do it, but since it is not I can not be able to complete it. Heck, by now I haven't completed any of my readings!! I just try to read as much as possible and by next week I read something else since now we are talking about another philosopher.",

      "text": "As a lifelong terrible learner and still an older than average adult student, Ill try to give you some tips I have *never* mastered:\n\n1) You\u2019re not supposed to read all of it. Depending on your major there are a lot of sections where the title says it all but the content is dense and unnecessary. If you think you understand what the section or chapter is about, then skim until you get lost/confused and go back to the last thing you understood. Continue reading until you get to the place where you were originally confused and check if you get it now. Rinse and repeat.\n\n2) Go to office hours. Go to office hours. Go to office hours. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! I never did this and still dont and its my fatal flaw every time. Professors that do this 100+ page nonsense often have some weird, unnecessary, and stupid motive behind doing it. Whether its finding out who is trying hard or who will be their next TA. Either way, if you go to office hours, its likely youll find out what they want you to focus on or what is actually relevant. From friends I have that have gone to office hours, sometimes those professors straight up give the answers to the quiz or test.\n\n3) I dont really have a third point, but dont be too hard on yourself either. If you feel comfortable with the material then feel free to give yourself a little slack. If you dont ever feel comfortable with the material, then seriously consider if youre in the the right major. From my experience, I spent years (and money) stressing myself out over material that I was never going to understand in a semester. Once I moved to an adjacent field with concepts I could grasp my GPA and mental health improved greatly...at least relatively.\n\nIf all of this is nonsense and not helpful then all I can say is keep on keepin on. Its not forever and youll be so freaking happy when its over.",

I'm a teacher and a phd candidate, and even for grad students reading can be one of the hardest things to get right.\n\nbut point one of this is really important - there's a strategy to reading. you don't need to read every single word. but you can still read it to get the message.\n\na reading strategy should go something like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* read the abstract if there is one (in a journal article there will be, on a book it'll be more like the blurb on the back page)\n* for a book, read the table of contents (it'll give you an idea of how the argument flows, you can see which topics or themes are important.)\n* read the footnotes - who is cited? this will give you an idea of which scholarly conversations the book/article is engaging with. it may also include names you already know, which means you can mentally locate the argument within the field (for instance, in my humanities phd, if they cite Foucault, Derrida, etc, I know they're located within French theorists of the late 20th century and all that they stood for. even if they're rejecting those arguments, it's still part of that conversation)\n* then read the introduction, that should give a brief(ish) overview of the argument and how it develops throughout the article/book (and in a book also will provide a preview of what each chapter is about.)\n* then (in a book) read the first and last paragraph or so of each chapter - that will give you an overview of the chapter and its argument\n* finally, read the conclusion.\n* make notes throughout, try to summarize the main argument or points, you may need to dip into other sections if you're looking for quotations or supporting evidence, but by doing this you should get a general idea of what the article or book is about, what it's arguing, and how.\n\nand yeah, go to office hours to clarify things that are confusing, and maybe ask the prof how they want you to read. the strategy above is VERY general and things may differ a little by field. so ask! say to the prof something like: I'm finding the amount of reading new and a little overwhelming. I've heard there are strategies for academic reading that allow us to make these readings more manageable, I will try to implement that, but could you tell me what you are looking for us to gain from these readings? should I be more focused on argument or method? or something else?\n\nthey should be able to guide you.\n\nnow, if only I could take my own advice....",

It can be about how you are doing in the class, a specific homework assignment, or anything related to the class. \n\nAside from that, I spent a few years in the US military and they don't teach like college professors do, but I wish they did. Military \"teachers\" tell you directly and clearly what you need to know. There isn't any guessing and there isn't any games. College for better or worse isn't like that, which you are obviously experiencing. \n\nThat said, don't worry about 100 pages that you don't understand. Try to find the 20-50 pages that make sense and can help you form a concept of the material. Then use the other pages if you are confused or need to clarify.\n\nAs a simple example: imagine you are making a pizza from a recipe. The first step is to make the dough. If you know how to make pizza dough, then you make it and move on. If you don't know how to make pizza dough then you go back to the section (or Google) and you learn how to make pizza dough. Then you can move on to the next step. \n\nIt's a pain in the ass and it's not always fun, but that's learning. Like anything else. Take your time and understand you're getting better, and you're human, and you'll get there. It just takes some time and some curse words.",
