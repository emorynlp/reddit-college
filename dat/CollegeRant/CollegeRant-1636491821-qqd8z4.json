  "text": "What the title said. I'm trying to get into graduate school and my recommender is dragging their feet, if even that. After they agreed to write a letter, I sent the link over a month ago and my application is still incomplete. Then, on the 1st I emailed them about the deadline (the 15th) and as of right now I have received no response from them.\n\nI'm feeling absolutely frustrated because time is running out. Friday I emailed an old professor for a last minute letter. No response yet, which is fine, but if that goes to shit I could very well be SoL.\n\nAnd on top of all that, I pointed out in my initial request that I'm trying to work out graduate research at the university, so being accepted (in a timely manner) was important. So far it seems that my application will literally be submitted on the last day, IF that. I've never actually witnessed unprofessionalism like this. I'm fucked.",

      "text": "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but there\u2019s still plenty of time before the deadline (Nov. 15). Since they agreed to write the letter, great. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to submit it early. Admissions committees don\u2019t look at applications (including letters) until after the deadline has passed anyway. You might send another gently worded email reminding them that the deadline is coming up, but otherwise calm down.",

Today, a week later, I have sent another gentle reminder and (thus far), you guessed it, no response.\n\nMaybe they still plan on submitting a letter but I have no way of knowing that which so close to the deadline in my opinion is out of line. I can't just twiddle my thumbs for the next week hoping they'll submit something.",

A few days ago, I emailed them and literally said \"Please just let me know if you still intend on submitting anything. I need to have a plan in place.\" NOTHING.\n\nLuckily, I scrapped together a back up plan in time but if I had just sat on my ass like was suggested to me itt I would've been screwed. I still might, might not get accepted lol, but at least my application was submitted.",
