  "text": "Got a last minute paper assigned that\u2019s due tonight. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but I thought no big deal I\u2019ll take all day to write it. But of course it\u2019s so goddamned noisy, lots of construction going on, and loud cars playing bass music and parking in front of my place, plus there\u2019s a lot of necessary things I have to take care of today: dealing with my landlord knocking on my door wanting rent and wanting to argue, the vet calling about my cat, our family doctor calling for phone consults, family with ill health calling me frantically wanting answers to their questions today, won\u2019t wait till tomorrow. I\u2019m still cruising along writing but man I miss writing papers in my school library where I could disappear from the world, nobody could find me to interrupt or demand I talk to them right now.",

Then had the audacity to email us the next day about how hard it is to grade all of our essays. I haven\u2019t gotten one grade back on any of my essays so theoretically I can get a random D at the end of this semester. Why the fuck do we even write essays for?",

I mean finding sources and pulling quotes can take at least a few days.\n\nAnd although the only professor I have that assigns essay is a lot nicer, I feel your pain with the pain of doing assignments at home \n\nPeople don't seem to get that just because you're at home doesn't mean you can just stop every 5 minutes to do whatever they want you to (if I had a penny for every time someone interrupted mid-lecture to make me take out the trash or something, I could have afforded to go to a better school)",
