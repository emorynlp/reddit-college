  "text": "My professor assigned my class a review sheet for the final and you can get an extra credit of 5 points if you complete it. The questions and all the answers were straight from her PowerPoints and other resources. I completed mine and sent it in. Some of the students in the group chat from that class asked if anyone completed the review sheet. I said that I did and someone texted me asking for a copy of it. I sent it to them told them to make a few changes and then he asked if he can send it to the class. I agreed and said just tell them to make some changes if they can. Was that a bad idea? I just thought since I copied all the answers from the resources that were posted that everything was right there.",

Yes, all the answers are throughout PowerPoints and resources, but you had to comb through the material to find the answers, and by doing so, you were reviewing the material. Handing another student your completed review to turn in means that that student isn\u2019t reviewing the material, and is only turning it in for the 5 points.",

If they go down you will get in trouble with them equally and no one will care that you had good intentions. Next time someone asks a good response might be \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not comfortable sharing because of the honor code, but I can help you know where to find the material or understand something if you\u2019d like.\u201d That way you\u2019re saying no but still being helpful. That being said though I\u2019m sure you will be okay this time around, don\u2019t stress over it too much!",
