  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to juggle work, finals, and studying for the TEAS but after doing so many practice problems and self guided review sessions I felt really ready. So I bought two ATI practice tests and took the first one today, and got a 76%. Particularly I did pretty damn bad on the math portion. I\u2019m taking the test on the 18th and still have hard finals to study for so I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to bring my score up. I\u2019ve been getting such bad brain fog from stress to make matters worse. And the community programs here in California are ironically so competitive that I feel like I\u2019ll be screwed if I score a 76% on the actual exam. What do I do from here? I\u2019ll only have two fulls review days before the ATI since I still have finals next week!",
