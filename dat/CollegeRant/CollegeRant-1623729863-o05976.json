  "text": "So I am a geography major which is very uncommon. So uncommon that my community college doesn't even offer all the classes I need for my major. I was lucky enough to even see that they were going to offer the last class I needed in the summer, so I did not hesitate to sign up. I just got the email that they canceled the class...They have not offered this class in years and they're not offering it next school year either. What the frick.",

I am uncertain what your financial situation looks like but if there are numerous community colleges in your area, you may be able to take the class at one of the nearby community colleges and transfer it to your degree. I needed courses in anthropology, social statistics, and social psychology and this has been my route.",

              "text": "I\u2019d still ask and see if there is a way this requirement can be met by either an alternative course like independent study, or by substituting another course. It\u2019s definitely worth asking about. Schools sometimes space out courses especially upper level courses, and will only offer them every so often, every other year, one per year, etc in an effort to save money and wait for a time when more students can take the course. Graduation metrics are also really important to colleges, so if this class is holding you back from graduating, they will find a way to resolve this issue for you.",

      "text": "Is there a possibility of getting the course as an independent study, or of substituting another course?\n\nAlternatively (assuming you're going to transfer) you may be able to just transfer without it, if you don't NEED the AA for something specific. If you're in one of the states where you really need the AA, you may be able to change to something general like \"transfer studies\" and transfer without it.",

That's why it was vital I took this course (that was canceled) once I saw it available.
