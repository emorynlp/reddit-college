When you're writing, all you have to do is select the style you want to use and it will do 99% of the work for you for in text citations and your bibliography. Literally to do an in text citation you just click add citation, choose the source that you saved in your library that you're citing, and it will insert it for you in the correct format. Then when you're all done writing, you just click add bibliography and it adds all of your sources from your essay automatically in the right format with the correct indents and spacing.\n\nZotero is free and also synchronizes your library across devices.",

Reach out to university counseling services obviously, but also reach out disability services to get accommodations even if you don't think you're \"bad\" enough to need to them. And do it as early as possible because the demand is high but the staffing is low\n\n2. University is kinda bullshit because you're paying thousands of dollars a year to teach yourself, especially in engineering. A lot of gen-ed professors are really nice and actually make an effort to teach you in a way so you'll retain the material, 200/300/400 level engineering professors? Not so much\n\n3. Two years of remote learning and almost every class being open notes or having little to no proctoring,  pretty much killed everyone's ability to study properly now that we're back in person. Also commuting is brutal after just having to wake up and turn on your computer\n\n4. Universities are businesses first and foremost and will always care about profits over people, even during fucking pandemics.\n\n5. If you're not a resident and you don't have your own car, you will soon find you're not above sleeping on the floor, especially in those library study rooms\n\n6. Work/life balance is key. Don't spend all your time goofing off but you gotta have friends (seriously mine are one of main reasons I didn't straight up attempt unaliving)\n\n7. Whenever possible, go to campus events for free stuff. Most of it is pretty lame, but I managed to snag a sweatshirt, a mug, and so much free food.",
