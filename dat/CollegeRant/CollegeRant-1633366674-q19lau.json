  "text": "My college strikes again. This time its even more stupid and they won't even take responsibility. I cannot specify what happened but basically I got ambushed by lecturers when I told them that the college\u2019s info always arrives last minute. I was like \u201cpls its so slow\u201d and they were like didn\u2019t admit their mistake, took my words and threw it back at me like tf- please? take responsibility?! I sat there for like 30 mins listening to them whine about it. Well my trust in adults went from a bit to almost non-existent now. \n\n\nTl:dr I don\u2019t think it was that long but uhh basically I got ambushed by my lecturers.",
