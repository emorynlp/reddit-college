  "text": "Hi all! I graduate this May, and I'm currently feeling like I just wasted my time in college. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to go into STEM. By the time I got to middle school, that dream pretty much died, and I became discouraged and didn't think anything was worth the effort if I couldn't get it right the first time. I went to a really competitive high school and I really just didn't try anymore because everyone seemed like geniuses. I really did enjoy math and my science classes, I even took AP Chem even though I was the worst in the class. By the time we had to apply to college, I had a mediocre GPA and no passion for anything. I got into a state school, and I chose to major in something that came easily to me: English. I am taking my last class for it this semester and then I graduate. I feel like I haven't learned *anything*worthwhile. Everything I have learned I could literally just look up on SparkNotes or Shmoop. Every paper I write ends up being the same and I just feel bored. And because I truly don't know what to do with my life and just the general dissatisfaction at what I chose to study, I am going to pursue a teaching credential after graduation, just for the time being. While I teach, I'll save up money and whatnot, since my parents paid for my education this time around. I really would like to go back to school in the future for something STEM related and go into research, but I just cannot see this happening, I feel like I am just crazy. I truly wish I had just bitten the bullet and pushed myself these past 4 years. The only time I truly felt like I was learning something was during a G.E Biology course I took 2 years back. It was awesome and I loved it. I even considered changing my major to biology back then. Although my interests lie in astrophysics, science is just so much more satisfying to learn, you know? I think I should've just gotten over my fear of failure and gone for it. Anyways, is going back to school later in life at least possible? Or am I out of my mind? I turn 22 next month, I don't plan on having kids anytime soon, nor getting married. I seriously cannot see myself teaching until I retire, and I feel like my B.A in English is basically worthless. Ahh! I seriously regret choosing English. No disrespect to any fellow English majors, but my passions just aren't within the pages... Any advice is appreciated!\n\nTL:DR: I feel like I chose the wrong major and shoulda gone for STEM. Will be going into teaching for the meantime, but I want to go back to school for STEM in the future.",

      "text": "For now, I think you should start teaching cause in that way there's some money flowing into your bank account. Meanwhile, why not check out some online courses on STEM? I don't know which specific subject you want to go into, but there are tons of available online courses. If after a couple of years of teaching, you saved enough money to go back to school without taking out a student loan, go do it. But I think there are already other cheaper, more convenient ways of learning, especially learning online. So try to explore that possibility.",

Honestly I feel like if you're not getting some sort of tech training for a specific job (like a doctor), the whole thing is kinda pointless. Not to rag on humanities or anything (spanish/hist major here) but I think they're way more intuitive and pushing for everyone to go to college is just creating a qualification saturation.",

I didn\u2019t enjoy any of my classes expect for these design classes I took as electives. Really considering going back to school for graphic design or interior design once I have a stable career. \n\nMy issue is my family is Asian, so to them majors that aren\u2019t engineering, business, medical, or lawyer is useless. So I felt pressured to pick a major that would make a good amount of money over what I would actually enjoy. I honestly realized I hated my major halfway through college and would\u2019ve changed it but had no idea what I wanted to change to at that time so I just kept going. Now I\u2019m stuck with a degree I hate and trying to figure out how I can change it",

Soon after my older brother was born (prematurely), she was offered a job at a big high school. She couldn\u2019t dedicate time to both her premature son and that job. She said no to the job.

      "text": "I know how you feel. I've always wanted to go to an elite college/university and become a doctor. I did very well in elementary school and middle school, but once I got to high school I kind of slacked, but I graduated with a 3.8 gpa. Once I went a college that I nearly had a full scholarship at (I only had to pay $2k of my own money for the semester) I hated it. I was a Chemistry and Optical Engineering major and the classes were great, but the dorm life/social life on campus killed it for me. I went back home and went to community college as an Engineering major...I ended up hating that too. I am now back to a Chemistry major since I do understand Chemistry and math compared to the other classes that I have taken.\n\nAnyway, I would say to just go for another major once you finish your degree! You don't want to be stuck teaching if you don't actually enjoy it. I feel like the worst teachers/professors are the ones who don't enjoy their job and only do it because they are qualified to do it. I know that you said that your parents paid for your tuition, but if you are able to pay your way through another major then go for it! I'm sure that it won't take as long since I am assuming that you have gotten your general education requirements out of the way.\n\nI'm pretty sure that lots of people that have graduated already or are currently studying right now HATE or don't enjoy their majors. My point is to do what you actually want to do right away. If I actually end up hating my life as a chem. major, then I will go for a different one EVEN IF it means that I have to take out private loans (in case F.A. is no longer available). I have a mindset like if I have exceptional student loans for college with a major that I love, then I do not mind the debt. It may be a bad mindset, but if you're doing what you love then the cost should not matter (at least if you are able to live comfortably). Good luck to you!",

I didn't know what I wanted to do and I could only see myself landing a marketing job, which I knew I would hate. I stuck with it for a little while longer before realizing it wasn't worth it. I dropped all my classes I had set up for the next semester and hit the drawing board of figuring out what I wanted to do. It's been a year since I made that decision and I have now been accepted to nursing school and I couldn't be more excited. Do what you are passionate about and the rewards will follow.",

      "text": "WOW I feel like I just read something I wrote but forgot about writing it! I am in the exact. same. boat.\n\nAbsolutely loved science, my goal was to major in either meteorology or astrophysics, and then get my masters in something combining the two. However, I was too afraid. Like you, compared to everyone else out my high school I wasn\u2019t the smartest and people definitely outscored me. I also took AP Chem as well and although I didn\u2019t excel in the class like my other classmates I still enjoyed it so much. But, when it came time to go to college I just went the easy route. I went in undeclared my first year because I wasn\u2019t exactly sure, and then I ended up declaring as an English major with a teaching certificate. I\u2019m a senior as well and am 21 (turning 22 in a month).\n\nI have beaten myself up for the past 4 years for not challenging myself. I have cried myself to sleep some nights because of this. My boyfriends brother graduated from high school last year and he is now majoring in astrophysics, and man, every time I talk to him I just think \u201cthat should be me\u201d and I just get really bummed about it. And his brother was just like me in high school as well, smart, but not the \u201csmartest\u201d. Yet he still went with it. And I really wish that was what I did.\n\nI have been thinking the same thing, about going back to school later on down the road. It does seem a little crazy because I can\u2019t even imagine going to school again, and for some reason society really labels people who aren\u2019t the \u201cconventional\u201d age for college to be failures if they\u2019re in school. But I just know that it would be something I\u2019d be really happy with, and that\u2019s all that should matter.\n\nAnd honestly, I have heard of SO many people going back to school a second time around, including my brother. He got a degree in business, however 8 years later at the age of 30 he just graduated from some IT program this past December and got a job in IT making $120,000 a year, THREE times what his business degree job got him. Also, he\u2019s just super happy and loves his job (so far, at least lol). So that really made me feel okay with the possibility of going back to school, that there\u2019s other people in the same boat and that they can be just as successful \n\nIt\u2019s so dumb that people expect us to know exactly what we want to do when we graduate from high school too. Hardly anyone knows what they want to do forever. So there\u2019s always going to be a lot of people going back to school or even just getting a job that doesn\u2019t relate to the degree they have.\n\nSorry for such a long comment. Your post just really really really sounds like me and I had to spew out some of my thoughts!\n\nEdit: I also realize we have somewhat similar usernames haha. I swear we are the same person lmao",

          "text": "I definitely agree with the after high school comment. Lots of teens think that they know what they want to do with their life until they're actually in the moment. I remember that I always wanted to live the \"college experience\" but once I was actually there, I was like never mind. Maybe it's because I am an introvert who tries to be an extrovert, but the point is that I always wanted to live through that experience until I actually lived it for a semester almost. \n\nI wish you luck while you're finishing your studies. I used to pick myself apart when I didn't challenge myself. I was quite lazy in the past, but if I were to take the \"regular\" classes instead of honors or AP classes, I would feel bad about myself since I would not be challenging myself as the \"regular\" classes were quite elementary at my high school. It's good for your brother for landing that job! That is a great salary. In the end, if you hate what you're doing, do something to change it. I'm sure that most people will be happy to pursue what they love doing instead of doing something that they don't love to do.",

Granted you will have to do the prerequisite classes either before or during the degree.

Applying an English major to a STEM major is a great talking point in interviews and personal statements!
