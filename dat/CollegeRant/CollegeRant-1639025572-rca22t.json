  "text": "I work in a child care center and we\u2019re extremely low staff so we have been working insane hours. I just put my two weeks in becuase I can\u2019t take it anymore. There are more reasons in burnt out but I won\u2019t go into detail. I currently have a B in the class but I\u2019m behind 5 assignments and the class ends in less than two weeks. I get a pell grant so I\u2019m afraid if I bomb the class it\u2019ll get taken away. Years ago when I first started college I failed my first couple classes and they took it away, I convinced them to give it back to me and I\u2019ve maintained decent grades As and Bs and a decent GPA 3.3. Im only 3 classes away from my associates on top of this. How screwed will I be if I let myself fail this class. I\u2019m so burnt out. I\u2019m at the point where I almost don\u2019t even care. Also it being online and having ADHD makes it so much harder to focus.",
