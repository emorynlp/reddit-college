  "title:": "Afraid I\u2019m going to fail classes for the first time",
  "text": "So basically in High school I graduated with a 4.0. I was such a good student truly I loved learning and I was good at it. This is my first year of college and I did really well my first semester and got an A in every class except my Calculus class where I got a B. I\u2019m a humanities person going to a business school so when I started taking my prerequisites this semester I just felt like I was swimming in waters so unfamiliar to me. I tried my best, but I\u2019m in danger of failing my economics and statistics classes. I\u2019ve never failed a class before and I feel like a failure. I should mention I go to one of the best/hardest business schools in the country and that both of my professors were poor teachers and assigned unhelpful assignments. Nonetheless I\u2019m blaming myself for not just \u201cgetting it\u201d like I always have and that my trying my hardest just didn\u2019t seem to be enough. I haven\u2019t taken the finals yet and there IS still hope, but I think I\u2019m trying to just reconcile with the idea of failing a class and needing to retake it. I\u2019m so tired man college is so stressful.",

      "text": "The good thing is that you can always retake the class to get a better grade. However, I do want to point out that just because you were an excellent student in high school doesn't necessarily mean that you will be an excellent college student. Correlation does not mean causation. That's one thing that college has taught me. For example, I wasn't the greatest student in high school. I got the occasional B's and C's. I graduated with a 3.0 GPA. Recently, I just graduated with my Associate's and got a 3.8 GPA. Turns out, I'm not such a bad student after all. I think the issue is that you need to get help before you fail. Don't wait until the last minute to do so. Go to your campus and seek out a tutor. Seek help online from fellow classmates. You said that there is still hope? Well, then you better get your behind to studying! Also, ask your professors for extra credit. The worst thing they can do is tell you no. Plus, don't give up! You have to give it your all even up to the finishing line!",

Studying hard could also mean brute force rereading page after page and not understanding poo. \"Study hard\" just seems like unhelpful college marketing bs. \n\n\"Study effectively\" would be the good way to do it. \n\nI'm guessing Pomodoro Method of 25 min study 5 break, notes, summarize, keywords, meaning, concepts, big small picture, little details, explain to yourself like you would to a baby, friend, someone else completely oblivious to the subject type of learning.",

              "text": "I have a friend who is becoming a doctor who used the Pomodoro method. Although it worked for him, it did not work for me. We all have different ways of studying hard. Mine is not only studying the textbook but also researching any other information that is out there on the Internet. Gaining other perspectives is a great way to study. What many don't realize is that college is not so cookie-cutter. Sometimes, you have to change your methods of studying in order to efficiently understand the material.",
