  "title:": "I failed college the first time... Two years later I want to try again. Help me please",
  "text": "I am a 20 year old girl, I graduated high school in 2019 and immediately went to a community college that following fall semester. I guess you can say I did fine the first couple weeks of college, it was definitely an adjustment though as I graduated from a very small private religious school. About two months in, me and my boyfriend of 3 years broke up, and it took a huge toll on me. Soon after that my grandfather passed. Everything hit me at once and I fell into a huge depression, causing me to neglect my schoolwork as a whole. Naturally, I flunked out. I failed everything. Embarrassing, huh? I didn't have the guts to tell anyone that, nearly two years later and only my close family knows that. Everyone else just thinks I dropped out to \"take some time to figure out what I wanted to do\". Then the pandemic hit and I was at a complete standstill about what I wanted to do with my life. I've been through so many different career options, and now, two years later, I believe I've figured it out. I want to go back to school to become a dental hygienist. For the first time in a long time I feel like I'm ready to figure things out. I am very optimistic about it, but the only thing is I have no idea where to start from here. How do I apply to another college? Will they even acknowledge my application because I have flunked before? I literally have no idea what to do. And no one I ask in my family seems to know either. I need some serious guidance. If you are educated on the topic, help me!! I beg of you.",

      "text": "Something similar happened to me. I flunked a semester of college, too. I was put on a semester of academic probation, and when I failed that too, I was asked to leave. It was a 4-year institution. I had fucked up. And once you failed there, it was no going back. Two years later I had built up the gumption to go back to school. I enrolled at a different 4-year school on some kind of probationary status.  I was not able to take a full course load until I hit a passing GPA for a full year. I did it and eventually graduated.  It felt good.   \n\n\nGraduating in 2019 wasn't that long ago, so your HS grades will still help you.  If you apply to the same institution you were at before, be straight up with them, they might let you back in\u2013 different schools have different policies. Or you can apply to a different school. If you apply there you can say why it might be a better fit for you, or you might be able to ignore your transcript from your community college and use your high school transcript instead. If you are sure you want to go back to school. The first step is to contact the admissions office and speak to someone there. Good Luck and don't give up.",

However, know that 95% of the people in that subreddit are rising high school seniors applying to college. But try asking your question there. Good luck!",
