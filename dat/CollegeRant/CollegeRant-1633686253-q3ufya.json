  "title:": "The University is a Dystopian Institution and it Would be better off for humanity if it ceased to exist",
  "text": "Note: I've  been writing this over a long time span, and due to a little more free time in my schedule, i decided to finish this up and post it here. If you're wondering why it's so long, that's why.\n\nI can't handle but feel like i am the only one who sees this. In almost every aspect, University has shown itself to be a place to have the lower classes compete against each other for scholarships, graduate program placements, and other pieces of paper you would otherwise wipe your ass with whilst enslaving them with student loan debt that forces them to become compliant wage slaves for life. It would ultimately be better if it didn't exist as an Institution, and if we gained knowledge through practical experience or via apprenticeship or mentorship.\n\nSo Here are a couple reasons why i think this:\n\n- Loss of Individuality and The University Stigma:\n\n     We do not live in the 1800s anymore. Post secondary education isn't the place where the world's smartest 0.1% go anymore. It's become mandatory for everyone to do, because no one will hire you if you don't have a piece of paper that as the participation sticker on it that says \"you did it!\". \n\nWith that being said, most people get accepted to uni and think that their Pythagoras or something just because they go to University. Most students are stupid and fall into this herd mentality of sorts. As a result, they try to fit in to this idealized version of a University attendee, and in turn surpress their own individuality.\n\nI found it very sad when i was waiting for my lecture to start, and looked around to see that I'm the only one not staring at my phone. It's just so lonely not having anyone to talk to. They should be greeting each other and asking how their days are going.\n\n When I'm home, i have online classes too. To be honest, i feel more and more like the guy in the office cubicle in front of the computer screen from the music video of Pearl Jams' song \"Do the Evolution\" which is partly why I decided to make this post in the first place.\n\n The students are mindless drones, and another good example of this is the fact that even in between classes, students will only ever talk about School. It's either about one of the 5-8 assignments I already spent 6 hours on the previous night, or about the Professors and how highly regarded their bullshit research is. I personally don't give a shit, my mind is about to burst from stress and sleep deprivation, I'd rather talk about you, your life, and your interests, not this suffocating Institution just because you want to sound scholarly. Honestly, even a discussion on what you've been watching lately would be interesting, but too bad you are too insecure to express yourself. \n\n It's not immature to be a University student and have interests you like to talk about, even if it's with friends at school.\n\n- Setting up Competition amongst each other:\n\n     We have all seen that one guy in every college related/student related subreddit. He's the guy who always calls students lazy and puts himself on a pedestal. He believes in that University Stigma i was talking about earlier, and claims to be a Scholarly, Hard working, model student when he's most likely trying to compensate for the fact that he is none of those. Most importantly, he puts others down so he can look better than the rest, and Universities and Colleges thrive off of this. \n\nEven getting internships is ridiculous, which essentially amounts to hundreds if not thousands of people applying for a job where they'll just get coffee for people and do secretary level work anyways. So much for being educated and scholarly individuals.\n\nThey want people to fight each other for scholarships, internships, and graduate program placements so that they forget about how much they're being fucked over. I have seen multiple instances of people giving false advice. And for what purpose other than to put down someone else who did nothing wrong to you. They just do it to push ahead, but longer down the line in life they usually end up having lots of enemies who screw them over in a similar fashion and the only one who really profited in  the end is the University who took their tuition money.\n\n- Expensive Tuition and Useless Fees:\n   \n     If you want clear evidence that University is an extortion ring, this is it. In order to gain an essential item (diploma) to get a job to put bread on  your plate, you have to pay HUGE tuition and pay extra thousands to retake failed courses in the summer (even if it isn't your fault), parking fees so that you can leave your car on a square of pavement for a few hours, an involuntary voluntary donation fee, lab fees, auxiliary fees, dental plans, health plans, student card replacement fees, breathing fees, farting fees, bathroom fees, and a fee that allows any staff member to walk into the middle of the campus, pick out any student, and start spanking them.\n\nNow granted, some of the fees i listed don't actually exist yet, but it wouldn't be surprising if they did.\n\nStudent loan debt is obviously the biggest problem here, but most people already know why, so I'm jyst going to state that it's there so that poorer people stay poor and become wage slaves after college and leave it at that.\n\n- Shitty Professors and their inability to get fired for anything \n\n     Alot of the time, Professors are only hired for their research first, and then mandated to teach to students, so they just half ass it because they don't care. TAs are even worse, i once had one in my very first semester who could not even solve a projectile motion question, which is high school level stuff. I ultimately failed that assignment because he spent more than half the time using my pencil to try and do it himself. When complaining to the Professor, he just pretended to care and did nothing to what in any other field of employment would be considered a fireable blunder and a massive showcase of incompetency.\n\nProfessors also like to choose people they personally like to be TAs, and not actual helpful ones. The indian and muslim Professors tend to choose only their own people, which is obviously racist as it gives unequal opportunity. Same for white professors too. \n\nI've even had TAs fail to attend entire lab sessions all together, forcing us to wait for hours like idiots. I've had TAs be late to lab sessions regularly. \n\nIt's so fascinating how these problems get bigger the further you get into the program, as if they want to reel you in to the point where it's no longer financially viable for you to drop out.\n\nThe profs themselves are easily the worst aspect of University. You are paying so much for being taught things so you can get your degree and fuck off, but will never get good instructions half the time. Sometimes you don't even understand what the hell they're even saying, other times they force you to buy their textbooks. They freak out if they're at risk for losing their jobs, when they could get another one easily with all the experience they have. Meanwhile, if i fail one course for no good reason other than poor instruction, i could end up on the street and starving with no hope for a job that can pay the bills because I can't even get my foot in the door.\n\nIt's so obvious how they use jokes and humour to distract students from the fact that half the lecture is filled with unnecessary irrelevant shit we'll never see on the exam. And they fall for it every time, because once again, the students only care about feeling good and having fun, not about getting their money's worth.\n\nThey never get fired either. I had a prof who couldn't teach 1st year physics and got suspended, but was brought back to teach 3rd year level engineering calculus. You would think that if he can't teach a course that is essentially just a recap of high school physics, that he obviously can't teach 3rd year engineering calculus courses, but apparently the higher ups don't care.\n\nI've had too many profs in online courses last year just post pdfs of the textbook and read off of those without doing examples and expect us to know what we're doing.\n\nThey don't care about you. Only your wallet and your compliance.\n\n- Forced Compliance:\n\n     This will be a short one because elements of this point exist throughout this entire post. I just wanted to give it its own section so that people know it's also a factor that influenced my opinion.\n\nAll of the above reasons are why I'm dissatisfied with post secondary and why I think post secondary should be abolished in favor of gaining knowledge through practical experience or via apprenticeship or mentorship.",

      "text": "> We do not live in the 1800s anymore. Post secondary education isn't the place where the world's smartest 0.1% go anymore. It's become mandatory for everyone to do, because no one will hire you if you don't have a piece of paper that as the participation sticker on it that says \"you did it!\". \n\nWhat does this have to do with the 1800s lol? College was relatively affordable until recent decades, partially due to the federal backing of loans that allowed for the inflation of guaranteed tuition. The reason that was implemented was to make it so that anyone who wanted to go, could. Do you think a better system is merely preventing poor people from attending, while rich people do? I'd add, this is an America problem, not necessarily a higher Ed problem. \n\nAdditionally, you very much do not have to go to college. Plenty of people make respectable livings from the trades. If your field requires degrees, 1) you chose that field, and 2) that's a by-product of labor markets, not the Universities themselves. Breaking down barriers to education is a good thing, and as more people go, the supply of educated workers in a service economy shifts, and this results in degree inflation. This, again, isn't the fault of universities themselves, but rather a function of how society itself operates. Are you sure your beef is with college as a whole and it should be disbanded? Seems to me that you're more upset at society. \n\n> Most students are stupid and fall into this herd mentality of sorts. As a result, they try to fit in to this idealized version of a University attendee, and in turn surpress their own individuality.\n\nI think it's objectionable first of all to characterize most students as stupid, but even still, where are you making the causal connection here? People attempt to fit in because of peer pressure in high school and elementary school, should we abolish those too? Hell, people do it in the workplace. You're again talking more in reference to a societal level issue than uni specifically, and even then, you should be examining how your individuality is suppressed. \n\nWhat about your identity are you unable to show explicitly because you're in college? Feeling like you need to fit in is a well documented psychological phenomenon that has much more to do with your relationship with your peers than college - do you think people who didn't go to university don't succumb to peer pressure? Perhaps you should be wondering whether your choice of field/major or even school is the right one for you? \n\n>I found it very sad when i was waiting for my lecture to start, and looked around to see that I'm the only one not staring at my phone. It's just so lonely not having anyone to talk to. They should be greeting each other and asking how their days are going.\n\nAgain, are we sure this is about universities? This point has virtually nothing to do with higher ed. Every kid goes on their phone now, regardless of whether they're in uni or not. It's a generational thing.  \n\n> The students are mindless drones, and another good example of this is the fact that even in between classes, students will only ever talk about School... Honestly, even a discussion on what you've been watching lately would be interesting, but too bad you are too insecure to express yourself. \n\nI mean, most people talk about work with colleagues because it's an easy topic they have in common. Beyond that, I've never heard the complaint lodged that students only talk about school lol. I think the large majority of students enjoy talking about other things, they just have to feel comfortable and you have to know them and what they like. \n\n> We have all seen that one guy... who always calls students lazy and puts himself on a pedestal... Universities and Colleges thrive off of this. \n\nI don't know who this is. If you're saying narcissists can do well in college, narcissists can do well in a wide variety of fields. There are always people who obsess over As or whatever, but that shouldn't (and I don't really see how it could much) impact your experience. Getting a degree with a B gives you the same degree.\n\n>Even getting internships is ridiculous, which essentially amounts to hundreds if not thousands of people applying for a job... They want people to fight each other for scholarships, internships, and graduate program placements so that they forget about how much they're being fucked over\n\nAgain labor market. If your issue with universities is that their function is to prepare people for careers, I think you very much misunderstand their purpose. That's arguably their main goal, though not their only goal. \n\n> you have to pay HUGE tuition and pay extra thousands to retake failed courses in the summer (even if it isn't your fault), parking fees so that you can leave your car on a square of pavement for a few hours, an involuntary voluntary donation fee, lab fees, auxiliary fees, dental plans, health plans, student card replacement fees\n\nNo you don't? Not necessarily anyway. I feel like there's this social pressure where people exist in certain environments that tell them what kind of school they go to, and those almost always come with $40K per year price tags and what not. You don't have to go anywhere. If it's not Harvard or Yale, it's the rest of them - go to a local community college and take cheap courses, then transfer to a reasonable state school. Sure, you may still end up with debt, but that should be a fairly reasonable amount in the long term by that road. Some states even have programs where 2 years at a community college gets you acceptance and reduced tuition at a state school. They may or may not win awards, but you get the degree. \n\n> A lot of the time, professors are only hired for their research first, and then mandated to teach to students, so they just half ass it because they don't care. TAs are even worse\n\nI'm sorry man but you fundamentally don't understand the academic job market. Most people teach and do research, there are teaching heavy schools, and research heavy school, and that determines your course load as well research expectations (grants, publications, etc.). Even at research heavy institutions, people just aren't hired without teaching experience, pedagogical philosophies, classroom references, etc. The market is absurdly competitive, and there's always someone who has a decent history of teaching because of the number of applicants. \n\nMost TAs are overworked and underpaid grad students not unlike what you're talking about, and in most institutions, their job duties are fairly limited. Some professors may take advantage of it, but their job is to *assist*. I'd cut them some slack. Besides, most are learning to teach. \n\n> in any other field of employment would be considered a fireable blunder and a massive showcase of incompetency.\n\nUniversity is far from the only field that has an issue rooting out problematic actors. In fact, most fields do. The tenure system absolutely needs reform, but I don't think that's applicable to the existence of college in general. \n\n>Professors also like to choose people they personally like to be TAs, and not actual helpful ones. \n\nIgnoring the comments on race, welcome to the world, where people hire people they know and like. \n\n>I've even had TAs fail to attend entire lab sessions all together, forcing us to wait for hours like idiots. I've had TAs be late to lab sessions regularly. \n\nThen leave and file a complaint with the Chair of the department of directly to the Dean's office. I don't understand how some TAs being late means we should get rid of college. \n\n> will never get good instructions half the time. Sometimes you don't even understand what the hell they're even saying, other times they force you to buy their textbooks... if i fail one course for no good reason other than poor instruction, i could end up on the street and starving with no hope for a job that can pay the bills because I can't even get my foot in the door.\n\nYeah, I just don't agree with this. The publishing market (again, technically separate from uni) is crooked as hell, but most professors don't author textbooks, and the ones that do are also technically being used for some bigger fish to make even more money off their work. I also don't think it's fair to just say broad brush that you don't get good instructions - how often do you target courses according to career goals, meet with professors to develop individual and challenging plans, use office hours to clarify concepts you're not sure of, etc. If you're not getting things in class, there are remedies, and sure some profs just suck, but the overwhelming majority love when students are engaged and seek help and want to be challenged.  \n\n>It's so obvious how they use jokes and humour to distract students from the fact that half the lecture is filled with unnecessary irrelevant shit we'll never see on the exam. \n\nI mean, do you talk to them about what you feel they should be covering but aren't? Tough when this isn't specific. Using humor isn't a bad thing. Many professors don't like public speaking in front of people they don't know, and humor is a good ice breaker. Plus, they're humans too - most are worried about what students think of them and want them to like them. \n\n>They don't care about you. Only your wallet and your compliance.\n\nFaculty don't care about college budgets as long as they're not being laid off. That's just the truth. \n\n**TL;DR:** Honestly man? It sounds like you're depressed and frustrated, and you're taking it out on the wrong thing. Your university should have some form of counseling service available to you, and I think it would be wise to take them up on it. College is strange time and can be a frustrating period of your life, but there's no reason it has to be miserable. I assure you, things will get better (and not by abolishing higher education).",

Prestige, is that what you're after? Not many people went to college in the 1800s because not many people *could* go. The US wasn't even a service economy then, most jobs were in manual labor and plenty of people didn't even finish primary school. If child labor and soul-crushing work in the mills removing the need for post-secondary education is your idea of a model society, might as well own it. \n\n> However, it no longer has that reputation since everyone goes there.\n\nIn slave societies, literacy was prestigious and you'd be considered an extraordinary mind. Is that an argument to lower the living standards of society? It shouldn't be. \n\n>And yes, you are required to go to post secondary, as you can't get any jobs that that pay the bills if you don't. Even if you could find it, another applicant who does have a degree or diploma will replace you.\n\nAnd yet so many people have managed to survive without one, curious huh? Many trade fields are experience and apprenticeship based. Stone masons don't give a shit if you have a degree. It's hard work in a different sense than many other jobs, but it's also a perfectly reasonable living. \n\nWhat's your threshold for paying the bills even? Virtually every trades person does just fine regardless of what you think of their profession, so if you need more than them to pay the bills, perhaps you should wonder why. \n\n>Most of your arguments are based off of semantics and it seems like you're just mad that I don't think University is a utopian Institution filled with smiles and happiness all the time. \n\nNot an argument in the slightest. You didn't address any of my points and instead you just wanted to be mad, while I went through yours point by point and dedicated time to responding. I hope you feel better, I suppose.\n\n>Fuck off. You are the prime example of what's wrong in society. It seems like YOU don't understand how it works.\n\nLol you haven't made a single keen insight into the functioning of society in this entire thread and have instead spent time malding that society hasn't given you what you think you're owed. Exuding an attitude that you're owed prestige above the plebs of society who go to college but shouldn't doesn't reflect well, and I've got news, life is a shit boat and virtually all of us are in it. You're not special because you've pointed out that life is unfair, and you're not making some discipline-defining critique by making muddled and baseless accusations about what you think college is. \n\nIf you're that upset about college and think it's worth so little, then don't go. No one is forcing you contrary to what you think. Spend less time worrying that other people have the same access to college that you do, and more time figuring out a path for your life that suits you.",

      "text": "You touch on a lot of real problems in academics/college, but I'd argue you don't have a good understanding of a lot of them. I agree that a more mentor focused philosophy would be better, but it would be better applied to college rather than replacing it. Concerning your points: \n\n1) There is little the institution can do about the constantly changing culture of young adults.\n\n2) I have not seen this on a systemic level. You've likely just had bad experiences.\n\n3) The expenses of college is a real concern and worthy of being the entire focus of a rant. \n\n4) There is an immerse problem with faculty and the quality of education. Good faculty hate bad faculty too, but their hands are often just as tied as students when it comes to addressing these problems. Poor teaching does not develop naturally from a professorial position. It is a result of bad hiring, bad leadership, and bad administration. At the same time, the level of disfunction you describe is extreme and not characteristic of most programs.\n\n5) There need to be some level of compliance in order to instruct. Students need to be able to follow directions, understand basic concepts, and overall be competent at independent learning and self-assessment. These are not natural abilities in people and need to be taught through basic classes in order to prepare students for more advanced instruction.\n\nWhile you raise real issues, your final assessment is overreaching. Overvaluing practical instruction over developing understanding of theory has flaws as well. For example in my full-time job I have less experience than my co-workers but a better understanding of theory. So when they run into problems the decision is usually, \"Let's go ask the Professor about it.\" I've been able to solve them by applying theoretical knowledge and building a solution from that in contrast to my co-workers who only know what they've seen through practical experience.",

The blanket generalizations you make are rather cynical and untrue. (i.e. student definitely talk about stuff other than school, have a great social life, and express themselves through extracurricular activities and clubs)",

Without the university, we would all be living vastly inferior lives. \n\nIt sounds like you are frustrated. Most of the problems you identify are pretty unique to the United States and the cost of college there. It sounds like you need to consider an alternative path.",
