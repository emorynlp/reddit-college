  "text": "My roommate is a slob. Since the day I met them, our room (it's a shared single room in our dorm building) has been a complete disaster. There's trash, dirty clothes on the floor and spilling out of their closet, there's coloring books for children, pacifiers, and cups for toddlers scattered on the floor; there's a box full of dirty dishes with food still on them, there's dried bits of coconut and cheese sitting  on the floor, there's a half empty Starbucks drink I bought them in September still sitting on their desk, and grocery sacks are left on the floor with random food containers and clothes. It's so incredibly disgusting and makes me want to throw up whenever I walk in.\nThey normally stay at the house where their club meets at, so I'm usually left alone with this dumpster fire of a room. But recently they told me that they're moving out, so now I cant wait for finals to be over and a new semester to start so I will never have to deal with this again!",
