  "text": "This is a sorta long rant, but looking at it now it's been pent up anger and frustration I had over this semster. In advanced, its a bit messy, but this class has been emotionally exhausting for me.\n\nHey y'all, I made this sorta temporary throwaway account cause all my other main accounts are associated with my school. I'll start of this rant by saying I've been having a hard time in a \"beginner-friendly\" CS intro class (comp sci 1) and I have been doing a variety of options to fix this. The course offers TA help and office hrs (on Discord) with the professors, though I've been mainly dependent on TA help and it has been fairly well throughout the semster. The thing is TAs can only help on the lab section (which I'm passing with an A), with them having the choice of whether they would want to help students with the LECTURE section. If I wanted the professor to help me, I would have to schedule 2 or 3 days ahead on a Thursday (day of office hrs) for a class I have to attend in-person. I should try to see if I can schedule anywhere out of that time, but I haven't tried yet.\n\nFor some goddamn reason, the lecture assignments are like 2 chapters ahead in the book suddenly after week 5 or 6. The lab section is the apporiate begginner friendly course and I've been vibing in that class. Because the assignments got harder around week 5 or 6, I fell behind on some reading so that I can get the assignment done/help in a 5 day period. I'm a full time student who also takes some other courses, but this course just deprived all my attention after week 6 and onwards till today. Luckily I'm not falling my other courses, but I've been doing them last minute so that I can understand how tf to do the assignments (which takes me days to program and understand). I have heard several people say that other colleges don't make their CS courses as excessive as ours so honestly wtf. \n\nFrom this, I'm passing with an  A in lab section but a C or possibly D in lectures cos the assignments are so excessively detailed and ahead from what I know (first time learning to code). While the TA for the labs do help with the lecture when they have time, I still take an extra day or so to understand wtf I'm programming and why. I try to understand why I'm doing it so that I can put two and two together with future topics (and that's how I've been able to do well in the labs, but not lectures because its always so ahead). \n\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that the labs and lectures are conpletely seperate sections that teach different things that week. And in all honesty the labs teach me more thru 10 min vids. The lab instructor posts on what we are working on and the basics of it. The lecture requires reading, but each chapter is like 30-60 pages for 4 chapters per week. \n\nAnyways the ahead up is some background info and thoughts I have on this class. Down below is boiling issues.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLab TAs for the most part are willing to help students with assignments from the lecture (and honestly without them I would have had an F in the class a long time ago). But they too have office hours from a certain time to certain time which are crowded by 15 people waiting in a waiting line (1 on 1 tutoring that lasts up to 30-40 mins at most). Progressely as the assignments get more hardly each week, more ppl attend office hours and the only way you can guarentee a spot of tutoring is to go 30 mins early and wait in line. I then try to find other methods of tutoring and found some that were offered to by my main school (engineering school). I then started to attend both in person and virtual hours along with waiting in line for TA help to get some understanding of the assignments and a walk through. \n\nThese tutors have been fairly nice and really good in their explainations that I relied on three forms of tutoring in this order: in-person tutoring from 11 to 3, ta help and waiting line from 3ish-7ish, and virtual tutoring from 7 to 8. I've been on this schedule every tues and thurs and also try to get early help on mon-wed. This Thurs, however, i had an assignment due the day of and tried to work thru as much as I can and get tutor help for something I didn't understand. I attended virtual tutoring from 7-8 because I only got a few mins of help from my other two options. When I saw who the tutor was going to be I wished I just exited out instead and try to figure it out on my own.\n\nI was paired with this one tutor who has such a passive-aggressive and condensing voice I have ever heard on a breakout Google Meets call. I remembered being paired for help with him one time, with him not answering my questions (complete silence) half the the time and ending it 20 mins to say he knows how to solve my issue, but its too advanced for me and that it can against what my professor requires and just ends the call. I got paired up with him this Thurs and think back on whether it was worth it for this attitude again.\n\nI attend the meeting because my other forms of help are depleted. I attend the call and try to be as positive as I can with this passive-aggressive toned-faced tutor. I asked if I was going the right path in my program only to be responded with \"What do YOU think?\". Geez, idk I WENT TO TUTORING TO ASK IF WHAT IM DOING IS RIGHT AND CORRECT. I try to understand what I'm doing wrong and give some thought to think on where I can go. He gets impatient and tells me the answer, while I ask him why so that I can understand it. He explains why in such a condensing tone of \"This shit is fundamental how do you not understand it.\" and just makes me feel stupid for asking said stupid questions. I ask him if I could move this piece of code, with him replying that no one is stopping me (like jesus I not sure if I move this piece of code it'll fuck it up somehow). The hour just bothered me heavily because it felt like I was asking stupid questions (but I try to assure myself I'm teying to understand the material) and annoying the shit out of this tutor. Despite this, I did get my assignment done at the expense of wondering why tf this material doesn't stick with me and why I'm actually stupid. \n\nI don't know if his tone is just naturally starky, but it just played me down and made me feel stupid in the end. I already somewhat accepted the fact I won't pass the lecture because of how much I'm struggling, but I'm trying my best to do what I can without breaking down. This tutor burned that hope for me and now I've just been depressed for an hour and moving on from it because I have to. Fuck  myself for not understanding this elementary stuff as easily as others say. Fuck that tutor for downplaying my ability to understand what I know and fuck me again for letting him get to me more then he should have. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do now except go forward and suck it up for another 4 weeks to see if I pass or fail.\n\nTldr: CS CLASS Lab is easy. Lecture is not (way too ahead for someone just learning how to code). Go to various kind of tutoring. Go to this one shit tutor who speaks in such a condensing tone of why don't you get it. Sorta just break down because everything qas bard to grasp halfway in semester. Questioning mental health.",
