  "text": "Currently in my final year of studies and been reflecting lately and I realised that I never had the ideal \u201ccollege experience.\u201d I never made any friends my first two years due to what I now realise was low self-esteem. I was excited to go into my third year with classes that interested me along with an internship where I hoped I\u2019d be able to meet more people.. and then BAM.. Covid happened. Classes went online and being remote affected me. I took the time during lockdown to better myself and while I still have my bad days, I  realise now how worthy I am, and am working on improving my self-esteem. Felt emotional today and had a breakdown thinking about my lack of a \u201ccollege experience.\u201d Sometimes it makes me feel different from others, or like I missed out in some way. But even in my deepest moments of regret, I remind myself that the right people and situations do find you. I\u2019m still doing courses online but plan to continue my studies following graduation next year. I originally planned to write this just to vent, but I hope that this helps anyone else who may be feeling similarly to realise that they are not alone. Also, would love to hear about people\u2019s experiences (mainly socially) with undergrad vs grad school (:",

      "text": "Hi op, I\u2019m definitely feeling this right now bc I\u2019m finishing undergrad in three years \ud83d\ude43 and covid really took away from what this could have been. ik it\u2019s a very good idea financially but I\u2019ve been struggling with the fact that I won\u2019t see my friends the same way I used to. I will be living off campus with them next year but I won\u2019t get to be in student orgs or go to on-campus stuff that requires a student id. I wasn\u2019t as involved on campus as I could have been, didn\u2019t get to study abroad, didn\u2019t make many friends and the ones I have now suck sometimes. Thanks for reminding me I\u2019m not alone in this feeling ! The good news is I have the spring semester to try and turn this experience around. Maybe you still have some time too. I\u2019ve thought about grad school but I think I\u2019d need to wait to save up some money. I\u2019d like to experience school a bit more so I\u2019d really consider it.",

      "text": "I feel a similar way. I'm finishing up my second to last semester and I barely had any experiences other than academic. Made zero friends and relationships. Never had an internship, never went to a career fair. I've recently started talking to my older brother who graduated before me about his college experience and apparently he had made several friends, went to several career fairs, graduated with a job, etc., and it's just made me feel like, \"wtf have I been doing?\" I wish I had known that I should have been searching for a job already. I wish I had known how important career fairs are. I wish I had friends to study with like my brother. Too many regrets. Oh well. All I can do now is work on whatever I can now. I definitely feel you when it comes to a feeling of lack of college experience. Sorry for venting on your post lol",
