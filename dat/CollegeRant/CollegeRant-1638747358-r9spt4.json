  "text": "It\u2019s for a class that I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t been the best student in, but I have never once cheated on anything. I study my ass off to make Bs. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing exceptionally well, if I was cheating I\u2019d be a pretty bad cheater.\n\nI used a term study made for my section that was supposed be for this section for this teacher for this final. It seemed like most of the answers were right. I\u2019m pretty sure what he did was leave certain ones incorrect so no one would catch on. \n\nThe exam was online and I took and I didn\u2019t cheat. The next day I\u2019m getting an email saying that I\u2019ve been reported and the RA tells me that he could tell I used the fake quizlet he made. 4 other students are being reported from my section.\n\nI\u2019m about to lose scholarships for studying a trap. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

This wouldn't be a problem at any of the universities that I've been at for any of my degrees.\n\nOP look at the Academic Integrity section of your syllabus for the class. It should state the university policies regarding what is ok and what isn't. If there isn't anything that says you can't use an unoriginal source to study from or something like that, make the TA cite the specific policy you violated and show you the evidence they have. \n\nHonestly that's such a dumb policy. How is reading a Quizlet that someone else made online any different than reading a textbook that someone else wrote? Or the lecture slides the professor wrote?",
