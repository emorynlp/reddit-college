  "text": "I get why professors don\u2019t want everyone cheating on exams but there has to be a better way than making every student pay (only $12, but still), just use a lockdown browser or something similar if the class is online. One of my classes is requiring we use examity, someone either actively watches us one on one or watches a group at a time. On top of this their terms and conditions say it\u2019s our risk if they somehow leak information so there\u2019s not even accountability.",
