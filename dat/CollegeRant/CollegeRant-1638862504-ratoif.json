  "text": "Hey everyone,   \n\n\nso long story short I went from straight A student to currently failing three of my classes. I was in a life altering accident at the start of the semester and then got COVID on top of that during my recovery. My mental health went to crap, and I couldn't face my professors.  \n\n\nI procrastinated sending them emails with status updates and was not transparent in communication. Surprisingly, I have good grades in my exams; so it's not as if I haven't done a thing in my classes. I am just missing the assignments- not the exams. I do have everything documented with the disability department in my university. I believe that since I have the exams done. I can finish all of my pending assignments by the end of finals week.   \n\n\nHow hard do you think it will be to receive that chance or maybe an incomplete grade in the meantime? My scholarship, GPA, and graduation depend on it. If I fail these three classes, my scholarship will be gone along with my GPA, and I will not be graduating. Moreover, it would tank my mental health even more. I plan on explaining all of this in my email, and just being transparent that my mental health stopped me from being communicative until it was too late. Should I contact the disability department for help first?  \n\n\nThank you for your thoughts!",

      "text": "So sorry you're going through this. Yes, email the disability/accommodations department and explain your situation. They will help you communicate your situation to your professors and the school. In my experience, I had a death in my family and my grades went out the window. I spoke with the school and was able to get an incomplete in a class or two and had more time to finish.",
