  "text": "I do wish I was the person who could do a lot more but I'm so easily distracted. Honestly I used to be even worse with this but I wonder where my time goes. I guess I could delete Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter and find out how much free time I really have but I convince myself I need it. Even though I've socially withdrawn a lot, several of my close friends are busy in committed relationships, others have other friend groups, and it feels so hard to meet people in the middle of the semester.\n\nI just don't have the energy. To function, to do anything. I have to prop myself up on caffeine to function on six hours of sleep while that is a high amount for a weekday for some of my friends. It's like everything I do, even if I like it, takes so much energy and I just want to lay down in bed. But when I do that I feel even more shitty about myself and fall into an existential spiral.\n\nI feel like I've been \"quantity >>> quality\" in my approach to activities/extracurriculars/classes this semester. I don't know how to sustainably put 100% of my effort into something I really enjoy so I've stayed attached to the model of just signing up for as many things as I can, but with few leadership positions, to keep myself busy. I had adopted such a cynical perspective about everything that everyone is just faking it and whatever I'm doing I'll just be faking it too. But I've let a lot of people down, maybe not with the explicit goal to but out of a lack of energy to put into things. How do people show up to meetings for all their organizations every week when they could be an email?\n\nI got ghosted by one of my research assistant supervisors so my income has dried up relatively. But he was an incredibly nice guy and it's literally my fault that I just felt overwhelmed by coming up with ways to code for a certain task so I took a very sloppy piecemeal approach. I'm on a literal full ride to a college thousands of kilometers from home so thankfully I have no debt to worry about.\n\nAnyway, I started this semester with a twenty-credit courseload (overload), two part-time research positions (5-10 hours a week), membership on two committees, a club, and a column for the campus newspaper. I have most of that, but I've just been lethargically going through the motions so that these don't translate into anything real and remarkable as much it would if you heard I've been doing all this stuff. \n\nI've slept through my 9am macro class somewhere between five and eight times, and luckily there's no automatic fail provision but there goes the 5% participation component of my grade (getting low As on exams/assignments otherwise) and any chance of a good rec letter from a pretty renowned professor. Because I already had previous experience in R and very few did  I also got really overconfident in my R class and didn't show up more than half the time (tbf it was optional) or pay attention and then ended up finishing the midterm in twenty-five minutes, thinking I got everything right... and then getting a solid B when many people did better.\n\nSo I need a physical internship for this summer because I am going to mentally (and probably physically) rot if I have to go back to my parents' shitty 100% car dependent corner of Trumpland (important: I don't have a car) for three whole months over the summer. And I don't have family connections to rely on and have failed at proper university networking thus far.  I have one more free summer class worst comes to worst to account for one of those months but I'm already dreading it even though it's December? I'm trying to apply to everything online that I can but I don't particularly stand out in any way so it's going to be a major uphill battle - been ghosted by most November deadline things.\n\nAnd I've been looking for 'escapes' from reality but none have properly materialized to make me happy? And that lack has perhaps made me feel more disillusioned with myself than not pursuing these in the first place. I have gone on international trips, one of them solo, just over short breaks. They've been fun actually but I've just come back and felt even more shitty. I land late at night and come back absolutely overwhelmed with work and with the realization that I still feel suffocated in this bubble of a small campus. At any rate, largely because of these trips, I will probably get some decent Christmas money but I have $700 to my name rn so I won't be going anywhere else anytime soon.\n\nI also felt insecure about my lack of sexual and relationship experience in this past, so September and October were... weird months. Being on a small LAC campus I matched with 2% of the entire female population of my school on dating apps and I thought I was unattractive before because people didn't directly initiate with me and there must be a reason I didn't get this experience. I am a bit of a physical late bloomer but still... shutting myself out from people and blaming them for not talking to me. Meeting people in various capacities I have materialized a few hookups this semester but the first went HORRIBLE and ended with me never talking to the person again who I felt I got along with (for obvious reasons though), and the others went less bad but I still feel insecure about my performance. Obviously sex isn't everything. I've lost the 'virgin' label but to my surprise I still feel about as insecure I ever did and it hasn't translated to being more social in other contexts. If you haven't had sex yet and just want to hook up to get it over with, trust me you probably won't gain anything especially where your reputation follows you around.\n\nAnyway, that was a bit of a long rant. I don't know what direction it's going in but that applies to my life as well. I constantly feel like things are about to collapse around me but I always limp through the finish line but don't solve the underlying problems. Eventually, life is going to have to come to a head though. It's a rut with few answers. I've become more and more irritable over the last few weeks too at slight things like professors' tones in emails, university admin announcements, loud people, the weather, etc. Not sure where my sanity is...",
