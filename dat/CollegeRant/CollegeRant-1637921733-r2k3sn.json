  "text": "College is literally a trap where you\u2019re forced to dump the little money you have into a greedy empty void. Like, how do they get away with this?! Unless your family helps with tuition, you\u2019ll inevitably need student loans, it\u2019s just too damn expensive. Once you take out your first loan\u2026 *there is no going back.* They\u2019re forcing you into a position where you can\u2019t attend their school without applying for loans, but you can\u2019t drop out once you\u2019ve committed to loans because where are you gonna get that kind of money to repay them without a degree?! It\u2019s absurd! And on top of that, you still have to find money to, y\u2019know, keep yourself *alive.* Idk if I\u2019m just too dumb for scholarships because I got a 3.7 instead of a 4.0 in high school, but I\u2019m seriously considering saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to the loan servicer and ending it all. In their contract, they said in the case of death, no debt will be deflected to any of my relatives, so maybe it\u2019s their turn to just throw money away; a dead person can\u2019t pay you back.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t believe it is ever worth killing oneself over money. College is expensive and there are likely many people going for the wrong reasons, meaning that they shouldn\u2019t be paying so much if they are unlikely to be able to make a return on their investment. Make sure you are not one of those people. Also, remember that while it might feel uncomfortable taking out loans when you don\u2019t immediately have the money to pay them back, there will likely come a time in your life when you do have some decent money, and then you might be thankful that your younger self invested in education.",

You need to live to help fight the vicious system and make sure kids getting out of highschool don't get mountains of debt and time taken away.",

You should probably talk to someone if you\u2019re feeling a type of way. \n\nI will say that the college system is fucked. The whole point of college is to learn. At least, that\u2019s what you\u2019re told. This was before the internet so, higher education was actually taught. Now, it\u2019s no longer the case. \n\nIn reality, you\u2019d have to be a dumb person to encourage colleges to increase tuition. No amount of education is worth going in debt for. Unfortunately, as a college student myself, society pressures us into going or this face being a \u201cbum\u201d.",
