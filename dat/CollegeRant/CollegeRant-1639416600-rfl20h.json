      "text": "It really depends on how much the assignment is worth. I fucked up really bad on our first major assignment in one of my major classes and somehow still managed to get an A in the class. It also depends on all of your other classes. One assignment in one class usually won\u2019t be that drastic in terms of determining your overall gpa. If you do well enough in your other classes it could still balance out.",
