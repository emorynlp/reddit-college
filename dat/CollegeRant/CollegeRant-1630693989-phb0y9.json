  "text": "I was sitting next to someone in lecture today who was clearly sick. Did they take a test? No, why would they. It would be too much of an inconvenience to go to the universities free testing center a block away from our dorms. \n\nThey just came to lecture, assumed it was the common cold. It could be, it could also be a highly infectious deadly disease that has killed over 4.5 million people worldwide. Why do people always assume, with no evidence that they don\u2019t have covid?! It\u2019s selfish & disrespectful to not stay home for a single fucking day while waiting for test results.",

My campus has a rule that if you show *any* symptoms of covid, positive test or not, you cannot attend class, so I think I have the weight of the school's policy on my side.",
