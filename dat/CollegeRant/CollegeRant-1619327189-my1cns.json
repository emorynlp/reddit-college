  "text": "Honestly, I'm frustrated and anxious with internships at this point. For the past three months, it's been nothing but editing resumes, typing cover letter after cover letter, emailing, answering a bunch of questions, references, everything only to either get ghosted by the company or organization or get that email saying \"Thanks for applying but we went for someone else, hope you continue to consider us for future positions!\"\n\nI know that you have to continue applying and that maybe your tenth or hundredth application can be the one, but man getting rejected application after application, interview after interview honestly does hurt and only confirms the thought that I'm doing is not enough.",

Of the 200 applications that I put in, the best that I got was a recorded video interview that was apparently analyzed by an AI instead of a person.",
