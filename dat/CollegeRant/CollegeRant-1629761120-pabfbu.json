  "text": "I just transferred from a smaller international university in Spain to a really big state school in Texas. It was my first day today and it was packed with people, lines with 50 plus people for food and student ID. I commute and the only parking lot was a 30 min walk from my 1st class and it\u2019s about 95 degrees outside. I could have taken a shuttle but I was already late. I took the shuttle back to my car and took forever. Just the hoards of people, pointless classes I could care less about makes me realize how much I hate college and don\u2019t even want to be here. I regret not doing online, I don\u2019t mind online as much. Now it\u2019s too late and I have to suffer through commuting like this everyday until December. Im just so sad and upset and frustrated and I can\u2019t get over the fact im doing it to myself. My parents would disown me if I didn\u2019t finish school so I really feel like I have no choice. Im just so sad rn. Thanks for listening. \n\nTL;DR\nI transferred from a small private school to a huge state school and I don\u2019t even want to be in college in the 1st place.",

      "text": "I'm sorry you're feeling this way, and it sucks that you don't want to be there. Are you studying something your parents want you to study that you have no interest in? What are your career goals and what other educational or work path could you take to get there?\n\nI went to both A&M and UT and felt so lonely at A&M because it was my first college experience, I lived off campus, and my classes were so huge I didn't get to know anyone. Just the parking situation and 30 minute walks to class was soul sucking, and I can't imagine how I would feel doing it now in the middle of the pandemic. I transferred after a semester to a smaller school, where I lived in the dorms and later within walking distance of campus, and there I found a good solid friend group when I joined an organization and then another friend group because I worked on campus at one of the colleges and met a ton of people that way. I hope the best for you, and you can DM me if you just want to vent.",

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m studying something my parents want me to, they just want me to get a college degree but I hate school lol. I thought after high school it would be over. And did you transfer to A&M then UT and then to a smaller school? Smaller schools are definitely way better I think. I\u2019m glad you found a solid friend group and a good school! That\u2019s amazing",

              "text": "I lived in Austin after finishing up at UT and loved visiting the San Marcos/New Braunfels area - wish I could have been on the river tubing today!!! I was a wayward teenager and didn't know what I wanted to do, followed my best friend to A&M and only stayed a semester then transferred to SFA, failed most of my courses that semester, had to take a semester off to figure out what I was going to do with myself then went back and switched majors. UT was grad school but I didn't finish my Master's degree there, but I did finish a program to get my teaching certification.\n\nI've mostly always loved school as a student and teacher, but I can relate to why so many people hate it. Formal education can be boring and tedious, but it can also be exciting and rewarding. I think when you find a class or program, peer group, or organization that really fits you, you could grow to enjoy it. If you loved your studies in Spain, I encourage you to definitely see how much study abroad you can fit into your degree program. Also I wonder how much that change is affecting you - it's really hard to go another country and live/study for a while and then come back home. I did a semester in M\u00e9xico and loved it, and when I came back home everything felt so different and weird.",
