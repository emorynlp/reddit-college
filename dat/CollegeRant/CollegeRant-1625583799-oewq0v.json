  "title:": "Is Partying with 16 Year Olds weird for a 20-24 year old group of guys?",
  "text": "My boyfriend and his friends got invited to a high school party by a bunch of 16-17 year old girls. (i was invited as well). All 5 of us are 20-24 years old.\nI find it a bit weird if they decided to go. I remember when I was in High School and when a bunch of 20 something year olds came it was the most awkward and weird thing ever. People talked so much crap saying \u201cdon\u2019t you have a job to get too?\u201d \u201caren\u2019t you in uni or collage?\u201d \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you at a collage party then?\u201d and then they would talk A LOT of bad things about the girl who invited them. Saying she\u2019s a Sl*t and all that. And it gave off very much pedo vibes to every female around. I even felt uncomfortable dancing at that point. \nThese guys want to go but it\u2019s a house filled with minors and to me it\u2019s weird. \nDoes anyone else think it\u2019s weird or is it just me? \nLike you\u2019re in your 20s partying with a bunch of high schoolers. If you want to party that bad, throw one yourself maybe? My bf has PLENTY of friends to throw a big party and none are minors. \nI would tell this to my bf and his friends but i don\u2019t want them thinking i\u2019m trying to stop them from doing something or whatever. Yes, I can state my opinion but at the same time I feel like they won\u2019t get it unless i say \u201cyou\u2019ll look like a pedo\u201d and I don\u2019t want to do that lol. \nWhat do any of you think?? Am i over thinking or is this a reasonable thing to bring up??",

Still a little weird in my opinion, but as long as they\u2019re 18 and/or within a couple years your age then I wouldn\u2019t consider that TOO sus. Still, party with people already in college before you party with people who just graduated high school if you can.",

          "text": "Sounds like my group of high school friends. We were 16 and had a group with a wide age range because we were kids from the neighborhood and everyone had siblings of different ages. When the older kids in our group turned 18 they hung out with the group like they always had... but more younger girls were getting added to the group too because of other people's younger siblings starting to hang out. Well eventually some of the older guys started dating the younger girls and ended up in jail for a few years. \nNow we're all in our 30s and 40s. We're all still good friends (in a group chat as we speak because one friend is in labor!) \nThose 12 year olds would say over and over they were mature and one of the group blah blah blah. But here's the thing, the 12 year olds are now hitting 30 and when we all get together they say now they think it's kinda gross that these guys were hitting on them when they were 12-16 years old. Their perspective has changed because now they realize how young they were and that these older guys were interested in them sexually from the get go just waiting for their chance. Just because they dated doesn't make it ok. They still went to jail (the girls are still friends with the guys who went to jail) and the girls were still not mentally developed to make decisions the way the guys were. \n\n\nSo no the new info doesn't matter. They should stay away from younger girls.",
