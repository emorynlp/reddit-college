  "text": "I have no idea what to do with my life.\n\nHi, I\u2019m a Hispanic-first gen college student-20 yr old female living in the Midwest in her 2nd year of college and am contemplating many things among death right now. Here\u2019s some background information: this past year I had an abortion that I didn\u2019t even want I was admitted into a mental health facility, I was diagnosed with ptsd, major depressive disorder, and mild anxiety disorder. I currently owe 3k to my university that I have to pay off before I can begin enrolling and registering for classes this coming spring. I currently have 3 jobs in order to pay for this tuition since my parents can\u2019t afford it. Two shitty jobs in grocery and one at the university that I only keep because it\u2019s an extra set of income and it\u2019s a program that helps students of color. \n\nHere is my problem. I don\u2019t know what I want to study and before you think then why are you in college let me explain this: coming to college I knew exactly what i wanted to go into: immigration law I knew the courses I would need to take and I was SET on this. Well recently my grandpa passed away due to covid right before I went into my freshmen year of college and I began to question the route of my own life and what it was that I truly wanted out of this life. I began to realize that after spending my whole life watching my family struggle with money that I wanted something different I didn\u2019t want to live that normal 9-5 job and retire when I\u2019m 60. I wanted financial freedom to support myself and my family so that\u2019s when I knew I had to change my major into something that would be simple enough where I can make my own hours so I can focus on creating a small business or investing my money. I decided on PR but my family gave me so much backlash and if you come from an immigrant family you know what I\u2019m talking about. I ended up staying in my pre law major just to make them happy and absolutely HATED the courses and professors. I barely passed my classes and was put on academic probation. Now if I don\u2019t reach a certain gpa amount I will flunk out and will not be able to come back next year I currently live in the dorms because I hate my living situation at home it was toxic and made me want to genuinely k*ll myself. I don\u2019t know what to do I have been contemplating moving in with my boyfriend and his roommates if I don\u2019t come back next year but I don\u2019t want to lose any more scholarships or financial aid since college is already expensive enough as it is. I don\u2019t even have a social life anymore because all I do is work and try to keep up with my classes. I\u2019m f*cking miserable. I hate my life and I don\u2019t know if I should keep trying to raise my gpa and potentially waste money or take some time off to figure things out and face the wrath of my family. \n\nAny advice is welcome and if u have questions feel free to ask I\u2019m open to literally anything which is why I\u2019m on Reddit",

      "text": "Have you looked into taking courses at a community College? They're a great way to explore without having to spend a lot of money. It is also makes 4 year universities cheaper because you're spending less time there.  I saved like 40,000 going this route. Not sure how it impacts your financial aid, though.",

Your #1 priority needs to be need to be taking care of your mental health.\n\nPlease don\u2019t check out. You are worthy. There will be opportunities for you. \n\nThis past year was awful for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean things will always be that bad.\n\nTake the semester off. Take care of yourself.
