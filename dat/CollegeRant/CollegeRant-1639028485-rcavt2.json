  "text": "I just had a fucking meltdown because my old ass laptop kept lagging and my browser kept crashing over the last couple hours while I was trying to finish a project that was due at midnight.  I barely finished and tried to submit, but it wasn't working.  This is the type of professor who will not accept a 1 minute late assignment.  If I had a laptop that wasn't old as fuck this wouldn't have happened.\n\nYes, I had a week to do this, and should have been finishing the assignment over the weekend, but I had to work, and I chose to spend my free time cooking food for the week, because I can't afford to/don't have time to buy food out.  I also actually got a full night's sleep on Saturday (a rarity), and then went to work.\n\nThen took out time to study for another class on Sunday, then went to work.  Monday I have classes and work.  Tuesday I had 5.5 hours of class and work.  Today I had classes, work, and a 2-hour exam review session (for another class), and a 2-hour group study session for a major project that is due Friday (another class).\n\nBy the grace of God, I got enough scholarships and grants that my tuition is paid this semester, but I support myself, and have been working 3 low-paying part time jobs while taking 19 credits.  If I didn't have to work 30-44 hours per week, and could afford a decent laptop, and didn't have to take the bus (which eats minimum an hour per day), I would be on easy street.  I was elated that I didn't have to take out loans this year, but now I think it might have been worth it..  I am already $20k in debt, and I make loan payments (even if it's just $50) whenever I can.\n\nI don't know.  Maybe this is just me blaming everything but myself.  I should have prioritized this assignment this week, but I honestly thought 2-3 hours was enough time to finish, as it was 80% done.\n\nWhatever.  Now I just have to get a 90+ on my final project if I want an A, which is very hard for me in this class.\n\nThis might be the semester I ruin my 4.0, and I honestly think that that might be better for my mental health.  Then I won't care as much about doing well, because heck, if I already got one B, what's a couple more?",

If not that, factory reset helps somewhat with these old shitty devices. \nMy university also loans out laptops so you can check if your university does that",

      "text": "Professor here \u2014- this sounds so much like my college experience. Everything was 20 times harder than it would have been if I had the financial resources that other students had. I remember doing my homework in the laundromat with screaming kids all around me\u2026a laundromat that I had to walk to because I had no car. I cannot imagine having to do things online because at the time, a decent laptop would have been completely out of my price range. And student loans? In my 40s and still paying them off. Ugggggg.\n\nLike you, I worked my butt off despite all these difficulties to keep that 4.0. And it paid off in the end. But I\u2019ll be honest\u2026I still have PTSD from it all. It was brutal.\n\nI encourage you to talk to your dept chair. Let them know that you are struggling not because of your work ethic or intellect\u2026but simply because you do not have adequate resources. My hunch is that the department will do all it can to help you. \n\nNow that I am on the other side of things, I realize that I could have asked for help back then. I wish that I had. \n\n Hope thus helps!",
