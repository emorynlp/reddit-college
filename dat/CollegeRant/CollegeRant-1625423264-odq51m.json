  "text": "I collected data from a cited database and put it into a table that I created myself and used it in my report. She then highlighted the table and wrote the comments \"You need to create your own table\" and took off points for it. The same thing happened with a visual diagram that I created and she wrote the comment \"You need to put things that you did not create into the Appendix\". but like, I made these things :|",

Solely because of curriculum differences, I was ahead of my year at my US school. I got sent to the principal's office 3 separate times because my teachers refused to believe my work was original. My writing was either \"too advanced\" or my knowledge of the subject matter was beyond the scope of the class. I had to prove everything was mine using metadata and even got into the habit of screen-recording as I worked on papers just so there would be some evidence I was actually doing the work. Super annoying.",
