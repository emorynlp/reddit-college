  "text": "I have had so many little inconveniences that I have came across when trying to get ready for graduate school. \n\nI think the first one was that I could not register for any classes until I received all my vaccinations. I had sent in my health department records and apparently I needed one vaccination that I had not received in a very long time. Ofc I couldn\u2019t get the vaccine right away since I had my covid shot so I had to wait 2 weeks. But really? At least let students register and be in the system so that they can get the classes they need before they get full. \n\nThe assistant for my department left me out on an email for information on advising for master students. Somehow I was not included in the email so I had to reschedule. Somehow I was left out even though I have been clearly emailing faculty to make sure i\u2019m on the right path lol. \n\nThe  financial aid office is my current trouble. My status says I am an off-campus student even though I secured on campus housing. I emailed them and they said that they had fixed it.  A couple of hours later it still says that i\u2019m off campus. I have tried calling twice and no one has answered my call. i\u2019ll try tomorrow morning (fingers crossed). July 1st is suppose to be the day that I finalize my decisions but how am I suppose to do that when my letter isn\u2019t accurate? \n\nI received an assistantship from my graduate department. I have to go through all the HR bullshit. I cannot log in with my information they emailed me. That\u2019s another thing i have to resolve. \n\nWhat sucks is this summer I have been working full hours as a cashier. I am so so burnt out :(. Not to mention like many seniors, my last year of undergrad was virtual. I hate having to reschedule/call important things when I have a full work load. \n\nTL;DR: Registering and just the process of becoming student is absolute bullshit. Too many inconveniences.",

              "text": "Yup. Most of what I am reading here is analogous to my own grad school experience, and a huge part of why I left my own first program, which was:  \n\n\u2014You are paying way too much to underwrite the expense of a ton of admins.\n\n\u2014those admins never make the experience easy.\n\n\u2014those admins will always deflect the blame away from their shoddy work and on to you, the person who is paying them.\n\nIt\u2019s annoying, but worse. It more or less set me up to fail as a student. I have no family, and dealing with the financial stress of grad school, plus balancing school and adult obligations, AND playing admin games? It was too much.",
