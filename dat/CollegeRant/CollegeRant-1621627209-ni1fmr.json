  "text": "He stopped the class cause I typed something that I didn\u2019t notice on Zoom. He asked me and I didn\u2019t realize it. I told him \u201cI don\u2019t know, can we just go on with the class?\u201d And he kept complaining about it. \n\nHe was bitching about not wasting time today, but took 45 to rant about stuff not relating to the class.",
