As in every profession, there are folks who really make it clear that they\u2019re invested in their work and take pride in it, and there are other folks who apparently don\u2019t care that much. Teaching is only one part of the job, so there may be other things going on pulling their attention away, and they\u2019re perhaps doing the best they can under the circumstances. It could also be that some are just lazy and/or view teaching as \u201cbeneath them\u201d (I personally know a few like this - research is all they care about, and teaching is just a thorn in the side to them).",

This goes against student code and the student was reprimanded for it. Now he is not allowing for early completion of midterms and quizzes because students can easily upload his questions and answers, and allow others to cheat. My fiance creates all questions by hand, he doesn't take anything from the internet.",

I have even had many professors who didn't give two shits if we did midterms or the final together. Some even encouraged it. But my fiance has been astounded by the amount of plagiarism and cheating he has had to grade. He is especially wary of siblings. He has two midterms in a semester (only one during an intersession) and only one counts towards your grade. This gives leeway if you do really bad on the first, you can make it up with the second. But he's had it where siblings will have one take it and tank it so that the second one, later on in the day, can get a better score on it. And then they trade places for the next midterm. He obviously can't prove cheating in this regard, but he does have open book, open note and open lecture quizzes and tests.",
