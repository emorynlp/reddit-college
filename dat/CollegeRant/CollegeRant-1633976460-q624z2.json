  "text": "I'm a sophomore right now so my first two semesters were pretty messed up because of Covid. My first semester of freshman year was totally online so I lived at home. I was super bummed out by this and it made me want to transfer but I figured I should give it a fair shot. In the spring, all of y classes were still online but I got approved for housing so I lived on campus. I had the room all to myself and campus was pretty quiet. Again, I wanted to transfer but I told myself that this would not be what it is normally like, so I needed to give it another shot.\n\nI'm now in the first semester of ym sophomore year and my campus is pretty much back to normal. Still wearing masks and everything like that but it's the closest thing to the \"college experience\". Literally from day one I was miserable. I cried for like the first ten days. I don't like being here and I don't really care about my major anymore. I want to transfer and I finally found somewhere that I want to go and something that I want to do. I visited that school this weekend and expected to feel like I fit in immediately. I expected to have and \"ah-hah\" moment, where I knew that would be the place for me. As much as I liked the school, I did not have that moment and now I'm feeling really lost and scared. I don't have a backup plan. Am I searching for a feeling that doesn't exist? Did anyone have their \"ah-hah\" moment?\n\nPart of me thinks that maybe college is supposed to suck a little bit and I just have to suck it up and get through it. Another part of me feels so incredibly lonely and like I don't fit in anywhere and there is no place for me at any school. What should I do? Should I leave and try somewhere new or should I just push through it?",

      "text": "Honestly, I'd say that a lot of people are feeling lost right now. It really sucks that your freshman semester was wholly online as that's the semester that you really begin to explore yourself and your desires... because you have motivation by being on campus more often and being alone with your thoughts, and also socializing.\n\nI'm in my 5th semester so my first semester was in person, my second semester half in person, and now I haven't been on campus in nearly two years. But I at least had that first semester in-person experience, you never had that... so it's extremely difficult.\n\nI myself had been losing motivation until I started talking with others about what I wanted to do and my motivations. I recommend you do the same. It's also possible that you haven't truly found your \"calling\" yet, I went into college thinking I wanted to go into journalism but then found my true passion in biology. That's one hell of a shift.\n\nCollege is supposed to suck somewhat, but your goals for graduating and landing a job in your field is what's supposed to keep you going. I highly recommend speaking with a counselor/educational advisor at your college about what your plans are, or ask them to help you plan and find your goals. Take some sort of career test and see what careers might suit you/that you find interesting. College may not be right for you and if it isn't, that's fine. But you never know until you understand what your career goals are. What do you want to do with your life, what are you passionate about? 99% of the time you can make some sort of career out of a passion you have. Sometimes that career doesn't require a college education, sometimes it does.",
