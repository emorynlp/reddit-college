  "text": "I have never seen such a poorly run system in my life. From professors being across the country with terrible internet connection, GROUP PROJECTS in an asynchronous class where it\u2019s hard to even contact anyone, and the piles of work that is given because apparently professors think they can increase the workload since it\u2019s online. \n\nPair that with limited social interaction and being in a major that I currently despise, this year honestly couldn\u2019t get any worse. I don\u2019t know if I can even make it through the semester.",

The fact that I don't have to travel all the way to class, I could web-surf more discretely, and I feel like I have the ability to leave at any time because once you're in an in-person class, you can't really leave without it affecting the class.\n\nBut now, most online classes require webcam and microphone. This is even worse than in-person classes because some people don't want to have to present themselves at home. Some people live in more unfortunate conditions than others and it becomes more apparent when we have to record ourselves at home.\n\nI think online classes, in general, are a little fun for a short period of time, but I can't do them all the time. We will lose most of our social skills by doing everything virtually and it's more difficult to present yourself professionally from home.",

So, many students are also having to \u201clearn\u201d as they\u2019re \u201clearning\u201d and it\u2019s not easy. My hope is that schools will show some major improvements in the way of student services, tools, etc. as they relate to online learning in the spring.\n\nJust hang in there ... feel free to check my account out on TikTok, as I\u2019ve shared a lot of tips and advice for students in online classes this fall.

              "text": "I've done both. I think it depends on the teacher.  I've had a class where we had to attend zoom, but I really didn't mind because the class was very interactive since participation was 60% of the class and the teacher  was really cool. I've had in person classes that were shitty and we could've just done the work online and it would've been the easier than attending class. I've had online classes that were set up organized so you were able to do work by yourself but the professor gave many resources, had quality content, and communicated frequently. I've also had the exact opposites of all those experiences. I don't really prefer any in normal circumstances, but with COVID going on I prefer to have online courses so that I can just do things at my own pace. But like I said, a lot of it is based on how well the professor structures the class. The problem we're having is literally that professors either aren't comfo with online/zoom and have no idea how to be effective, or they've gotten away with doing nothing because only a few students would sign up for their course over the summer/winter so they didn't have to spend an entire semester worrying too much about it and haven't adjusted it at all",
