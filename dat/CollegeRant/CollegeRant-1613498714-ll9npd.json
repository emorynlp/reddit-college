  "text": "Not sure if its just because I\u2019m a microbiology major, but I feel like my professors have such fewer exams which makes the material I have to memorize so much more. It\u2019s so frustrating because I feel like I could do so well if we had exams after every half-unit. \n\nUgh theres just so much information and not enough space in my brain :(",
