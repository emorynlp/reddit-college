  "title:": "Don't know what to do anymore :/ Physics is kickin my ass and makes me not want to major in Computer Science anymore but it's kinda too late to switch up. Even more even if I did want to change majors, I don't even know what I would pick",
  "text": "Physics is straight up killing me right now, and with 2 weeks left in the Summer Quarter at my C.C, I am stressing at the potential of failing. What makes this even worse is that I'm a Running Start student (Pretty sure everyone knows what Running Start is, but for those who don't, I'm a HS taking classes at Community College free of tuition. Still gotta pay class fees and shit, so roughly around $270 per quarter, though I had to pay full tuition of $1200 for the summer quarter). If I fail this class, it will throw off the whole plan I set up for myself and I won't know what to do....With my physics class being online and having a shitty teacher who basically reviews material instead of actually teaching us, this is the only time in my life where I've even had to worry about potentially failing. Since I'm going into my last year of HS/C.C , I had to pick fast on what I wanted to major in, in which I decided on Computer Science since I've always loved everything that has to do with computers. Though now I honestly don't know what to do major wise, and most classes are filled up anyway if I wanted to switch majors heading into this fall quarter. I guess what I'm most of afraid of is just failing and having to live with the shame of it and telling my parents. Along with that, since we ain't got it like that in terms of money, I feel even worse considering my parents paid for the majority of my tuition for this Summer quarter. Maybe I'm just bitchin and complaining and that's fine if you see it that way, I won't take offense. I guess I'm just here to rant and get my feelings out. Motivation for this shit is hard since I've felt clueless since day 1 even with some tutoring and help from the professor. I'd start to get some shit just to be left in the dust..My only option left of course is just to hunker down, try to study the material, and see what happens...\n\nAlso question for those who have used Chegg and/or Bartleby: I'm getting pretty desperate I'm not gonna lie. Tutoring for Physics is basically over and not a option anymore at my C.C, As it ran from the beginning of the quarter up till yesterday. I was thinking of using Chegg or Bartleby to review problems from my homework and try to get the step by step methods down to apply to future problems. Does Chegg or Bartleby work or should I just forget the idea and try to work with the book (Which is just as confusing as the professor)\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted-Talk\n\nTL:DR : Idk what to do considering I'm stressing hard about failing Physics cuz it'll affect my future roadmap pretty bad if I fail",

      "text": "Hi, I just graduated from high school with my AA from a program similar to Running Start.\n\nI understand that your physics class and the thought of failing the class is stressful. Please do not let this one class deter you from changing majors; this class is hardly a representation of the major. Computer science is a great degree that will enable you to live a financially secure life.\n\nFrom your post, it seems like enjoy planning ahead. Consider the worst case scenario, where you fail the class, and write down how that would affect your plans. Think about what you would say to your parents.\n\nAfter that, you need to just sit down and do your best to prepare for the last weeks of your course. It's your only option, which you know. I HIGHLY recommend emailing your instructor a few questions that you might have when studying, even if you know it won't help. Preferential treatment is a huge thing, and even a little bit of influence helps.\n\nI had a friend who took physics, and the teacher never showed them their actual grade. The teacher graded on a scale of 100 points, and my friend consistently did *terrible*. It turns out my friend was actually pretty average in the class; after curving grades, he recieved a C as his final grade.\n\nI hope something similar happens to you. Just recognize that, in the case of failing physics, this is only a small obstacle in your course. Even if this prevents you from receiving your AA (unlikely), you are still incredibly ahead of the average student. There is a reason why you are doing well in Running Start; it's time to sit down and just try your best. Keep us updated!",

      "text": "This sounds so much like my initial experience with college! I too was a computer science major at a community college when I first started, and I too totally failed a bunch of classes one semester and decided to change my major. \n\nListen, it sucks when it happens, but sometimes you may fail a course. Sometimes this is because it's difficult and you legitimately tried and fell short, but more often than not we can be honest with ourselves here and admit there was probably more we could've done to prevent failing. I did decide to switch majors because it turned out I absolutely hated computer science. \n\nThe worst part of this is you are going to have to retake this class if you do fail (so your GPA won't be permanently wrecked), and it will suck to tell your parents and pay for the class again. What I would do is buckle down and commit to working at least a certain number of hours each day.\n\nNow, if you do fail, it will be fine! You are still in high school and have literally years ahead of you to figure all of this out. Classes can be retaken, loans can be had, majors can be changed, etc. Everyone screws up a few times with college. You'll be ok! Better that it is at the beginning than the final semesters of your major.",

          "text": "First off, thanks for your words! Your response has given me some positivity at how I'm looking at the situation.  Second, looking at it now, you are most definitely right about people (as in me lol...) not being honest without ourselves on how we could do more to prevent failing. I'm looking to take your advice of buckling down and dedicating way more time than I have been this quarter, as I can't lie to myself that my effort hasn't been at 100% and I shouldn't put that on the professor. With a test on Monday, I'm looking to review the material for the certain chapter and hopefully do good on that. Then immediately look back over the whole quarter and relook at the concepts that I haven't been able to grasp that well, so I can do good on the Final Exam.\n\nAlso I'm sorry that you've failed a bunch of classes way back when, but at it seems that you are here now, it's obvious and great that you moved past that! What are you majoring in now and how are you liking it? (Or if you already graduated, how did you like that experience of switching majors?)",

              "text": "Yeah I had to pay out of pocket to retake all of my classes and it was definitely no fun, especially since I ended up switching majors anyways. But without retaking them my GPA would never have recovered. I switched to English education and I actually just finished my first year of teaching! I taught English 1 and Journalism and it was loads of fun. Definitely a 180 from CS lol. This next year I'll be teaching English as a Second Language at another school, which means I'll be working with other teachers to help them when they have non-English speaking students and working directly with those students. Basically, you literally have no idea right now what you may end up doing, so don't stress out too badly! It will work out. Switching majors was a great decision and I liked my classes a lot more. Don't be afraid to branch out and look more closely at things you wouldn't have considered before. I used to feel like it was CS, engineering or bust because I thought I had to make 80k+ to be content, but I'm actually more content with a stable job that I like and which pays just fine.",

I'm also stressing due to how I know my parents will react to it and ofc how I'll feel about it myself if I fail (The full price tuition is the main reason I'd feel really guilty and ashamed for since I didn't pay for most of it). If it comes down to it, I can try to slip onto a waitlist spot to retake the Physics class in the fall since the one class I'd need is full for all professors offering it.",

I know that college is expensive and that\u2019s really great your parents are paying for your classes. I would suggest you look into aid, scholarships and work study to help relieve the burden. It is not the end of the world if you done her your associates at the same time as your diploma. I\u2019m not gonna have a bachelors degree until I am 25! Also until u switch to a university you don\u2019t need to know what you want to major in and it is normal to change your major a few times. I hope this advice helps. You are doing your best and keep trying to do your best but burn out is real and I am right there with you. I hated physics 1 and 2 and took two summer courses this year lol.",

      "text": "Things going off of major plans, especially when it comes to a situation like this in college, shit really hurts. I\u2019m sorry that you feel like this and that it\u2019s putting so much pressure on you. While you are a Running Start student for the purpose of I\u2019m assuming finishing college quicker with less debt/money, I think that this is a good opportunity in that you have been able to dip your feet into what you thought you wanted to major in. Not saying you don\u2019t appreciate being able to have the head start, but a lot of people waste money paying full price trying to figure out what they want to do. So what I\u2019m saying is, if you were able to figure out a different path, maybe in part by discussing with your parents (who I\u2019m sure would understand) this would be a good time to try and do that versus later. I know the situation isn\u2019t ideal and having your big plan thrown off is disheartening (believe me, as I go into my 6th year of undergrad OOF) but be okay with \u201cfailing\u201d and changing your course to figure out what might be better for you if you\u2019re really hating physics. \n\nAlso, as an aside, I\u2019m not well versed in what it takes for a Computer Science major, but how much is it of physics? Can you just meander your way through the physics requirements or is that a big portion? I feel like CS can be applied to so many different fields that you could still find what you enjoy about computers in that major/other related ones. \n\nI\u2019ve never used Bartleby or owned my own Chegg account, but if you\u2019re using it to understand the problems I think that\u2019s not a bad idea. It\u2019s helpful for a lot of people because they often explain the answers, though I know many use it to cheat (you don\u2019t seem like the latter). \n\nI wish you luck OP, and I hope you are able to figure things out even though it may feel hopeless right now.",
