  "title:": "We Love A Ridiculous and Homophobic Professor :)",
  "text": "I am an idiot. I did not look up my professors prior to this semester. What a big mistake on my end. Now, to preface, I have had 13 professors and classes prior to this. A majority of them came from this college. I have only ever had issues with one professor, which was not MY professor but a club leader, being homophobic and transphobic. \n\nWell, isn't it my luck? I have another one. \n\nSo, this is an accelerated 7 week course. I work two jobs due to my demographic and lack of support at home. So, this is an ONLINE course.\n\nTo start, the professor has told EVERYONE on the first week, \"You will NEVER be eligible for 100% on anything. You have chosen the path of an online course which is substantially easier than a live lecture. Your grade will reflect as much.\"\n\nWhich I said whatever. I am very good at course work, anyway, and I didn't think this would matter. \n\nThe first few grades she gave me? Well below passing because I was giving \"too much detail\" and \"in a debate, I wouldn't have this time.\" Which?? This is a history course. This is NOT debate class or public speaking course. I am not even a history major. So, I have less detail and just summarized my initial posts. \"You are giving too little detail!/ This is irrelevant without more to add!\" I started to stress out because I was writing too much or too little. I EMAILED her several times, too, to get feedback and she would never response. Then, one day I get an email about my profile picture which contained the hint of a pride button. \"You should not be wearing any form of media that is not neutral to your school.\" \n\nFrom there, she started to spell my name wrong. :) Every single time. I would correct her politely. I sign my emails, it is in my documents, it is PUBLIC and I'd email her.\n\n\"Hey, my name is spelled \\*\\*\\*\\* not \\*\\*\\*\\*.\"\n\nNever. Got. A. Response.\n\nWell, due to depression and needing a hospital visit and starting new meds, I was out of school for a week. All of my professors understood the circumstances of this situation and granted me more time to do my work, with my documentation and such to show I was genuinely just struggling. I was waiting on student disabilities to approve everything to. THIS PROFESSOR TOLD ME MY DEPRESSION WAS MY FAULT and that if I worked harder, I would not have missed an assignment but she was giving me \"permission\" to make those assignments up. However, I should \"feel special\" because \"if I break that rule for one student, I have to break it for ALL of them.\" She gave me ONE DAY. Well, due to my news medication and the extreme fatigue, I hadn't even realized I had the email because I had a week's worth of other work to focus on and then my ACTUAL jobs needed me back since I work in two office positions. By the time I had her assignments done, it was a few days later. I emailed her again, and she DID NOT respond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can sympathize. People are busy. School is busy. It's been two weeks, I tried her again. She told me \"You know from your records that you used your one-time free pass. I don't make exceptions because it's not fair for other students, in the past and in the present.\" I told her I NEVER had a chance to use it and I was reaching out to submit the work.\n\nThis lead to a full fledged internet squabble where I finally snapped on her and TOLD her if she was confused on my previous emails, she needed to reach out and make that clear. I reached out to my academic dean...\n\nNothing will probably come of this....\n\nI just wasted my breath.\n\nTL;DR :) I hate college professors that are dicks and I no longer care about my GPA. I will gladly perish and drop out. Watch me.",

      "text": "There should be multiple deans at your college. I had to report a professor earlier this week. I called, emailed, and got the runaround. So I went to campus, found their office, and said, \"I need to report a professor for their inappropriate conduct.\"\n\nApparently those were the magic words. I was immediately pulled into an office with candy and an emotional support dog. The dean drafted an email right then and there, reprimanding the professor, demanding he meet in her office, and 100% solving my issue. Did I maybe make them think I was being sexually harassed, thus expediting the process of getting a meeting with them? Yes, absolutely. But did I lie? No. His behavior *was* inappropriate.\n\nGo fourth, and open many doors with these magic words. Do not send and email, do not call them. Go to their office and don't leave until actual progress has been made to resolve this. You're being treated inappropriately by your professor. Your rights as a student are being infringed. \n\nCollect any documentation of this: emails, her unfair grades, her comment about your pin.  \n\nAlso, my biggest point. Don't let this miserable pissant ruin your education. She's trash. Fuck up her career instead. Currently watching my Prof go down in flames for the bullshit he was doing. Great fun, when they deserve it. \ud83d\ude42",

          "text": "UPDATE, and you\u2019re to thank \ud83d\udc9b\u2728!!\n\nI printed out all of my emails and interactions at work on break. I went to campus after work and refused to leave until I saw the Dean. When I saw the Dean, I made them read through the entirety of the messages. I was so angry and anxious, but I did my best to be level headed. I detailed my medical excuses, the discrimination towards students that can\u2019t make lectures, the homophobia over my pin, and since our school is trying to educate their professors on mental health? This was a huge problem. \n\n(Also!!! He has a pride flag and a BLM flag in his office. He said my pin is acceptable and she should not dictate my choice of photo and that since the harassment of my name and her addressing me were forms of microaggressions after the comment, he treating it as homophobia. He said they were going to enforce staff training in the next few weeks and look at penalizing the professor more but he could not detail what the looks like/it\u2019s a board decision.)\n\nThey are going to refund me for my course, pay for my next history course in full and supply the book, and we\u2019re going to excuse withdrawal me to avoid damaging my GPA and avoid further discrimination. \n\nHe gave me some tissues because I was cry and a wreck. He offered me the therapy office where we had a similar set up but our service animal was out. I said I had two emotional support animals at home that would help with my anxiety. He gave me his business card for the future.",

              "text": "Boy, strap in.\n\nFinal exam was an off-campus event. That's fine, I thought, I'll get directions and the whole class will be there, no problem. Throughout the ENTIRE semester, I have asked him in person and through email about this event thing. What am I supposed to do? What's the address? Why is it not in the classroom? I did not EVER receive an answer. I mean, if you want to consider \"we'll get there when we get there\" and \"you have creative freedom\" and \"we'll meet at this one place then go to the event as a group\" and other funky bullshit as answers, then oh boy I got so many answers. Dude sends out an email the day before the event with an address and a map of how to get there. He says \"meet me at this other place at this time and we'll go to [address] together.\" Great. Still not sure what the fuck I'm supposed to do, but I'll be there. I let my family know where I'll be because this is setting off all kinds of alarms. But I wouldn't pass the class if I didn't make the final - for some inane reason it's 40% of my grade ????\n\nAnyway. I get to the meeting place. It's outside, in a park. This was earlier this week, and where I live we just had a cold snap. In other words, it's fucking miserable cold outside. I'm 15 minutes early, no big deal. I was fine with waiting 15 minutes. I waited there for a fucking hour and half. I walked to this other address he gave, knocked on the door, and said \"I'm here for the final with Professor Asshole\" and the lady had no idea what the fuck I was talking about, but she did know him. She let me come in, have some water, get warm, and called him. And texted him. And sent him an email. I waited for another half an hour, then broke down and left.\n\nI almost just gave up. What a bullshit day. I wanted to cry I was so pissed. Then I was like \"nope. Im not gonna fail this class cause this guy's a fucking loser. I paid out the ass for this bullshit class, waited in the cold for over an hour, I'm gonna sick the dean on his ass.\"\n\nI got to make up the final on video. I'm nervous he'll retaliate and fail me anyway... But I also hope he does so I can watch the dean fuck him up some more.\n\nThe ironic part? It's a fucking communication class. This whole mess could have been avoided if he would have used the fucking skills he taught this entire semester. \ud83e\udd37",

This is the advice I would give to any student that is being 1) discriminated by faculty or 2)being disadvantaged by lazy/incompetent professors. \n\nIf what you are saying is really true and there is evidence of it, you need to compile a file with all the evidence attached. This homophobic behavior is not appropriate. Like /u/anadized said, you need to reach the proper channels ASAP. Although I would first start with the department chair. If your complaints fall on deaf ears, then I would contact the dean.",

      "text": ">Sounds like you got a bad professor. I've taken many, many online classes. I actually prefer them. Most professors i've had have told us, in the sylabus that online classes are harder and you need more disipline to be successful in them. The line she said , \"***You have chosen the path of an online course which is substantially easier than a live lecture,\"*** is complete horseshit. The fact she said this shows she's no good. No good professor would ever say online is easier than seated, especially in a 7 week accelerated course. I usually don't say this but this professors **NEEDS** to be fired. I hope this shitty teacher doesnt screw up your time in higher education. I wish you luck.",

Way to start off the class on a high note, basically tell everyone they\u2019re slackers and that their grade will get penalized for it lol. Also you\u2019re doing your part by emailing and following process so she should definitely try to meet your more halfway. It just sounds like this person has a total lack of empathy, vague standards and is prolly more focused on researching than teaching.",
