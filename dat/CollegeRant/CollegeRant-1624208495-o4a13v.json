  "text": "I\u2019m majoring in biomedical engineering, and getting the core engineering classes done. I\u2019ve been remote bc of covid my whole college journey so far, and it just sucks. I don\u2019t even remember what I learned lmao, I feel like none of this will even matter at a job. I\u2019m hoping junior year will be better bc that\u2019s when I take specialized BME classes but calculus, physics, comp sci, and other crap just feels boring. Ask me to recall one thing from physics I all i remember is F=ma. I feel like my education didnt teach me anything about the \u201creal world\u201d.",

      "text": "You are not alone. I just graduated and Literally can not recall information given. During the time of Covid my GPA dropped from a 3.87 to a 3.2. Your in a pretty hard major, I can't imagine attempting to manage all the work you had on top of everything else. \n\nYou got threw it though. It doesn't feel great but you got threw, COVID literally only worsened the mental health epidemic amount Uni students. Yet professors seemed to have no recognition of the positions we were all put in. \n\nI am super glad you got threw it all, and are looking forward to your upper division classes. Give yourself grace readjusting, this internet stranger is routing for you!",
