They can help provide you with the resources needed to succeed.\n\nI\u2019d suggest doing some self reflection on what went wrong this time and work to correct it for next time. You shouldn\u2019t be too hard on yourself either tho and take the time to relax if you can.",

      "text": "I\u2019m somebody who is really critical of myself and I really relate to how you view yourself. I think that our personalities come from being naturally low in conscientiousness and high in neuroticism, with high standards for ourselves. It\u2019s a tough mix. I think it\u2019s important to recognize your own responsibility in doing well, but you also need to forgive yourself. Given that you have a learning disability, there\u2019s even more reason to relieve yourself of some of the blame your experiencing. The best thing to do from this point on is to be proud that you are holding yourself accountable rather than blaming your situation, and work from there. The positive side to seeing yourself as falling short is the possibility of being so much more than who you are right now. Make small incremental changes in your habits and keep reasonable goals. Talk to an advisor about your situation with financial aid and they will offer you support. Being on academic probation doesn\u2019t make you any less of a person. You are still you and it\u2019s always possible to return to a better state of productivity if you know you\u2019ve been capable of it in the past. The worst thing to do is torture yourself about it, even if you feel like that\u2019s what you deserve. Take care <3",
