  "text": "I still have the same mental health problems that I did in high school; on top of that, I keep making shitty fucking decisions now that i\u2019m on my own and eating shitty fucking food bc I don't have a kitchen. I have friends that I do stuff with but I feel can\u2019t trust anyone and I feel really fucking alone here\n\nTL;DR: having a hard time adjusting to the independence that comes with college",

      "text": "I feel the same as you and the comment by /u/robertbchatham. I\u2019m in a 1 bedroom off campus and I\u2019m alone most of the time, besides my boyfriend who isn\u2019t in college. I have no college friends and it sucks! But it\u2019s only temporary. Remember that if you focus on what\u2019s important to you, you can find opportunities that will naturally allow you to make friends. Just start by prioritizing your studies and your passions, and hopefully those two things can lead you to new friends.",
