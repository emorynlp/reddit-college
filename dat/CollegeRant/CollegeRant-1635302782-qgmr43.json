  "title:": "Is it possible to room with a roommate whose sleeping preference is absolute silence and no lights",
  "text": "I\u2019m living with a roommate and a suitemate. The problem we\u2019re having is that I sleep too late and she sleeps early. She likes to sleep with absolute silence and no light at all. Which means me walking around midnight to use the bathroom can\u2019t work cuz when I open the door the light is on and she hates it. When I open my drawers it makes a squeak noise even if I slowly open it to prevent sound. When I open the door or enter in the room the door makes a sound even if I close it softly and she doesn\u2019t like that. Basically I have to be a ghost at night. She closes all the lights at either 10-11 pm. I sometimes leave my desk lamp open in case I\u2019m still working on homework but she says because there\u2019s light she\u2019s can\u2019t sleep cuz of me. Even if I turn it off my computer screen has light and she hates it. She also complained about me being too noisy to the RA and the RA talked to me about it and I acknowledge me sleeping too late but I cannot control the noise and light. I also told her my concerns about her turning the full room lights on in the morning just to clean her nose piercing when she could\u2019ve gone to the bathroom to do it(she did this 3 times now) knowing this I\u2019ve been trying to sleep earlier but my ra mentioned that she also has an issue with me in the bathroom regarding toilet paper. I listed a few things she might be concerned with me and my ra says it\u2019s confidential and all she can say is toilet paper. Maybe it\u2019s because when my roommate bought some cleaning supplies and toilet paper I didn\u2019t pitch in. I already have a bunch of toilet paper and I told her I have them up in my closet and lmk when we need it but she never did. After explaining my side my ra says that there\u2019s miscommunication. I told my roommmate so many times that if she has a problem with me, tell it to me right away but if it\u2019s about the lights issue I can\u2019t change it cuz it\u2019s impossible. Also I just can\u2019t sleep that early. I also do have some stuff I don\u2019t like her doing but I\u2019m not gunna mention that cuz that\u2019s my problem not hers.",

Why she acting like you are living with her instead of you both sharing a dorm. \nAt what time are you going to bed? and what are yalls majors?",
