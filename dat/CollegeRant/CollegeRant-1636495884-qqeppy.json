  "text": "I quit my job. People might say I\u2019m bad at time management, procrastinator, weak, whiny, lazy, that\u2019s not how the real world works etc. Sure idc. I quit my job that scheduled me 4-6 times a week to focus on school. But I will be volunteering at most 3 times a week for something I like to do. I think my degree is better to focus on a than a minimum wage job I hate. I want to make my life easier and people act like it\u2019s a crime. Asking to just change my availability. Ha they have scheduled me against my availability and other ppl before. They don\u2019t care and you get all the blame if you don\u2019t find someone to cover your shift. \n\nOh and how about juggle volunteering, work, and college! Kiss my ass. I barely have free time as it already is and when I decide to have it I\u2019m behind and it\u2019s so fucking stressful. I don\u2019t want to make my life hard. I feel like people around me are addicted to struggle. When I clock out early (or when I\u2019m supposed to) my coworkers try to convince me to stay and do overtime like shut up. Now I\u2019m privileged because I get money for going to college because of my dads g.i bill so I got the means to do this. I was only at that job for work experience and to get more money because my benefit pay was behind schedule.",

      "text": "Seems like where you were working was pretty bad. Any job that ignores you availability (especially in a college town, where many people likely need that accommodation) isn\u2019t worth it. On the other hand, I would really recommend liking for a different job that will actually respect the time commitment you are able to make. \n\nI struggle balancing work and college as well, and I don\u2019t do anything extra like you\u2019ve mentioned. I\u2019ve been super lucky to find a good workplace that does respect this! Being able to save even like $50 a week will help you so much in the future. \n\nAll that being said, you know what\u2019s best for you and what you personally can handle. Fuck everyone being rude or condescending to you about it.",
