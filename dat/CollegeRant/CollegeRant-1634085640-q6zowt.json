  "text": "It seems like it comes naturally to most other people. I see couples holding hands all the time. Large groups of people hanging out. I\u2019ve been joining clubs, working out, attending lectures, etc and haven\u2019t figured out what a good way is to meet girls or make friends. I don\u2019t wanna be a virgin loser when I graduate",

      "text": "The worst thing you can do is actively seek out a girlfriend. Let me explain. We can tell when a guy is speaking to us with the intention of getting in our pants and its a turn off (unless shes also looking for a hookup but generally not). Treat and talk to women like youd talk to a guy. If, *if*, you have chemistry with a woman you befriended then try to take it to the next level, but other than that, treat them as friends. You make friends by talking to people. How many people do you approach and speak to per day? How many people do you ask to study together or go to some event? Whoever you sit next to in class, at the dining hall, wherever, just make small chat. Ask questions. Talk about yourself but ask questions more. Make plans for the future.",

I don\u2019t know what to say besides that. I eat alone for almost every meal and sit alone in lectures. I don\u2019t really approach anyone because I think it would just be really awkward and go terribly. I have no idea how to make small talk. My social skills are probably the worst out of anyone. I mostly just feel like it\u2019s hopeless",

              "text": "Well, friends arent going to just fall into your lap. You need to make an effort. Its not awkward at all to talk to people on campus, I think thats mostly in your head. I talk to a new person at least everyday. It doesnt always develop into a friendship and I may never speak to them again, but thats what you need to do.\n\n>usually just \u201chi\u201d or \u201chow\u2019s it going\u201d. I don\u2019t know what to say besides that\n\nI dont think thats true. You cant think of a *single thing* youd want to tell another person? Hell, go with the classic, talk about the weather. Ask how they think they did on a recent quiz/exam. Ask if they could help you with something on a homework. Ask what their major is. Ask where theyre from. Ask if they have pets. Ask what music they like. I highly doubt youd ask all those questions and a conversation didnt develop organically. \n\nYou have to stop giving a shit about what other people might think of you. Look at it this way. Say you did approach someone to start a conversation and the person thought it was weird. That, itself, is fucking weird. Its college. Literally everyone starts out not knowing a soul on campus, often in the city as a whole. People transfer in at weird times, etc. Theres literally not a single sane reason to think its strange to start a conversation with someone.",

And no I can\u2019t think of a single thing I would want to tell another person. I don\u2019t give a damn about what anyone would have to tell me about themselves. Why should I care about what someone\u2019s major is. I don\u2019t care if they have pets. I don\u2019t care what music they like. I don\u2019t have a reason to care about anything or anyone so I don\u2019t see why I should make the effort to talk to anyone. At this point I am more willing to jump off a building than I am to cold approach someone",

Ask people about the questions that interest you, like for me, an interesting conversation could start with \"Why is it that mathematics, which often starts based on pursuing an intellectually interesting but abstract set of axioms and their implications so frequently becomes useful in describing the universe? Does there exist some a priori relationship between abstract mathematics and reality?\"\n\nIf that question isn't interesting, I'm sure you can think of one for yourself. \"Do you think there exist meaningfully different forms of human wellbeing, from a utilitarian perspective, or does utility differ only in magnitude?\" etc.\n\nIt's also already been mentioned, but thinking about the world through the lens implied by the phrase 'virgin loser' is off-putting to most people. No one cares if you've had sex. Also, realizing a person is interacting with you purely to achieve some sort of personal 'tally mark' is incredibly annoying.",
