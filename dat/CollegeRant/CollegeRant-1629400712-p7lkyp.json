Like what\u2019s the point of Carmen if professors just use a third party anyway.\n\nThanks to all the stories though I feel like I have an edge to get ahead of all the stupid bs",

              "text": "Aleks deducts points off if you get a problem wrong or  doesn\u2019t go with what aleks wants you to say. It makes you stay on a problem/topic until you get it right. You have knowledge checks that you have to do sometimes and if you get a problem wrong, it makes you have to do a specific topic all over again. It is a huge time waster and rage inducing thing to go through. Do not recommend..",
