  "text": "The first few semesters, I was doing fine. Not excellent but still passable. But as I am taking more and more advanced fast-paced/vague course. I started to do horribly. I am afraid of going to the campus or classroom..... The more I fear, the worse I perform. My old friends even looked down on me for that. Just wanna rant.  I have recently attended the Ielts test and that examiner just gave me an 6.5. So sorry for my poor English.",
