  "text": "Went to check my grades this morning and noticed he gave me a 45 and 60 for two of my essays. You would think I rushed through them or put no effort in with those sort of grades but they took my hours obviously as they are a page and in 11 point font and single spaced!!! I can\u2019t deal anymore, I have four more of those to write and apparently my efforts may just be in vein, and on top of two lab reports due every week.",

      "text": "First, was there a prompt/description or some list of requirements for the papers? If so go back and review that information. Maybe you missed something. Once you have done that, and if you still have no idea what you did wrong, setup a meeting with the professor. \n\nI'm a TA and when I grade an essay assignment, usually I don't take that many points off unless you didn't satisfy a requirement of the instructions/prompt. So that's why I think you should just double check that something isn't missing from your assignment. \n\nAlso you mention lab reports. Is this a science lab? Scientific writing is it's own unique beast that takes A LOT of practice to get good at. If you need some resources, I can provide you with some.",

Also, maybe try running the program through a website like Grammarly or something that will do a basic proofread of your paper.\n\nAnother tip is to sit down and read your paper out loud, not just in your head. I catch a lot of mistakes and weird phrasing when I'm actually speaking as opposed to just reading.",

I understand you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on them, but unfortunately effort doesn\u2019t always equal quality. Just because something takes someone a long time doesn\u2019t mean they did a good job and that the work merits a higher grade.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I agree with the other posters on the suggestion of visiting the writing lab. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be able to shed some light on what\u2019s going on.",

      "text": "Felt that.  I have a Japanese prof (the prof is from Japan, the class isn\u2019t Japanese) this semester, and she always gives me extremely low scores on grammar.  Thing is, the parts she marked me down for were grammatically correct in the first place.  I work as a writing consultant in my schools English department.  I\u2019ve discussed this with my coworkers there, so I know I\u2019m not at fault.  I\u2019ve talked with my classmates too, and they say they\u2019ve been similarly marked.  We talked to the prof about this, and she admitted to not being a native English speaker.  But she marks us down anyways and refuses to consider reevaluating the scores\n\nMaybe if you reach out they\u2019ll reevaluate their grading?  Idk, hopefully your prof is reasonable and open to discussion",

I'm not sure if it just feels that way or because it's true, but now I feel like the group thinks I'm the weak link and I've procrastinated making the changes because I'm scared of fixing it just to let everyone (and myself) down again. That being said I am working on it right now, just wanted to check Reddit as a break. It might help to ask him for critique? Some professors don't leave feedback because they think students won't value or use it (which does happen). Maybe if you reach out to him and voice your concerns he'll take the time to actually give feedback? Hopefully lol",

Although no one at my second uni went over how to use it or even contact them so I didn't use it while there. \n\nHad one instructor who would mark random things wrong on my paper because it didn't meet the requirements which it did, it just didn't meet her requirements that were never posted anywhere. Wrote each paper 4 times and they were all about 4-6 pages on length. Some papers were done over more than 4 but 4 was the average. Hated life and hated going to college bc of that instructor. Put me so far behind in my other classes that I was playing catch up until the last day assignments could be submitted.",
