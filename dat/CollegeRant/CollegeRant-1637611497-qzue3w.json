  "title:": "For the first time I'm actually stoked to graduate",
  "text": "I still have a year left but I'm on the downhill slope. And after all the fucking stress and setbacks and rough months, things are finally lining up right. Last week I got a research position in a lab that I love. And this semester is the first in a long time that has gone well. Good grades and positive memories, taking good care of myself and enjoying my life.\n\nI was assaulted by my good friend in my first semester, in student housing. People don't realize how it ruins your life. My anxiety disorder, two years in recovery, came back. I got stuck in a cycle of abusive sex and abusive relationships. I left student housing and I left my mom's place and I suffered financially. School was too much but I kept trying. Ended up breaking down in my third semester and withdrawing late from most of my classes. Tanked my GPA. I couldn't recover in time so I lost my scholarships a few months ago. I've literally never felt so fucked in my whole life. I sobbed for days after I got that email.\n\nThere are parts that can't be fixed. I wish I still lived on campus and I wish I wasn't paying thousands more for school each semester. But for the first time I think I'm accepting shit for what it is. And I'm really proud of myself for getting through it. I can't wait to walk. I'm so fucking pumped to take those pictures in my cap and gown and put my diploma up on my wall. I'm excited to write and present my thesis in my last year, and to apply to grad school. I'm excited to get to invite people I love to see me graduate. I'm excited to see my friends walk too, and to get calls from them in the months after when they go back to their home states and start their careers. I'm excited to see what they do.\n\nI remember watching my older sister graduate and it's wild to think that I'm almost there now.",
