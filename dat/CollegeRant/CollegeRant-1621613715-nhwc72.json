  "title:": "Prof. giving me a zero on my final unless I retake the exam with my camera on",
  "text": "I completed taking the final exam for my Algebra class in which I received unfair treatment from the professor. We were told prior to the exam that we needed to be on logged in on zoom (with camera and mic off) throughout the exam and I made sure to do so. As soon as I completed the exam, I received an email from the professor stating:\n\n\"As it was explained and posted on Black Board, you were supposed to be on zoom during the time of final exam. YOU failed to follow the instruction, and your score for Final will be in question for verification of the person who took the test.\"\n\nDuring my entire time on zoom, I did not hear the professor call my name once, although she claims to have called my name multiple times to turn my camera on. She also claims to have sent me chat messages. However, the only time she did message me was when I was done with my exam. I responded to the message the second she sent it.\n\nI did however hear her calling the name \u201cDina.\u201d Multiple times. I\u2019m not sure if she was saying my name with her accent or not, but I know I would have noticed my name being called. She completely gaslighted me and made me feel insane.\n\nShe refuses to accept my grade for the test due to her claims. Instead, she demands that I retake the entire exam a different day with my camera on. I find this completely unfair, as my classmates and I were all taking the exam under the same circumstances, and I'm the only one being asked to completely retake the exam. I asked the professor for her reasoning, and she claimed that I finished the test quickly, which is untrue as the majority of my classmates completed it before I did.\n\nI even described to her the things she said during her time on zoom to prove that I was on and actively listening while taking the test. I also asked her multiple times if she would ask my classmates if they heard her calling my name, to which she completely ignored. \n\nInstead she made me stay past the class time to solve three questions from the test on the virtual board with my camera on. I tried to solve them, but my camera was blocked from the system and I couldn\u2019t unblock it. Additionally, there was no pen on the screen to allow me to solve the questions. She made me feel like I was lying, so I asked her if she would like me to email a picture of my screen to prove that I\u2019m not. She refused to allow me to do so. \n\nAnother thing I needed to mention is the way the professor spoke to me. She was yelling at me as if I was her five-year-old child. It was extremely unprofessional and belittling. She had absolutely no understanding of my situation and completely dismissed my point of view. \n\nI took my exam amongst all the other students in my class with our cameras off, yet I'm the only one being asked to completely retake the test. This is my final exam and I feel like it's only fair that the grade I received for it should be final, the same as everyone else who took the exam with me. I sent an email to the dean in hopes of helping my situation, but I\u2019m afraid they will side with the professor. But we\u2019re taking this semester completely online. The only accusation she has of me cheating is based on suspicion. No one was asked to turn on the camera during the test unless she was suspicious. I find that unfair. Let everyone keep their cameras on during the test instead of using unfair judgement to pick on students.",

That's so shitty wtf I'm really sorry your teachers being a bitch.\n\nAs someone who is currently studying to be a teacher we never are trained to raise our voices and teachers need to be monitored more closely because too many let it go to our heads.",

          "text": "Thank you! Unfortunately I\u2019ve already emailed the dean because the professor told me she\u2019ll email the math department for refusing to retake the exam. I\u2019m not sure my academic advisor would do much in this situation, but again i\u2019m not really familiar with her role. Just genuinely hope I don\u2019t have to sit through the exam for two hours all over again for absolutely no reason.",
