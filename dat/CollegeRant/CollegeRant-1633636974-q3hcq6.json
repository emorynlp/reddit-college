  "title:": "College and imposter syndrome are quite simply driving me to the edge of madness",
  "text": "I can't possibly express how unreal it all feels. I am not even talking about mental breakdowns. It's just another level of despair that can only be compared to madness. How is one supposed to deal with 35 hours of classes every week + homework and labs in each of the 7 classes AND still have a little fun AND sleep. Just ... HOW ? I swear I have everything on my google calendar at I just can't believe it. It is so overwhelming I can't even keep track of all the classes and the deadlines we have. Granted I am also involved in campus life and stuff but I mean that's a normal thing to do for a college student. But no. In addition to that comes f\\*cking imposter syndrome. I've been doubting my skills for these 2 years I spent in college. I just constantly feel plain dumb and like I don't even deserve to be here although there is a selection before entering the school and like half the people fail the first year but I still feel like the dumbest person in the room, like the only one from 300 people in the lecture hall that can't argue about technical computer questions with the teacher. I just feel like I don't even belong here and like I can't last. I am passionate about what I'm doing and that has to be the only thing that's keeping me from having a complete meltdown. We're just 3 weeks in the semester and I already feel like I'm going to f\\*ck up. I just want to go to sleep before midnight without feeling guilty and also just a hug.",
