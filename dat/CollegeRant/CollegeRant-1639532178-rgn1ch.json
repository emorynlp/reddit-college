  "text": "I have an A in one class for sure, thought I could get a A/A- in two others but it'll likely be a B+ in both (depends on how this essay goes in one class and in the other, whether or not the other class will get a 1% roundup). My next two classes the highest I could end up with are a B- and B, but I'll likely end up with a C+/C and C/D. \n\nGood news is I'm going to pass. Bad news is I'll be just under a 3.0 (cutoff is 2.0, but still) even though I out a lot of effort into this semester. I just seem to struggle with the tests no matter how much I understand because of how they're formatted. Answers are too similar or showing work is difficult.\n\nI'm upset at myself. I shouldn't be but I am. I had a 3.3 first semester, dropped to just under a 3 last semester and the same here. Maybe I'm applying too much pressure on myself. Doesn't help that I'm the only one in the house who goes (and has went) to college.\n\nI refuse to let anyone down. Maybe next semester I got to push myself to the maximum limit.",

Then proceeds to take points off even though I ran it through the paid version of grammerly. And took it to the writing center. But...but she still took points off for grammer",
