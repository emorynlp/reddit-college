  "text": "\nUsing respondus lockdown browser gives me more exam anxiety then the actual exam itself.  I don\u2019t cheat but I am a HUGE fidgeter, partially due to ADHD, partially due to anxiety and also it\u2019s just who I am.  I look around the room, I change positions in my chair, a tap on my laptop and fiddle with calculators or pens or whatever\u2026 the biggest thing is that I use a paper or something to cover the extra questions on my screen so that I can only see one at a time.  Today I used my calculator because I had no paper and I can only assume it\u2019s going to look like I\u2019m touching or reading something suspicious off screen. Bleh. I can only imagine the number of flags my recording will get\u2026 I\u2019m almost completely convinced I\u2019ll get an email or something asking if I cheated. Anyone else deal with this?? Or am I a solitary case lol\n\nTLDR - lockdown browser makes me anxious, I\u2019m a fidgety person, browser just results in prolonged test anxiety",

      "text": "I totally agree. I had to take a placement exam over the summer and freaked the fuck out when I found out that my exam was going to be proctored and everything. And recently, I almost freaked out when I thought my math exam was going to be in a lockdown browser. I\u2019m also a HUGE fidgeter and am either looking around the room or playing with something on my desk. I don\u2019t cheat but it\u2019s just unnecessary stress and anxiety that it puts on students.",

      "text": "I\u2019m the same way when I took exams on Honorlock. I have crazy anxiety when exam time rolls around and so far things where smooth for me. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it but make sure if anyone is talking to you make sure you tell them you\u2019re taking an exam and from there on out ignore them or tell them to keep it quiet. You just gotta cover yourself and you\u2019ll be good.",
