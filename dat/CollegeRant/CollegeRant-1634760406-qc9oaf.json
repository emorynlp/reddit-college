  "text": "I\u2019m a bachelors student at a state college, and I have to retake one of my gen eds after transferring. I\u2019m in this class, and a couple weeks ago, my grandmother passed away, and I had to travel stayed in order to attend the funeral, which I full well intended to do.  \n\n\nI was able to get an extension from all my classes, for all assignments including 2 tests, except for the one gen ed class. I even got a an excused week off from my full time job.\n\n\nIn reply to my request for an extension, I am told something to the effect of (barring specifics):\n\n\n\u2018I am sorry for your loss, there are no extensions on assignments, however, I will be offering extra credit work in an upcoming week\u2019\n\n\nThat sucks, as I would have liked to have done both, but I didn\u2019t pursue anything more and told her \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\n\nEarlier this past weekend, we had a paper due, and the night it was due, she sent an email to the entire class of the following effect:\n\n\n\u201cThis is an important assignment due tonight. A few students have gotten together to request an extension of the deadline. I\u2019m a bit unsympathetic with students that have obligations that take priority over this course, however, I will extend the deadline by 24 hours for those who need additional time.\u201d\n\n\nI think I was understandably rubbed the wrong way about this. When my grandma died there were no extensions, but you changed your mind  because a few students needed more time?\n\n\nI sent a polite and respectful email asking if she would reconsider and let me make up the minor assignments I missed for the period I requested my extension, and I got the following email back:\n\n\n\u201cSo, you have an issue because I have everyone, including you, extra time to complete a major essay??? For clarification, I gave EVERYONE in ALL my classes a 24 hour extension, which has nothing to do with a single student making up missed assignments, which is not allowed according to my syllabus.\n\nPer my prior message, you can do the extra credit I offered ALL students.\n\n\nYou are correct that giving the ENTIRE class more time at my discretion as the professor of the course, and if you think that is unfair to you personally or if you have an issue there is still time to withdraw. I\u2019m not sure how to help you further.\n\n\nIf you need any further clarification, I\u2019d be happy to schedule an appointment with the dean for you.\u201d\n\nTLDR: professor told me there was no extensions in the course when my grandmother dies but just granted an extension because a few students simply needed extra time. I asked her politely if she would reconsider letting me make up work and received a strongly worded email in return.\n\n\nI\u2019m really hurt an i don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m scared of going to class again. If anyone has advice, similar stories, or positive words id love to hear it.",

That's a very unprofessional email to send to a student.\n\nI would probably take her up on the offer to schedule an appointment with the dean, or head of the department, and bring a copy of this exchange. If she's as flippant with them as she is with you, it could go in your favor.",

We were together for ten years. Studying is painful right now. I\u2019m pushing myself through the tears.\n\nI hope you get through this semester and never have to deal with this prof again.",
