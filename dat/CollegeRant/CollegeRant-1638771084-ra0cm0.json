  "title:": "Everyone at my college cheats and it\u2019s literally beyond what administration thinks it\u2019s going on.",
  "text": "It\u2019s funny. Throughout middle school and high school my teachers would talk about the negative effects of cheating to discourage us. Nobody listened, and even the smartest students were cheating in those times.\n\nMy first college was a community college I went to for a year. Every class was providing answers one way another. My first semester there I was almost paid to do a classmate\u2019s final essay, but I backed out because I was scared I would be snitched on . Someone else in the class capitalized on the opportunity and got paid $25.\n\n Students who were not cheating kept quiet. Literally every class in my time there had some form of it, mainly in the WhatsApp group chats. It was so widespread like grade school, but this time it seemed even more people were cheating.\n\nNow I\u2019m in university and it\u2019s the same way. Technology has really enabled this to happen, it\u2019s so easy to work smarter and not harder.\n\nSo now to why I\u2019m writing this. The administration at my university has been stressing how academic dishonesty is not tolerable recently, mainly through the professors. And it\u2019s kind of hilarious at this point, because while they\u2019re right in the fact that cheating is widespread, they have no idea that the vast majority of us students are keeping quiet in this process. Another reason why it\u2019ll be tough for them to make a dent on this is because professors have increased tests and assignments online due to covid, which allows for all of the outside resources to be used. Literally every class has at least some assignments based online. \n\nMy main theory is that many professors know what\u2019s going on but wish to have the students act accordingly in discretion. \n\nMy college has no idea that it\u2019s dealing with something that is a part of academic life.",
