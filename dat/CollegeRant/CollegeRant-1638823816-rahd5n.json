  "text": "Reality\n\nIn may of 2020 I graduated from college with a finance degree and it\u2019s very hard coming to the realization that it means nothing. College doesn\u2019t prepare you for the harsh reality of what is life. My job doesn\u2019t value my degree (partly because I have job where it doesn\u2019t matter) I have been declined for over 100+ jobs I am more than qualified for! I feel absolutely worthless and my relationship is suffering due to this and it\u2019s unfair I know! But feels like nothing I can do everyday I go to work I hope to be fired if I\u2019m being completely honest. I\u2019m 23 so I know this isn\u2019t forever but just a hard realization.\n\nThis may not make sense just needed it off my chest!",

This is a mistake students make - you need more than just your degree to make yourself a competitive candidate. Internships, networking, independent project experience and even just working a regular job parallel to your studies all build up to these things. The degree is merely one piece of that puzzle.\n\nThat being said - you're right; you're only 23 and you have a lot of time to build up the remaining parts from there. Some people go through that \"trial by fire\" during or even before their studies. It's just that you have to do it after.",
