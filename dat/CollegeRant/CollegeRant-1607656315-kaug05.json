  "text": "*Warning: long rant**\n\nSenior here, graduating this coming spring (thank the lord). In all of my years, I've never been cursed to live with hallmates so childish, selfish, and such blatant disregard for dorm rules and courtesy. People like these give college students a bad reputation. \n\nThis semester, a group of friends, I suspect, moved into rooms next to each other. All was fine until they begin to play chase at 12am, blast music at 2am and host karaoke until 4am. Even with an RA's warning, they would lower the volume before slowly cranking it back up. \n\nThey look like, and act, like children. Playing chase, roller skating past midnight in the hallways. Mind you, these halls are only wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side. Hell, there's literally an indoor roller skating park 10 mins away from campus!!! \n\nOne time, I happened to hear them talking about how somebody had been taking their laundry out from the washing machine into the dryer, and that they didn't appreciate it. Instantly I knew it was me. That's because they leave washed clothes in the washer for hours. Not only does it encourage mold, THAT'S THE ONLY WASHING MACHINE ON THIS FLOOR!! How entitled does one have to be to not appreciate others practically finishing your laundry for you!?? I technically could throw the wet laundry on the nearby table if I knew it was theirs.\n\nThey walk around the common halls barefooted. I saw one leaving the dorm building without shoes on either. Hope they get parasites and warts.\n\nThe school is smoke-free. Never have I gone one semester smelling weed so often through the air vent. It'd be at least once a week and the RAs haven't been doing much about it. If it keeps up, I'll be making sure the RD and the student development vice president knows about this.",

Good for you to have realized what they're doing and distancing yourself. My best friend (whom I'd been roommates with for 3 years) was once friends with a nursing student who used her to do her homework. She'd make my friend \"help\" her with her homework and spontaneously \"visit\" her at 8pm on a weekday. She didn't listen when I told her she's being used, but realized it 1 year later when the nursing student switched to mass communications and tried to have her do her homework as well (we're both STEM majors). Cut ties with her and she never bothered my friend again.\n\nSome people should just grow up before going to college. They think it's no big deal with their parents forking the bill.",
