  "text": "guys i am at my wit\u2019s END! i\u2019m a freshman living in a dorm, and i\u2019m sick and tired of my roommate. she doesn\u2019t help clean, and she isn\u2019t respectful to my sleep schedule and will continue to use the entire room light instead of a desk lamp when she stays up for homework (every night). i\u2019ve been able to try to ignore that, but the last three weeks, something has been happening that is going way too far and idk what to do.\n\nevery. single. night. like clockwork, i wake up at 1 am and can\u2019t fall back asleep because my roommate masturbates VERY loud. she moans, talks to herself, and the act itself is very noisy and uncomfortable. to make it worse, i have misophonia (sound disorder where specific sounds make me incredibly upset), and the wet noises that happen when she gets off trigger my misophonia.\n\ni can\u2019t wear headphones because i have un-healed piercings that are too close to my ear canal, and i don\u2019t know how to tell her to stop. i try making it very clear that i\u2019m awake (i\u2019ve even walked out multiple times for half an hour, only to come back to her still doing it).\n\nwhat do i do?? please, please help\n\nEDIT: talked to her yesterday morning and last night was a lot better!",

      "text": "Wtf? How can people be so unaware of themselves? Is she not even embarrassed...Anyways you definitely have to tell her all these things are bothering you and set some boundaries.\n\n- For the light thing you can get a sleeping mask btw that helped me a whole lot when I had a roommate. But set a lights out time or desk lamp only time with her. \n\n- For the cleaning thing try not to use language that is blaming her of the issue. Offer to help her clean as well. Maybe make a to do type of checklist to make sure it's clean. \n\n- And for the mastubation thing... She might be embarrassed because I'm assuming she thinks you didn't hear her all those nights, so take that into account when approaching her. Just ask her to please do that when you're not in the room. Have a knock first system in place so you don't walk in on her.\n\n- While the topic is being discussed also ask her if you do anything that bothers her. She will feel like you're not accusing her. \n\nIf the communication isn't working yeah you should tell the RA and make a report because that's ridiculous.",

If you really can\u2019t bring yourself to tell her directly you can always consult your RA. Part of their job is to help mediate situations like this. If your roommate is unreceptive to talking or continues to disregard your needs after you discuss it with her, that may be a case where it\u2019s time to request to be moved to a new room, because nobody wants to live with someone like that.\n\nBest of luck, that\u2019s a wild first impression of college life.",
