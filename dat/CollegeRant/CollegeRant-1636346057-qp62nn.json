  "text": "Some details, I'm in an online math class that has the weirdest set up. We take a test with the respondus lockdown browser AND webcam. Whatever, no biggie. Except that they want us to write and work out our answers on paper instead of selecting them on Canvas, and then submit a pdf scan of our work. Doing this makes my face go almost completely out of frame when I'm writing and working on problems. I'm a little nervous this will flag me and I'll get accused of cheating. You can still see the back of my head/part of my eye but that's it. Anyone have exp with this?",
