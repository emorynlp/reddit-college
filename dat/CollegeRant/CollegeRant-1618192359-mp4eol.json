  "text": "If you are someone that does this...how??? How do people just let others do all the work? Ignore attempts at communication? What goes through their mind? Maybe they\u2019re busy but everyone is. Maybe they see someone taking the lead and doing the work and think ehh they\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nI genuinely wish to know. I\u2019m always worried I\u2019m not contributing enough and so I make sure to do my part and usually more than I even need to. So I have no idea how some ppl can just do absolutely nothing or the bare minimum while others have to cover their slack on top of their own strenuous work load.\n\nAh..why can\u2019t I just work on things by myself. People always say you have to work with others in the workplace but I feel like at that point most people would at least put in a bit of effort for the sake of their job. Some ppl just don\u2019t care about school but it hurts the rest of the group and the people that do. I hate it, I\u2019m so stressed",

Our presentation was done first at the middle of the sem and the paper was due a couple weeks ago. We all had our sections assigned and I finished my part. 2 never showed up to our meetings or contributed to the paper. I had to edit their sections and write the intro and conclusion while the presenters just criticized the whole paper. I didn't mind criticism, but some were ridiculous like just a spelling error. I or someone probably didn't notice some spelling errors that anyone could correct if we didn't notice it. They could have fixed the minor mistakes and made more points regarding what was unclear. I kept opening the document the days before the paper was due and it was just criticism after criticism and I felt angry cause 2 were unreachable and the other kept saying she was going to help but only ended up focusing on her part. So glad I'm done with that.",

But they don\u2019t. So then I have no choice. \n\nSometimes there have been situations where I didn\u2019t know the content in the project so communicated with the leader and asked for help, I got it done with help and learned about the topic. \n\nI\u2019ve never not communicated with team even if I didn\u2019t know what to do at all. \n\nThese people who choose to opt out are usually the good looking well-to-do folks who don\u2019t really need school to be financially secure in the future, they just see it as a source of fun.

If this was a normal year where we have in person class then maybe things would\u2019ve been different but me personally I didn\u2019t like the approach they took. First of all there was 5 of us so working on it on zoom together was pointless. Why would I put in effort when there\u2019s 4 other people who are there too. There was 5 questions all together and 5 of us so all we had to do was do one question each. Had we approached it this way I would of made sure to do my one question to the best of my ability. But meeting on zoom after a long day to do work we should have just split up just seemed like a waste of time. So I\u2019d go to meetings but kinda just sit there, I\u2019d contribute every now and then but almost 0 real effort.",

They figure people who do the work care enough to \u201cmanage the slackers \u201c and get them to perform. It\u2019s an exercise in getting group members to hold each other accountable\u2014it is always a disaster since slackers ignore anyone trying to get them to be productive and count on the fact that many students will not hold them accountable and just do all the work on their own\u2014no matter how stressful! \n\nNot ME. If you happen to be in my group, I directly ask who wants to do what? We divide up the work then look at due dates and make deadlines\u2014I ask everyone to speak up or get stuck with shit they don\u2019t want to do. I also say that Everyone has tons of shit to do, so do it by group deadline BEFORE due date. \n\nWe all exchange info and if anyone needs clarity send a text, message or email to group members. No micro managing\u2014BUT if that shit is not in by deadline be prepared because I will not hesitate to make it crystal clear WHO the half-ass was that did not perform, to the professor AND the rest of the group by project end. It will be outlined in detail on individual member evaluations and turned in. Barring an egregious emergency or death\u2014shit should be turned in by Deadline\u2014proof read, edited, succinct and follow all rubric specs.\n\nI\u2019ve literally asked one half ass that ignored work in my group In front of the entire class to explain to our classmates a certain section of the presentation, to his complete and utter a shock and silence, he literally walked out of the classroom!
