  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nKeeping this fairly short. I decided to go to college for business and I enrolled in a small university (about 1000 students). While I went to college, I got a part time job at a grocery store to get myself some money to keep up with expenses. I did great at the job and I mostly kept up with my studies.\n\nLast week, I graduated since I completed my internship requirement at the previously mentioned place. I also accepted a full time position from them since I thought it would buy me time to figure something out (I also applied to internships like crazy this summer, had about 9 interviews but no offers, which made this grocery thing a last resort to finish my degree).\n\nNow I feel like I'm stuck and with a degree that I'm pretty sure is mostly useless (asides from my minor in accounting, I'm pretty sure business is a shit major). I guess my question is what now?\n\nI've thought about enrolling in a much bigger school and taking on a major like engineering, computer science, or any other STEM field that will earn some respect and guarantee a decent income. I have no background in either of those fields but science and math were subjects I liked back in high school. I also like art, but I was thinking about making that more of a side thing. Is there any recommended path I take?",

      "text": "Degrees are only useful if you can make them useful. In today\u2019s day and age, a degree will not guarantee a decent income, let alone a job. A business degree is a very good, versatile degree. The only problem is, you need to get your foot in the door. You may have to relocate just to find something. I work with the federal government and can tell you that degrees are just a check in the box, once you start finding relevant work experience you will easily move up and hop around companies until you find that high paying job. \n\nThe biggest misconception about college is that high paying jobs will fall out of the sky once you get a particular degree.",

I am willing to relocate but I\u2019m afraid of giving up that full time grocery position I have because these people seem kind of invested in me (and there\u2019s the money I put away from being at home and not having many bills). I\u2019m also afraid of quitting because if I don\u2019t get any offers, then I\u2019m SOL and have no stream of income to pay my bills and would need to eat into my savings.",
