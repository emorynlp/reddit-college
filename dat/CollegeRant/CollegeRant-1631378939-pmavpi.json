  "text": "I\u2019m taking a gap semester this year but my boyfriends already in college and he\u2019s become someone i can\u2019t recognize just in a few weeks. \n\nWe used to hang out together all the time, of course the distance stopped us from that, but the way he was with me- isn\u2019t how he is anymore. \n\nFor one- hes partying like there is no tomorrow. Hes blacking out every weekend, smoking, taking drugs, and whatnot. This was out of his character- he never drank outside family functions and hasn\u2019t smoked for over a year or done drugs for a long time. But this all change the second the first weekend at college hit. \n\nHe used to have only a few friends but they were right, trustable guys who were also doing good in school, had girlfriends, and were just much more mature. \n\nThe new friends he made in college are equally wild party animals. He\u2019s hanging around a lot of girls all of a sudden (which makes me uncomfortable knowing these girls he described them as \u201cparty whores\u201d and would only wear very skimpy clothes around him). His new guy friends smoke and drink and gave him a lot of edibles. \n\nOf course i don\u2019t want to say anything because I don\u2019t want to seem overly controlling. \n\nHe was such a smart, bright student. Now he\u2019s talking about how he\u2019s already late on assignments. He\u2019s always hanging out with people, never studying, I miss the bright student he used to be. \n\nI just feel like I don\u2019t know him anymore. Like we\u2019re suddenly in two separate worlds.",

      "text": "I would def leave too but you got to see if you can fix him lol. I'm a dude and after classes became in person again I don't recognize myself anymore either. I hate the fact that I got exposed to a WAY more efficient and time saving way of learning just to go back to the centuries old shit way of learning. People keep saying it's so that kids can get social with others and shit... I'm in college dude I don't give a f\\*\\*\\* about that shit anymore. He's probably just trying to get as much fun before lockdown comes back or something. But from the way you describe it, seems like he's overdoing it. Just talk to him and if he says that your too controlling just fuckin leave lol. A man should be able to tell caring from controlling... But def tell him how you feel.",

      "text": "People change, but also some people don\u2019t know how to initially handle the freedom that comes with college. Many people go overboard on partying at first, regret it and then change that characteristic of themselves. Other people just change and that\u2019s the person they want to be, which is okay too.",

      "text": "Damn I would just leave the relationship honestly. If my boyfriend is talking about party whores and blacking out every night I wouldn't wanna be with someone like that. But that's just me... \n\nYou should talk to him about it and if he wants to continue being reckless it's up to you if you want to be with someone like that. If you feel you're not in love with this new person he's become you shouldn't settle and go through that stress. Figure out what you want in a boyfriend and if he doesn't match that it's your decision to stay or not.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear that you\u2019re having a rough time with this. It\u2019s definitely normal for brand new freshmen to act this way. Of course, it can\u2019t go on forever. He\u2019ll learn one way or another that this kind of behavior isn\u2019t sustainable over the long term; whether he will have to fail all his classes, end up on suspension, get alcohol poisoning, etc. first is anyone\u2019s guess. Whether you\u2019re willing to wait for him to learn that lesson or not is up to you. Sounds like he just went wild with his first taste of actual adult freedom. Some people take longer than others to burn through that stage.\n\nGood luck with everything.",
