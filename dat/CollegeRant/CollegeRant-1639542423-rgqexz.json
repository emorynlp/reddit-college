  "text": "I have As in my math and bio courses, and I fucking hate that the grades I spent all semester working on and maintaining could vanish into thin air all over one test. So no one who looks at my transcript will know that I did well all semester and only have a shit grade over a single test.\n\nAnyways, I have finals for them both on Thursday back to back and have to score a 98% in math and a 95% in bio to prevent my grades from dropping. Wish me luck",

Therefore I just need a 70 on the final. But I have 3% extra credit on my overall grade which bumps it down to 55%. (And the final is curved)",

But personally, if you did well on all the other exams, you know the material so taking the final (especially if it's cumulative) would be redundant if not impractical.",
