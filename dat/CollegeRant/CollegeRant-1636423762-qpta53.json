  "text": "Almost done with my first semester of freshman year. It's been good, but I can't help but feel like my social life has taken a dive lately. I have a lot of acquaintances and people I talk to in my classes, but I have 3 main friends. Lately, it seems that my 3 friends have been super busy with work and school and other situations, and I've been eating meals by myself a lot. They all live a lot closer to the school than I do, and they usually all disappear and go home on weekends. Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying school but I always imagined myself having a ton of friends during college but it seems like I spend the majority of my time by myself.",

      "text": "For me it\u2019s partly because of Covid. I thought when I came back it was gonna be like leaving a prison but I just feel like I\u2019m stuck at prison only this time I get to go to school. Everything closes early, until a week ago, I got night terrors, and I never get to see any of my friends. I could barely see my boyfriend because of the lockdowns and I can\u2019t have him in my dorm because my school has a no visitor policy.",
