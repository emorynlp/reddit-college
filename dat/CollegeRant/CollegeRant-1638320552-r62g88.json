  "text": "I'm CompSci and a sophomore finishing out my third semester in college. It was easily my worst performed and most miserable and along with a lot of other contributing factors, the first semester where I was truly out of gen eds and in full swing in the main course work\n\nAnd college is obviously no joke no matter which specific school you end up in, but engineering is especially torturous. Lots of complex subjects taught by professors who make things even more complicated and if you're lucky, you get a section taught by a Prof who doesn't mind curving everything into oblivion so even if you learn absolutely nothing, you'll still not fail\n\nI've spent more time googling how to scrape by things on my own then actually learning in the classroom and most lectures have mandatory attendance so you'll fail if you miss more than a few things without something from the short list of valid explanations (with proof!)\n\nI mostly chose this field because of all the promises of job security and high wages straight from graduating with a bachelor's, but honestly, I'm not sure if it's worth it in exchange for this constant strain I've had my mental health\n\nThese classes haven't failed to make me feel the stupidest I've felt in a long time and the thought of continuing down this path for 2-3 more years than the rest of my life feels me with so much dread on top the anxiety and clinical depression I already deal with. It genuinely feels like if I stay here, it will almost guarantee my chances of ending up in psych ward. Maybe not this semester or even next semester, but definitely at some point.\n\nI'm thinking about changing it to something else in a different field but it just stuff just won't pay decently without having to spend more time in college then grad school which definitely wouldn't be cheap\n\nI'm going to talk to someone at career services before the end of this week so I'll have time to adjust my schedule if I do manage to narrow down what I want, but I'm honestly just feeling so lost because of all this. I know it's still fairly early on and it's better to realize in Fall as a sophomore than a junior, or God forbid, spring as a senior but it still really sucks",

      "text": "Trust me, I get it. It\u2019s not fun to fail classes you are trying really hard in. The material is overwhelming. As someone who switched their major from electrical engineering to something easier, I regret it. Once you graduate and try to find a job and quickly realize that there are few jobs out there that pay well, and if there are, you\u2019re probably not going to get them due to lack of experience or not having the technical degree. \n\nBefore switching majors, do this if you can: slow down. I\u2019ve met below average students who graduated with an engineering degree or comp sci and it took them all well over 5 years to graduate. So instead of thinking about switching majors, think about if you\u2019d rather get an easier degree in a short time with little job prospects or a worthwhile degree that pays well but might take you an extra year (or two)? As someone who is in a crappy job right now, take the latter.\n\nSlow down if you can. Depending on tuition, living situation, scholarships, etc. take a smaller course load. Go half time and try and work part time at a tech start up or business, or do an internship. Also make friends in your classes. Consider them your buddies in war. You\u2019re going to go through the trenches together. It helps to vent, rant, and learn with others who are in the same situation as you. If you need any other advice, send me a DM.",

The main thing is differentiation rules and limits and that also includes a lot of stuff with trig identities and the unit circle\n\nCalc2 on the other hand is mostly intergals and...a lot of other stuff. And God help you if you go to a school where they put CompSci in the same program as engineering because you're going to get stuck doing Physics (first class I ever had to drop) or even Chemistry (no you'll never need it unless you're doing some really niche CompSci/Bio hybrid)",

      "text": "don\u2019t pick a major bc of the money unless you absolutely like it. all the work won\u2019t be worth it unless the reason why you pick it is cause you like it. there\u2019s so many careers out there that young students don\u2019t know about because they don\u2019t get talked about as much. glad you\u2019ll be going to the career center! as you\u2019re considering majors, think more about what career(s) do you see yourself realistically pursuing and find a major that best aligns with it. you don\u2019t HAVE to do this cause your major doesn\u2019t always equal career but it can be helpful. also getting work experience while in college will help you A LOT in finding a job after you graduate. a lot of employers want experience, having a high gpa isn\u2019t as impressive if you don\u2019t have work experience (obvi this may not be applicable for certain fields).",

                  "text": "Compsci is not that different motivation wise from library sciences or education IMO. It's really hard to stay in the full degree program if you're just there for a paycheck in any of those cases, which is what OP is doing it seems. STEM, like education is a lot of work, with a potentially very delayed monetary payoff, and if the money is the only reason you're there, you likely won't get through it all",

They were mainly interested in CompSci because of the money, seemingly not the concepts and actual work itself. People don't have to go through this stress to get by when it isn't working out for them. For instance, if someone is really bad at math ever since they started elementary school, why would they be majoring in math when it's clearly not working out for them just because businesses will hire them? People don't have to pull teeth at something that they don't want to.",
