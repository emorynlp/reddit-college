You won\u2019t even make it to that point however if you can\u2019t pass....\n\nThis is why I was forced to drop my chemistry II class this semester. The professor believed it was the students fault the highest grade received on exams was around a B with the class average more around a 40?! In a fake attempt to help us he asked what we would want to change in future exams and I simply requested a REVIEW, his response was a chuckle like I was mental for asking and he said we are given the chapters covered and that should be enough...it is CHEMISTRY! The book is just simple definitions, his class lectures? Just elementary examples of reactions. Test? Nothing recognizable from the 40 plus hours of tedious homework going over the same reactions or pointless lectures. Considering letting department head know. I\u2019m an A student in all my other classes. \n\nBasically I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not just you. Professors that were always difficult or just plain dickholes are now allowed to do so without accountability thanks to online learning.",

However, there's the pressure of due dates, finals, losing financial aid, academic suspension/expulsion, not getting disowned by your parents, etc. If expulsion occurs, then you probably end up thousands in debt with little to no means of paying it back unless you're from a rich family or something. None of this shit happens for fucking piano or ballerina lessons. \n\nWith all this shit hanging above your head, how the fuck is anyone supposed to prioritize understanding a topic thoroughly? We are given time limits to learn shit too and not everybody learns at the same pace. Colleges are FUCKING TRASH at taking this into account.\n\nSo it's absolutely no surprise we have people resorting to cheating, paying for people to take classes for them, and getting pissed off when professors don't directly address quizzes or tests. Because their life is on the line somehow and people in survival mode DO NOT give af about ethics, merit and all that pretty shit.",

Also, all of us are hiding behind screens and don\u2019t know anything about each other. With this in mind, there isn\u2019t a way for anybody on Reddit, unless a user personally knows you in reality, to know what country you live in.  \n\nAlso, like a lot of people will, or already did, say, college is difficult. \n\nYes, this subreddit is called college rant, but all of us have our own difficulties in college. Suck it up because there\u2019s nothing you can do about it unless you decide to drop out.",
