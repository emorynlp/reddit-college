  "text": "\nThe past 3 years at College I\u2019ve been starting strong at the semester start, but fizzle out regarding assignment slabs have ending up failing all my classes consistently. Is there recourse from this? Am I stuck? I\u2019ve just been feeling depressed and ashamed thinking about all the loans and external funds that have been donated or taken out in my name. Just wanted to rant I guess",

Jotting down everything that needs to be done throughout the day?\nFor the previous fall semester I would use the stickies app on my computer and just jot down everything I have due for the week and then another note for everything I have to do that day. It helped my manage my time but also remember the homework for future tests and the final. Sorry to here about your mental state and your outside struggles :( me too man it definitely gets harder every week into the semester",

      "text": "This may sound silly; but does your school break classes in different lengths of time at all? I've found something that's helped me make it through a 18 credit semester this past fall is switching to shorter length courses for the majority of my courses because I did really well on those during this past summer. If you can handle the academic speed and possibly pressure, it helped \"reset\" my brain by starting on two new courses mid-way through the semester. I ended up dragging the past week but compared to last spring, I did much better than having taken multiple courses on a longer schedule and having taken ruthless advantage of my drawing teacher's \"just turn whatever you have in\".",
