  "title:": "Rant about my college experience so far",
  "text": "So I\u2019m currently a Junior at a large public university and my experience here as honestly been meh. I have had a lot of fun nights but the thing that\u2019s made me feel down is that my friends only want to hangout whenever there\u2019s drinking or smoking involved. I partake in the parties and such but I like to just chill and hangout with people sober as well. I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve tried planning a day trip for the weekend or finding some fun activities to do (like concerts a few hours away) and my friends don\u2019t want to go because they just want to lay around and get drunk. Sometimes I even take a weekend off and stay to myself just because I don\u2019t want to be around that scene and I feel as if some of them look down on me for that.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to people that\u2019s graduated and they said college was some of their best years and honestly some of my favorite memories have been from college but I wouldn\u2019t label it as my best years so far.\n\nRant is done. Anyone else every feel like this?",
