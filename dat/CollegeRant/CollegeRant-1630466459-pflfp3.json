  "text": "how do you encourage yourself to get through it all? how do you not become emotionally dependent on others to feel motivated/encouraged to get through school? these are the hardest classes i\u2019m taking yet and i have to do so much reading and watching in order to synthesize information for writing assignments. i don\u2019t want to drop a class yet (that\u2019s my last resort) but i\u2019m already having such a hard time managing my stress and staying motivated. it\u2019s been affecting my life and work and i\u2019ve already fallen behind when it comes to my self-imposed deadlines. i want to be able to deal with this before i\u2019m at a point in the semester where i\u2019m overloaded with work that i have to do. i need help",

      "text": "College is overwhelming, I learned recently that professors expect you to study 3 hours for every hour of class. I\u2019ve taken this info to calculate how many hours I need to study on certain days. 5.5 hours from M-Th, and 7.5 hours from F-Su. It\u2019s a lot of work but once I know those hours I know when to stop studying for the day to not get too tired. In other words, time management is a skill and you should practice it. It\u2019s not the most exciting thing but a schedule can work wonders.",
