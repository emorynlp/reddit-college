My mental health has suffered enormously from the get go. I only stayed for my parents and so I wouldn\u2019t get judged by the rest of my family. I\u2019m just\u2026so tired and burnt out. I don\u2019t even enjoy my major anymore because of how things have gone. I know for a fact I\u2019d be so much better off had I chosen a different path than the one my parents chose for me.",
