  "text": "Hey guys, its my first time here and tbh i don\u2019t have an idea how to use this app. So yeah I\u2019m here because I wanted to share my thoughts. It makes me sad knowing that life is unfair, i am studying right now for our final exam and I saw on social media that a lot of students showing their grades (high grades) then it makes me feel sad knowing that i don\u2019t have enough sleep still i\u2019m having a hard time getting that high grades. And u know i just realized that their course was different from mine. Its like i chose this course even if i know that it is difficult. Then i started crying, thinking of \u201cwhat if i didn\u2019t chose this course? Maybe i am one of them that have time to gala or libot something\u201d. I need advice\u2026.",

I'd recommend to go over your course syllabus and see what the passing grade for the course is and the exams passing grades than focus on that passing number and don't pay attention to how high you can score but if you can pass with even the lowest minimal passing.",
