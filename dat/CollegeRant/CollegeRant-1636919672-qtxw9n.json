  "text": "I\u2019m so tired of these classes that have these shitty discussion boards to replace in-class discussion. NO ONE says anything thoughtful. It is all low-effort (not that I blame them) but it is so hard to reply \u201cthoughtfully\u201d when someone creates a discussion board and it regurgitates stuff from the lesson but the writer doesn\u2019t know the topic. Or in the case of tech, vague use of words that sounds like buzz wording. Like someone can say \u201cyeah use encryption on the connection\u201d but they won\u2019t complete the thought out to say *how* they would do that. F/E: \u201cuse a VPN\u201d or \u201cmake sure the website always uses HTTPS.\u201d So many people regurgitate terms but don\u2019t use them correctly too. \n\nI get not everyone cares about the class but damn. It\u2019s so hard to reply. I\u2019ve had the professor rip into me for generically replying back to someone who had a generic statement and expected ME to specify. What.",

      "text": "Ugh yessssss. Y\u2019all currently in school have it ROUGH with the weird not quite back to normal but not really online mode going on! I did an online masters starting in 2015 but my last semester was spring 2020 (I was working full time and just wanted to take my time with it) so I got a little of the Covid stuff too. And the FUCKING DISCUSSION BOARDS OMFG! I really wish discussion birds could be like informal \u201creddiquette\u201d style. Like if you need to cite a source, just [hyperlink](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) it. And emoticons can display mood or tone :-/\nIt\u2019s so annoying to have to be formal on a platform that just isn\u2019t meant to be that way! Ughhhhh.",
