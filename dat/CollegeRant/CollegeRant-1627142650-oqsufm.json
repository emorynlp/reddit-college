  "text": "This summer I took Liberal arts math 1&2 along with general biology to finish my A.A. I am doing well in my classes and should end with two B's and an A. This is literally the final week classes end Aug.2 but I just wanna close the laptop and not think about it anymore. I have so many fun plans coming up and staying motivated is hard.",

I missed two assignments because I work full time too. I'm so done too I feel you especially since I won't be getting an A I feel less determined.",

I got my first D last semester and i felt my soul leave my body but it's allllll good lol at least i am making up the lost credit. I took college algebra \ud83e\udd74 but then took a step down and decided to just stick with liberal arts to get the credit out the way.",

              "text": "Thank you so much! Same goes to you! It will all be worth it in the end. Im studying to teach high school biology. What are you wanting to do after school? College algebra is hard to a lot if they didn't have a good math teacher in high school. I was blessed with amazing math teachers. I definitely won't let this C hurt me. If I continue on my path that C won't do anything to my GPA!",

Since i regularly get A's and B.\n\nThat's so cute i am also going to be a teacher!! I want to teacher elementary school kids though haha i just think they're so cute and i have the patience and energy for them. I'm not sure what subjects or even grade i want to work with.\n\nI agree though college algebra was way harder than I anticipated which was my fault in a way. I took intermediate algebra and got an A so i totally thought that i would pass college algebra but nope lol. The professor put in all our grades at the end and i saw my grade flop but it wasn't a required class i just thought I didn't have any other options but college algebra until i asked around for \"easy math classes\" and liberal arts math ended up being fun and way less stressful.\n\nI love that you're becoming a biology teacher. You have to be patience you'll get a lot of freshmen but i do like biology my last unit rn is on biodiversity!! Then final exam and I'm done!!",

                      "text": "Thanks! How cool that we both want to be teachers! My advisor wants me to volunteer to teacher assist in different grades so I'm sure that I want to do high school before I start my teaching credits. Luckily my future mother in law and sister in law are teachers in lower grades so I can sit in on there classes possibly soon.\n\n I just know I can make or break a freshmans semester and possibly inspire them to continue focusing on sciences in high school while it's still free ya know? If I had a good biology teacher in high school I would have know im destined for the sciences early on before I \"wasted\" $20k on an associate of arts and may be in a different position now. However, I am thankful for where I still ended up, but the fact still stands. \n\nYou should try volunteering in your \"free time\" to see the grades you may like more. I say that in quotes because our time is never really free its just deciding not to do the mounds of homework during that time hahahaha. Or possibly applying for substituting after you get your associates depending on your state.",

                          "text": "That's so funny u say that because I'm getting ready my resume to be a paraprofessional!! So i get to experience different grade levels but with pay. In my state it's 48college credits and a highschool diploma to be a paraprofessional. Thankfully i am already there and i want to start in the fall. I will also be applying to my Elementary education bachelor's program in the fall while i finish my last 12 credits and i am \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35.\n\nIn my college they technically just changed the rules and we no longer need to pass a specific state test to apply for the bachelor's program. However i passed 2/4 units on the test and would like to pass them before December so i could least have that as an extra push for them to accept me.\n\nI'm happy that you're in the position you want to be in. I heard most people don't really know what they want to do in college for the first two years anyways so don't beat yourself up! It's very refreshing and nice to see someone excited to impact students lives.\n\nI originally wanted to work as a child therapist/social worker but after talking to advisors and stuff i am way to sensitive for the part and would probably fall apart my first case lol so teacher was second best and i always loved academia and the school environment.\n\nYou're right amazing teachers do make /break students because thinking of all the amazing teachers i had reassures me whenever i get nervous about spending so much time/effort/money pursuing this career.",
