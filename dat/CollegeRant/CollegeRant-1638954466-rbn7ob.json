  "title:": "Final exam in 5 hours",
  "text": "I am a senior in college and my last important final exam is in 5 hours. Computer Network Architecture. Fucking brutal class, hundreds of slides of straight memorization and having to simulate for example the minutae of TCP congestion control on paper and know the format of all the headers and protocols up and down the network stack. Closed notes. 3 hours. Haven't slept in 21 hours and just finished a 7 page paper for my French class (in French, only allowed to use French sources).\n\n\nTldr: I'm miserable and tired and I want a beer\n\n\n/rant",
