  "title:": "I got a opportunity to get my college 100% paid for but because my mom refuses to give me her information for FAFSA I won\u2019t be eligible for this opportunity",
  "text": "Just found out that my job, as an inhome caregiver, it\u2019s part of a union. And the union will pay 100% tuition costs up to a bachelors program with the college they are partnered with. It\u2019s based in Ohio, and it\u2019s completely online. They have the programs I need to get my degree. I\u2019m like HOLY FUCK SHIT FREE COLLEGE OMG FUCKING HELL JUST SAVED MYSELF $40000 !! In Oregon you need a BA in social work, psychology, or Human Resources before you go into a masters program for mental health counseling. I could transfer to a Oregon masters program once I\u2019m done with my Bachelors. Anyways good news, amazing right, freaking the fuck out. This is an amazing opportunity for free education. Here\u2019s the kick tho, you have to have your parents information for FAFSA and get federal aid so they can pay the rest of tuition for what federal aid didn\u2019t cover. when you apply for FAFSA, you know how you need your parents information if you\u2019re under 24? Well my dad is dead so I can\u2019t use his information, and my mom refuses to give me her info for FAFSA. So I have to go through all this shit with her she wants to speak to someone from the college and blah blah blah, I\u2019m just fucking done. Like thanks mom. Seriously. Thanks. If she doesn\u2019t provide her information I literally won\u2019t be able to get free tuition. At this point I\u2019m just gonna get married to my fianc\u00e9. Which is a fucked reason to get married, but I will have to talk to him. I would sign a prenup and everything. But seriously this shouldn\u2019t be a problem, this is an amazing opportunity and my mom is such a dumbass cause she thinks they will take her money away if she provides her info. It\u2019s not fair that I feel like I\u2019m marrying for a college education and not the right reasons for getting married. This is a big deal, we\u2019re talking $40,000-$50,000 of debt from my bachelors. That\u2019s not including the extra $40,000 for a masters program I want to do to be a mental health therapist. This is not fair. I\u2019m so angry.\n\nUpdate: talked to fianc\u00e9, we both agreed it\u2019s the wrong reason to get married and that we aren\u2019t ready. we want to wait at least another year, so that option is off the table. the most i can do is try to appeal, but that\u2019s all i can really do or wait til I\u2019m 24. Who knows I might pop out a kid.",

Even if it means jumping through a bunch of hoops that seem unreasonable, it would be worth it for $40,000. On the other side, would your relationship with your fiance change if you married him, especially for this reason, and would that be worth it?",

      "text": "u/hillsorvalleys I hope you read my comment. I made the same mistake when I was your age! It was always my dream to go to college for social work, but I came from an incredibly broken home where both parents refused to give me any information for my FASFA. I said I would wait until I was 24, but I got incredibly side tracked. BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWS! \n\nLook at your Universities financial aid website. There's something called an \"income adjustment appeal form.\" You'll have to get that form filled out, submit a copy of your fathers death certificate, and write a letter stating your current relationship with your mother and how she refuses to give you her information. You submit it to the financial aid department and they can waive the parental requirement. 99% of the time they will accept it because its usually a student worker that looks at the appeal forms and they just honestly don't care. The Financial aid office will then reach out to FASFA on your behalf to allow you to get aid. \n\nIf they deny your application, which they probably won't, DO NOT ACCEPT NO FOR AN ANSWER. Go in person to the office and ask to speak to the head of the department. Make them look you in the eye and say no. They won't. If that doesn't work, then reach out to the department chair of your major and ask for help. If you're doing social work, I can promise you they'll say yes; we're notorious for helping others. (I was rejected from my goal University and reached out to the social work department chair from my backup school. It took her one email for me to be accepted. It'll work, I promise). \n\nIf you have questions, PM me and I can look up your Uni and walk you through what they want. \n\nDont give up!",

      "text": "Hey OP. I just want to preface my response. I only say this as if you were my sister asking her (hypothetical) older brother for advice. So please take it with a grain of salt.\n\nWhile you are young and childless, you will have the mental dexterity and energy to work towards your degree/career trajectory. You\u2019ll also have the stamina to do things on the side (if you enjoy a hobby like hiking/arts and crafts/volunteering etc\u2026). In completing your degree you are statistically more likely to find a well paying job. So it might be worth it to have a sit down with your mom and diplomatically explain your plans if she helps out. \n\nHaving a child can take up a lot of time and it can make keeping up with school commitments difficult. That is not to say that there aren\u2019t women out there that have kids, attend school, and reach their goals. I\u2019m more than certain there are women out there who probably made it though graduate level studies while child rearing. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s your choice to make and nobody can tell you that you are right or wrong on this matter.",

You can only use you\u2019re own information if your over 24, married, have a kid, were in the military, parents died, or you were homeless or in foster care when you were younger. The government set it up that way so parents would help pay for college, the less money they have the more money you get for free from the government. They didn\u2019t set it up where you could file to be independent automatically because you obviously are fresh outta high school with a shitty job and they know you don\u2019t make that much, so they set this in place so they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for college for students. It\u2019s a fucked up system. The only way I can file to be independent is if I appeal to be independent but majority of the time they deny them if your parents refuse to provide information.",

So in 2008 they voted that all unmarried students under the age of 24 must submit at least one parent's social security information when applying to verify the student's \"expected\" familial contribution. Which we all know is absurd and most people can't afford it.",

You're not required to give your parents information for FAFSA if you can get independent student status. Both my parents are deadbeats and I was able to be classed as an independent student. So I don't have to supply my parent's information and basically get max pell and state grant dependent on my income. Your dad being passed away may be enough for your school's financial aid office to classify you as an independent student. **FYI** you don't have to live on your own to count as an independent student. I'm 22 and I live with my grandparents.",
