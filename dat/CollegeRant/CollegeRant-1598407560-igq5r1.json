  "text": "I get that there are students who put zero effort in their studies and try to blame the professor for their own shortcomings, but I think these students are a minority. Most students actually want to try their best but get professors that just do the bare minimum in their teaching (eg. reading off from the slides, never making sure that their handwriting is readable, rarely replying to student emails). And I hate it when they say that students should go study in the library themselves if they're struggling so much. What are we paying them for then?",

(Thats fine but it was the first quiz and I had no idea what to expect from his quizes/exams) then after 10 minutes he picked them all up, Very quickly went over the quiz skipping half the questions. Then said That that should have only taken 3 minutes then the following class put us down (and continues to every class since) about how no one did well on that quiz and how we need to study harder.",

There was one question that pretty much everyone missed, caused as far as everyone who I asked after and myself knew, she did not teach the material that question went over. So naturally, she just worked out the question on the projector, told us how easy it was to do, and moved on. That was the only chemistry class I took. That leads to another similar pet peeve of mine with professors, when they talk about how \u2018easy\u2019 the content is, failing to realize that they\u2019ve got a 15-30+ year head start on us, hold a PHD in the subject, and are constantly immersed in it 24/7.",

None of us finished the test in 1 class period, and when we asked the sub if we could finish it after school she said we had to wait for our teacher to come back. I went in early and got yelled at by the teacher for the class not finishing. Got enough kids complaining that she yelled at us in her class for not \"studying enough\" and being lazy and then told us we had to come in after school and finish the test and then get yelled at again because we got low scores because we didn't know what we were doing.",

Most of you have no idea how to learn on your own even as adults.\n\nAsk a Chinese, Russian or Indian student at what grade they were expected to learn the material on their own. I guarantee you by middle school most of them were not relying on the teacher. I went to school in Mexico, for us it was 7th grade. The math teacher may demonstrate an easy problem, then he'd give us harder ones for homework and a super hard one for the exam. Our literature teacher would expect us to be prepared so she could cold call us to answer questions about the assigned readings. I moved to the US for high school. I didn't even speak English but everything was a review to me and we were treated like babies so I had straight As while barely trying. \n\nWhat are you paying for?
