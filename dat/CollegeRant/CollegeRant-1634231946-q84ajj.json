  "text": "So I'm a fourth year STEM major and I'm taking one of the most advanced courses in the dept but I absolutely cannot fucking stand how it's taught. It's totally flipped classroom, no lectures, the students are expected to get up in front of the board and present everything. It pisses me off to no end that I'm paying for this professor who clearly knows their shit, but they just sit in the back of the class every day barely saying anything. We don't even have a proper book, it's just some notes the prof wrote.\nThe idea is it's supposed to be all independent learning and grad school-ish but that just doesn't work when this is a class I need to graduate. I can't ever struggle with anything or take time to learn something in detail, you know, actually learn independently, because if I slow down for one second I fall behind and my grade gets marked down to shit.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck flipped classrooms",
