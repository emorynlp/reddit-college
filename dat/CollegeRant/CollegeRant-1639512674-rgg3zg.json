  "title:": "My Professor Gave Me A Fifty Percent Grade On My Essay Proposal. I\u2019m Going To Scream.",
  "text": "My Professor Basically Failed My Final Essay Proposal\n\nHello everyone, I hope your final days of class are going well during finals week. I wish I could say the same for myself, but as the title implies, I'm screwed. I will use this post as a rant to get my feelings in order before finishing my final, so pardon me. \n\nI KEEP FUCKING UP MY ESSAY\u2019S AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!\n\nEvery essay I write has barely passed the minimum requirement for this class. I'm trying to meet the standard that my professor is asking for. I'm honestly fucking trying, but it isn't enough. Either my thesis statements are not actual thesis statements because they aren't \u201cclaims,\u201d or I\u2019m not making any factual statements in my body paragraphs. \n\nWhen I make claims, they are either not delved into enough, or I haven't provided adequate evidence for the material. I've asked her what she wanted to see to get concrete examples, but even afterwards, I still fail. I'm fed up with this. \n\nI finally mustered up the courage to look at my Essay Proposal grade, and she barely passed me. Again. I'm so disheartened about my final. Failure is the only fucking end route for me at this point.",

      "text": "Okay, so im a seasoned essay writer and i\u2019m gonna try to help you out here with a quick summery of how to get a basic essay draft down. The final draft is about polishing the basic draft, so the draft is a good place to start. Since most college essays are argumentative essays im going to do that kind. \n\nIntro: (all in one small paragraph)\n1. Briefly restate the prompt/ question being asked in a expository way. Ex: if the question is \u201cwhy do female fans of Donald duck believe he is white, while male fans believe he is yellow? Which group do you think is right based on their argument?\u201d Your restatement will be \u201cwhen it comes to the color of Donald duck, female fans argue that he is white while male fans argue he is yellow.\u201d\n\n2. After this restatement you put the roadmap-thesis statement. Something like \u201cin this paper I will present and analyze the female fans argument that Donald duck is white and the male fans argument that he is yellow, then i will explain why i believe the female fans argument is correct, i will then offer a counter argument on behalf of the male fans, and defend my argument against their counter argument\u201d the roadmap is you stating what you plan for the paper, the thesis is what you are arguing for specifically in the paper (aka for the female fans white duck theory)\n\nThats all you need for a brief intro. \n\nExpository section: \n\n1. In a paragraph or two: \nObjectively state the facts of one side of the existing argument. Add relevant quotes facts and statistics and cite in text. Ex: \u201cwomen tend to believe donald duck is whitebecause____.\u201d \u201cAccording to mickeys study 90% of women believe Donald is white (mickey,pg2000).\u201d No opinions, no personal arguments, and no I- statements in this section!!!\n\n2. In the next paragraph or two:\nObjectively state the facts of the other side of the existing argument. Add relevant quotes facts and statistics and cite in text. Ex: \u201c men tend to believe donald duck is yellow because____.\u201d \u201cGoofy who is an expert on male psychology writes in his paper \u201cgoofy psychology\u201d that he thinks this is because men are goofy (goofy ,pg2000).\u201d No opinions, no personal arguments, and no I- statements in this section!!!\n\n3. In a paragraph: \nMake comparisons between the two arguments, point out inconsistencies and flaws. Analyze the arguments. Ex: \u201cwhile the female argument for donald being white is based off of stastical evidence, the male argument for him being yellow is based off a psychology book that is not even peer-reviewed\u201d or something similar. No personal opinions, just flaws here.\n\nAnalytic section:\n\n1. In the next two or three paragraphs:\nTime to choose a side and argue for it. In the first paragraph give reasons why the opposition is wrong. In the second and third give reasons why your side is right. Defend the argument factually and logically. Ex: pg1\u201dthe male argument for donald being yellow is dumb because____\u201d. Pg2&3: \u201cthe female argument for donald being white is good because___.\u201d This is where you get to show your stuff and make good, strong comparisons. Focus the most of your effort here rather than in the expository portion because this is what professors care about. \n\n2. In a paragraph: \nThink of a way the opposition would reply to your argument, then put it here. You want it to be strong so you Don\u2019t commit the straw man fallacy, but it cant be so strong it contradicts your argument. Ex: \u201cthe proponents of the male argument for donald being yellow may argue that the picture evidence of yellow donald is better proof for donalds color than the expert opinions from the female argument\u2026. But they are wrong.\u201d\n\n3.\nDefend your original claim against the counter argument. Ex: \u201cwhile the male argument for donald being yellow has pictures of yellow donald, it has been documented that those pictures were taken after donald rolled around in lemonade, thus they are not better proof than the expert opinions.\u201d \n\nConclusion:\n\n1. In a paragrapgh\nRestate thesis but not roadmap, restate both positions and argument, bereifly state counter and defense. Ex: \u201cthere is some debate in the male and female communities over whether donald duck is yellow or white, but I believe that the evidence and expert testemony the female argument provided proved that donald is white. While some evidence provided by the male side seems to prove the contrary at first, further research proves that the evidence is unsubstantial against the females arguments. Because of this I believe that donald duck is, in fact, white.\u201d \n\n2. Cite! Cite! Cite!\nCite everything, learn how to use footnotes. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nBeyond this, my recommendation to you is to spend more time drafting the outline of the essay before writing the first draft. Here are some steps for that that help me:\n\n1. Open up a google doc and make a bulleted list titled with one side of the argument and another on a separate page titled with the second argument.\n2. Collect your relevant facts, quotes, and statistics. Make sure to cite them right there so you don\u2019t have to go back and do it later. This will help you be sure that you are making factual statements in your body paragraph. \n3. Piece together a quick summary of their argument here.\n4. Now you have all the fact and you can do the expository section. \n\n5. By the time this is done you should have a better idea of which side to argue. My tip here is to always go for the side that has more facts to defend it even if you disagree with its conclusion.\n6. Once you have this figured out think of three really strong reasons why the argument you chose is better. Is it more logically valid? Is there more evidentiary support? Really take time to figure these out and write then down, write as much about them as you can\n7. Now think of how you might argue against your own arguments. Again it has to be strong but not too strong. Write a few sentences\n8. Now defend your argument against the counter argument you just made. Is it logically valid? Is the evidentiary support bad? Does the position you defend cover for their argument?\n9. Now go back and write your roadmap-thesis. \n\nFormula is: in this paper i will present and critically evaluate both [1st author\u2019s argument for/against___ ___] and [2nd author\u2019s argument for/against ______], then i will defend my position that [chosen position author\u2019s] argument is better, and consider and respond to a potential objection on behalf of [opposing author]. \n\nBoom, you have a paper. Just slap a intro and conclusion on it and you\u2019re good to revise. \n\nComment or pm me if you have questions or need clarification on anything.",
