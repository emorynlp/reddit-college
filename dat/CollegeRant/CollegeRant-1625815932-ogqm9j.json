  "title:": "My super smart friend is getting scammed",
  "text": "I convinced my friend to join me at my college because she hated hers and we could be roommates. The kicker- she has to pay out of state for a year. She is super smart and has a 4.0gpa plus a 30 on her act, which would get her a full ride somewhere like Chicago. But not at our college. No, she gets like $3,000 waived but then ha $16,000 a semester left to pay. Her parents won\u2019t help so she\u2019s paying for everything with loans and she doesn\u2019t qualify for any fafsa. I feel like I basically put a noose around her neck convincing her to go to this college, but now she\u2019s signed her lease and can\u2019t leave. I don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s not being offered more scholarships. Are we just being stupid and not understanding how scholarships work? She said she applied through various websites and just got subscriptions to news letters. Her words \u201cWhy am I trying to hard to keep a 4.0 when it doesn\u2019t get me anywhere?\u201d Thanks in advance for reading.",

      "text": "the problem with scholarships is that you\u2019re usually competing with other potential students and it depends a lot on essay writing. there are merit based scholarships out there, but that\u2019s usually the only time your high school gpa, ACT/SAT scores, extracurriculars, etc matters for scholarships. I\u2019d focus more on the scholarships offered through the college, which you can usually find on the college\u2019s website, or talk to student financial aid to get a deeper understanding as to what\u2019s going on. maybe there\u2019s something about being a transfer student that\u2019s hindering scholarships.\n\nher biggest concern should be why FAFSA didn\u2019t offer her any aid. is she claimed as a dependent or is she an independent student? if the student is dependent, FAFSA looks at the financial security of the parents and does or does not offer aid depending on what they find. if the student is independent then they look at the student\u2019s financials. in Illinois (my state) I became independent at age 24 and it\u2019s actually opened up more financial aid options for me.",

She has no contact with her dad and her and her mom have a very strained relationship but regardless she refuses to help my friend pay for her school. Her trying to get as far as possible from her family is the whole reason to be going out of state. Her mom still files her as a dependent. Thank you for your time, I think she\u2019s going to try file to be an independent.",

              "text": "Yeah I\u2019d urge her to talk to the college\u2019s financial aid department. I had an entire discussion about some similar stuff earlier this year as I was trying to figure out my status as a student and was having trouble with financial aid for summer 2021. If she\u2019s no contact with her parents, I vaguely recall there being a way to claim herself as independent in school (something that she can discuss with the financial aid office), but she may also need to talk to the IRS if her mother continues to claim her as dependent, as her claim is going to mess with your friend when she files taxes and applies for financial aid of any sort, not just college.\n\nIf her parents make good money and claim her as a dependent, she\u2019ll very likely get minimal financial aid at best.",
