  "title:": "Tying to get ahead in my 8-week history class so I can visit my sick grandpa. Exhausted.",
  "text": "I\u2019m in two other 8-week classes, as well. I have to be enrolled in this much so I can transfer on time. I don\u2019t have lectures for two of the classes so I\u2019m legit just reading the digital textbook and taking notes. My eyes burn so badly even though I take breaks & use glasses. I have to read two chapters per week along with other assignments on top of that for history alone and I\u2019ve been trying to get a bit ahead so I can have less assignments to worry about when I visit my grandpa. It takes a full day of driving to get there, so that\u2019s already two days on no work. I\u2019m going to have to fit in time to read/do hw whenever I can there instead of just focusing on spending time with my 99 year old grandpa with worsening dementia. \n\nI know I have a choice and *could* just do nothing while I\u2019m there and let my grades drop, but I\u2019m have anxiety & hate letting people down. I want to do well & show my professors that I care.\ud83d\ude14",

I wish I had more pictures. \n\n\nI lost my brother and grandpa about 15 years ago while in college. I wish I could go back and take a year off to hang with them instead of being in those classes. I miss them every day and I haven\u2019t cared about my GPA until this post reminded me how much I worked for it. \n\n\nMy mom definitely doesn\u2019t care. \nMy dad has never once asked. \n\n\nI agree with seeing your Professors and also communicate with them. So much can be avoided with clear and direct communication. Some Professors do take themselves too seriously but most are understanding.",

      "text": "You've probably already checked, but I'll drop this here anyway: check the syllabus and any announcements from the professor to see if you are allowed to use the text and any other provided resources during tests. I've noticed that several of my classes so far have allowed it, because they don't ask straight fact questions so much as a combo of fact and interpretation questions. I've had at least one class that utilized documentaries from Films on Demand, which have an option to download the transcripts of the documentaries. \n\n\nMy point is, IF you're allowed to use the text on tests, read through the relevant readings once during the week, and once right before the test. Then, have the digital text open and use the search function in the reading app if you're unsure of anything. This won't work out for you if you don't read and understand the material beforehand though. I just figure it'll save you time and eyestrain on note-taking.\n\n\nSpeaking of eyestrain, look into getting cheap blue-light filter reading glasses from a website like Zenni or whatever. They're amazing.\n\n\nEdit: paragraph spacing",

I have to do one while I\u2019m visiting as it is due next week (I don\u2019t feel the need to ask for an extension as I can get it done). For my history class, my tests have essay portions and MC, no open book.

I do love the search function during quizzes.\ud83d\ude42",

I bought physical books for my current classes just out of paranoia, but I think next time I'll just go full digital. \n\nDo they give you some sort of study guide at least? Sounds like you're taking an upper division class; my upper division classes have tests like that too. When they do provide study guides, I type my notes into them as I go through lectures and readings.",
