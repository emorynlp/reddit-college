  "text": "\nI\u2019ve been feeling really down for the past few weeks. I\u2019m an incoming freshman taking up Architecture here in the Philippines and as many of you know, this major really cost a lot because of the materials. I manage to get into a public university so tuition is not a problem but it\u2019s still going to be hard for me because of the school supplies. \n\nU see, I can\u2019t say were poor because we have no debts, and were not struggling to make ends meet however my mom is the only one working for us and this school coming she has 2 college students to support to.\n\n\nThat time when my mother told me how much she will give me for my school stuffs, I immediately thought of temporarily stopping my studies. It was not even half of what I will need.  The second thing that came to my mind ofc was to try to fit the things I needed to my mom\u2019s budget but no matter how I chose the cheapest stuffs or used ones, it\u2019s still not going to be enough. The next option would be to look for a part time job but it\u2019s not even possible because of the pandemic and not to mention I live in a rural area and there is limited job openings here \ud83d\ude1e\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t want to tell my mom that it\u2019s not enough, because I know she\u2019ll try to make a way to give the things that I\u2019ll need. She\u2019s working abroad for a decade now and yet she barely has savings which will be spent in her vacation this coming october. I really don\u2019t want to add up to my mother\u2019s burden.\n\nAny architecture students here who are experiencing the same problem? Why not share it here. I just want to feel that im not the only one like this.",

      "text": "Any chance you still have those savings from your senior year? If yes, use them now. If not, approach your relatives for help. I firmly believe that you don't need that much money to buy stuff for one school year. 1k to 2k is enough, in my opinion, to help you for 2 and a half year, if you know how to work things around. You don't need that much materials to produce a presentable outwork. Buying a Laptop for future use is another thing though...",

          "text": "1k-2k? Not even half of what I initially needed. I already bought my school stuffs, only those that are necessary and it cost me 8k already. All of them are even cheap stuffs and not branded. I used the money my mom gave and added my savings without letting her know and yet I still have tons of stuff that I need to buy. Studying architecture is really expensive even with free tuition. Even so, I don\u2019t want to take a course I didn\u2019t like so I took it anyway",

      "text": "Take out a loan? Get a job near your studies if they are in person? Find a side hustle online? Financial troubles are not new to students. And it\u2019s very common for students to contribute and not expect their parents to pay all - especially a single parent with other children to support. Also see if there are second hand materials you can buy at a discounted rate somewhere. Be resourceful. Don\u2019t quit.",

          "text": "Loan? I wish it was easier to take out a student loan here. My mother has to apply for it (w/c I know she wouldn\u2019t) and there needs to be some kind of collateral. Jobs? Trust me, that was the first thing I had in mind, actually I stopped studying last school year because I worked and I barely saved up because I helped my family with the expenses too. I live in a rural area and part time jobs are not a thing here. No one will even accept students because employers needs someone who don\u2019t have any other commitments.  Second hand materials? I will, and there\u2019s no other option, but even with that, it\u2019s still not enough. \n\nOnline jobs are actually great, I could tutor or teach english online but even that is not an possible with the terrible internet connection here.\n\n\nThis is a hopeless case haha. Anyway, thanks for reading and sharing your opinion \ud83d\ude36",

Overall though you are in a better position than most if you and your family have no debt at this point. I don\u2019t know too many students that will be able to say that.",
