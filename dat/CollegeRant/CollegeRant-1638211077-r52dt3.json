  "text": "I'm in my 1st semester in college, 5 classes, 16 hours weekly.\n\nI have no time for myself or my family or anything else besides college.\n\nI'm having a terrible time.. the classes were interesting at first, but after seeing the stupid way they're done I lost all motivation.\n\nWhat teachers do is to simply explain NOTHING in class, they start wandering about their lifes or talking to us like we're masters in the area already, using terms almost no one understands or comprehends.\nAfter that, they'll just send, 10 days or so away from the exam, about 2000-3000 pages to read and that's it. No explanation, no direction on what to focus, nothing!\n\nThis would be okay if they did the exams in accordance to this, but it isn't. \n\nMy exams consist of a simple sentence from one of the 3000 or so pages and a \"develop this topic\". \nThat is 100% of the score of the exam.\n\nFUCK the dozens and dozens of hours and days you put in reading as much as you can read for this ONE out of FIVE fucking classes, almost not sleeping nor eating shit. If you read 2999 pages and leave the 1 page where that sentence belongs, congrats, here's your 0, try again next year ;)\n\nWhile that's going on, you missed 3 deadlines for delivering essays to other classes PLUS you have 3 more exams coming up next week, 2 on monday and 1 on tuesday, good luck!\n\nAfter that you barely remember that you had a girlfriend or that your mum exists.\n\nFuck college, it's ruining my life.",

Sometimes life leads you in another direction, another major, perhaps less hours, changing schools, etc. maybe consider your options and accept what you can and can\u2019t handle.",
