That mixed with a heavier load of non-school responsibilites, arthritis acting up, and randomly waking up at 5am to sinus issues that lasted 6 hours? I went to sleep on the couch at noon fully accepting that I just wasn't gonna do anything today. Probably gonna hate myself for it tomorrow but I still know I needed it",

The pressure to graduate on time has been a lot (since I have a history of dropping classes due to stress) but I'm trying my best and feel okay about where I am rn. I don't need to get an A I just need to pass to get the credits and the actual grade won't affect my GPA (If I choose that option) which is helping me contain my stress",
