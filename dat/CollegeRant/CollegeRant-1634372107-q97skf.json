  "text": "i think i've done well in forcing myself to do tasks for the past few weeks but this week i just don't have the willpower to move my body. like i know this is the course i want but god none of the things i'm being taught right now interest me at all. what i mean is, my course is multimedia arts i don't think i'm supposed to have a subject that teaches me how to compute binary code shit or something. i know my previous college didn't have that -- it was purely media and arts subjects and i liked it but i couldn't keep up with their pacing so i transferred, and this one is just idk. why do i have to learn this shit? i don't even listen much in discussions anymore.\n\nthe pacing is ok for me but the topics and shit are less interesting than the subjects from my previous college but i have no choice but to continue on, i have the whole weekend to finish a few tasks, rant aside -- what are some things that i could do to get myself to just get on with it?\n\ni just wanna get all this shit done and then stay in bed for 6 months lmao",

      "text": "honestly just take it one day at a time. don\u2019t try to complete everything at once where it overwhelms you. i also use a planner religiously and plan out what days i\u2019ll be doing what assignment based on their due dates. and also give yourself a break, if your completing an assignment and feel the need to give up it\u2019s becoming to much then do something that comforts you. don\u2019t just sit around that way you can return to finish completing the assignment when your done but maybe take a walk or draw to distract your mind until your ready to finish.",

      "text": "The advice I would give is to try and make a connection between the stuff you\u2019re learning and what you want to do. I had a class where I was also super uninterested with what I was doing but after one unit I was able to connect some of its topics to stuff that interested me. It made the class a lot less miserable and it piqued my attention so I was more invested later on in the course. \n\nAlso for getting stuff done, a great method I\u2019ve heard about is to force yourself to work on things for 15min. Once that 15min is up evaluate where you are. Maybe you\u2019ve gotten in the grove, if so, then great. Keep working. If not, then take a 15 min break/do something else productive. Once that\u2019s up, try working on that first task again for 15min and rinse and repeat. That way you\u2019re getting things done,  it you\u2019re not forcing yourself into doing hours and hours of something you hate.",
