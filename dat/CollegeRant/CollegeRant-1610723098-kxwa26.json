  "text": "English classes having the hidden requirement of writing what your professor wants to hear. They don't explicitly say this of course, and there are of course some good English professors out there that don't follow this. But why take the risk? This one is probably the worst given these classes tend to be designed around giving YOUR opinion/take on a topic, while simultaneously encouraging students to self-censor so they're garunteed a good grade. I think it creates an insular bubble of ideas in English departments/faculty when English should theoretically be one of the most free expression subjects.\n\nI've had assignments in a class where there were clear bonus points available. Do ___, get +5 points on this assignment. Ok simple enough. And the class also allowed late work for a small penalty. So I do the bonus and turn it in a day late. The hidden requirement on this one being apparently it's just \"common sense\" that you don't get bonus points you earned if it was turned in late. No mention ever of this rule in class, nothing in the syllabus about this. The rule itself isn't that bad, but if you never tell the students that's ridiculous.",

Bonus work and points should technically be a bonus only if the assignment is turned in on time. So not turning the assignment in on time should disqualify you from the bonus. My professors do this all the time. At least they allowed late work, mine gives 0.   \nAlso if you took this class years ago I'm sure you had classes in between now and then, so make a document of questions to email or ask your teacher on syllabus day. The more you know the better. Now you know that for that class and some teachers turning in work late disqualifies you from extra credit.   \n\n\nYou shouldn't go around calling people names because they are making sense of the late policy rules for not getting extra credit.   \n\n\nThis is almost one of those rules you can assume. But we all know what ASSUME means. So instead of assuming or blaming not knowing, ask the professor next time, if you make the mistake just learn from it.",

I don\u2019t always state them right next to each other, however; for example, a number of students have asked if they can submit essays in this class that they have submitted for other classes previously, and I\u2019ve told them no, because my \u201cacademic dishonesty\u201d paragraph in the syllabus says that students may not submit assignments submitted for other classes, even the same class in a different semester. It\u2019s not on the assignment, but is a blanket behavior covered in the syllabus. \n\nI also don\u2019t grade on whether someone shares my opinion. I have told them to stay away from papers written that try to prove that climate change isn\u2019t real or caused by man, or that vaccines aren\u2019t helpful and may even be harmful. Most of my papers require scholarly, peer-reviewed, academic research evidence, though, so I\u2019m mainly requiring them not to use those topics because they won\u2019t find any established scientific evidence that will agree with them. But, I\u2019ve given A grades to anti- and pro-abortion papers as well as anti- and pro-gun rights papers. It\u2019s all about the argument, not what my opinions are.",

That\u2019s a claim without evidence. Maybe you\u2019re not exceptionally skilled at critical thinking, and it\u2019s why you\u2019re having difficulty expressing this point; you may not realize the errors in your thinking.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with assuming gender from an anonymous username? I meant no offense, but most people normalize faceless versions of those they are talking to by imagining a persona that resembles themselves. I think that\u2019s healthy, actually; it\u2019s an attempt to empathize rather than \u201cother\u201d that person.

If you don't know this by now, an anon comment will not change your mind.\n\nFact is that you implied asking for a concrete example, I gave one, I'm not going to search for more. If you have trouble believing that professors will mark down papers for disagreeing with their viewpoints, then you either haven't encountered such a professor and are naive, or you're a pushover.\n\nAlso, I literally pointed out that RMP reviews are not accurate. Your counter example could have very well been made by a person who just regurgitated the profs views back at him and did well. A single example is evidence, regardless of how small. I'm not making an outlandish claim by saying that liberal professors like hearing their own words thrown back at them.",

The only way to evaluate whether someone received a lower grade because their opinion didn\u2019t match the liberal opinion of the professor would be to see the paper in question, see the feedback, and have outside parties assess whether that feedback seemed reasonable (even better if there were a rubric that could be assessed). \n\nJust telling us that there\u2019s a student out there that *perceives* bias doesn\u2019t prove that their assessment was accurate. That\u2019s why I showed you the counterexample; it was meant to show that your example couldn\u2019t be an example that professors have that behavior, or even that that single professor does; all you proved is that a student perceived that behavior, which could have been a false perception. If all of the ratings were negative with that same opinion, that would indicate a pattern and the assumption would be fairly reasonable. But the counter example I provided was only a few down on the page. So that doesn\u2019t show that the professor has that problem, or even that all the students perceive he does. It does, however, mean that students have expressed non-liberal opinions and believe they have received bad grades because of those opinions. However, that is a philosophy class, which generally have a component of logic in them, so it\u2019s even more likely that all opinions expressed will be based on philosophical logic (if drawing from source material), and that if students were expressing opinions without citing other philosophers and without using the logic taught in the class, that students might receive bad grades for that.\n\nYou actually sound a bit like one of the students I usually have that doesn\u2019t pass the state college assessment test in an odd way that isn\u2019t common: low reading score but high writing score. You seem skilled at thoughtfully expressing an opinion that doesn\u2019t have the substance you think it does. It kind of makes sense why you thought your grades came from the liberal opinions of the professor and not of your ability to evaluate the credibility of information and arguments.",

Committing the fallacy of an appeal to  majority while calling it \u201clogic\u201d as well as committing ad hominem by casting doubt on the perception of the person expressing a grievance is not how a educator/professor should be responding to students with grievances especially when an educator may be failing his students and not practicing proper pedagogy. Overlooking, dismissing and attacking the character and credibility of a student is simply Unacceptable but as more mid-wits within the softer sciences and liberal arts further depend on consensus disguised as logic it is now so egregious that even undergraduates are aware of it, consensus was primarily the last option reserved for dueling theories at the forefront of the highest sciences and not a means to conduct character assassinations towards student you don\u2019t agree with. Mid-witted faculty much like yourself who overwhelmingly depend on being clever socially to appeal towards larger groups of individuals in an effort to avoid the use of critical thinking and logic to mask their fundamental inability to provide any progress in their field while continuously emphasizing their qualifications while modeling their research in a biased manner with intent to find agreeableness amongst the general public and mid-wits in their field. Relying on social adoption of theory that is disproven by mountains of research in the higher sciences is not inconsequential, it is irresponsible and a threat to the wellbeing of society. One could produce an entire study on how individuals such as yourself are collectively destroying learning institutions, but it would make no difference in the grander scale of things because you would dismiss it and present a fallacious counter argument that appeals to society by exploiting the perception of individuals and their self-identity. It\u2019s tiring, and accomplishes nothing yet you continue to practice it because you don\u2019t care about the pursuit of truth, professors like yourself express resentment for more accomplished or more intelligent individuals in the field by appealing to the public with social reasoning and misconstrued and cherry picked statistics that reinforce support towards your opinion. It is ridiculous and if it is only possible because its a malignant behavior of sociopathic mid-wits who collectively abuse the agreeableness required for  open minded intellectuals to advance the sciences. Most of the competent faculty has left out of frustration with administration that is under the spell of the mid-wits social appeals, at some point reform might have worked but it was hijacked in the same manner. The sooner students as a majority realize that the institutions have overwhelmingly become a liability to society rather than a resource, save for possibly the mathematics departments. the sophists profiteering off gullible citizens they eventually create a circular economy of narrative explanations that censor better and useful explanations that reduce the citizens reliance on their system. Such a monolithic and fractured system falls apart when a Socrates asks questions they can\u2019t answer. \nEither act in the defense of your students intellectual freedom or take your moral perversion towards reality to fortune telling and corrupt religious institutions.",

Basically, what I\u2019m saying is that it seems like an attempt to build your credibility, but I\u2019m not sure it serves that purpose.\n\nI think you and I just possess a difference of opinion on the importance of tested data. Most of the cherry picking I see in class comes from students who possess a narrow-minded view of some topic overpowered by their personal feelings or experiences. Students will want to write arguments that make claims against vaccinations or climate change on a scientific basis, not one of freedom, against abortion on a health basis, against guns on a safety or deterrence basis, etc. They have to look at hundreds of articles in our databases and find 5 that agree with them in order to make their argument work, and generally they ignore the counter arguments of the other side and act like they don\u2019t exist. Some have the patience for it and do so, while still addressing the counter arguments and their papers are fine, but others purely cherry pick until they find the answer they\u2019re looking for. \n\nBut, I believe that relying on those who have put in the legwork, and who have dedicated their careers and lives to advancing thought and research in their fields is the wisest course of action with the least number of problems. I will always ask a doctor whether vaccinations are harmful, not google it or rely on my intuition, and that approach is, I believe, the only rational one. We get too mired in relying on our personal opinions or intuitions for answering questions that others have already spent so much time and resources answering that it\u2019s irresponsible.\n\nAnd I find your point about Socrates an interesting one because, while I once was incredibly impressed by Socratic philosophy, what I know of it, I mean, I have increasingly found myself leaving it, over time, in favor of the Sophists he was arguing against, at least in principle. I\u2019m more on the side that we can\u2019t believe that there is one perfect idea of abstract concepts out there if we just rely on our philosopher kings to present them to us; rather, I\u2019m of the opinion that their can be no perfect idea of these things since all of these ideas come from us and each of us is at the mercy of subjective reality upon which we completely disagree on basics of opinion and truth. Also, the fact that the ideas of the Sophists eventually ushered in or inspired the thoughts of Descartes, which inspired the scientific method and which has led to most of the advancements we have today, while religion, mostly founded upon the ideas of \u201cperfect moral ideas\u201d of Socrates, tends to get stuck at a point where it believes that it is always the authority, despite having tested none of what it claims. Religion expects blind faith, while science insists upon transparent presentation of data to clarify conclusions. So, I find your comparison of my thoughts to religious ones to be odd, since Socratic philosophy essentially inspired religion, which took those ideas of the perfect morals that can be unlocked if listening to the correct authorities as a model for Jesus, whose story eerily matches up with the story of Socrates himself, who lived around 500 years earlier.\n\nI am aware that one of the fallacies is a reliance on authority as a means by which to determine truth, or the fallacy of saying that an idea isn\u2019t right if it isn\u2019t tested in lab conditions. However, I\u2019m not telling my students that their ideas aren\u2019t right if untested against evidence; I\u2019m telling them the correctness of their ideas can\u2019t be *confirmed* without evidence, and I won\u2019t accept any arguments from them that don\u2019t have that confirmation. Monkeys in a room accidentally write down the formula for gravity, but it shouldn\u2019t be immediately believed unless they had also proved it through gathering data and testing it. I have the same standards when they want to argue a point more philosophically, such as arguing against abortion more from the perspective of considering when life begins, where I would expect them to find articles from journals that are more philosophical in nature, not try to make their argument on their own while ignoring the work of those who have spent lots of time thinking on these ideas in the past. But, even philosophy can\u2019t ignore science, if done competently, because the argument that states that a fetus is a full human life, and doesn\u2019t allow for abortion under any circumstances, also ignores that countries that allow access to safe abortions tend to have less poverty, which often drives more abortions. Policies that allow for safe abortions and access to them often result in a significant drop in abortions over time as compared with those that try to restrict it. So, the way to prevent abortions is to allow greater, safer access to it. It\u2019s counterintuitive, but seems to hold. Granted, I didn\u2019t provide a source for any of what I\u2019ve mentioned just now, so it should probably be rejected until it is researched on one\u2019s own, since I don\u2019t currently have the research at hand on my phone, but I found it worth mentioning nonetheless.\n\nI appreciate the things you said, though I wish you had responded to my most recent point to him, which I believe addresses one or two of the problems you\u2019ve had with the things I\u2019ve said, though I think you need to back off of some of the aggressive and pathos-driven rhetoric when you make points, such as the dismissal of one side through emotional shortcut terms like \u201cmid-wits\u201d or \u201cfortune-telling\u201d or just the generally-dismissive tone, since it seems as though you are attacking the ideas by showing your disdain for them rather than showing the flaws in them. And to equate \u201cinsisting on hypotheses that are tested by data gathered to answer the question\u201d with \u201cfortune telling and corrupt religious institutions\u201d seems to severely undercut the argument you intend to make, since fortune telling is the one that insists on claims without evidence. I don\u2019t quite understand your point there. I wish I were at a computer and that you had organized your ideas a little better. I feel like there ideas I haven\u2019t addressed in what you\u2019ve said. It\u2019s also my fault, though, since it is very late and I\u2019m willingly replying from a phone.",

You don\u2019t seem to understand whether evidence makes the point you think it makes. What you presented wasn\u2019t evidence; it was anecdotal. You were citing one or two examples of the possibility of it happening, not establishing that it is a rule. Your personal experience of having two teachers do that doesn\u2019t prove that it\u2019s a rule that all teachers do. It\u2019s merely for personal experience, which doesn\u2019t count for much, but which we irrational conflate to be more important because it\u2019s what evolution tells us we should do. \n\nThis may have something to do specifically with your conservative viewpoints, though, and may not be your fault at all. [An article published soon](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/conservatives-see-scientific-and-nonscientific-viewpoints-as-closer-in-legitimacy-study-finds-59122) in *Political Psychology* found that conservatives tend to find anecdotal evidence to be equally important as scientific evidence, while liberals tend to find scientific evidence as valuable while anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t found to have much value. It makes sense when thinking about the conversations I have with my dad as while, and why he values the people he listens to, as well as why many of my students value the political commentary of people like Ben Shapiro, who rarely presents evidence but relies on points with little connective tissue. Granted, some views are extreme while others are more centrist, so it\u2019s not all the same, but there\u2019s a thread there.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a character attack to say that somebody might not have done well on a state test. I have many students in my developmental english courses who are dedicated and hardworking but always miss one little aspect of writing or reading that got them into my course. But they work hard and listen to feedback and do well. You don\u2019t seem to listen to feedback, though, and have just told me that any feedback I provide again you won\u2019t reply to. I feel that\u2019s a dangerous habit to develop, by the way. Not engaging in dialogue with people we disagree with is what caused the Capitol riots; we\u2019ve all become so consumed by our filter bubbles to the exclusion of everything else that even the prospect of information we disagree with is nauseating. It\u2019s important that you know views someone who disagrees with you as an enemy. Conservatives used to call liberals who did this \u201csnowflakes\u201d, but I think conservatives are currently in the \u201csnowflake\u201d role. People mustn\u2019t escape dialogue, on EITHER side, to desperately avoid melting and holding their fragile shape. If that shape is sufficiently strengthened, it will hold. If not, it will reshape itself, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that as long as it\u2019s an informed decision and not a subtle manipulation.\n\nEither way, I wish you the best, but would love to continue the conversation.",
