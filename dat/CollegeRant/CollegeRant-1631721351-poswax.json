  "text": "Everything about the institute is an absolute money grab capitalistic pile of dog shit. I've wanted to be a speech pathologist for YEARS and i've been putting myself through school intermittently. No help from anyone whatsoever. Now that I'm out of community college and going to a state school I'm taking on considerable debt and the quality of education is an absolute fucking joke. I'm 3 semesters past my associates and i've still only taken one fucking class that has anything to do with my major. Now i'm stuck doing an algebra course via ALEKS before i can take the other courses and it's total fucking trash. My mental health drops a peg every time i miss a problem and LOSE CREDIT FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION THAT ALSO TOOK ME 20 MINUTES. Who has the fucking time for this?\n\nI'm ranting because i'm losing my fucking mind. I have to complete 37 more of these topics by sunday night. I woke up today (wednesday) at 5am to get an early start. I'm about to head into work at 10 and do you know how many topics i've completed? Two. Two fucking topics out of 37. If I'm this angry at everything already how in the fuck am i going to make it to my degree let alone a masters? Everything about college from the god damn ground up has been soul crushing. I want to fucking quit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick edit: I definitely needed to get the venom out on here, thanks for listening and the positive feedback everyone! This made me feel a lot better. Good luck out there!",

Now I'm attending the university in my hometown and it's ridiculously expensive, the majority of my professors are either stuck up old facts who love to flex their textbook that they wrote, or they are student teachers who don't know what they are doing. This is excluding 1 or 2 good professors. I have a stupid amount of work to do and  it seems like I'm the only person in the majority of my class who is completely lost. At this point dropping out seems so great right now.",

Also I've never heard of speech pathologist, and I'd assume it's one of those majors that sadly doesn't have any real world use, so I'd highly recommend you switch to something else like medicine, business, computers, etc. I don't know your current situation, and what you mean by \"state school\", I'm currently at a state school as well but it's prices and classes are exactly the same as community college, so by no means is this a university. I'd also recommend if you are in a university to switch back to community college or a school like mine because it's so much cheaper and the classes are exactly the same. Yes it sucks taking so many bullshit classes. I'm a comp sci major so I hate all the humanities classes like literature, speech, psychology, etc. I even hate classes like biology, and math that are supposedly \"related to my major\". Honestly I'm here for the student life activities, and free money. Yep I basically get so much financial aid that I get a good chunk of it back in my pocket every semester. If not for that, I wouldn't be in college lol",
