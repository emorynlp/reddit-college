I got interested in science because back in 2011 I took some magic mushrooms a few times and it tapped into a part of my brain that had never been tapped into before and everything in the universe came together and I completely understood the math and the physics of the universe. From that moment on I've wanted to go back to school for biochemistry. Someone who used to hate math, now I'm teaching myself calculus before I take the class so that I understand the concepts before the professor talks about them.",

I think they do it because they bought the STEM lie (that getting any education besides in STEM is waste of money) or their parents pressured them into that. So they go in those fields despite not really liking those materials and have a terrible time in college and know it won't get better since they will work in that area for the rest of their life. The only way to cope is to pretend they are the only ones getting an education and everyone else is wasting their money to just work as a waiter/waitress later in life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIronically, they had to take couple of humanities classes (English and history) and struggled really hard with it, but afterwards still kept going with the \"anyone with half a brain can easily learn that stuff, it's not hard like chemistry\". Really wanted to tell them \"I guess you lack a brain then because you couldn't learn it\".",

Stem majors have to put in upwards of 10-14h days at times, maybe even more than that. To me, it seems like stem requires significantly more work than business majors do, and thats probably where the animosity towards business majors do. \n\nObviously there are exceptions for both sides, I only speak from personal experience. \n\nAs much as we may dislike each other, we need one another. Business majors are useless without something to sell. That something to sell comes from stem majors. Stem majors are useless if they can't sell their product.",

If they did (Biology to med school people), it likely would've been Kinesiology courses for A+P.\n\nMe personally, one of my favorite classes that I ever took was a Global Studies class, generically titled \"World Views.\" But oh the interesting, non-STEM-connected conversations to be had in that class.Takes on belief systems, worldviews shaped by each culture, why people tackle their own microcosms the way they do based on their upbringing. \"Do objects have feelings and perspective?\" The very words \"epistomology\" and \"ontology.\" My professor was a child of American missionaries who spent half of her childhood in the Philippines, and has a sister who's tight with various diplomats. The class was a total mind refresher as well as a mindfuck for me, just as learning about molecular cell mechanisms for the first time was also a mindfuck.\n\nTLDR: go forth and try a humanities class, science nerds.

I definitely think that it\u2019s easier to get good grades in the humanities but a lot of that boils down to the fact that our class sizes are smaller and the profs are more personable. By contrast it seems a lot of profs for STEM courses are so incredibly callous and try to weed people out (my roommates are both in stem so I see a lot of this) and the culture seems competitive and unsupportive at times. So I can definitely see how it would be more difficult to maintain good grades in that kind of environment.\n\nStill, it seems to translate into \u201cit\u2019s harder for me to get good grades so that means my major is better\u201d for whatever reason with some people",
