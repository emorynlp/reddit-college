  "text": "I may not pass this semester with a good overall GPA. I\u2019ve been slacking majorly due to mental health, plus I was in a car accident right around midterms. My professors have been pretty lenient with me as far as due dates, and I was doing well before but I just couldn\u2019t seem to get back into the grind. Now I\u2019m worried. I have two 10 page papers, two 5 page papers, and a 3 page paper all due by the 17th and I just don\u2019t believe I can get it all done. I was thinking about paying someone to do one of them but atp I think it\u2019s too late. Wish me luck :) I also need one of these classes to graduate, so that\u2019s added stress.",
