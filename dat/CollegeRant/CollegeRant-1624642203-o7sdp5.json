  "text": "because of the pandemic, stress, anxiety, & depression, i\u2019ve been struggling through getting good grades in college. i did really bad this semester and ended up failing 3 of my classes(which put me on academic probation) and i never wanted to die more than i do right now. \n\nmy parents asked about my gpa and i lied and said i didn\u2019t know(because i didn\u2019t want them to find out) and they said \u201cyour gpa is probably too low to tell us that\u2019s why you\u2019re lying and saying you don\u2019t know\u201d then proceeded to compare me to other people and themselves(about how they had high gpa\u2019s) and apparently college is easy and i\u2019m just lazy. \n\u2026 i\u2019m an engineering major. it\u2019s not easy at all. \n\n\ni have 2 semesters left to bring up my gpa and i just need motivation. i\u2019m taking a summer class for one of the classes failed and i think i\u2019m going to pass with a B. so i guess i should be happy right? \n\ni feel like i\u2019m not gonna get anywhere in life. everyone is ahead of me and they\u2019re happy living life and here i am\u2014stuck. feeling like worthless piece of shit. \n\nif anyone has been in my situation or similar please let me know how you dealt with a low gpa & how you overcame it. because honestly speaking.. being 6 feet under sounds amazing right now.\n\n\nedit: i\u2019m done with the summer class. i got a C+",

I locked myself in my room for a week and just slept and read but i didn't force myself to consume material. I just read what I could manage and took frequent breaks. Ended up with two A+ for both my exams.",

I failed bio my first year and thought I learned nothing but when I took it a second time I found myself filling in the gaps of the shit I barley remembered from the year before.",

      "text": "My first semester was a huge learning experience, a funny story. During one of my finals, I forgot that the exam started at 8am, not at 8:30 which is the usual lecture start time. I show up late, go to my seat, then noticed I did not have a scantron. So I ask the girl next to me for one. She gave me one. Then I realized I did not have a pencil, I ask her for a pencil. She lend me one and gave me a WTF face haha. Like bro you came late and not prepared. To top it all, I studied the wrong material. I thought the final was comprehensive, but in reality it was jus the last three chapters. I was so embarrassed. Ended up with 2.7 GPA due to full time work and full time class. I had a relatively okay major, not engineering or physics hard. What does help during times of feeling alone is finding support system like a student club and relating to other students. I got better in being a college student through student orgs on campus and those friends motivated me to do better. Positive support from groups help.",

      "text": "In my freshman year, I fucked up my very first semester in college and failed two college classes. I was at the verge of fucking up my financial aid too because of the credit reqs that I didnt fulfill during that semester since I failed. My family accused me of partying and not doing enough when I was struggling with studying and mental health issues.\n\nI've been there. If youre getting a B for the summer class that you failed, it'll cover up the previous class and massively raise your GPA. Two semesters is more than enough to fix an academic probation. Take your time this summer before the fall sem to thoroughly prepare if your classes are going to be harder. If it's possible take easier subjects/gen eds that are easier or atleast more forgiving professors. Goodluck. You're not gonna get stuck here and you're gonna be fine :)",

You\u2019ll do great! I forgot to say this too but try to go to your academic dean and/or your advisor. When I needed more time and was overwhelmed with work during the probation period they helped with extensions and they just provided a buffer between me and the professors so that I had another person advocating for me when I was struggling.",
