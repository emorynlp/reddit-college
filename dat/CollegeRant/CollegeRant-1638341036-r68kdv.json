  "text": "How do you make the decision to stay online or go in person next semester, when you\u2019ve been online since last March, but don\u2019t trust your institution to not make you sick with COVID? I\u2019m tempted to do in person, but I don\u2019t want to risk my health when I\u2019ve already been ill with COVID once and still recovering from Long COVID, booster shot or not with this new variant that\u2019s supposedly more dangerous.",

Sanitizer. Masks/face shield etc. \n\nIt\u2019s more of a personal choice. Personally I\u2019d love to be on campus more as some of my lectures have been in person my grades have improved significantly from the fully online method.",

You\u2019ll get to do all the normal college stuff in person, see other people, go to on campus things. I think in person is the way to go, just try to do that while still being safe and doing what\u2019s comfortable for you. Again, totally up to you, if you\u2019re not craving that experience as much just do online to do safe and save some money",
