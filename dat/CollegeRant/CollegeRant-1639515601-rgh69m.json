  "title:": "College is a commodity",
  "text": "Maybe when people did not have to go into massive amounts of debt saying that college is not a commodity would't be a joke, but with the amount of money college costs I feel alright with treating it like a customer service transaction. I don't even feel entitled to a lot, but I just want to recieve instruction that gives me a fair chance for a good grade. \n\nI have witnessed many examples of \"point theft\" throughout university. Like professors not bothering to teach certain subjects that will be on tests, or being too lazy to input grades correctly. There was an example where I spent a week and a half in the hospital/home rest during the semester, and in one class I had made everything up at a 100% average but my grade still dropped 10% because my professor was too incompetent to input my makeup work correctly.\n\nI do not even want a guaranteed pass because of my payment! I literally just want a fair chance to get a good grade. I do not think that is unreasonable at $30,000 per year. I go to a top university too, so this is not a problem with the \"quality\" of the university I go to. \n\nTLDR\n\nI want a quality of education that matches the amount of money that I pay, because what I recieve now just does not match up. I do not think that many people are wrong in treating schooling like a customer service interaction because of this.",

If the makeup work was entered into the LMS incorrectly, just follow up with the prof/dean/office of student affairs/whatever the correct procedure is at your university.",
