  "text": "I started this semester as an English major so all of my classes are upper-level English courses. I have grown to hate writing because of these courses and a few of my profs (which is why I changed my major) but I have to finish out the semester anyway. I have a 5 page paper due tomorrow, an 8-10 page paper due Friday, and I already turned in a paper that was supposed to be 2000 words. I only made it to about 1300. I just need to get through this semester and as long as I pass (all of my grades are As right now) I don\u2019t feel bad about not meeting length requirements or poor writing or whatever. I have enough on my plate as it is (I work and I was in a car accident about a month ago) I\u2019m just over it and needed to get this out of my system \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m done stressing about classes that don\u2019t matter to my current degree so I\u2019m just gonna do what I can and not give a shit",
