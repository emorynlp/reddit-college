  "text": "This summer I took an Algebra class to satisfy my associates at a community college. I had a choice of in person with this professor who had great reviews but it was 2 hours Mon-Fri, or this other professor with below average reviews but it was online and had no meeting time. I didn\u2019t think the reviews would matter that much for an online class for something simple like algebra. Boy was I ever wrong. The reviews were a bullseye. The common complaints about the professor were noticeable by day 2. It literally feels like deja vu living all the complaints I read about. Do yourself a favor and check rate my professor before you sign up for classes!\n\nFor fun I checked some of my favorite professors and the lowest average for one was a 3.9. The app isn\u2019t just used to complain about professors. It\u2019s a legit helpful tool for students to avoid bad professors.",

For this next year, I have to take some classes that have very limited sections and I don't really have a choice of what professor I have (since scheduling is my priority). Some of those professors that I have to take have really mixed reviews, so I'm hoping I will get along just fine as long as I continue being a good student. Wish me well y'all!",

Lo and behold, she was making everyone\u2019s life difficult and I spent a lot of long nights doing her insane amounts of work only for her to not grade any of it until the end of the semester. I would never recommend her to anyone else and I wrote a review on RMP for her. I did see someone else\u2019s comment about how profs with bad reviews will write some good reviews for themselves, which now that I think about it, it\u2019s definitely possible with her.",

      "text": "I want to add, in my experience, the majority of the reviews on RMP at least at my uni, are written by students who did poorly in the class or were written years and years ago. In my case, the courses I've taken with profs that have low ratings have always been positive. It just depends on the student. \n\nPlus if you look at the rating and that's the only prof that teaches it so you have to take it with them, and they have low ratings, you will now be (unintentionally or intentionally) biased against that prof even if they are actually really good. This could end up hurting you in the end.\n\nBuyer beware when it comes to RMP ratings, don't base your college schedule and courses solely off of it.\n\nETA: not saying it doesn't have its correct ratings but I've seen some of profs I loved that had very poor ratings. Including some that I knew who the ratings came from and they did poorly due to their own issues, not the profs. Plus many haven't had any ratings since 2014.",

Read the syllabus and course shell carefully. Is it organized? Do they communicate clearly? Is the tone really harsh or supportive? Are the policies fair? Do the pace of the course and assignments seem reasonable? Does the prof encourage you to get in touch with them if you have questions? \n\nA well-written syllabus should give you a feel for a prof's teaching style. Use that add/drop period, folks.",

          "text": "A common issue with higher ed is that institutions hire adjunct faculty to cover the majority of classes. These people are underpaid, over worked, and usually don\u2019t have benefits. So they physically drive around to multiple locations / schools or zoom in to the classroom. This results in them having limited time to work with students and virtually no professional development (not that many institutions promote that) so they don\u2019t understand the basic concepts of teaching and learning. Another issue is that they\u2019re focused on getting published because it\u2019s what higher ed is all about. They\u2019ll dump teaching responsibilities on TAs that are even less knowledgeable on the subject matter and active learning techniques. The other thing you\u2019ll see is TAs taking advantage of students and trading grades for sexual favors. I hope it\u2019s not a huge issue but I\u2019ve seen it happen before.",
