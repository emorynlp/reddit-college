  "text": "Can anyone give me an example of why this self-plagiarism is bad? If it is a concern. All computer science majors commit countless self-plagiarism. How is a CS's act of breech of academic dishonesty different from any other \"self-plagiarism\"?!?! Literally all stem majors are shafted with academic dishonesty.\n\nDo you even site yourself? Is it not unreasonable?\n\nIf this is an actual concern. All instructors across all universities should be fired for assigning the same damn assignments to students. Fucken cookie cutter assignments. that is the biggest act of \"self-plagiarism\" on the books.\n\nPlus, they don't even site their sources.",

      "text": "The argument is that when you submit the same assignments to multiple courses, you\u2019re double dipping. When you ask permission to reuse, recycle, or repurpose prior assignments and the professor says it\u2019s okay, then there is usually no concern. When you try to do it without asking, that\u2019s when the academic dishonesty piece typically kicks in.\n\nInstructional materials are not viewed the same as coursework submitted for credit because instructional materials are not being evaluated for a grade. There also needs to be consistency in the assignments given to courses across several semesters for accreditation and assessment of learning purposes.",

      "text": "Well, I agree that professors should not be reusing assignments again and again, but that's poor teaching not plagiarism. Assignments don't need sources because they're not published or presented research, they're undergrad assignments.  Students don't evaluate the validity of an assignment because they don't have the expertise to do so.",

      "text": "My professor said it's to prepare you from reusing documents in the real world.  You shouldn't just be editing a claim form for a client instead of making a new document because you may miss changing a line.  If you become a researcher, journals are going to expect that you're sending articles not posted elsewhere because who wants reused stories.\n\nHonestly I think it's just they don't want you double dipping which I think is a waste of time to write on a different topic when you have a paper that works",
