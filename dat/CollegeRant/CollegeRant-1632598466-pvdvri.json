Research upon research . With titles and subtitles . For 3 different career options . Mind you if we were underclassmen it would be different but no we are all seniors who kinda know what field we want to be in . Like we are way too deep in our college career to change majors",

If you're spending more than that, consider talking to the department chairperson or the dean of the college for the business management class (please talk to the chair unless they're your professor). They might know enough about the student learning outcomes for your class to decide if your professor's giving you too much work.",

It\u2019s honestly kind of dumb that some classes have discussion boards. \n\nI have a Student Success Seminar class where we have to make discussions and thoughtful replies about bullshit topics like what the personality traits we got on our aptitude test or why we included what we did on a vision board we created. No idea how that\u2019s going to help me in college or for the future, but okay.\n\nWhat also sucks is the class used to be 3 credits, but got changed to 2. Still the same amount of coursework though.",
