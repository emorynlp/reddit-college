  "text": "There is this girl (let\u2019s name her Alex) in my virtual class that is trying to become a nurse. Alex is the teacher's pet. She can come off as rude sometimes and she doesn\u2019t like helping classmates since she thinks this class we\u2019re taking is a competition. She\u2019s the type of student that reminds the class group chat to not talk about answers. This other student who isn\u2019t fluent in English was having issues with her computer and was asking our class for help, Alex had the nerve to tell her to figure it out on her own. It's sad because this girl should not even think of becoming a nurse, she\u2019s far from caring.\n\nUnfortunately, I was put in a breakout group with her, tell me why she was being passive-aggressive. Her negative energy just rubbed me the wrong way so I decided to not talk and work by myself. As well as other students. She decided to snitch and tell the professor that I and a few others were not talking, which affected our grade. Alex has no heart, maybe if she was nice people would talk to her. I\u2019m just shook because, in my 3 years of college, I\u2019ve always been in classes where everybody helps each other out. I\u2019ve never seen a student like Alex go above and beyond to snitch on other students just to negatively affect there grade. Why are students like this? like nothing is ever that deep.",

      "text": "Insecurity.\n\nTell your professor that she created a difficult and hostile environment in your breakout session and this affected your participation.  It might help you, it might not - but at the very least it will alert the professor to this bad vibe, and if your groupmates reported the same it could help.  It will not stop Alex from being a pain; she may double down after learning that you \"told,\" but at least this would no longer be \"your\" secret.",
