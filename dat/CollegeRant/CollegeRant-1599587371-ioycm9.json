  "text": "The majority of students HAVE to work to survive while being in school. School is damn expensive and it\u2019s expensive just to stay alive. Student mental health is not that great. Life is hard. A lot of people are in college to break the cycle of poverty that so many of us have been plagued with our entire lives. They know all of this. It\u2019s not a secret!!!!! But they act like every student has all the time in the world to dedicate to their studies and don\u2019t have anything else going on. Most employers will give you extensions or lighten your workload if it\u2019s too much to handle. I\u2019ve already been in the workforce and college does not prepare you for it, just like high school doesn\u2019t prepare you for college. \n\nI am just so sick of professors being so stuck up and I\u2019m sick of being in last place just because my parents and I don\u2019t have money.\n\nI wish teachers would just cut us some slack sometimes",

      "text": "Hi u/perfectbarrel, \n\nI admire you for sticking with it this far. Without knowing exactly what your professors are doing or saying, it may be out of their hands.  The [federal guideline](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2019-title34-vol3/xml/CFR-2019-title34-vol3-sec600-2.xml) for a credit-hour for a semester is at least two hours of homework for every hour in class, or at least six hours of homework per week for a three-credit semester-long class. Federal financial aid is based on this, which is why a 12 semester credit load (a 36 hour per week time commitment) is considered full-time. Giving students a significantly lighter workload could technically endanger your school's ability to get federal financial aid, which is not what anyone wants. \n\nObviously, this presents a problem for students who have to work full-time to support themselves. \n\nWe [know](https://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/) that helping students financially helps them to stay in school and graduate. But most schools can't afford to give students the financial help they need.  Is there anything your professors could do to make things better while still observing the credit hour requirements?",

I am only taking 9 hours this semester so I\u2019m not even full time but I am going to (hopefully) take 2 classes this summer so I will have 24 hours by the fall 2021 semester. \n\nWhat really prompted this rant is that I went to submit a small essay that was worth 10 points and I couldn\u2019t because it was due at 7pm and by that time it was 9pm. I emailed the teacher my essay and told her that I had moved over the weekend and it was really hectic. She said I had known about the due date since the beginning of the semester and the syllabus said no late work will be accepted so I couldn\u2019t submit it. Which is true but I could write a damn 10 page essay about everything I had to remember this weekend. I guess what would really help is some leniency with due dates. Just seems so cold and heartless that she would say no.\n\nI don\u2019t usually have much trouble with due dates but when I do there hasn\u2019t been much leniency at all",

              "text": "I know this is 112 days late, but I just found this sub. \n\nTwo things, one much bigger than the other:\n\n1. I\u2019m an English instructor and my late policy is to accept all essays late. Students aren\u2019t usually used to this and send apology emails and all sorts of things, but I allow late submissions and infinite revisions.y due dates are guidelines, not rules. They are the dates set up for when I believe the optimum submission times in the course are. The only deadline that can\u2019t be surpassed is the final deadline, midnight before grades are due, when the class is locked by the system and I have no control over that.\n\nI do these things because I\u2019m young*er* as an instructor (freshman English composition), but a lot do not, and for some reason factor the ability to meet a deadline into the ability to learn a subject, which I think makes no sense. What does it matter if you\u2019re two hours late on an essay meant to demonstrate mastery of the material? Did you not demonstrate mastery? Is the only measure by which she\u2019s assessing your mastery based upon an arbitrary time constraint? I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s fair.\n\n2. However, this is all a fault of the system, not your instructor. The deadline issue is old and has roots, and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t change. However, you\u2019re mostly overworked because, as the other instructor posted here, we have rules as to how much work have to complete in our course in the course load of the class, as per accreditation guidelines. If enough classes at an institution have little to no work, or even less than they should, the accrediting team that comes and does a one-year-long audit of our institution\u2019s courses every seven years (for that entire period) will give us a citation with areas we need to fix or approve us for accreditation. So, these things are required of us (except the deadlines for homework).\n\nThe issues you\u2019re talking about, then, are systemic. An accrediting board\u2019s job and, thus, every teacher\u2019s job, is to get you to *learn* that subject in the allotted time frame for the course. Their job is not to provide a list of checkboxes that you check in order to complete the course. Their job is for you to learn the entirety of the material their course offers, and in as permanently a way as possible. This is *especially* true of junior and senior level course, as they should entirely relate to your major and, thus, should be incredibly important as foundational knowledge that leads into the work you do in your future career.\n\nHowever, students always tell me that they \u201chate politics\u201d and prefer not to talk about them. But ALL of the problems you have with college are a result of politics, not teachers. Teachers are doing the best jobs they can with the tools and rules provided to them. However, most students, in my opinion, aren\u2019t best served by taking a full load, and I find it insulting that financial aid generally only pays out fully if you take 15 hours a semester. Students work and need financial aid simultaneously. Teachers don\u2019t know or care how many classes each of their students is taking (we literally can\u2019t even look up your class schedules at most institutions).\n\nYou are being slammed with this much work because every time there\u2019s a recession, like in 2008, states look for ways to cut their budgets and education is a huge part of state budgets. When those education budgets get cut, every time, schools start focusing on \u201cefficiency\u201d. Teachers used to run the colleges, but when the higher-ups hired \u201cefficiency experts\u201d and \u201coutside consultants\u201d to see how to pass more students (which has slowly become the new measure of success for a college), colleges have ended up with more ways to attract students, higher student loads, and more online work. And in terms of financial efficiency, we\u2019ve also been hit with standardized textbooks across curriculums, which almost all come with a required ebook and standardized course materials and assessments with software codes. Many of us kind of hate that stuff to (I know many who do, but I hate those online software packages with a passion, since you can just click through them without reading).\n\nMoney is being taken out of education, more administration has been hired, and tons of things have changed around teachers; but their core job has stayed almost exactly the same: teach a certain amount of material in a way that the knowledge is learned permanently, not temporarily for assessments. All of the workloads of multiple classes and costs and all sorts of other things are bureaucratic problems that teachers have nothing to do with.\n\nBut deadlines, while unfortunate, are something that came out of the...idk...50\u2019s? 60\u2019s? 70\u2019s? They\u2019ve been around so long they\u2019ll be here forever. They have nothing to do with whether course material is learned.\n\nI think all of these changes, including strict deadlines, over time have unfairly targeted poorer students and minorities. Not everyone has equal access to success nor on the same timelines, because of the requirements at the systemic level, and because of the rising costs of education that are entirely a result of funding reductions at the state level. Weirdly, cost of education has barely gone up at the institutional level. But the state\u2019s funding has gone down, so tuition has risen to maintain those costs. It looks like schools are being greedy, but it\u2019s the people who don\u2019t want to pay taxes to higher education that are being greedy, like someone skimping money on the construction of a house by half and then asking why the house is built in a shoddy way or, conversely, why the payments are so much higher than previously discussed on a perfectly built house.\n\nAnd teachers have nothing to do with any of these fees. While the costs of education have risen, the pay of administrators has gone up, while the pay of teachers has stagnated. I have seen my workload go up by 30 percent in the last 10 years but with no pay raise while tuition has gone up by around 50 percent to meet the losses in state funding. We are literally raising rates just to *maintain the current level of instruction*. It\u2019s a bunch of bullshit and will *remain* bullshit until people start caring about politics and voting out the assholes that don\u2019t think education matters.",

It was were mostly older students took their classes and high school students took their college classes. The teachers were all super chill and wayyyy better at explaining how their classes worked. I wish I could have completed my degree there but the only school within an hour of me that I can get my desired major is actually an even bigger school than the one I\u2019m going to now",

The instructors at those schools tend to understand a lot more about how students are not only students but also might have kids and work a full time job while taking classes. If only all institutions were like that.",
