  "title:": "Cheating classmates are going to get someone killed\u2026",
  "text": "I\u2019m in the nursing program and I have two classmates that are 100% cheating on all of the homework, tests, papers, and lab practices. The one girl is extremely two faced and backstabby. She\u2019ll be your friend as long as she feels superior to you in some way, but the second she feels you\u2019re surpassing her she\u2019ll turn on you. The other girl is like her puppy and follows her around and does what she does. This girl really just wants to be a stay at home mom and genuinely does not want to be a nurse. \nThe only reason that they got into the program is because they did each other\u2019s homework and took each other\u2019s tests when everything was online. \nNow the cheating has gotten worse. I thought I was the only one who knew about it, but it turns out the ENTIRE cohort is aware and everyone is furious. Plus apparently, they openly talk about doing each other\u2019s homework and quizzes. They both have been hit with plagiarism twice and I\u2019m fairly certain that they\u2019ve been reported at least half a dozen times. I think the one girl will drop and won\u2019t be back in the spring, so if that happens the other girl won\u2019t be able to cheat. That\u2019s the general consensus at least. \nIt\u2019s just so infuriating because the nursing program is hard and it\u2019s serious. What if they fake their way and end up killing somebody?",

      "text": "This is so wild to me because I wanted to go to nursing school in my early 20s but in California it was so in demand that all the schools basically had a lottery system. I didn\u2019t want to wait so I just moved on to something else. I say this because I intended to go into the field seriously and with guest care as my highest priority, so it kind of pisses me off that these two not only got in but could seriously endanger their patients",

      "text": "Im in school for nursing currently too and I heard of similar issues in the cohort ahead of me. Cheating your way through a major like nursing is pretty stupid as this information is  fully applicable to real life. Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it. You cant cheat your way into an NCLEX license, you can't cheat a job interview. You cant cheat the exit HESI. Cheating for them will only get them so far, and the distance for them will be a couple years with literally nothing to show for it.",
