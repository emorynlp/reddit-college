I\u2019m one of the few students who showed up for almost every class. \nShe\u2019s still employed and she\u2019s teaching a class next semester that seems cool.\nIn terms of my department she\u2019s probably one of the best professors and for some reason they will NOT fire a professor no matter what so I\u2019m just gonna take what I can get lol and teach myself",
