  "text": "Currently writing my final ethics exam that is due at midnight because I have been super stressed about my job situation and have been putting off writing it. I have made GREAT grades in this class so far, making all 100s and only one 50, but I am nervous about this final exam. I know I will still pass the class if I do poorly as this exam only makes up 20% of my final grade, but I want to do well. It is my own fault as I have not studied the terms or concepts or watched many of the lectures. I am trying to write it as I study it but I am having SUCH a hard time understanding all of the big words in ethics. Not even terms specific TO ethics, just big, professional, scholarly words. So many of them in a sentence just boggle my brain. It makes me so scared that I am inept, it's as if my brain just stopped learning and understanding new words past a certain age or something. I mentioned my job situation, I turned in my notice this week I work for a bunch of people who have no idea how to run a business and they get upset with me for the craziest of things. They talk bad about me behind my back and call me mean things. It has stressed me out beyond belief. Bullies never pass an opportunity to call me \"inept\" and think I am starting to believe it about myself. Any advice would be helpful :(",
