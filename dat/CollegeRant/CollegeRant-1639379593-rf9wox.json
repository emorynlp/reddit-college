  "text": "The reality is that most popular advice people give are wrong. No, professors aren\u2019t super kind human beings who are willing to answer any questions you have. Most professors are drowning in work and they hate it when they have students ask dumb questions in office hours. No, it isn\u2019t easy to make friends in college and most people are too busy to be open to socializing. No, a ton of people don\u2019t study better in study groups. For most people, people actually study worse in groups. No, joining frats is not a good idea. And so on. There is just so many bad advice out there",

It's not really that they hate students asking dumb questions it's that they get annoyed by students asking questions about things that are in the syllabus. READ your syllabus a few times over. Most of the time they will be more than happy to answer something that isn't in the syllabus or perhaps isn't clear.",

I go to a smaller university, and in my department, the professors will frequently stop by the commons to see if people have questions and have gone out of their way to make sure students understand the material. The professors are also very friendly, and my optics professors says \"Hey man, how ya doin?\" When he sees me in the halls and my lab instructor encourages people to just come socialize if they want. My university's frats are all academically based, have both public and private study sessions, have mandatory volunteer events every semester, and the reported GPAs of members increase after joining. \nMaybe take advice from people at your university and/or department over randos on reddit.",

A lot of complaints on here are about how college isn\u2019t living up to the \u201cbest four years\u201d hype - it\u2019s like come on people give that an ounce of thought and you can realize that\u2019s an unreasonable statement. Adjust your expectations. Your parents might tell you that college will be the best, but they faced an entirely different job market. They faced a lot less pressure since their education wasn\u2019t priced at $40k-$250k.\n\nAnd then romantic relationship/friendship pep talks.\n\nI could see use in a website that aggregates and organizes the best advice in a presentable way.\n\nReally what we need is a students union to monitor the satisfaction created by student support type admin offices and to demand a bigger voice in spending and better spending transparency",

It should have all pertinent information from A-Z. \n\nI am not doing  this alone, it would be very useful if i could gather several authors who can chime in on very special topics.\n\nFor example mental health, it would be very disingenuous if i say just go to a counseling center or meditate lol.  But for someone who has experience in this for lack of a better word (and you dont need a degree for this) they can give very helpful pointers to those that are affected. Of course, students can find this all online but it again it helps if everything is in one organized spot. \n\nI am finishing undergrad and I want future students to avoid mistakes like \u201cregretting my major\u201d or \u201ci should have gone to a trade school\u201d. College is very expensive and I want future students to play their cards right.\n\nIt\u2019s a site dedicated to students from students.\n\n\nIf you or anyone is interested please DM me.  Or just tell me if this would be useful as I want to be motivated to finish this project.\n\n\nHope this helps.",

There\u2019s friendly and unfriendly profs, people who are good at socializing and ppl who are less good (esp w all the lockdown stuff), some people like frats and some don\u2019t etc. \n\nJust for me personally:\n\n-nearly every prof I\u2019ve had had answered Q\u2019s when I had them and seemed friendly or at least unbothered doing so. There\u2019s maybe like 2 or 3 exceptions to that\n\n-I made some acquaintances but never any lasting friendships. But that\u2019s typical for me since hs I\u2019ve always really struggled making friends \n\n-I don\u2019t belong to a frat idk I think they are kind of scummy and lame but some people I\u2019ve also never had any probs w fratbros\n\nSo yeah. You really just need to experience it yourself that\u2019s the only way to know how it will go for you.\n\nYou are 100% right about study groups tho",

Making friends depends, most of my friends are in my major and we became friends because we were in a lot of classes together. I wouldn\u2019t say it was difficult to make those friends.",
