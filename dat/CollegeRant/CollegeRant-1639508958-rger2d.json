  "text": "Ok this is not the promotion of cheating on exams, and I'm strongly against doing that, but if you're gonna cheat do it right. I was taking my final exam and we were in the middle of a quiet classroom and all of the sudden someone's phone blasts out question #1 over its speakers. I don't think I've ever held in a laugh that hard. I'm assuming they were using Quizlet as there is a read-aloud option. Surprisingly the professor didn't do anything to my classmate and allowed us to keep going.",

But during the final the same guy who asked \u201cso it\u2019s a 10 point curve right? So if I get a D in the class I\u2019ll wind up with a C?\u201d Also had his phone go off with what sounded like Siri going over the topics of the exam. Not once. But twice!\n\nThe first time the teacher ignored it, but the second he kind of had this uncomfortable smile on his face and asked what it was. The student said he had been studying on his phone beforehand and it just accidentally went off\u2026 twice. The teacher didn\u2019t say anything more. The teacher was such a sweet awkward guy.\n\nWhen class was over the student asked talk to the teacher outside. I would have loved to have listened in on that convo!",
