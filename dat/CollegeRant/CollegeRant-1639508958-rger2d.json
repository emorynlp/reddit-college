  "text": "Ok this is not the promotion of cheating on exams, and I'm strongly against doing that, but if you're gonna cheat do it right. I was taking my final exam and we were in the middle of a quiet classroom and all of the sudden someone's phone blasts out question #1 over its speakers. I don't think I've ever held in a laugh that hard. I'm assuming they were using Quizlet as there is a read-aloud option. Surprisingly the professor didn't do anything to my classmate and allowed us to keep going.",

It was a little stressful even though our cameras weren\u2019t on since it\u2019s not my best subject.\n\nAll of a sudden I start hearing two of my classmates asking each other what answers they got for some of their questions and suddenly the professor snapped and told them to turn in their tests right away.\n\nNext test we had all of us were required to be on camera",
