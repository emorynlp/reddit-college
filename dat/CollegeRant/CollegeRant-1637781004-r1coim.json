  "text": "I'm close to failing every class I'm taking this semester. I've realized I don't just have a few problems with my university, I straight up hate it. I'm incredibly unhappy as I'm stuck taking classes that are not at all useful to me, and I'm talking about classes *within my major,* not just core courses or whatever. I'd transfer if I could, but I'm so far into my degree that no other college will likely accept me. Even if they did, 99% chance I'd have to waste more money and time to make up for lost transfer credits and to meet requirements for credits done in residency, which isn't worth it at this point. I honestly don't know if this semester can be salvaged. My mental health is in shambles and I can barely bring myself to care about anything anymore.",
