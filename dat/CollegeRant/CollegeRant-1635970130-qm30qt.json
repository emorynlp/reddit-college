  "title:": "Feeling lost and guilty",
  "text": "I dont know, im graduating almost 2 years late than my required date to graduate. I know its my fault as i was unmotivated and had some difficulty with learning too at times. I feel guilty for graduating at 25, i already wasted half of my 20s, i feel like i shouldve done more with my life but all ive done is study. Many people are way ahead of me, even those who were like 1 or 2 years younger than me already graduated, makes me feel even more lost. I also feel embarrassed of graduating late. It wasnt even a hard degree, it was just a business degree, some personal things in my life also affected my studies. Now im 25, still in college, havent done much with my life... And this was my pity party.",

      "text": "As someone whose also 25 years old and should have graduated in 2018. I feel like you shouldn\u2019t blame yourself. Everyone graduates and starts college at all ages of life. I also was unmotivated my first two years of college and needed to take a two year break in order to find out what I wanted to do. Even now that I\u2019m about to graduate next year in the winter I still don\u2019t know what Im gonna do after. I just feel like you shouldn\u2019t compare yourself to others because when you do you\u2019re gonna look at all the flaws in yourself. At least you\u2019re graduating which many people can\u2019t say since they drop out.",
