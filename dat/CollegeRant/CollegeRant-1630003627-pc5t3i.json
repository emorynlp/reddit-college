  "text": "1. The ones that take 3 days+ to respond to an email (note: consistently) or just never reply at all not even to follow-ups.\n2. The ones that read word for word with little to no enthusiasm off a PowerPoint slide they stole from another professor.\n3. The ones that are unnecessarily rude and obviously openly judgmental.\n4. The weird ones who flirt with the gender of their sexual preference and shows explicit disdain for the gender they don't like with less enthusiasm and vibrancy.\n5. The ones who probably paid or plagiarized their PhD on some shady online PhD program who can't even research.\n6. The ones who grade on favoritism.\n7. The ones who give 0 feedback and gave the *entire class* a B+ without any rubric and without any feedback.\n8. The ones who, literally, do not even know what they're doing. They understand the material less than a student and it shows...\n9. The off topic professors who cannot stop talking about how \"in their days\" how something else was without covering the material.\n10. The professor that just likes to be a piece of shit. You know what I mean when you have one.",

      "text": "Guess what, there's no training  in a PhD program on being a teacher. You're expected to study, research, become an expert in your field, and then somehow the ability to teach will come from that. Furthermore the process is very individualistic. Focusing on your own work above everything else is usually an asset in advancing in a doctoral program.\n\nFrom the other side of things, I guarantee you there are plenty of PhD's outside of academia that look at some college professors and ask, \"Can you believe what this clown is getting away with?\" Everyone knows bad performance, but the college system isn't really designed to address it in a prompt manner.",
