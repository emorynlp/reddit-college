  "text": "I have an online course, and it runs through CANVAS and Connect. All the assignments are linked through Connect which needs a code to activate. I was using the 2 week free trial and blasting through all the assignments to avoid having to pay another $120, and as I\u2019m approaching the finish line I notice the last two exams are locked until a month out. I emailed my professor who promptly told me, \u201cThe exams weren\u2019t supposed to be open yet, and I noticed the error due to you working so far ahead\u201d. So essentially I\u2019m forced to buy this code just to take 2 exams now which would have been open regardless.",

It\u2019s not your Professor who just decides to keep an exam key open, but rather an agreement between the institution and publisher (i.e Pearson). The one thing to check would be your Course Outline (Syllabus) to read the \u2018fine print\u2019 on required purchases for the course, like textbooks and exam keys. At our institution, the syllabi are treated like a contract, so if you\u2019ve paid tuition on the course, and remain registered, we\u2019re both held accountable to what\u2019s stated in the syllabus.\n\nIf you\u2019re in need of financial assistance, then absolutely contact your Student Services or Academic Advising team - there is always financial help available to those in need.",
