  "text": "ETA- it\u2019s absolutely possible that I\u2019m being too sensitive and making this personal when I should just be happy that I did well in the class. Maybe he did grade them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019m in a masters program (don\u2019t want to be more specific because the program is small) and each class ends with a 20-25 page research paper. Typically worth 40-50% of the grade for the class.\n\nOne of my professors this semester told us upfront that we would not receive extensive feedback on the paper which is fine. I\u2019ve taken him before and gotten general feedback with an offer for extensive feedback during office hours the next semester which I appreciate. \n\nThis semester he didn\u2019t even acknowledge our papers at all, we did not get grades or feedback from him. He did not update blackboard but did put the overall grade into the official system so we found out what our grades were when the university published them. I am just at a loss, I have never felt so disrespected or hurt by a professor before, especially someone who is the entire reason I even pursued grad school. \n\nThere have been rumors that he no longer wants to teach us and he officially got promoted to professor (vs associate prof) last year so maybe the rumors are true.  Either way I stress myself out to  live up to his expectations and I\u2019m just gutted that this is the way the class ended.",

              "text": "ah that makes sense then. i'd recommend going to a mentor/advisor (maybe that prof, maybe soemone else) and saying \"hey, i think this has publication potential and am working on revising it; could you spare the time to look it over and tell me if you have suggestions/criticism?\" if they know it's for publication and not just a class paper, it'll usually get bumped further up the priority list and you're likely to get more and better feedback!",

It is more likely the case that they are being given, or have, competing for personal or professional commitments which means they ran short on time. Though students are an important part of the job, they are not the entire job and often other things take precedence or there are some urgent matters that come up. \n\nThis doesn't mean it is excusable, or professional, but it also doesn't mean the guy got a promotion so he is sitting poolside with a long island iced tea not bothering to care about your effort.",

      "text": "Just because you don\u2019t have a grade in Blackboard doesn\u2019t mean that your paper wasn\u2019t graded.  If your professor was running short on time to make the grading deadline, it\u2019s very possible that they entered the grade into an offline grade book (in order to calculate the grade they\u2019d enter into the official system online) and didn\u2019t update Blackboard, or maybe even just forgot to update Blackboard in the midst of the end of term rush.  Faculty can pull down all submissions at once without having to review the work online, so there can be no marker in Blackboard that something was reviewed but it can still have been reviewed, if that makes sense.  If you\u2019re upset about this, reach out to your professor directly and say that you can\u2019t see your score on Blackboard and wanted to know how you did on the paper and if they have any feedback for how to improve in the future, but I\u2019d recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt and at least asking about this rather than assuming that they didn\u2019t bother to review an assignment worth half your grade.",
