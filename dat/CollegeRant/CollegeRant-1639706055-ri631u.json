  "text": "I was triggered when one of my professors emphasized that you must study \"*this topic for the final exam, it is a crucial topic on the 55% final exam!\"* \n\nAnd then not even ask A SINGLE DAMN QUESTION ABOUT IT.\n\nWhat was the \\*\\*\\*\\*ing point of me memorizing the entirety of the Wnt and TGF-\u03b2 pathway: two big pathways that you mentioned not once, BUT MULTIPLE TIMES. I spent a good 3-4 days memorizing the pathway and what each protein, each transcription factor does in each progressive step.\n\nYou did not ASK a single damn question about EITHER pathway.",

      "text": "My evolutionary bio professor gave us a 55 question final 15 were cumulative and based of a reading he put in the exam, he said the the 15 questions will be based off the highlighted parts of the article, they were not. Maybe 5 were but the other 10 were just general questions. The other 40 questions were from the last third of content, i studied it for countless hrs, memorized all the stuff that was important, just to get questions about the stuff that either wasn't mentioned or was a word in a sentence that we hardly went over. Im just hoping i didn't fail but idk at this point.",
