So wait-list time it is. \n\nWish me luck that i haven't just tossed away nearly $280",

Lab science courses have very firm class size limits, and graduating status is not a reason to force an override even at my home school.  Asking for a class size override as a transient is a fruitless effort\n\n\nAnd because it's a 4000-level lab class, many schools in the area only offer it during the spring.   \n\nIt's a critical course for the major, not really any substitutions that would be allowable.",
