  "text": "Last year I stayed in a college dorm and I had this roommate that was simply put filthy. The kitchen always stank and was full of burned oil all the time.\nWe only had a room, a bathroom and a kitchen so Iearned in the kitchen most of the time. Filthy slime dropped on my papers from her microwave (i didn't heat my food so it was from her). So every night, from 2am to 3 am I would clean the kitchen spotless (but i wouldn't do her dishes, she left them for one or two days with soggy food in them). I  would do just my dishes and I think it was fair. Why didn't I tell her? I thought it was the first time sharing a room for her and I didn't want to make it hard for her. So I just suck it up. The first semester I didn't say anything, but even though we agreed to clean the flat once a week, I would still be the one doing most of it.\nSecond semester comes and by this point I would try to hint to her to clean after herself. Two weeks in and she goes home earlier and without cleaning, letting me do a 4 hour cleaning spree by myself. I Broke down. I also had school work to do, I had so much tl learn since I am in med school. I couldn't take it and I started taking pictures . I took them for about two weeks, so she couldn't deny anything when I confronted her. She left home again without cleaning and when she came back we discussed. She lied in my face that she is the one cleaning the kitchen after me.... How? I'm not eating in the kitchen. I'm not heating my food. I'm no cooking greasy food and letting oil splash everywhere and NOT wiping it. ( she had food from home she didn't need to cook). After that I snapped and I told her about the pictures and she started cleaning after herself.\nThe semester ends she needs to go home. I still had one more exam and we said goodbye to each other. I asked her to please check whether there is anything left that belonged to herin the fridge (since it was mine). She said no. I didn't check, i trusted her. Two days later I open the fridge to see a yogurt and bucket of soup that were both more then 2 months old ( she left the flat for 2 months before moving). They were moldy and disgusting. I couldn't believe that she lied to me like that. I am not her maid. I didn't have to throw away her old food. After explaining how I felt to her I blocked her cause i knew she would lie.\nNow she still staying at a dorm and I stay in a flat on my own. I wanted to still stay at a dorm but after that year I just couldn't take it. And now her mother keeps bragging how she is doing so much better. And that angers me so much I have no words. Why am I the one that is the bad person (her mother wouldn't even say hi to me, she acted like she didn't know my mother but they were friends prior). What did that fucking liar tell them? How can someone lie so much?",

      "text": "From this, you did nothing wrong mate. Only thing is you let her walk all over you for far too long. Of course she twisted the narrative to make herself sound good to her mother (people don\u2019t like to admit when they\u2019re in the wrong). They both sound like a pain in the ass, Id cut them off and be happy I don\u2019t have to deal with that anymore. Sorry you had to put up with that for a whole year.",
