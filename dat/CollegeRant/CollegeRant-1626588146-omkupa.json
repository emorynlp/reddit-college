  "title:": "Struggling to balance work and summer course",
  "text": "I decided to take two summer courses this year, and originally I wasn\u2019t planning on working at all even part time (because I desperately need to get credit for these courses). But my boss who I\u2019ve worked for the past two summers asked me to come back with less hours, and I said yes because i do kinda need the money. But I just finished my first summer class and I am absolutely regretting that. I\u2019m sleep deprived, not finishing assignments, and not taking care of myself. I only work mornings but there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of work for this class, I was not expecting it. I don\u2019t know what to do. I wish I never agreed to working this year, I really don\u2019t have the time for it. And the pay isn\u2019t even that good because I\u2019m working literally 16 hours a week. I don\u2019t know what to do, I feel trapped. Anyone else been through something like this?",

I understand the struggle unfortunately I did not pass one of the courses but don\u2019t push yourself too hard, everything is a learning experience just learn what can you do better next you try to do this !",
