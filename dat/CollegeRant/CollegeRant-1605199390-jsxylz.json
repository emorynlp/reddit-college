  "text": "I am a sophomore at a school I love more than anything. It\u2019s 2000 miles away from my home, and I was okay with that, at least last year. Now, with online classes, I never leave my stuffy apartment. It wasn\u2019t stuffy at first, but since I never leave due to boatloads of schoolwork and literally nothing else to do, now it\u2019s stuffy.\n\nOn top of that, I was diagnosed with an incurable autoimmune disease in May 2020, so trying to deal with being sick all the time on top of school is literally killing me. I decided to leave and just flew home a few days ago. At least at home my mom will take my temperature for me.",

But man online classes has made me hate my apartment.\n\nSo terribly burnt out that i\u2019d rather be anywhere but here. Online classes are a true true pain. \n\nAlso doesn\u2019t help that within 3 seconds of my existence 54 assignments are due and another 30 are introduced.",
