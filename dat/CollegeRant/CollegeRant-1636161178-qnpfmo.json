  "text": "I have a couple of friends from high school that followed me to the same college. At first, it was going well, we were already friends in high school so that was good, the issues started when friend A started ditching friend B and me to go to parties with another group of friends. we would always make plans ahead of time and then they would cancel them or say they were too tired even though they knew that we had something coming up. Then A's friends had a falling out so now we get together and stuff, but then B got a boyfriend and they are constantly together, like probably 4 days a week and like 10 hours a day. They constantly want to do stuff with them and they often try to bring their boyfriend to our hangouts. It's annoying, which sucks cause I like their boyfriend... and this friend is kinda sheltered and I had to pick them up at the crosswalk to our dorm and they took forever while I had to put my emergency flashers on so the cars could go around. It pissed me off and lately, they have been pissing me off a lot, which then makes me even more pissed cause they do the smallest stuff but they don't think, and it's like I have to bend over backward all the time and I hate it.",
