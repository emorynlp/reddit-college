  "text": "College is supposed to be the time of liberation and freedom but it\u2019s actually anything but that. It\u2019s 4 years of being bogged down and stuck without a decent salary, and without much choice. I have done 2 years of community and still could not get into the only school I sort of was excited for. The other one kind of sucks but I can\u2019t move on with my life until I graduate. At this point I\u2019m just looking for entry level jobs without the degree and hoping for the best. I\u2019m going to be doing part time school so I\u2019ll graduate still unless I don\u2019t pass calculus which isn\u2019t even relevant for my major. Why doesn\u2019t anyone talk about this? I feel so stuck and it\u2019s sucking the life out of me. Having not much money and being burnt out.",

          "text": "This! I started school and then dropped out. Now a few years later I'm going back and taking my prior credits with me. Except I'm going back with a couple years of traveling, work experience, savings, and a flexible full-time job with a great salary that will allow me to finish my degree and go to grad school while living comfortably.\n\nOn the other hand, it also means I didn't finish quickly and now going into my mid twenties with years of school ahead of me. I like school and studying, so it's not a problem, but for some people it may prevent them from going back.\n\nBut there is no right way. And I always tell people: start, try it, drop out of you want, and you can always go back!",
