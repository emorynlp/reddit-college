  "text": "Idk what I want to do at this point,.. Before I went to college I wanted to be a vet. I was told that in my area vet jobs are hard to come by so I decided to plan for obgyn classes. But when I actually got into college I decided to try for early childhood education classes to be a preschool teacher (I don\u2019t remember why I changed my mind now),.. the classes was all over the place and I couldn\u2019t keep up with the professor so I changed to radiography. I was recently told by my advisor that according to my grades it would be better for me to look into sonography (and a host of other jobs) instead of radiography because their program was far more competitive then my grades could keep up with,.. this last semester was a total disaster,.. I failed all 3 classes and in turn lost my financial support,.. now I\u2019ve turned to asl classes in hopes of becoming a interpreter but haven\u2019t been able to sign up for classes yet due to family situation. I was talking about the struggle to my parents and my dad is saying that I\u2019ve never finished anything in college and he doesn\u2019t see me finishing this one either,.. he says that it\u2019s getting to the point where I can\u2019t change my mind anymore and need to just do it but he doesn\u2019t think I will. Looking back at everything I\u2019ve realized I haven\u2019t stuck with anything and feel like a failure,. So I really don\u2019t know where to go from here,..\n\nTL;DR\n   I\u2019ve given up on to many career paths and I\u2019m not sure what to do now,..",

      "text": "Honestly, take a little time off. See if you can get an internship or volunteer position in a job you're interested in and try it out. I did that. I worked at a Prosthetics clinic for a little while until I knew that's what I wanted to do and I was mature enough to go to college. If I had gone right out of high school I'd probably be in the same boat.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry for the unsupportive criticism, and I can empathize. My parents never finish HS, and I switched major several times during college, I finally decided on one but took a while to finish. Depending on the program you choose some are competitive (the most sought after ones are usually competitive), and that\u2019s okay. If you want to be a medical professional, and it takes time, go for it, it takes a positive supportive system to get there, the friends and family to keep you going when things get tough. But not everyone has that, and some have little of that support. There\u2019s many factors at play here, but like another Reddit user mention, take time to reflect, college often overwhelms students and get too busy to take a step back and reflect. Find ways to talk to students or professionals at certain career fields to obtain bit of insight. This may help.",

      "text": "My dad never finished high school aswell,. And my mother never went to college,. So I\u2019m assuming this is why they have been pushing so hard as soon as I stepped out of high school,. They have never tried to help me figure anything out, only got upset with me because the things they told me to do never worked,. I\u2019ve took this semester off to just unwind because the pandemic has completely shattered any confidence I\u2019ve had and has stressed me out to the max (between job hunting, college, health conditions, and being a youth leader my brain power stays booked),.. I\u2019ve been doing tons of research on stuff and think I\u2019m kinda ready to jump back in but the only thing I\u2019ve been hearing is how he thinks I\u2019m going to fail at this to,.. idk where to find a good support system of people who are going through similar situations,..",
