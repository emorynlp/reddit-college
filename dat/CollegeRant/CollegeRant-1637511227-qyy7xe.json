      "text": "When I graduate next fall, it will have taken me about 7 years. \nWhen I first graduated high school, I was undecided and took gen ed courses at my community college for a few semesters. Then I took a year off because I had no idea what I wanted to do. I went back, took another course, then took another year off. I honestly struggled with finding the motivation to continue and I also hated in person classes because of social anxiety. \nWhen I finally figured out what I wanted to do, I tried taking as many courses as I could while still working a full-time job. It took me 2 additional years to get my associates degree and now I am in pursuit of my bachelors (which should be completed by next fall).\n\nWord of advice: take your time and learn more about yourself and what you like. There\u2019s really no rush. It\u2019s better to think hard about it and immerse yourself in possible degree/career paths rather than jumping into a major you may end up hating.",

          "text": "This is really good advice.  I used to teach in a community college, and have raised three kids.\n\nThere are a couple of factors at work here.\n\n1. College is super expensive; instead of a few thousand dollars for an extra year it can be 10s of thousands of dollars.  Parents got pissed about this and demanded colleges reduce the time-to-graduation.  This resulted in students being driven to declare a major within a semester of entering college and no wiggle-room in their track.\n2. By and large, an 18 year old really doesn't know what they want to do in life.  But they are forced into a decision.  The first couple of years:  No big deal.  But then stuff gets *hard*, and you see all these threads about \"I'm so burnt out\" or \"I haven't studied all semester\" or \"I have no motivation.\"  It's normal for motivation to wax and wane a bit, but it should recover by itself.  What's going on here is indicative of something much deeper\u2014 like feeling stuck on the wrong track.\n\nSo it's good to take a bit of time to figure things out.  My youngest went through this.  He's the most academic of all my kids, but he dropped out of his third year in physics/engineering to join the Marines!  He needs some time and experience to figure out what he wants to do in life.",

I personally don\u2019t think so. \n\nCollege is much more expensive than it used to be causing students to spend more time working to pay for the classes. Also degree requirements are constantly being \u201cupgraded\u201d to make it more competitive. I changed my major halfway through and was told if I just entered as that major it would have been easier because they added a study abroad requirement and a few additional classes you can only take on specific semesters. So you miss that semester or the class fills up, you could wait another year despite having everything else done. I also think there\u2019s a larger emphasis on field experience. These classes take more time and energy than a typical class (travel, prep, etc.).",

I graduated on 3 years from a major university but was able to test out of 18 hrs.\n\nAll three of my children graduated college in 4 years.

It's easy to compare yourself to others man but honestly it does you no good because their will always be someone better off and someone worse off. Focus on yourself and creating healthy habits and routines and remember its okay to take some mental breaks here and there. Life is stressful as fuck now a days and I completely agree with you, I'm stuck being forced to take 6 classes next semester and one in the winter and I literally feel nauseous whenever I think about it.",
