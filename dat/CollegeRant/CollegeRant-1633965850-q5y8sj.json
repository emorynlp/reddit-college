  "text": "I know that grades don\u2019t necessarily reflect intelligence, but any time I\u2019ve gotten a B in a class I\u2019m so hard on myself. I feel like I could have done better and can\u2019t stand the feeling. I just finished up a report and feel like it wasn\u2019t my best work and I\u2019m already feeling lousy thinking about scoring low on it. Is anyone else like this? How do you distract yourself from thinking about it?",

      "text": "For me, I do a lot better when I think things are worksheets VS tests. I have heckin test anxiety. My science teacher in 11th grade was AMAZING. She would do a \"weekly review\" to see what she needed to retouch on next week. It wasn't until the end of the year, she told me I was the only one (out of a class of 15) who had \"review\" on the top of their paper.\n\n\n\nWhile yes, grades mean *something*, they don't reflect the knowledge you have. I believe in you! The way to help is to be gentle like you would would your best friend!!!",
