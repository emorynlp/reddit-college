  "title:": "Professor assigning an unreasonable amount of work. Is there anything I can do?",
  "text": " Before you say \"stop complaining\", let me give some context. The professor I am talking about is very very old. The reason I say this is because every test we take is riddled with typos, to the point where on some questions you can't tell what is the right or wrong answer. It is hell week, and she has assigned 3 essays, 4,000 words each, due the 1st day of finals week, which is Monday. I am in 4 other classes, work full time, and my wife is about to have our first baby any day now. I am a very hard working student, straight A's in all of my classes except this one. I am going to put in my best effort to complete them all, but I just can't see how I can do it. Sure maybe I am just complaining, but to me with the 4 others classes, full time work, and a baby it is difficult. I realize I brought this upon myself so maybe this is more of a rant than anything else. I'm worried that if I talk to the professor it will just piss her off and she will grade me even harder. Any advice? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Well it was not easy nor fun but I did it. Honestly pretty fucking proud of myself for it. Might not be A quality but I did it!!\n\nTL:DR: Professor assigning large work load while she makes mistakes on assignments and quizes",

      "text": "What the actual hell. Why is no one saying congrats? This man is having a baby. Congrats on the baby. I hope everything goes well. \n\nAs for the professor, try explaining your situation. Might be more lenient given that you\u2019re literally expecting a baby. In almost every case, that\u2019s a valid excuse unless the professor is heartless. \n\nIf the professor doesn\u2019t care, you have options. Even though you brought this on yourself, if you can\u2019t physically accomplish the work in the timeframe because you literally lack the time to do it, you can prioritize better. I.e Going from full time to part time. This way, you can dedicate more time to school. If you have monetary issues where this would be a problem, this probably won\u2019t work. \n\nI will say though 4000 line essays due multiple times a week on top of finals is not cool. I get that the class has rigorous work but, it\u2019s flirting on a tight rope of being a literal ass for no reason.",

He still will be required to take 6 credits, but that will give him more time to complete what courses he does have. But I do agree assigning a couple of 4000-word essays the week before finals is not good for the professor. He should be letting you study for the final, not burdening you with more work.",
