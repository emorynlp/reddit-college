  "text": "Not academically, but socially. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried harder in my life to try to find something socially, but I either fuck it up, no traction is gained, or something else happens and I\u2019m never able to join a group of friends. Fuck it, I\u2019m giving up. I tried damn hard to claw myself out of a very low period, and yet I failed, I feel myself sinking again, and I\u2019m still alone. I literally see people make best friends in like 2 weeks and in the 12 weeks I\u2019ve been here I still have fucking no one, and I\u2019m almost sure people hate me or think I\u2019m stand off-ish. I just don\u2019t even know what to do, and quite frankly I\u2019ve pushed so much I just fucking give up. This is probably a sign to just focus on myself because I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to do anymore.",

I think that you never want to be dependent and simply put, you have to work with what you have. It sucks not having anyone to talk to but, at the same time.. no one is stopping you from being the best version of yourself. You have absolutely no one judging you. Be you.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not gonna try and give you cheesy advice like join a club or approach people or some shit because I hate hearing it too. All I\u2019m gonna say is that what you\u2019re feeling is completely valid and it is okay for you to give up and sink in these feelings. A lot of people feel the same way and it is comforting to vent and know that you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a rough life out there. Time stands still when it comes to making any progress on our desires and we all get stubborn. It\u2019s a big part of becoming an adult. That\u2019s at least what I\u2019ve realized in my time of overthinking my feelings so being self-aware has made me feel a bit better knowing it is okay for me to have these feelings, and it makes me appreciate little positive things that happen to me (socially, personally, etc.) much more",
