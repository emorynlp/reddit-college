  "text": "I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m not picking up anyone\u2019s fucking slack. I hate group work because people always fuck off and don\u2019t do their part. I\u2019m gonna do my shit and if they don\u2019t fuck em. I don\u2019t have time to pick up someone else\u2019s slack and I\u2019m sure my professor agrees. I did my part sorry they didn\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019d rather work alone. I know I\u2019m gonna get an A. Why should someone else get an A when all they did was sit there with their thumb up their ass and use my work?? I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a genius but these are some lazy motherfuckers. Y\u2019all are grown come the fuck on. Don\u2019t nobody wanna have you in their god damn group because you\u2019re a lazy son of a bitch.",
