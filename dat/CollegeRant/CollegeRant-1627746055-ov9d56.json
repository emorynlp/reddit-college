  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking an online course that I need to take to be able to take other classes I\u2019m signed up to take in the fall. I have had no trouble so far in the class and actually found it to be a breeze. I studied a lot for the midterm exam. I\u2019ve gotten a 100% on all the assignments so far. Mind you \u2014 the point system in the class is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm, and 1/3 final. \n\nI go on to take the midterm and you have to use the lockdown browser with webcam even though the exam is open book open note. I log in, and immediately couldn\u2019t get the textbook to work with the browser. I brushed it off, I didn\u2019t really think I would need it anyway. My whole exam then froze for numerous minutes, so I got out my phone and emailed back and forth with my TA. After 30 minutes my exam unfroze and I continued working, and thought it was pretty easy. Towards the end, it froze again and I had to email my TA again. I had to end up switching computers and finishing the exam with the 10 minutes I had left. This was a two hour exam and I had lost an hour of time. I rushed through it and was able to finish it in time and submitted it. \n\nCouple days later, I get my results back and I\u2019ve failed the exam. I immediately emailed my TA, not sounding desperate, but telling him how I was shocked at how low my score was after studying and thought that my exam not working half the time most likely had an impact on my score. He responded back saying there was basically nothing I could do (even though the highest score was a 92 with a D class average, there is no curve). I have to get an A on the final to be able to pass. I will have to change my entire fall schedule if I end up failing the course. \n\nTo top it off, my mom has been in and out of the hospital this week with severe health issues and I\u2019ve had to be the one to take care of her and do everything as she\u2019s a single parent. I haven\u2019t had anytime to sit down and get any school stuff done since I\u2019ve been in the hospital most of the week. I don\u2019t even know what to do. \n\nShould I email my advisor and tell her my situation? Should I tell my TA that I\u2019m stressed and behind already because my mom is in the hospital? I don\u2019t have much hope I\u2019ll be able to pass at this point.\n\nTLDR: I failed an exam due to losing time because my exam froze. My TA won\u2019t do anything about it. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

Because if it froze and you felt like you had a good understanding of the material, it would be worth going over the test again to see if there are any unanswered questions ond going over questions you got wrong",

      "text": "I would definitely email the department and explain the situation. Even though you were able to finish it, it sounds like you rushed the questions due to the lack of time which is most like why you failed. Not necessarily cuz you didn\u2019t know the material \n\nLockdown browsers are super glitchy. Had a class where half of the people were having issues with it. Being kicked out, freezing like yours did etc. So I really do believe you. This definitely isn\u2019t your fault. Professors need to understand that technological issues are out of a person\u2019s control. I would honestly try to fight it. What do you have to lose? Wish you the best of luck and hope you can fix your grade.",

      "text": "The exam should not have froze. Did you tell your instructor and advisor? That is an issue. If you were supposed to be able to access the book and could not, that is also an issue. Did you ask for the TA to do something specifically? You should outline what went wrong. Then ask to retake the exam with the conditions that were supposed to be in place. That is not unreasonable. What reason did the TA give you for not doing anything about it?\n\nEdited to add: I find if you keep your problem simple and ask for a simple solution you will get a favorable response. The more information you give, the more people will look for a reason not to help you. Just my two cents.",

When I emailed him after the fact he told me that everything would be fine with my grade and I just needed to focus on the homework more even though I mentioned again the difficulties I had with my exam freezing. I didn\u2019t ask anything besides what my options were moving forward in the course. I\u2019m going to just try and move on from the exam because I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything I can do about retaking it, as I was able to get my answers in but I just had less time to work through everything.",

      "text": "The big red flag for me is that you thought it was easy but you failed the test. You have a major misunderstanding of the material if you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. I recommend going to office hours regularly to check your understanding of the material for the remainder of the course. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but something isn\u2019t working well. Also go over the test and find out where you went wrong. Was it concentrated to certain sections of work or certain problem types?\n\nLockdown was an issue, but if you thought it was easy and you completed the test it sounds like you\u2019d have put pretty much the same answers if lockdown had worked perfectly.\n\nWhen taking a class using tools like lockdown I strongly recommend not using the ebook version. Physical books mean less chance of tech scuppering your exam.\n\nAssignments sound like you get 100% for just turning it in. Don\u2019t take that as a measure of how well you understand the material if the average is in the 90s, they\u2019re just using those points to curve the class.",
