I\ufe0f deleted tik tok and im basically always doing something.\n\nPartying is pretty easy to manage since most people start going out at 11pm\u2026 So you do work up until then. Also I\ufe0f force myself to be up by 10am the latest the next day.\n\nNot the healthiest solution, but that\u2019s one way to do it",

I\u2019m struggling with the same feeling because I\u2019m a nursing student and then I go on snap and feel super depressed because I can\u2019t go do anything fun on the weekend anymore bc I\u2019m slammed with shit to do. I\u2019m going to be real though, I\u2019ve partied throughout freshman and sophomore year, and it was never worth it. Either the cops showed up, there was annoying people, people puking everywhere and a horrible hangover the next day. Never really worth it and you\u2019ll thank yourself when you have a nice job and money because you worked hard to get your degree. You could also get used to your load at some point and eventually manage to find time to go out or hang with people! Just remember insta and snap makes everything look better than what it actually is :)",
