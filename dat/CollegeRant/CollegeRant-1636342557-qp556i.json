  "text": "I have only 9 more credits left and my degree is finished, thank God, but I feel like I'm drowning.\n\nData Structures is the one class that allows me to take all the other courses I need, and it's so hard. And I have nobody else to blame for it being hard because I spent 3/4ths of my college career hating my major so much and Chegging away at all my homework. Now I'm a senior in Computer Science and I can hardly code a thing.\n\nIm trying to forgive my past self for letting it get this bad but it's hard.  I'm 22. I don't want to cheat. I want to actually understand what's being asked in my classes. Studying for the test I have tuesday has been so tedious because I'm trying to study both data structures *and* java fundamentals. it shouldn't be this way.\n\ni don't know anymore guys. i wish I didn't choose this major. i just want to sing and write and clean up the community and be an artist. i hate how hard I made this for myself. my parents are getting so tired of me and how much of their money I wasted. i feel so stuck and disappointed in myself and I don't know what to do. i feel trapped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** cheated my way through computer science and I'm reaping the consequences as a senior. trying to change my ways and learn genuinely has me feeling super stuck and sad and I don't know what to do.
