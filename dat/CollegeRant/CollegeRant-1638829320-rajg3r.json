  "text": "No, I'm not that one kid that hates the teacher because they won't give me an easy A. I'm actually aiming for a C at this point. It's a speech class and usually I don't have to show my face but this class you have to video tape yourself making a speech. From the very beginning this lady has been giving me a hard time. I have tried ignoring her but to no avail she just finds something. I turn in an assignment and she doesn't even grade it. She writes, \"The worst writing I've read.\" or \"Awful\". Some of this stuff she says is downright cruel. I'm trying my best to be polite but I can't help but wonder if everyone else is getting this treatment. She has offered me to go to tutoring or fail. I have also turned in a new speech and thought I had followed the rubric and done better then a lot of students in her class but she game me an F. Should I just ask her to grade the countless amounts of ungraded assignments, report her negligence, or just go to tutoring.",
