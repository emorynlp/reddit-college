  "title:": "Im absolutely destroyed bc of my last math test.",
  "text": "So i just got out of my mathematical methods test, i completely fail the test, and im destroyed bc ive failed the fist one too, i thought i was prepared enough for this one, i studied for almost two weeks, and i thought i had this one over control but nope. everything was going well until i reached the last half of the test then everything got so fucking weird, i just completed 2 problems out of 4.   \nThose last two problems ive never seen any example on any book neither on youtube. I just feel like a fucking failure, and im scared that im gonna have to take the course again bc the prof is well known for making students drop out from the uni. (if you retake the course and fail it again you have a last chance to take a final test but this test is the one who sends everyone home).   \n\n\nOh and also i got sick yestrday and i feel like im fucking dead inside. so eveything mixed up together makes me feel the worst of the worst. lets hope i pass the final test is my last resource for this semester course. \n\nTL;DR I fail my mathematical methods test and im dying on the inside.",
