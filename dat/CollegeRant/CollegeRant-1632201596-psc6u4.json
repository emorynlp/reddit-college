  "text": "Tests should not be due on the weekends, ESPECIALLY if they are scheduled so u can\u2019t do it on ur own time. Classes aren\u2019t occurring on the weekends, so just bc ur class is asynchronous shouldn\u2019t make it any different. Especially when the point of asynchronous classes are for you do do the material on ur own time. People do a lot of things outside of academics on the weekends and have prior commitments. I shouldn\u2019t have to email my professor for a different test time, and my excuse has to be valid with the university\u2019s guidelines. Meanwhile I can\u2019t even find the university\u2019s guidelines. Let students have their weekends off bc we spend half of it doing homework anyway.",
