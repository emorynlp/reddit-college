  "title:": "Prof. just gave me a D in a class where I earned a C",
  "text": "Overall, this professor is a good enough teacher. I understand it is online and it's sort of hard to teach in this environment. I certainly did a lot worse than normal this semester due to everything going on and ended class with a C. I checked on canvas and it was a C.  I've been okay with this grade as she literally has 0 A's in the whole class.\n\nI was paying for my classes on the school website and she already put my grade in as a D and I took the final yesterday and got a passing grade, and my overall grade was even higher than it was earlier. I emailed her, and she hasn't responded for roughly 6 hours. I went through the syllabus too, and I found the issue.\n\nThere is a tiny sentence in the middle of the syllabus that says \"you must pass more than half the tests to pass the class\". I didn't know this, and my grades for the 4 tests we took were 59%, 69%, 74%, and 75% for the final.\n\nI know I didn't do good on the first 2 tests, but I think that especially because it's online, only by 1%, nearly her whole entire class is failing, no one is excelling in the class, AND I HAVE A C I deserve to at least get a C!!\n\nI would be less pissed off too if she just told me all the way back in April that it was impossible to pass the class so I can at least drop it, but now not only is my GPA murdered, but my entire degree is pushed back nearly a year because I'm trying to do a 3-year course in 2 years and I can only transfer in the fall semester. I've been taking extra classes and 17 unit semesters and keeping a 3.6 and it all is probably gonna get ruined by 1 point for a policy that I didn't even know about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My teacher gave me a D in a class I got a C in because I barely failed a single test from April.",

          "text": "I read it just it's written in the middle of a random paragraph and it's one sentence, pretty easy to miss, and the way she worded it seemed like it wasn't a policy just a warning that it would be impossible to pass because of the weighting of the tests if you fail two.",
