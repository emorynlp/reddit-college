  "text": "Growing up being the family's IT guy, I figured getting my degree in it would be a great fit. I initially wanted to major in Computer Science, but I didn't want to hassle with the math because I've always been horrible in math, so I made it my minor and made my major Information Technology. \n\nI'm thinking, I love messing with stuff on the computer this career path would only be natural. Nope. Not even close. For instance, I thought learning about how the internet works would be cool. Nope. Just a series of boring protocols to remember. Internet Packet A goes from Place A to Place B. Yawn.\n\nI'm taking a class in Cybersecurity right now and although I thought it *sounded* cool and was excited to take it, it's boring asf. It's my most boring class. \n\nMy computer science classes are just hard and I've found that I enjoy the thought of learning how to program more than I actually like programming. Spending all this time trying to \"think logically\" and solve these difficult algorithmic challenges is not fun. Sure, it's fun when I'm able to complete a coding project, but for the most part it's just pain. \n\nSo essentially\n\nIT = boring. And a degree in it will probably lead me to some boring desk job.\n\nCS = hard and not fun. Me learning all these data structures, time complexities for algorithms, and CS principles is not going to matter much when I graduate and I don't find it fun regardless. \n\nBut hey, money? I know these career paths can lead to good pay. I just hope I don't end up hating my life after I graduate and am stuck in a cubicle in front of a company computer all day.\n\nThere's no turning back now, either. I'm already scheduled to graduate in May.",

      "text": "You don't have to use that degree to go into computer science. The degree isn't important what makes it. I definitely relate to majors you thought would be natural becoming really boring and awful. I also like to mess with computers and build them etc but computer science is really too much and involves math that I also really don't like. I am taking new media studies to learn about animation and CGI, stuff like that. But what I am also figuring out is that (and I suspected this would be true) everything I am learning in my intro class is everything I learned 3 years ago on a YouTube video, and Maya is a buggy mess and is generally slower to work with. So all I do is take the directions in Maya and do the project in blender because I believe blender is the future. Anyway I went off on a tangent but just know that you don't have to get into a computer science job just because you graduated with a computer science major. But hey maybe you could try and see if it is good for the pay and judge it based on that. If you hate things that aren't visual like me you could try doing animation or something. It's all up to you though.",
