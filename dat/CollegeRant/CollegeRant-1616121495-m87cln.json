The grading system of every class is different and i just have to hope for next semester classes to not have outrageous point systems.",

So like a 10 question exam but each one is just a small part. Rather than one question that is super hard and worth a lot of points\n\nEdit: thanks for the responses. The only other comment I'll make is that grading exams is hard. The more questions the harder it is to grade. It's also hard to create questions. Still i think I can strike a balance between number of questions, pertial credit and the time it takes me to grade to make it easier for the students while still providing a way for me to assess how well the students understand the material.",

It seems like a question with 15 points is likely asking about multiple concepts or skills, so missing one part shouldn't be a zero. In the real world we need to be able to combine ideas and concepts, and recognize when problems require a complicated solution. \n\nA test with only a few questions worth lots of points without partial credit, yea, that's ridiculous. I got an 88% on a physics test last semester because the only thing I did wrong was convert 2cm to .2m instead of .02m. Yes, my algebra sucked that day and I deserved to miss a point or two, but my physics was spot on. I shouldn't have missed all 12 points for a problem that took 3 pages to solve.",

There's no reason to assume that your rate of getting stuff right will increase as the test gets longer, and adding more questions also imposes time limits which means that you'll be rushed, making the likelihood of errors higher.",
