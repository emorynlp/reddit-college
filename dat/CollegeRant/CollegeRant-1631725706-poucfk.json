  "text": "I will never understand why mandatory attendance is a thing ? Yes of course you don\u2019t want to teach a class of like 5 people but I should not be penalized for missing one class. I\u2019m paying thousands of dollars just to be told if I\u2019m sick for more than two days it will affect my grade, it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. If college was free okay than it would be your policy, but I\u2019m already paying for a $472 fee for breathing at this point.",

You do need to prove youre ill, meaning a doctors note, but at this time I think professors are being more lax. If youre sick, it might be covid, dont come, all good. It might not be like that at your school but if you can prove youre sick you should not be getting a grade deduction",
