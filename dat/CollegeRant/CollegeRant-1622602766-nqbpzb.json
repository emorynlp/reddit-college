  "text": "A couple weeks back I hosted a webinar for a club in our college and unfortunately due to technical difficulties our Dean was unable to deliver a thank you message to the speaker we had called for the webinar. Ever since the professor incharge of the club has been back bitching about me so I confronted her. I told her that it was the entire team\u2019s decision to move ahead with the session as we already waited for 5 mins during the webinar for the dean to figure her tech out. I told this professor that I respected both of them etc etc. After that long ass write up she replies to me with a \u201cthat\u2019s so nice of you\u201d. I replied with \u201cthank you for understanding and responding simultaneously.\u201d\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand what issues these professors have. When they fuck up they blame it on technical difficulties but when it\u2019s from our end or if it can be blamed upon us they leave no chance to do so. The fact that this professor still did not understand the situation is immature and wrong on so many levels. Lol she could\u2019ve straight up spoken to me after the webinar but nope had to go back bitching to my senior about it who obviously got into trouble cause I confronted this professor. So now that senior and I also don\u2019t talk. :)",

          "text": "Aaah the president of the club told me that whenever my name comes up she\u2019s pissed and that after the webinar she had a lot of negative things to say about me. Even tho the entire team was elated w my performance. The president actually wanted me to clear things w her that\u2019s why she told me about this professor\u2019s attitude issue. Oh and clearly by this professor\u2019s response her ego was shattered. This professor called the president after I had texted her regarding the confusion and stuff that it was the entire team\u2019s decision to move on w the webinar etc.",
