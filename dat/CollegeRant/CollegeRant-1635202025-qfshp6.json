  "text": "idk if im biting off more than i can chew or if there really just isnt enough time in four years but college is so fucking hard. like not even the classes im fine with that but making my own schedule, getting like majors and minors, internships, how to fit everything in in just four years. \n\nim a first gen student AND my academic advisor is so unhelpful that it frustrates me so much to the point of tears and i dont know who to talk to or if im supposed to talk to anyone because it always feels like everyone else was told something that i wasnt. and i dont want to look stupid or like i never got the college freshman memo.\n\ni have no idea how anyone can navigate this. if i was just given some help or even pointed in a general direction this would be so much easier",

Just hang in there. That's what I've been doing and I just signed up for graduation last week. You'll get there too if you just hang on and don't quit",

      "text": "Take it one day at a time. Focus on the things due this week. Set aside a couple of hours each week or a day or two each month for planning/strategizing. I'm also first gen. We can handle a lot! We're super smart and brave and determined. Go directly to the requirements for your major (and minor(s) if you have one(s)). Also go to the requirements for graduation (including gen eds). Print it all out. Sit down and break down the requirements into categories and all the classes you need to take in each category. Create an excel sheet and make a four-year plan. Put all the classes you have to take on the side, and fill out all the semesters you have left with the classes you need to take. Also keep track of the credits each class is worth. You'll probably edit this continuously as you move through college because some semesters a certain class isn't available or you will remove/add a minor, etc. \n\nIf you have questions during this process, I recommend emailing them to your advisor, or even another one if you've heard they're better, because you have time to craft your questions to be very straight-forward and the advisor is less likely to BS you in their reply or misunderstand you.\n\nAs for internships, when you have a chance in the next few weeks (maybe over Thanksgiving break if you're in the US), sit down and just go on a google spree looking up summer internships in your field. Keep track of the ones you're interested in in an excel sheet. For now, just get an idea of the deadlines. I expect that most summer internships will have deadlines anytime from January-March of next year, so you can work on the actual applications over winter break.\n\nWarning: don't do any of these \"strategizing\" sessions in the evening before bed! It will raise your blood pressure lol. But if you get used to doing these sessions often, for short amounts of time, you'll get used to it and it will start to feel energizing and exciting rather than stressful. You're creating your future!!\n\nFinally, reach out to elders in your field! Look up online communities. Some fields are quite active on Twitter -- if yours is, create a profile and literally tweet out \"looking for guidance as a first-gen \\[blank\\]\". Or try a facebook group, or a subreddit! Also try literally googling \"first-gen \\[your field\\]\" - hopefully some online groups and resources should come up. Use the community! :)",

              "text": "Finishing in 4 years is an arbitrary goal. It assumes that you will take each course once and pass it the first time, have time to work if needed, time to do internships, and whatever else goes on in your life. Thats not always possible, or it might be significantly easier to space things out some. There is *nothing wrong* with taking longer and finishing \"late\". Its better to finish late and finish strong than to finish on time but be a depressed burnout shell of a person. Im considering taking an extra semester since the last classes Ill be taking are extremely hard, and I want to get a lot of research hours in. I should note that I'm also retaking 2 semesters worth of classes because my first try at college didnt go well. So people I started freshmen year with graduated last year and I have about 2 years to go (I also took a few years off). And you know what? Its fine, Im great, Im doing great and Im proud of everything that Ive accomplished. Take a breath. If you dont finish when youre \"supposed\" to it literally does not matter.",

Ask the department if you can see another academic advisor or write down all your Q\u2019s in list form and send it in an email to the one you have now and you should get an answer.\n\nAnother thing you can do is ask upperclassmen or former students if you know any",

      "text": "Hi! I'm in my second year of CC and I've never related to everyone's burnout and lack of motivation more. I'm experiencing a huge burnout right now and was on Reddit to try and find some answers and advice on how to combat this. I saw your post and wanted to share a piece of advice that put my mind at rest when I felt how you did. My parents have always said that college doesn't require you to go the same pace that everyone else is going, you can go at the pace you'd like and take your time with everything and anything. There's no rush to complete college within 4 years or any amount of time. I'm technically still a freshman because I failed last semester so here I am, redoing it. You didn't miss any memo or an unspoken memo. In reality, many of your peers might have family members who went to college and are able to advise them; unfortunately, you didn't have that luck but life wouldn't have given you a challenge it didn't think you'd be able to achieve. Go at your own pace and take the time to figure out what methods work best for you, don't compare yourself to anyone in the same boat, everyone is sailing different seas. \n\nMy dad once told me a story about his old HS friend. His friend Tom could not finish college to save his life and he couldn't keep up with a full-time student schedule. So, he opted to take ONE class per semester and although it took him longer to finish, he got the same piece of paper everyone else did. He went at the pace that best worked for him and worked to pay for his classes out of pocket, so although he took longer, he graduated with the same diploma without debt and had racked up enough money he was much better off compared to his classmates that graduated in 4yrs. The moral of the story, just because you didn't graduate at the same time as your peers, doesn't mean you're any less successful or inferior to them. \n\nAnd about time management and scheduling your time try this, I use an agenda from target. Every Sunday I take about 30 minutes to plan for the following week. I look at the days I'm working, write the scheduled days down, any doctor/dentist appts down, and then I write down all the assignments I have to do and schedule them in between the days I work and the days I have off. Something that will make your life easier is taking all your classes on the same days, for me, it's Tuesday and Thursday. So I'm able to plan all my assignments for those days. It's helped me stress a lot less about completing things on time because I know I'm always gonna have at least 2 days a week completely dedicated to doing schoolwork. It takes a bit of effort to find things that work for you but you're on the right track just by seeking help. Keep going and stay strong, a month and a half left for this semester, we can do it!!!",
