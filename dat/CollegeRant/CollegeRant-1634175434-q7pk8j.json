  "text": "People at my school suck and can\u2019t even do the courtesy of contributing the bare minimum to group work, much less be good company, and classes are assigning more and more filler work and papers and hours of reading where I literally can\u2019t even learn anything because it\u2019s just so much damn busywork and I don\u2019t enjoy any of it.
