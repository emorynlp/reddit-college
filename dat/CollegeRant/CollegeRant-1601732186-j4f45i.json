  "text": "Just a small rant.\n\nI'm a second year student who just transferred to a 4 year from a community college. My terms are in 8 weeks instead of the usual 16 weeks, meaning I take 2 classes every 8 weeks. I thought this would be better than the usual 5 I pile on each semester, but it really hasn't helped my study/learning skills any. Last year I did pretty decent in school, with a 3.9 gpa. This year I still have A's in both my classes, but I don't feel like I'm learning??? My classes are online by choice, not because of Covid. I work full time and my schedule isn't flexible for work, so I needed my school schedule to be. I get off at 6pm every day, leaving me with 3-4 hours a night of homework or study time. But I dread coming home to do homework every single day. And my two days off a week consist of doing chores/running errands and homework. Leaving me almost no time for myself or others. I mean, I just cut my toenails for the first time yesterday in a month or two because I literally feel like I can't even find the time to care for myself due to my packed schedule.\n\nI often find myself procrastinating until the day before, or even the day of, any assignments or tests because I hate doing school work after regular work. I feel like the world around me is one huge clusterf*ck and it's making it really hard for me to focus in school when I feel like I'm in constant anxiety mode because of what's going on around me.\n\nAnyone else feel like this? Like school's not enjoyable to learn this year because of the mess around us? Or maybe it's just my poor time management skills or packed schedule. Tell me I'm not crazy please.",

Trying to do the basic self-care has somehow dropped to the absolute bottom of my priority list below school and work and maintaining a LDR.  Like, normally I eat fairly healthy, and cook tons of vegetables and whole grains, but this semester I am honest-to-God living off of energy drinks and cigarettes.",

I can't even find the time to cook for myself. I'm a mess.",

Not all of them. But I'm doing all the short easy stuff then not touching my books the rest of the week til it's all due. It feels like a huge burden to even pull out my school stuff. But the fact that I have work constantly hangs over my head. I know it's not the same as having a job, however I did work and do comm classes as well last year. Idk I was so on top of things at comm and now I'm at an actual university and I have no motivation",

It used to be I would go to the library every day, and being on campus allowed me to form and commit to study groups for all of my difficult classes.  This kept me accountable to my routine, having others that I met with regularly to work through problems, and quiz each other.\n\nIn my online classes, I have managed to form study groups that meet through Zoom, but it really just is not the same.  Not to mention that I am not getting to know my professors at all (and they do not know me), which was so important to me during F2F, because it made me more comfortable asking for help when I needed it, and somehow made me give more of a shit about the class.  It has also kind of put me in the mind-frame of just getting the assignments in.",

I was thinking of security when I took the position and feel like I have no choice but to juggle school and this job now. It's so much pressure and people who want designs are needy as f*ck.
