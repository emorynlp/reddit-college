  "text": "Forgive my sloppiness Im just so tired. \n\nI\u2019m a junior undergrad English major and I feel burnt out. All of my classes are upper division English. I have good grades and compared to my classmates it seems like I do exceptionally well on assignments/essays, but I feel like it\u2019s still not good enough. \n\nThere\u2019s always some comment from my professors that I need to develop my ideas or \u201cgo deeper\u201d like bro I thought I did that. I will analyze a piece of text til every literary/rhetorical device is teased out, every theme and trope is analyzed for greater significance, discuss audience, analyze every bit of symbolism..... etc..... and it\u2019s not \u201cdeep\u201d enough? Like ever.. idk. I know there is always room for improvement and you can always think deeper into a concept. But I\u2019m so tired of it lol. I just feel like I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m getting a certificate in education to be an English teacher and this semester has made me question if I\u2019ll be a good enough teacher for my future students and if I should just give up.... \n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "I am an English professor and I agree that the instructor may be trying to push you harder. I really recommend that you make an appointment with one or more of these professors who have given you comments like this and ask them to tell you exactly what they meant by that comment.\n\nAnd remember this for when you are a teacher- which I'm sure you'll be great at if you decide to do it- the way you give feedback - making sure it's sufficiently clear- is really important. So many teachers/professors don't know how to give good feedback. It's hard.",

I definitely can see why you are burnt out but definitely don\u2019t give up. You made it this far and are a damn champ. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure you have asked but just in case have you asked them to explain or give you an example of how you can go deeper or what they mean by go deeper? Does your school have a writing tutors or anything like that available? Do you have or know any English graduate or TA that can help you?",
