  "text": "Forgive my sloppiness Im just so tired. \n\nI\u2019m a junior undergrad English major and I feel burnt out. All of my classes are upper division English. I have good grades and compared to my classmates it seems like I do exceptionally well on assignments/essays, but I feel like it\u2019s still not good enough. \n\nThere\u2019s always some comment from my professors that I need to develop my ideas or \u201cgo deeper\u201d like bro I thought I did that. I will analyze a piece of text til every literary/rhetorical device is teased out, every theme and trope is analyzed for greater significance, discuss audience, analyze every bit of symbolism..... etc..... and it\u2019s not \u201cdeep\u201d enough? Like ever.. idk. I know there is always room for improvement and you can always think deeper into a concept. But I\u2019m so tired of it lol. I just feel like I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m getting a certificate in education to be an English teacher and this semester has made me question if I\u2019ll be a good enough teacher for my future students and if I should just give up.... \n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
