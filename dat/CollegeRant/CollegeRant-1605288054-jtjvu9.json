  "text": "Due to COVID, my university has turned a lot of spaces into quiet study spaces where groups aren\u2019t allowed. The problem is, many people see this as the perfect place to hang out and socialize. There\u2019s not a lot of people, so the sounds are even more so noticeable. It is one of my all time pet peeves when people are completely unaware of their surroundings and talk on the phone, listen to audio without headphones, or talk to each other. Exams are coming up and it\u2019s all systems go for me. Enough is enough people! Stop using quiet study spaces if all you\u2019re going to do is socialize.",

I had to draw the line when 3 Dudebros came into the main room for our floor blasting shitty rap on a Bluetooth for five minutes before I left, just hangin' out!",

      "text": "Yes!!! This one area I go to study is generally very quiet but there\u2019s always one person that ends up going on a zoom or phone call and talks so loudly. I think I\u2019m more amazed that they don\u2019t feel anxious about everyone hating them and hearing everything they\u2019re saying. Like I genuinely don\u2019t understand how they\u2019re so oblivious to their obnoxiousness",
