      "text": "You aren't supposed to understand just from school. They'll tell you they (professors) want you to learn to \"think for yourself\" in order to not have to show you as much and lighten the amount of work they have to do. Realistically you will need to study and practice in your free time. Drawing out the concepts in my own free time on paper then trying to implement has helped me a lot to. Eventually it will become second nature if you practice enough like all things drilling is important.",
