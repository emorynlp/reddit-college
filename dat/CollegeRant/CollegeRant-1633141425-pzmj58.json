  "text": "i\u2019m enrolled in an online astronomy class that i thought would be a good experience bc i took it in high school and i enjoyed it. this class is the least of what i expected and i hate it so much!! not only does she force you to watch her super long lectures, but she has you answering pop-up questions throughout the lecture to make it more interactive\u2014 it\u2019s mostly questions where you need to guess the answer based on the info she has gone over so sometimes i get them wrong and those grades are posted! then she has everything due friday by 6pm\u2026 not 11:59pm like everybody else, but 6pm. i take notes and everything, but when i took my first exam i literally didn\u2019t know anything and she has no remorse! i know i could try and do better in this class, but i just feel like this class is too much for an online course! she says she emails us as reminders, but she only emails us on fridays when she posts the materials for the next week! she just genuinely gets on my nerves and i don\u2019t like her as my professor. that\u2019s all for my rant",

      "text": "I had a hybrid class last semester and the timing of everything was awful. We had class Tuesday night. Quizzes were every week due Thursday at 9pm (and ofc I usually forgot about them until Friday morning) we also had homework due Saturday night. I also had 2 other classes happening with just as weird schedules. It was really stressful and my grades dropped a ton, but I survived. I think a lot of professors mismanaged their schedules when things went online",

Then you won't miss the deadline, and also it's like you get a free extra 18 hours if you need it in a pinch.",

They want to be available to hep students up until the deadline, and 5pm or 6pm is the latest they expect to be available during the day.  I use a midnight deadline, and the biggest issue is that I'm usually asleep by midnight, and students sometimes run into issues near the deadline and are frustrated that I'm not available to help them.  I wish an earlier deadline worked, but I found those to be even more troublesome, so now I stick with a midnight deadline and am just resigned to having a number of frustrated students each semester.",

First, for every credit hour, you should anticipate up to 2-3 hours outside of class. Since this is an online asynchronous class at 3 credit hours, each week would be 3 hours + 6-9 additional hours.\n\nSecond, what do you mean that she showed no \u201cremorse?\u201d Remorse would imply that she did something wrong. It sounds like she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She gives lectures and has you answer questions as you go, which is more than what more traditional online courses would do (which would be just reading the book and doing assignments/exams). She also sends out weekly reminders (which, again, is more than many do, and honestly, doing so is a courtesy).\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lot of work, and it\u2019s frustrating when schedules don\u2019t align at your convenience, but that\u2019s all part of it. Dropping is an option, as is being sure you\u2019re extra careful about keeping up with deadlines.\n\nGood luck!",
