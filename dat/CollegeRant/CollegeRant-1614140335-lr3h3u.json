I understand it, I just can\u2019t fucking remember everything I need to remember to pass a fucking test. I cheated on a quiz like an idiot and got caught, but thank God my professor didn\u2019t report it. But I can\u2019t cheat in the future. Which sucks because everybody else is cheating. When I don\u2019t cheat I get F\u2019s and D\u2019s even if I study for weeks and understand everything, I get points off for stupid little mistakes or not properly showing my work and then that marks the whole question wrong. I fucking hate math.",

      "text": "I hated math when I was in school, for a lot of the same reasons you have mentioned. It didn't seem to fit how my brain was wired.   \n\n\nSomeone on this thread mentioned a disability that affects their math. If you haven't already, it might be worth getting screened for dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADD, or anything else that affects learning. I'm not a specialist in this, but I have had to navigate some disabilities in school, as have many of my friends, so this is just my way of making sure that if you do have something going on, I'm not the asshole who tells you to \"try harder.\" The other possibility is that your professor is not explaining things well, which happens more often than you would think.  \n\n\nAfter college, I ended up tutoring underserved high school students in math and one thing that seemed to really help them is making a list of the steps. Like actually writing it down, starting with \"read the question,\" and making each as simple as possible. I think students were trying to memorize the steps and do the steps, which meant that their brains were doing too many things at once. Many people need to understand the big picture, and math teachers aren't always clear *why* you are doing the steps. Sometimes they just go over the steps repeatedly and that misses the point.  \n\n\nAs someone who hates math and had a creative major, don't listen to anyone in this thread who tells you to cheat and that math doesn't matter. It's actually not true that you will never use it. Learning to get good at math can protect you in life when you are choosing credit cards, buying a house, taking out a loan, budgeting your finances, or accepting a job offer. I ended up studying music, but I used math in ways I didn't expect. I also use math in my hobbies like knitting and sewing.",

      "text": "I'm someone that has always been good at math and it's been mostly easy for me. I still hate hate hate the people that say \"if you just get a tutor you'll understand it\". Some brains are not wired for math and while tutoring helps, it is not necessarily going to make everyone suddenly able to do math. Depending on your specific struggles it might help to find a tutor that can work with your style of learning, which I've found helpful for other subjects I struggle with. Sometimes they are able to show me things in a way that I haven't seen before and it becomes easier to remember. Still, math is hard and it sucks and try not to beat yourself up about it too much.\n\nEdit: I reread your post and wanted to add that before I got my ADHD treated I used to get Cs and Ds in math because I would forget a negative sign or forget one step in the problem. I don't know you or have anyway of saying what you're going through, but for me that was one of my biggest ADHD symptoms. Either way I definitly feel the struggle of making really simple easy mistakes or forgetting one step and failing because of it.",

I have a learning disability called Dyscalculia (a math learning disability that impairs an individual\u2019s ability to learn number-related concepts, perform accurate math calculations, reason and problem solve, and perform other basic math skills). I have always struggled with mathematical concepts. Algebra 2 was by far the hardest for me. Back when i was a community college student (2017-2019), i took the same algebra 2 class back-to-back and failed it both times, leading me to drop out of the class on the 2nd go-around.\n\nMy learning disability always made me feel stupid. I am now a junior at the University of Arizona, studying history with a minor in government & public policy and international relations. During the Spring 2020 semester, my learning specialist, who also doubles as my counselor, asked me if i wanted to take a statistics class and i immediately shut her down (in a respectful manner). Math overwhelms me, my brain shuts down when it hits mathematical roadblocks.",

Dyscalculia is a very real disorder. \nI honestly get so irritated when people say things like  \u201cCheck out Khan academy, go to YouTube or get a tutor\u201d.  It\u2019s not that easy. \n\nI\u2019ve always failed math and when I don\u2019t fail I have to really try way harder than most people, but I do amazingly well in other subjects. Dyscalculia is very annoying because most of the time you\u2019re trying really hard but your brain isn\u2019t co-operating. \nIt\u2019s like telling someone who\u2019s been in a wheel chair all their life, \u201cJust watch me walk and you\u2019ll learn how to do it with time\u201d. \nIt\u2019s stupid and insensitive and only makes the person feel even less capable. \n\nI always get straight A\u2019s. My GPA right now is a 4.0 and I made my deans list. I\u2019m in my sophomore year at my local community college and I\u2019ve been avoiding my statistics class like the plague, for as long as I can. \nI just know once I take it, It\u2019ll probably drop my gpa (I\u2019ll keep trying but sometimes it changes nothing). \n\nAnyway sorry for my rant, It just sucks a lot and it\u2019s nice to see others kind of understand what I\u2019m going through.",
