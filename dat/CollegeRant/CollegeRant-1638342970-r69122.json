  "text": "For context, I go to a large state school in the Midwest. \n\nI've always struggled with making friends. I find that I don't fit well into a single group, because I tend to get sick of being around the same group of people all the time. All the good friends I made in middle/high school came from different backgrounds and social organizations, which probably explains why I have like...5 good friends. \n\nI hoped that by the time people got to college they would realize that cliques are stupid. But no, that's not the case. Within the first week of starting school as a Freshman this semester, people made groups of friends and pretty much aren't open to hanging out with other people. Many of these groups were formed prior to coming to school (many of the people who went to my HS and now go to my college are still hanging out with one another and very few other people). They are also usually segregated by location of where people came from (geographically), what dorm they are living in, what major they are studying, etc. \n\nAs for me? I made one friend during the first week of school who ghosted me a month later when I moved to a new dorm (which was the best decision I made all semester). I've also gone on some Tinder dates and seem to be pretty good at talking to people on there, so my social skills aren't necessarily the problem (though I must admit it is much easier for me to talk to people online than in person because of my social anxiety). But I haven't made any new friends that feel like permanent connections. The person who I am closest with down here is my friend from middle school, and we don't talk all that often. \n\nI don't fit in to any of the social groups on campus and I feel the loneliness starting to consume me. I'm planning to join some more student organizations next semester and I'm not going to work as many hours at my part-time job (which acted as a coping mechanism for my lacking social life this semester) so that I'm more free on the weekends to try and attend more events. Academics aren't really a concern as I'm doing fine in my classes; it's really just the social problems that need to be fixed.\n\nTL;DR - I'm lonely and I'm struggling to meet people since everyone is staying in a single social group (probably for comfort) and I hate clique culture.",
