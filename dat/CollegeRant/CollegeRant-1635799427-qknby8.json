  "text": "Anyone else out there that wants to change their major or is it just me?\n\nLike I thought I was gonna like being a music major but I hate it now. It feels more like a job than anything else. I like going to recitals and the instrumental area meetings because I like hearing people play, and I like band too, but I\u2019m not sure anymore if it\u2019s something I really want to continue with. Band yes, music major not really. But I\u2019ve already picked classes for next semester so I guess I\u2019m stuck.",

So done being stressed out all time. Now I\u2019m gonna pursue English and History and try to be a teacher. I already feel better knowing I\u2019m going with my strengths. I probably won\u2019t make as much as a STEM major but I\u2019ll get to focus on what I\u2019m good at and contribute to society. \nYour not alone. Hang in there!",

It has killed my passion by making it work. I'm seeking to hop into something more useful in tech maybe, but it's a little late for that. What would you switch to if you did?",
