  "text": "TL;DR: I went back to school in a desperate attempt to make up for my squandered youth, but couldn't fit in as a 48 year old man. Now I'm at a loss for anything worth living for.\n\n\n\n\nLet's wind the clocks back a few years. I'm watching a Snapchat filmed in a college dorm. A guy is in bed as two naked girls crawl onto the bed and approach him. I assume they're all students. And as I watch this I think \"What's the story behind this video? How does this actually happen in real life? This is remarkable.\" Because I've never had this happen to me when I went to school, or known anyone this has happened to when I was at school. I wonder where you even meet people who are interested in doing this. I wonder where people find the time to do this. I wonder what steps I could've/should've taken to get to do this when I was first in school. So this isn't just a special thing to get to do, this has got me wondering how this guy pulled this off. And regretting that I never got to do anything like this. Because I wouldn't even begin to know how.\n\nI'm always poring jealously over stories like these. Sometimes it's the West Virginia University nekkid party. Sometimes it's a group of girls eat each other in Tutwiler Hall. Sometimes it's the East Carolina University Hoelympics. Sometimes it's the ladies of Alpha Omicron Pi at Georgia Southern, singing about how they \"drank all their cases\" and \"sucked a lot of cock.\" Things so rare and impossible I have to wonder how they happened, and why I couldn't be there. I've seen students relax outside of student housing, play leisurely games of corn hole, but never this. Not in real life. But here it is, on Snapchat. What is the story behind these Snapchats?\n\nI lament this a lot. And Redditors usually tell me \"If you're so obsessed with sex, go have some.\" And maybe I could. But I think I've been clear, it isn't the sex itself that I'm so fascinated by. Boyfriend & girlfriend/husband & wife having sex, big deal. It's not uncommon for the romantically committed to have sex. I'm interested in these rare situations from the Snapchats I watch. So not just any sex would do. Wouldn't be the same. \n\nA more relevant perspective would be \"Didn't you say these situations were rare? Most people don't get to experience these, you can't feel sad about your social situation because of that.\" But I'm sad about my situation because not only did I not experience this when I was in college, I didn't have much of any social experience when I was in college. Didn't have sex, didn't date, didn't so much as make a friend. And furthermore, I haven't done any of these things yet. At a very hard 48 years old. I think my situation is exceptionally dire. Most people are not like me. Dire enough that I think I'm entitled in saying I didn't have a normal or proper social experience in college. \n\nTo that you might say \"Okay that's pretty sad, but you're not the only person who had an abnormal social time in college. It's unfortunate, but it happens.\" I keep a lot of Internet company with people like this. I'm on r/foreveralone and r/virgin and other places. So I have the opportunity to ask other people like me \"Why are you a friendless virgin?\" And they say things like \"I have bad social anxiety\" or \"I can't find the right person\" or \"I haven't figured myself out yet.\" Or maybe the workload was so heavy they had not a second to spare for human interaction. In short, these people couldn't help it for one reason or more. But when I was first in college I didn't have these problems. Today? Different story, I'll admit. But back when, I didn't have social anxiety. I knew what I wanted. I liked the people I saw around me. So I have no such good excuse for my squandered prime. I can't easily say I couldn't help it.\n\nAnd so, seeing all these kids living their best lives while I lived one of the worst, I begin to want to reclaim my youth somehow. Get a do-over. It would be nice/ideal to achieve what's in the Snapchats, but I figure all I really \"deserve\" is what a normal college student would get to experience. And I'll remind you, I am very 48. But I go for it anyway. I even do my research to ensure strong chances of enrolling at one of those \"Snapchatty\" colleges.\n\nThis probably sounds like an absolute fool's errand. And I knew it was crazy when I started, but I didn't truly \"know\" how crazy it was until I tried it for a semester and failed. Everyone told me 48 doesn't go into 21 no matter how hard you force it. You might suggest \"Why don't you make some friends your own age?\" Maybe I could've found some other very old students somewhere. But I have no interest in that. I'm aware of the hypocrisy of being so disgusted by people my own age, but hoping that maybe other people won't be disgusted by me. But the way I rationalized it in my mind is, I consciously reject oldness and strive for youth. Frankly I'm disgusted by my own oldness. Hence the striving for youth. As a way of doing what little I can to \"escape\" my age.  But why am I so disgusted by age? Because I want to recapture my youth. To hang out with old people, even if we're not doing \"old people things,\" wouldn't be the same. It's not just about having friends/sex, it's about making up for what I missed. And not just any friends/sex would make up for it.\n\nYou might concede \"I don't like it, but if you must keep young company you could go to a bar and chat up young people if they're willing to talk to you.\" But that wouldn't be the same either. Random young friends aren't the same as successfully navigating the social environment of a college community. Without some kind of community, I'm just a random person. But if I'm in school, I'm in a community, I'm seeing people regularly, building reputations with them and they with me. We're all \"together,\" part of a thing. Going to a bar isn't like that. I'll never see all of those same people again. Nor is going to a sleepaway music festival. We're only all \"together\" for the duration of that festival. We won't all be together again. It's not really a community. I can't build a reputation there, gossip will not spread, none of us can really matter to the group as a whole. At least not as much as school peers do, as little as that might be.\n\nTo scratch this itch, no one aspect of the college experience will do. Just having friends won't cut it. Just talking to young people won't cut it. Just being in some kind of community won't cut it. I need all of these things. But it's clear from trying and failing, I can't have this.\n\nAnd the problem with this is, it's all I want out of life. My one true passion. I have no other hobbies or interests or motivation of any kind, really. Some people suggest I find a hobby. And I'd like a new passion, I hope to find one. But a hobby picked up for the sake of a hobby isn't a passion, it's a distraction. Something to keep you going every day, but in all honesty it's just out of obligation to this \"thing\" you've committed to. Once upon a time I didn't like photography, for instance. Still don't. But I tried it anyway just for something to do. And over time I did find myself motivated to get good shots. But deep down I knew I was only doing this because I had grown accustomed to it. I \"taught\" myself to enjoy photography. As much as I could without truly liking it. If I truly loved photography, I would miss it if it was gone. So I gave up. And eventually I lost the motivation to get good shots. \n\nI believe real passion is found when you see something and want to do it even before you try it. When I saw what it was to be a photographer, I didn't want to do it. I only did it because of the insistence of people who claimed to know better. That I should try something, anything, to broaden my horizons/enrich my life. But it didn't actually make me any happier. I only did it because I trained myself to do it. You show me Snapchats of a guy getting double teamed in his dorm, I know without ever having had sex that I want to do that. Exactly that, as I see it in the Snapchat. \n\nMany tell me I need therapy. But to what end? I don't claim to be in a good place. But I think \"Seek therapy\" is a cop-out answer. When you tell me \"seek therapy,\" what do you think therapy is actually, practically, supposed to do for me? Think beyond this nebulous hope of \"It'll fix whatever's wrong with your mind.\" What is therapy actually for? First of all, it can't work unless I allow it to work. Because therapy is about helping the patient with whatever their mental health goals are. So what mental health goals do you mean for me to aim for? To not want to reclaim my youth anymore? I'd gladly forget this if I found another passion. But what people seem to want me to do is get over this regardless. Go back to photography or whatever and be happy with a photographer's life. Essentially, learn to accept my shitty life. And that's not real happiness. I don't want it. I don't want to train myself to enjoy the taste of a shit sandwich. Some say \"Therapy will help you figure things out. Get to the root of WHY you feel the way you feel about things. And potentially, target the real fulfillment you seek through other things besides being on Do It For State Snaps.\" But I already know why I feel the way I feel. I just need to find a new passion that sates what I crave. And a therapist isn't in the business of things like, say, helping me get laid. They're in the business of maybe indirectly helping me get laid by working on making me into a mentally stable individual, sure. But I'll worry about that when I have something worth getting healthy for. Without that, I'm just paying to have someone \"reinforce healthy thinking/responses.\" I don't care how \"healthy\" anyone thinks it is, I'm not gonna learn to stomach a shit sandwich. \n\nIn addition to Do It For State and all these Snapchats and so on, I think a lot about the first episode of The Sopranos. When Tony is in therapy, and he says... \n\n\"It's good to be in a thing from the ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling I might be in at the end. That the best is over.\" \n\nAnd Dr. Melfi says \"Many Americans, I think, feel this.\" And what's so infuriating about this is, the show never offers any answer to what to do about this supposedly very relatable issue. Missing out on the only years of my life really worth living, that is the essence of my grief and my mad schemes of blending in with the fellow kids. And then I hear \"Lots of people are going through this.\" And I'm like \"Really? What do they do?\" And there's just no answer for it. Seems insurmountable, but for learning to appreciate the taste of shit. And I won't do that.",
