  "text": "so i\u2019m in this group project with three other people. we had to conduct a study through survey and then get the statistics from it etc. now we have to present our project to our class\u2026. in two days. and i texted them last night and asked if they wanted to possibly get together sometime before wednesday to work on it. and guess what? NO ONE REPLIED. like yall know this shit is for a grade right? yall know we have to present in two days and WE HAVE NOTHING, RIGHT?!?!?? i swear i\u2019ve never liked group projects. it\u2019s always one person doing all the work, poor communication, and some people that have no clue what\u2019s going on but they go along with everything so they can get a good grade. this would all be getting done so much faster if we worked by ourselves. \n\n\ntl;dr: i have a group project due in two days and it seems like no one has any clue what\u2019s going on",
