  "text": "So I'm 7 weeks into class now and so far the only graded assignments are tests because they're all multiple choice/matching. This is 7 discussion boards and one exam (exam every 5 weeks) without a grade. I'm absolutely paranoid about discussion boards, especially since the first graded one is there to let you know what to improve, but with no grade I could be doing poorly and not even know. \n\nSide note; I messaged this instructor last week about a homework assignment that didn't have a correct link, so I'm assuming there's been a crazy medical emergency or she just never checks anything. \n\nI might try to go to a higher up if I can do it anonymously, I just really need to know if I'm doing something right or wrong.",

My instructor told us that he would be slow to grade our stuff because he doesn't have a TA but I'm worried because I need to know how I'm doing in that class and so far I have no grades.",
