  "text": "So I\u2019m a freshman and I just got done my first semester of college. It was finals week so I had no sleep because of studying and all that.\n\nI had a final for my 9 AM and had to be at my next class at 10 AM for my presentation.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what happened. I guess it was the lack of sleep and stress but while I was presenting it was like I forgot everything and everyone was staring at me. It felt like I couldn\u2019t even get the words out. I just froze up it felt like the created a lump in my throat. It was so awkward and uncomfortable I thought I was gonna pass out or throw up.\n\nI ended up getting through it but I could tell that everyone was judging me it was literally the worst presentation in the class.\n\nI\u2019ve never felt so stupid in my life.",

      "text": "I really wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Having seen people get nervous during presentations, the most I think is \u201cthey seem nervous.\u201d I\u2019ve definitely never thought they looked stupid at all. And usually I\u2019m much more focused on the presentation I\u2019m giving after them to even focus on what they\u2019re doing or saying anyway. Your prof should also be understanding of you being nervous. It\u2019ll be okay.",
