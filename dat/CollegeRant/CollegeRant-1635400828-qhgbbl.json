  "text": "I just started my senior year in college, but recently my mind has been tempted with the idea of taking a gap year. College is tiring and I hate it so much. The only reason why I probably won\u2019t do it is because I have fasfa and my mom helps me pay for tuition. My mom is wonderful for this, but I know she wishes I could hurry up and finish so she could stop paying. I keep telling myself, \u201cyou have about 1 year left, suck it up!\u201d. But the worst part about this is that I made a mistake and left all my hard classes for last and didn\u2019t space them out. I\u2019m so nervous for the future semesters! I\u2019m so tired and anxious, I want to cry.",
