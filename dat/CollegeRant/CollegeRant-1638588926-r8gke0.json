  "text": "I have a group project due on Tuesday and my group barely did anything. Of course me being the person that I am started working on if. I\u2019ll text in the group chat and these fuckers will say \u201cyeah I\u2019m going to get started on it\u201d but they never did. We have a major presentation on Wednesday. Presentation slides and a 10 page group paper. I\u2019m not about to do this all on my own. These fuckers. I truly believe that if you do not do your part in a group project you should get a 0.",
