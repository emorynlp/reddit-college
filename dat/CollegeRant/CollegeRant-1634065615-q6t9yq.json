  "text": "I have never been that great of a student.\n\nI was what one might say an \"exceptional student\" up until I started Middle School, but everything has pretty much gone downhill from there.\n\nThroughout High School, I failed English class three out of four times as well as a semester of Biology and AP Government.\n\nThe thing is, it's not that I was taking classes that were too difficult for me, I just couldn't seem to get myself to do the work. I could understand what we were learning, it was just hard to get started I guess?\n\nI don't really know how to explain it.\n\nBut anyway, in my last year of High School I actually earned all A's and B's on my report card for the first time since middle school. It was a major personal accomplishment of mine and I was proud of myself (even though I only had 3 classes compared to the usual 8).\n\nI ended up starting college this Semester and it has gone pretty well so far, EXCEPT for my English class. I honestly don't know what it is about English that is so difficult for me.\n\nI am already so far behind and I was considering dropping the class, but that is a whole other story.\n\nI am currently failing because I am very behind and I don't have much time to catch up.\n\nThe strange thing is that I thoroughly enjoy writing and reading but when it comes to English class, my brain just turns off. I suddenly don't understand anything or any concepts and it's just like UGH!\n\nI don't even know if this is making any sense, but I just feel incompetent and I really have to pass this class. I don't want to have an F on my transcript and I really don't want to retake the class... and not that it is about money or anything, but I did have to pay for it so I feel like if I fail then it was definitely a waste of money.\n\nI am also contemplating whether or not college is right for me?\n\nI am currently majoring in Music but I still don't know what I want to do.\n\nI know a lot of kids and even adults who are in college don't know what they want to get out of it.\n\nI feel like, even though I did personally want to further my education, the main reason I started going to college was that everyone in my life told me I should.\n\nI know that a lot of places will not hire you unless you have a college education, especially the few careers that I have my eye on currently.\n\nI have no idea what I am doing and I know it might seem like I'm making a big deal out of nothing but my English class is the main thing that is making me question everything right now. I don't know how to get my grade up and do better in English class.\n\nThe only thing getting me through is knowing that if I pass then I will never have to take English ever again.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or any comments at all, I'd love to read what you have to say.\n\nThank you\n\n:((((\n\n(P.S. I'm too lazy to re-read this and make sure it doesn't sound psychotic, so if it does, please just disregard that)",
