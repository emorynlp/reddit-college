  "text": "If classes open in the fall, everyone gets corona because there WILL be those students that thinknits a hoax, or that because /they're/ going to be okay that they dont need to wear one.\n\nIf we do online, my school wont reduce tuition and I have to start a new year through the computer. I did it last semester and I wanted to quit evey week. I applied for a full residency MFA program, and if I wanted something online, I would have applied.\n\nIf I take a year off, there's nothing really for me to do because we cant travel (BECAUSE WE NEVER CLOSED), and--\n\nNo one is hiring. I just graduated, I know I wasn't going to have a job anyway as per my degree, but this is just terrifying when STEM people cant find jobs. \n\nEveything feels like the wrong/bad choice. And I dont even feel like writing fiction. This whole thing has made me feel so small and insignificant and I'm scared for the return of \"normal\". Because it's never going to be the normal we had before, but it also makes me question evey institution we have currently in place-- it makes me go to the absurd.",

There's hardly any motivation left to do anything really because what's the use? Everything can flip in seconds for the worse in today's world.",

I absolutely dreaded online classes and would rather not do another semester completely online. If we get to go back in the fall (my college is set on us re-opening) you have to worry about catching the virus every day you decide to go up there.",

What a lot of people don\u2019t seem to understand is that, no matter who you are or what you do, you have to make a compromise. \n\nI\u2019m in school on scholarship alone. The scholarship is only good for 4 years. I emailed financial aid about extending it so I could take a semester off, and the financial aid office is fucking closed. \n\nMy choice is stay safe and stay away from corona and not be able to afford school, or go to school and be ridden with anxiety for several months straight. \n\nBecause no one is willing to compromise anything.",
