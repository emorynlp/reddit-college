  "text": "sweet mother of fucking Jesus I hate my accounting class, I just got back from my exam and realized a couple of my mistakes, and FUUUUUUCK that test was incredibly difficult. I absolutely hate how for one of the answer choices on literally all of the fucking questions it is \"none of the answers above\" which makes me second guess every calculation I do. I really do not want to take this class again next semester because this is a prereq for 2 of my last classes which means that if I fail this class like I think I did,, I am going to have 1 required class next semester which is going to be this stupid shit and I don't think I can take more of this professor. keep in mind that his class average for most of his tests is usually around the 40's to 55 area which pisses me off because he considers this \"pretty good considering last semester the class average was in the 30's.\" Also since this professor is the only one in the school I think I'm going to lose my mind if I have his crap again for the next semester. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr post-exam panic is getting me and I want to just die.",
