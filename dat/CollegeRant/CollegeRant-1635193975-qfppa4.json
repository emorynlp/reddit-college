  "text": "Me and a friend are taking a chem class together and she always waits until the last minute to do her homework (well, so do I, but it isn't as much of a problem for me) and we usually end up doing it together. I hate it though because it will be due at midnight and she'll be interrupting me every five minutes at 10:45 to explain things with her instead of going to office hours (because then she would have to do it at a reasonable time), then she'll insist that I do all of the prelab with her and we'll end up staying up until 2 am working on that. \n\nWell, we have homework due today and a prelab due tomorrow and I didn't want to deal with it so I'm working on it on my own. I've gotten six missed calls and a bunch of. I'm just sick of this.",
