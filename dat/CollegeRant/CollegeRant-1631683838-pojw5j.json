  "text": "It\u2019s been two weeks into the new semester and I\u2019m already a week behind on catching up with homework. \n\nI\u2019m taking a break right now but I\u2019m so dumb that I had spend 5 hours doing half of one math assignment. \n\nThis math class is so difficult cuz my professor is so unorganized and I don\u2019t know what to expect whenever I log into to join the zoom lectures. His lecture notes are so messy that I have to write my own notes from the textbook to understand the topics better. I know that\u2019s what I should be doing anyway but even I take bad notes and it just helps when professors have good lectures to take notes on.\n\nI don\u2019t even want to bother logging into the zoom lectures every week, it\u2019s almost useless.",
