  "text": "I currently have a 50% in my philosophy class. There are only 3 tests and each test counts for 33% of the class grade.\n\nI  only got 5/10 on the 1st test and the highest grade in the class was a  7/10. The average was 4/10. He said there is no curve and people just  need to study harder.\n\nI don't  think I am stupid. I have a 4.0 GPA and I have all A's in my more  difficult business, science, and math classes. I studied and took notes  but I swear that many of the test questions were never mentioned in  class. He doesn't give back the tests and he never responds to my emails  when I ask to review my test.\n\nI  looked my prof on ratemyprof and he is one of the most praised and  \"easy\" teachers in the department.  I am so stressed for this class. I  cannot get a F as it is required to graduate and I need my scholarship. I  don't even understand why he thinks it's ok that no one will be even  getting a B in his class.",

They just don\u2019t sink in for me.\n\nIs it possible that he assigned a bunch of readings and the test questions came from something in there ? This is how some of my harder classes are- the stuff we cover in lecture and etc rarely shows up on exams; but all of the \u201cin between\u201d stuff comes up.\n\nCan you ask for an extra credit opportunity ? \n\nSorry :( that sounds rough and would give me awful anxiety.\n\n** also, it annoys me when professors are like this. Like there is only one way to learn something- that is not how the world works. Just a bummer when you work hard and still don\u2019t do well, and they have zero flexibility. Anyway, *end rant*",

      "text": "Why is it with philosophy, sociology, physchology, etc that even though it a basic class it abnormally hard. The professors are notoriously hard to talk to. I had to take sociology at the first college I attended. I almost failed that easy class. The teachers tests were insanely hard she even said she did purposely to ensure we were paying attention. The questions would be all obsecre comments or text in the text book. \ud83d\ude44\n\nThen I had to take educational psychology I got the worst grade I got at university I have my degree from, all online. The tests we had three tries, but each question was from a small point in the text. So you had to look through the whole chapter for each question and had a very limited time. I finally figured out how to copy and paste each question so that way before I re took the test I had time to find the answers so I can answer them better. The worst part was the first assignment that I failed. I even asked about how to do it and the answer was more or less look at the assignment directions. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44 If I understood the directions I would have not asked for help. No surprise I failed that assignment and she put in her comments I should have asked how to do the assignment before I turned it in. I was like really I did ask. \ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude16\n\nDoes your college have an academic advisor? I would ask them for help with this class. Tell them exactly what has been happening. I did this for another class where the professor graded something poorly because it went against her beliefs. It was a discussion board topic. I talked to the academic advisor and told the professor I was doing so. She quickly changed her grade before the advisor could see it.\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44\n\nFinally is there tutoring option for just this class for you ? I did not have that option with online. \n\nI hope it works out for you.",

I encourage you to work your way up the ladder until someone listens to you and it\u2019ll be more effective if it\u2019s a group of you and your classmates doing this. First go to the other professors in the philosophy department and ask for general help on a specific theory or whatever. You can mention your shitty professor but remember your intentions and it\u2019s to better pass the class and get feedback. If they refuse to help, all of you go to the department chair and file a concern. By then, it will definitely get the attention of your professor.",
