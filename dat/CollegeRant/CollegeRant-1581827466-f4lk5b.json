  "title:": "honestly fuck anyone who says \"college is the best experience of your life\"",
  "text": "I know this has been posted a million times already, but I just gotta rant - what is it exactly about college that is so amazing? Having no money? Having no freedom in life? The professors who think they are WAYYY smarter than they actually are, even though most of them are complete idiots with no legit experience? The fact that 18 year olds are being told \"you have to know what you wanna do with your life right now!\" Staying up late to write an 8 page paper on some bullshit topic that doesn't interest you? Being totally confused and lost as to your life's purpose? \n\nI have to wonder if the people who say \"college is so great\" just have shitty lives or are pining for their youth. Or maybe their brain has blocked out all the shit and only kept the good memories. Or maybe they're just crazy. But regardless, college is NOT the best time of your life - it is an incredibly scary and confusing time, you don't know what's coming up next, you're trapped in classrooms all day, you're shielded from the real world, and you cant pursue things that interest you. \"But in adult world we have to pay bills\" so shut the fuck up and pay the damn bills!! How hard can it be?? At least you actually have money to pay the bills!\n\nSorry, I just had to get that out. I can't wait to be done with the education system in America. 20 wasted years of my life I'll never get back. I can't wait to get on with my life and start doing things I want to do.",

I am not broke thanks to saving for years before even attending, I get to hang out with my friends whenever, study with them, gain new knowledge, stay up however late I want. Heck, if I want to watch a movie at 1 in the morning I can. I love college. \n\nI think if you have better time management you wouldn\u2019t have to stay up late to write that paper",

So many students are being forced to take out loans for classes that are completely irrelevant and a waste of time. \n\nAs a whole, America could cut it\u2019s student loan debt in half if we eliminated two years of college, which aren\u2019t even necessary for most majors. There seems to be a perception that college students are still kids whose time can afford to be wasted. No, we are adults. Period. \n\nI know a girl who is paying her way through college and she barely has time to study because she\u2019s trying to keep her student loan debt as low as possible. She works over 30 hours a week. It is utterly ridiculous to me that she works so hard, and stresses herself out so much, all because she needs to pay for an education that is wasting her time 50% of the time. \n\nIn grad school, universities would never waste the time of these working professionals - so they simply take the relevant classes and get their degree. No one would ever consider teaching biology in law school, because we need to respect people\u2019s time and money. Why don\u2019t undergraduate students get the same respect?",

      "text": "I admit I came into college with high expectations and although it's only my second year, Im disappointed. As someone else has mentioned, the people who say 'college is the best time of your life' tend to be the partiers who don't care that much about their grades. As someone who is introverted and academically motivated, college is lackluster. Im on the newspaper for business and art but besides that, all other social clubs and involvement seems overrated at school.\n\nIn my opinion, I think everyone needs to experience life to THEIR needs and THEIR wants regardless of the stage of life (upon entering adulthood). Why should 'good times' be exclusive for college? The common misconception of college being the best time of your life stems from not having all adult responsibilities yet and still being able to do 'fun stuff' (drinking, partying, going out late). \n\nI think people also tend to forget the burdens on college kids' shoulders, too. During my parents' time, student debt could be paid with a summer break part time job. That is no longer a reality. Unless you go to community college or have your parents financially support you, student debt will literally cripple you. So, I see the financial aspect of college as debunking the whole 'college is the best time of your life' notion. \n\nNot to mention, once you do take out loans, finding a job in this economy is like a Hunger Games. Its so hard for college kids to find a decent paying job because most entry level positions (ironically) demand prior experience. Getting internships will provide experience but even the internship process is super competitive. It's even worse if the internship happens to not be paid.",

It's all theory. While my major classes will lay some foundation for when I get a real job, the Gen Eds wont help me later in life. They're throwaway classes that waste your time/effort/money. I took a Gen Ed over winter break so I could focus on my major classes during the Spring semester but man, I put in so many hours reading and writing. The Gen Ed was interesting but taking it was still a pain.",

If it\u2019s absolutely necessary, do it but review your school\u2019s transfer policy. I transferred in a lot of classes in subjects I wasn\u2019t good at or knew I didn\u2019t like. This way, I didn\u2019t have to worry too much about doing all too well in them and I could enjoy four class semesters. Also review the pass/fail option and see what classes that applies to. Apologies if you knew all this beforehand. \n\nAdditionally, why are you working 20 hours a week? If you can, you should cut down that amount. It\u2019s not impossible to do 20 hours but it\u2019s definitely going to affect you/your schoolwork in a negative way. If you absolutely need the money then continue but if you don\u2019t then try to push it down. Also, look into university jobs if you can. They require less of you and you\u2019ll be able to study while you\u2019re working. \n\nYour rant was understandable :) it\u2019s hard and I feel the same every once in a while too even though I\u2019m a fkn nerd.
