  "text": "Were still online, i know its hard for everyone, and its even more harder when you dont turn your camera on. The thing is that i have this super hard class, mathematical methods, but my proff its a complete jerk.   \nWhen he gets on the videocall he literally says this: \\*sighs\\* good morning, and people say good morning to him and he doesnt even says a word back, hes always with this tired voice, you can tell just by his voice that he hates us and that he dont wants to be on class with us. hes always in a bad mood. and its such a throw off, bc he class its boring and he makes it waaaaayyy boring. like he doesnt even tries to show a lil bit excitement for the class. like how fucking rude. i always say hello in a friendly tone even if i feel like crap. so its so rude to me that he fucking sighs to even say hello, i know that it could be a mental problem, but its a job dude, we all know (the ones that have had job) that sometimes you gotta put this mask on and try to give the best of you.\n\n  \nI know were college students and we are supposed to me mature but is it that hard to fake your voice just for the sake of making the class more friendly?? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR My Teacher its always in a bad mood and its getting to me.",

      "text": "It won\u2019t be the first time. It also probably isn\u2019t that he hates you (that\u2019s an extreme perception). The thing is that professors aren\u2019t customer service agents - they aren\u2019t paid to fake being nice or friendly. So, when you come across ones who aren\u2019t, that\u2019s just how they are. It\u2019s annoying, to be sure, but it\u2019s better to let it roll off your back.",

              "text": "I get where you\u2019re coming from, and I don\u2019t like rude people either (I make a point to be approachable and friendly when I can), but teaching isn\u2019t customer service, and being polite isn\u2019t in the job description, so they cannot be required or expected to be friendly if they don\u2019t want to. Clearly, they don\u2019t want to be there and are miserable, but there\u2019s really nothing to be done about the way they come across other than to be kind yourself and not let it get to you.",

And we are never here to \"entertain.\" But we do get joy and give joy by sharing our passion for our field and work. \n\nMy advice - give the energy you want to get from your professor.",
