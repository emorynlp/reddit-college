  "text": "My chem professor is horrible. We have never had a test average above 56%, I\u2019m in a group chat with more than half my classmates and none of us have a grade above 80% regardless of how hard we work,our tests are full of questions we never even went over in class, he is constantly posting rude things about how none of us deserve a good grade in his class, he\u2019s the type who brags about how no one passes his class, he refused to let a girl who had to go into emergency surgery have extra time to finish an assignment, he didn\u2019t give me extra time to get assignments done when I was in the hospital unable to physically do them, when someone asks a question about the material he always responds in a rude way and acts as if we\u2019re insulting him, he doesn\u2019t grade us fairly on labs, the list goes on and on. \n\nI just wanted to share this because his class has really messed with my classmates and my mental health and I really needed to get this off of my head. For once in my life I\u2019m glad it\u2019s finals week because that means I don\u2019t need to be in his class anymore.",
