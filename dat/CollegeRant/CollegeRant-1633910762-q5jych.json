  "text": "In my first year of college, I took a pretty basic, zero-level math class. It was part in person and part online. The professor was really good at explaining things, and I actually got something out of the class. I failed the course (mostly because I went through high school online and had zero study skills), and now I'm retaking it again. This time, I decided to take it online, because hey, I already did this stuff, so it should be easy, right? Nope!\n\nThis online course is one of those where the prof. just says \"do problems x through y from the textbook\" and does no actual teaching. There are some \"lecture notes,\" which is weird because there are no lectures. Worse yet, the textbook problems aren't actually graded. It's just assumed that you'll do them and somehow figure it out from the limited, out-of-context information the textbook gives you, and then you'll be ready for each of the seven assignments that actually get graded.",

I have my fair share of terrible professors in fully online classes, but I got through it with my strong study skills. Does any studying techniques work or are you currently practicing any?",
