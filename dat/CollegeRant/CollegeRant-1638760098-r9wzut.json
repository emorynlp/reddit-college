  "text": "I just want to smack myself upside the head. I\u2019m such an idiot. Just flat-out incompetent. For most of the semester, I put my Calc I assignments on the back burner because I was extremely sick. Whether it was walking pneumonia or a bacterial sinus infection or what, it made me feel like absolute garbage to the point where I was unable to leave my dorm for weeks. I\u2019d only leave to eat or maybe attend a class (if I felt up to it) but for the most part, I sulked under the covers of my bed. As a result, I missed a lot of my calculus classes. Like, a LOT. I emailed my professor several times, apologizing profusely for my lack of attendance and he didn\u2019t seem too concerned about it. Eventually, I was able to see a doctor after two months of cold/flu-like symptoms and got a prescription for augmentin. What a blessing it was too, because I felt like a brand new person after taking it. \nAfter I snapped back to reality, I realized that my grades were a shit show from missing classes and not completing my assignments. I\u2019ve been dedicated to bringing my grades since Thanksgiving break, confined myself to my room only to assignments. I don\u2019t leave to see friends or even eat sometimes. I skip showering. My room is a fucking hazardous wasteland. But no matter what I do, I just can\u2019t win. My grades are decent, hanging on to As and Bs by a thread. It\u2019s just calculus that I\u2019m failing.  I\u2019m partially frustrated with my professor for not telling me that I have a D/F (I only found out by emailing him\u2026I\u2019ve been seeing him consistently everyday for either office hours or class for the past two weeks), even though he told me during midterms I was \u201con the road to get an A\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have a canvas page or anywhere to access material. I went to a tutor to receive help and she told me she\u2019s been trying to contact him since the start of the semester. Most of the students who are requesting tutoring are coming from his class. At this point at the semester, it\u2019s still possible to bring my grade to a B if I\u2019m lucky. I just don\u2019t know if I have it in me. And that\u2019s where my other feelings of frustration are directed at\u2014 myself. If I were truly smart, maybe I could buckle down and drive these concepts into my brain. But I\u2019m so tired and burnt out\u2026as long as I can pass I\u2019ll be happy. \nI think my best option would be try to at least pass and then take a summer calculus class. Passing doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee that I\u2019ll understand the material unfortunately, so it\u2019s be better for me to set time aside in order to truly focus on it. \nBut I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m probably just victimizing myself and afraid to deal with the consequences of my own mishaps.\nAny advice would be highly appreciated. \n\nTL;DR - There\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll fail a course I need for my major (physics major) and now I must figure out how to make the best of my situation.",

      "text": "I would try to retake the class. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of either, you were not feeling physically well this time around and that has had an impact. It\u2019s better to really understand the material (especially because it\u2019s calc and you\u2019re a physics major.) I am happy to hear your other classes are doing well though! I hope you are feeling better!",
