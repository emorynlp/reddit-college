  "text": "I know that this isn't the professors fault at all, but why do tests always have to be around the same time. I have an Italian exam On Thursday and a Mineralogy exam on Friday, after weeks of barely anything. Since they are both so memorization heavy, I'm just trying not to fail either of them. At least they are both only worth 15% of the final grade.",
