  "text": "&#x200B;\n\n[finally someone said it. ya'll i get it man people they're in different places right now. and i know it's better to just do and to adjust but seriously, it's so much better to have people you can relate to when it comes to this. it sucks cause even when you acknowledge this the situation doesn't automatically get better. but it helps in a way, you know you're not alone. and I've never felt so alone, ironically right now in spite of living with my family. idk i just don't like this. i know it's not an excuse. i don't want to make excuses all i know is at this point to make it i have to give my soul up or smthn to make it this semester. this whole set up the pacing it's horrible. i wanna throw up. ](https://preview.redd.it/niugss975av51.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=41af5996f1771ef45852af3b836c81fa90f16500)",

Well not at all but very little and I don't feel like doing the work. They just make you do async work and  I feel like I'm not really learning anything rather than just submitting work for the sake of it.",
