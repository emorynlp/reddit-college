  "text": "I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I finished this semester with all A's but I still feel horribly inadequate. I love my professors, I loved my classes, and I honestly love my classmates. But, I still can't help but feel like I'm a failure. \n\nI know it sounds cliche as hell, but sometimes I literally feel my mom's voice in the back of my head asking me why I didn't do better. Or telling me I should be in harder or more classes since the ones I am in are too easy if I'm getting all A's. \n\nIs anyone else feeling this way? Honestly I think grades are a sham anyways, but I still put so much importance onto them I make myself sick. I have seen friends who are way smarter then me get C's or D's, but if I ever got lower than an A I'd actually hurt myself. Sorry for the dark post. \n\nTo end on a lighter note. And this is mostly for me but: You are not alone, you are loved and deserve to feel good about yourself. You have struggled and will continue to struggle, that is okay, take it easy on yourself. I love you, and you should love yourself, and you eventually will.",

Mental illness doesn't care about the real world. So all I was looking for was some solidarity. \n\nI'm not really complaining about something in specific, more so looking for other people who also are feeling this extreme anxiety.",

      "text": "This could be a case of gifted kid burnout. You think you need to be ahead of where you are and that you are never at the point you should be. I get that. I always feel like I should have taken another class and gone over 20 credits somehow. You are doing good and I know hearing that won't change your mind. I think it's just important to know that you will never satisfy that hunger for feeling that you have done enough. No matter what you do, you will still feel it. Don't let the feeling overload plans overwhelm you. Cutting back on classes might actually help. Give yourself less to work on so that your brain can catch up knowing that you are going to be okay if you don't overload yourself. Good luck :)",
