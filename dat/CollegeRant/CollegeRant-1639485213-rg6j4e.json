  "text": "I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I finished this semester with all A's but I still feel horribly inadequate. I love my professors, I loved my classes, and I honestly love my classmates. But, I still can't help but feel like I'm a failure. \n\nI know it sounds cliche as hell, but sometimes I literally feel my mom's voice in the back of my head asking me why I didn't do better. Or telling me I should be in harder or more classes since the ones I am in are too easy if I'm getting all A's. \n\nIs anyone else feeling this way? Honestly I think grades are a sham anyways, but I still put so much importance onto them I make myself sick. I have seen friends who are way smarter then me get C's or D's, but if I ever got lower than an A I'd actually hurt myself. Sorry for the dark post. \n\nTo end on a lighter note. And this is mostly for me but: You are not alone, you are loved and deserve to feel good about yourself. You have struggled and will continue to struggle, that is okay, take it easy on yourself. I love you, and you should love yourself, and you eventually will.",
