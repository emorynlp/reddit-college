  "text": "In high school I was usually an B+/A- student but now in college I\u2019m currently a D/C- student. These are a few examples what\u2019s happened this semester.\n\nIn my recent essay the only issue my professor said he had was my thesis needed to be a big stronger. I got a 70 on it. \n\nIn my math tests one question is worth 15% of it (usually with 20 questions in total). Because of this I ended up starting my final with an 85 and finished it with a 68.\n\nIn public speaking for one speech my professor said my performance was great but I needed to include more of the sources I used and other small things. I ended up with an 80 (the highest was a 90 and the average was ~70).\n\nIt\u2019s just so infuriating how one simple mistake can cost me so many points.",

Missing some of those key points in your work is a big deal and you need to make sure you take the time to fully work out each of the professor\u2019s points being made. \n\nExpectations should be much higher than grade school. You are in a different level of learning. Sadly many of my students never realize that.",
