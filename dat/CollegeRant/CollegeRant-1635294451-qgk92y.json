  "text": "I started a new antidepressant 2 weeks ago I think its backfiring. The intro statistics project is due November 1st at midnight. I chose a data set then realized and it wasnt gonna work and I don't even know what the f*** I'm doing so im back to square 1. Time is ticking but my body is so tired I don't even know why because I sleep all day but it feels like I'm glued to my bed and I just keep crying I feel like I don't even know why I exist. I can't remember the last time I left the house I haven't seen anybody besides my boyfriend in so long. I don't want to fail I haven't gotten anything less than a b in college so far the pressure is just so much.",
