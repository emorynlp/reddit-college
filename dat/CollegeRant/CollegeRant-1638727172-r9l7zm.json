  "text": "I'm tired of their condescending comments, their arbitrary grading metrics, snobbish attitudes, and their terrible teaching ability. Why is it every time I take a general education class, I always run into these issues? I have no issues with my major course professors, but it seems like whenever I encounter a liberal arts professor there's a strong chance it's going to be an uphill battle with pretentiousness and their inability to lead a classroom discussion. I feel like many of them were trust fund babies in college who majored in something easy and are now upset because the money ran dry and they don't make enough anymore.",

      "text": "I'm a \"liberal arts\" professor. I have certainly had many occasions to ruminate upon the wisdom of my choices, but I was in no way a trust fund kid, nor was my course of study particularly easy. I followed the advice that every gen-xer heard from every adult in their life when they were young: do what you are passionate about. Study what you are good at. Student loans are an investment. I followed that advice and have been trying to make the best of it ever since. \nMy experience teaching gen ed classes is that many students don't want to be there, are not open to what is being taught, and do not see themselves as having room to improve in any way that I can help them with. My advice to you is the same as it is to them. You'll get out of this experience what you put into it. If you decide to find value in this class, you will. \nI do my part to make the class useful and interesting for them, but I can never catch all of them. Some come around eventually. Others are just firmly decided that they are too good for this and my class is only an obstacle on their path to glory. Perhaps you are among the latter.",
