              "text": "Gah damn, a community prof getting laid? That's a first. No, really, all my profs that I had back when I was going to community were in their early 70s and had grandkids, not a single one of them was a Professor Chad lmao. But also, eh, tbh I'm not really sure what to say because I'm kinda in the same boat in terms of relationships. \n\nAs for having no fucking clue, welcome to adulthood. There's good news and bad news. Bad news is that you have no fucking idea what you're doing, the good news is this is the perfect time to figure that out. Before getting my goals into place, I had no clue what I wanted to do with myself in terms of career, life goals, etc. So I started small, and explored what interests I have. For example, I love technology, so I started learning about all the latest gadgets that are coming out and how they're built. One thing led to another, and then I wanted to be an engineer. \n\nYou see, what you must realize is that being in the state where you have no idea what to do is actually the perfect state to be in, and lemme explain why. See, you're not tied to any one goal at the moment, you're not settled into one area to work in, or one particular topic that interests you. You're still trying to figure that out, so explore everything! Like electronics? Go out and buy a book on how they're built and programmed. What about video games? Go learn about them. All of this is done so that you can find the little niche area that you really love.",
