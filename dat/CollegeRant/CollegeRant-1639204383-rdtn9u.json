  "text": "I\u2019m so annoyed by him. I\u2019ve spent an entire semester with him so far and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna do more. \n\nI go to a school where they accommodate for people with dyslexia, ADHD and other learning disabilities. \n\nI have ADHD. Somehow though, I got put with a kid who has Autism, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder. \n\nThe fact that I was given this still confuses me to this day. I\u2019ve been trying to get out for the longest time but every time I try, the process changes and I have to start over. All he does is talk to himself until 4 in the morning, chug my water, and sleep for 18 hours of the day. He doesn\u2019t go to class and stays in the room every second of the day unless its to go to the bathroom or to get food. \n\nI literally applied to be an RA just so I could get my own room and get away from this kid. He\u2019s so weird and is so hard to live with. I have no idea how he \nstill goes here. It makes no sense to how because he never does work. Someone help me. What do I do in this situation?",

      "text": "honestly, it all depends on your comfort level. you can confront him about boundaries, & maybe just propose a system where both of you get alone time in the dorm (not just him). or, you can go another route, which is complaining to your ra or dorm coordinator & getting them to deal with housing for you.",
