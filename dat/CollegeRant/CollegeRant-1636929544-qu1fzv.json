  "text": "The class exam average is in the 20s and although there is a curve, the curve works so that a good portion of the class is going to fail. The exams are the only thing that constitutes our grade. I honestly don't know what I'm learning in the class -- I'd think I understand the concepts, but then I see the exam questions and they might as well be rocket science.\n\nI really don't understand professors who deliberately make exams so difficult to the point even the graduate TA does not understand what is going on when we ask them questions on some of the materials. The professor even warned us to essentially be prepared to fail the class - I paid tuition money to learn, not for the professor to show off their research knowledge through exam questions and to fail. I have other classes to worry about too. This class is a requirement for my major and from what I know, it's not even that important for the industry I'm heading into (unless I decide to dedicate my life to do research in this field - which I'm not).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to pass the class. My next exam is in three days. I'm so exhausted.",
