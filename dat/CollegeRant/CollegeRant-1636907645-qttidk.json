  "text": "I'm not saying anything everyone else hasn't said already but sometimes it really gets to me. I miss making friends and meeting people I look forward to seeing every week. I miss staying after class to talk to the professors about their subject and their backgrounds. I miss being able to meet people naturally instead of awkwardly dm'ing them.",
