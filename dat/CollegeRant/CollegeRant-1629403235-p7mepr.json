  "title:": "It pisses me off that my school hasn\u2019t enforced a mask mandate.",
  "text": "I don\u2019t understand the logic. Cases are peaking once again, but my school won\u2019t enforce anything. They \u201cstrongly encourage\u201d us to wear masks and get vaccinated but they can\u2019t outright enforce anything because of the snowflakes that will petition and cause an uproar over their \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d or whatever bullshit they use to defend their reasoning behind not wearing masks. And I get it. It\u2019s hard to fukin breathe sometimes. BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THAT BRO IT CALLED A MASK FILLER ITS ON AMAZON. Like how can you be so thick headed and selfish. They complain about how they just want to have a normal college experience but we\u2019re not gonna have a college experience period if you can\u2019t protect yourself and others by simply wearing a piece of fabric on your damn face that will lessen the chance of you getting infected and possibly infecting others. Why don\u2019t these people understand that if you don\u2019t protect yourself you will get sick and then you will infect others and the school is fucking shut down AGAIN? There is no fucking conspiracy. It\u2019s as simple as do you want to live or do you want to catch some awful virus which will most likely infect your friends and family who could die. It\u2019s not about politics and your self expression, it\u2019s about staying healthy long enough to graduate. I just don\u2019t get. And I know damn well my school would have enforced a mandate by now if it weren\u2019t for the uproar it would cause. They don\u2019t wanna hurt anybody\u2019s feelings or piss off our dumbass governor who doesn\u2019t give a shit. But it is so not fair for other people to have to live in danger of infecting others because their dumbass classmates won\u2019t mask up. They are ruining everything. I don\u2019t feel safe anymore and that pisses me off because I pay these people so much money and they can\u2019t even protect me from my dumbass peers who think they\u2019re fighting the fucking civil war and making some kind of point by not wearing mask. This shit honestly makes my blood boil. Sorry this is long and fucking whiny as hell but I need a place to speak my mind about this. I\u2019d get harassed if I said anything supportive of masks in the kind of state I live in the college I go to. It\u2019s like the fucking culture here.",

Literally step on to my campus and it\u2019s like COVID never happened. It\u2019s really bad.

And from Houston Methodists law suit there is strong evidence that no legal proceedings would come about, but if you read the Harvard article they run the risk of legal complications. \n\nCorrect Ethics are not relative, but so are a lot of other things and we still establish moral guidelines based on the concept of improving/upholding individual autonomy.  So, basing my ethical argument on upholding autonomy I do in my own subjective opinion is submissible.",

Just because I don\u2019t agree with vaccine mandates does not mean I don\u2019t take the virus seriously.  I am vaccinated and mask-up wherever I am required to, but gaining natural antibodies to a virus is a lot better than a clinic drafted makeup of the virus.   We can implement all these safety precautions, but the virus will still mutate and charge on.  Constantly suppressing our body from bacteria is only going to compound the health issues in the future.",

Unfortunately, it is a global issue and there are some places where people don\u2019t have access to vaccines, and that will be an additional source of mutation. But we also have those that just refuse modern medicine/science as a source of mutation and spread in developed countries.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can objectively state that naturally acquired immunity is better than vaccine acquired immunity. I also can\u2019t objectively state the opposite. I think it is an unknown. The benefit of vaccine acquired immunity, assuming all immunity is equal, is that you can avoid being sick, which is a big deal for some, and spreading the virus.\n\nBacterial exposure is another topic, but a very important one. I do think we will have more issues with highly antibiotic resistant bacteria in the future, mostly due to overuse and miss-use of antibiotics. I have also heard some discussion on how overly sterile environments may weaken our response to bacteria we later encounter. But I don\u2019t think something like a COVID vaccine is going to have the same effect. The vaccine works because we are exposed to some aspect of the virus and our immune system does its job. It isn\u2019t an immune system suppression, if anything it is a stimulation. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard about any issues of weakening immune responses from vaccines.",
