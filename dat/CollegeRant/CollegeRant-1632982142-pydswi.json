              "text": "The problem is after covid it got pretty oversaturated so it's harder to make money now. You can start here on reddit, kik, discord, Twitter and Instagram, then once you build a following to go on onlyfans. You also need to be able to get a decent pedicure or do your nails for this. Also maybe have some nice heels and socks as well. \n\nPost some pics and they'll ask you for your prices. Make a cashapp, venmo (I don't recc PayPal bc you need to use ur real name).\n\nI made like an extra 300$ doing this but I stopped. It's not entirely easy money. If you're not famous/don't want to show your face it's a little harder. Also scammers are everywhere so be careful if you decide to start.",
