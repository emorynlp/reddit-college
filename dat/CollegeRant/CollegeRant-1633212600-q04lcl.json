  "text": "Basically lol. I just never feel good enough, even when I put in effort it\u2019s still not enough. Compared to my sis she doesn\u2019t even try yet she get straight As and everybody and their mamas love her. Me, effort or no effort I still borderline pass, everyone hates me or thinks I\u2019m a bitch though they never even spoken a word to me before. I literally had people come up and tell me so and so hates me because I have a rbf. I\u2019m sorry my muscles just rest a certain way tf do u want me to do about it? Anyway I\u2019m genuinely used to being alone. I\u2019ve always been anyway. And yes I\u2019m ALONE ALONE not the mf that somehow can cry to their friends for not having friends. It\u2019s why I hate physical class because it\u2019s always so awkward lol like damn I\u2019m in this school for years yet I can\u2019t even find someone to sit with?\ud83d\ude02 I had people to talk to but no actual friends. I started the first ever sem with 0 friends in class and I\u2019m ending my last sem with 0 friends in class I mean it is what it is man I have other things to cry about aka my unknown future \n\n\nMy life has been SO bad. It\u2019s honestly always been, I feel cursed. The whole reaching adulthood is stressing me so much. Idk wtf I\u2019m gonna do and people are starting to ask me about my future and I just say I don\u2019t know and they\u2019re like \u201chow\ud83d\ude1f\u201d how bout fuck u too leave me alone I\u2019m just as stressed lmao. I don\u2019t intend to do something within my course cuz I don\u2019t like my course no more. I just wanna die honestly like this is all too much for me I didn\u2019t ask for this. I\u2019m so stressed about my future and I\u2019m also stressed about my current sem cuz I\u2019m pretty sure I lost like 40% of my grade just cuz I skipped 3 classes crazy right anyway I\u2019m also behind class and I\u2019m gonna go back next week I think I guess and uh\n\n\n1. I have no idea what going on in class  \n\n\n2. Lecturers probably gonna question me in front of everyone\n\n\n3. I probably will sit on somebody\u2019s unassigned assigned seat cuz as said, I haven\u2019t attended class :) in fact multiple people\u2019s unassigned assigned seat since it\u2019s multiple classes I skipped \n\n\n\nI feel like I went through this so many times I\u2019m used to it yet sick of it. It\u2019s just my life man I don\u2019t even know why I continue living it it\u2019s literally the same shit everyday . I wake up, eat dread for breakfast, stressed and incredibly sad throughout the day, vent, maybe shed a few tears and sleep feeling stressed. Terrible quality of life if I say so myself",

      "text": "You did a good job at giving a concise venting session. Have you thought about email the professor and stating that your mental health has been bad and that you are planning to school this week?  This might go along way. Makes sure to show up early for class and ask classmates what seats is open. You can do this. Teachers are more inclined to show patience and care because of Covid",
