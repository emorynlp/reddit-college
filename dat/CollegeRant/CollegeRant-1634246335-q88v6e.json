  "title:": "Just spoke to coordinator of department about my terrible professor. Now what?",
  "text": "Bulletpoints for my issues with this professor \n\n**general disorganization/ poor communication**\n\nLectures are all over the place, don't match power point, don't match paper handout \n\nGoes off on irrelevant tangents mid lecture\n\nTakes way too long to respond to emails. Missed one class due to covid scare and took me over a week to get missing handout\n\n**unprofessional**\n\nCusses during class/too informal\n\nHas joked about drug use and suicide\n\nMade sexist comment in reference to a fertility ritual\n\nSO. Now my conundrum. I can either bite the bullet and take finish this class that I hate and am not learning in OR withdraw and have to take it again with no refund.  I have a C currently. If I tank the next test I will fail the class, if I withdraw it won't affect my GPA. What would you guys do?\n\n\nTL;DR  should I stay in a class I might fail or withdraw and have to retake it",

      "text": "It just sounds like he's a man with a personality. It doesn't seem like he's done anything wrong. Cussing and joking is pretty much the norm for profs. And are you sure the irrelevant tangents are actually irrelevant? Sometimes good teachers throw interesting and surprising discoveries at a class.\n\nAnd sometimes lectures deviate from Power points because he wants to be free to follow thoughts and improvise. Try to see this as a bonus.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you've got much of a case here. I'm sure exactly nothing will happen based on your complaint.\n\nAnd did you talk to him before you \"reported him\"?",

          "text": "Yeah I get that some people like to cuss and be more colloquial with their students it's just not a quality that I appreciate in a professor. I have to be professional as a student by being attentive, not disruptive, respectful etc so I expect the same from my teachers.\n\nJoking about suicide and drugs is not funny to me, and the advisor I spoke with didn't think it was acceptable either.  The tangents are not always irrelevant,  sometimes they tie back into the lesson so I'll concede there. As far as the power points I'm just used to more thorough slides, this man puts a date, or a name without any information. It's as if the PowerPoint is just for him to know his talking points.\n\nThe advisor I spoke with took this seriously and assured my anonymity because of course if I stay I don't want my life to become hell. Now that I've slept on it I've come to the conclusion that he's just not my teaching style.",

Being reported can have serious consequences in a person's life; he could lose his job, get denied a raise, get demoted, all because you didn't like his sense of humor or the way he uses PowerPoint. \n\nProfessors get called \"boring\" more than anything else, so they take risks to make things more relaxed and engaging. But this teacher is going to punished for that risk.\n\nMaybe next time sleep on it BEFORE you put someone's livelihood in jeopardy.",

I will forgive all those things if he changes his behavior but even if he does  I still don't like his lack of thoroughness and organization. We deserve better.",

If he truly was making deeply upsetting and offensive \"jokes\" and you (understandably) didn't feel comfortable talking to him about it directly, then, yes, reporting him seems totally appropriate. It's just not how you made it sound in your last message. Apologies for any misunderstanding.",

Because in my experiences, sometimes it\u2019s better to see an F or a D versus a withdraw. But also know that I was a transfer student from community college so that was the standard for me.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I\u2019d stick it out. As bad as it sounds, this is not going to be the last time you see a professor like this. And depending if their tenure faculty (basically staff with a lot of clout and can get away with anything because they\u2019re under contract) then it\u2019s kind of a lost cause to go to the department chair.\n\nIf it helps, know you only got a couple more weeks with this professor and you never have to see them ever again.",
