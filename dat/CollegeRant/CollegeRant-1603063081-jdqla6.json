      "text": "You're definitely not alone. I took almost a decade off of college and returned in January of 2019. The pandemic has really made me question if it's worth it to just get a piece of paper. Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic because I feel as if I'm behind my peers in some ways, but in others I'm miles ahead in terms of experience levels. Just keep your chin up, we'll all get through this together.",

      "text": "You're not alone. I always I feel like I'm an outsider watching to see how long I can survive before I inevitably drop dead. Definitely feel you with being unable to imagine a future. Can't imagine myself as an \"adult.\" They always tell you to sacrifice the present so you can enjoy the future. Study hard so you can go to college. Study hard for a job. So you end up always sacrificing the present as the future gets further and further away from you, and at the same time you start to forget everything that ever made you feel alive. I feel like I'm already at the end of my life, regretting never having made any meaningful connections with anyone and wasting all my time on something futile instead of exploring and doing any good in the world. I'd like to end this on a positive note, but I can't think of anything to say. I know that when I posted on here, I was more just looking for a sign that there were people out there feeling the same, not looking for people to offer their ideas for solutions or positivity. So I'll just say I'm with you on this.",

      "text": "You're not alone. Most of us in college right now feel the exact same way. I don't know your situation, but maybe I can share mine to give you some perspective.\n\nI'm currently in my mid-thirties going back to college for a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering. I have two kids and I work full-time. I feel like my life is almost a decade behind schedule because I did not finish college straight out of high school. All of the stress I felt when I was in college the first time feels significantly less than the stress I feel now as a thirty-something trying to balance kids and school and work. I really wish I would have done this years ago.\n\nIf you are feeling burnt out and your mental health is at risk, then seek help. Reduce your stress by making smart choices and using wise time-management. Always remember, there is no race to get the degree. Take your time and relax as much as your situation will allow.",
