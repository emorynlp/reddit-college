  "text": "Seriously, I feel like offing myself every time a test comes up and every morning I have to wake up for class. I hate both of my classes. I wish I never took them, I'm switching my major to something undetermined and taking a gap year as of now so I don't even really need to take them. I hate them so so much. I want so bad to withdrawal from them but I already paid for them with my job. ($1,200)\n\nI literally can't bring myself to do the work. My brain feels like it's shutting down whenever I try. I'm so burnt out of taking hard science classes with labs. my GPA is getting lower and lower. I know I get bad grades because I'm suicidal, spend my time procrastinating because of ADHD , and because I feel no satisfaction from doing it, and doing other things that don't make me want to literally die.\n\n\"That's just how being an adult is-\" no mom and dad. I literally want to off myself every day because of college. I don't think that's normal. I hate everything about my life. I have no motivation to do any of these classes. I already paid for all of them is the worst part, I'll probably end up with two D's.\n\nTL;DR college is making me suicidal",

      "text": "Being enrolled and studying in an educational institution itself triggers my PTSD. It's not just bullying which is part of the cause, I'm not even sure sometimes if it is at all because it seems more like being forced to go to school regardless of whatever I'm experiencing is the cause and remembering being bullied became part of the effects as a consequence of having no escape, but there's also the dealing with the assignments and the extra crap and back when I was younger I had to deal with them all in a lesser healthier and stable life. I had a pretty complicated life. Although I got more desensitised to it, I still feel the effects of my PTSD.",
