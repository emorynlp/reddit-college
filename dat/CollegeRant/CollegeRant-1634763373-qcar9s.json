  "text": "I have an upcoming test next Tuesday for my finite math class and I've been studying and practicing for days now. I feel more confidant about the test but all of the nonstop practicings has got me feeling burnt out. I make sure to take breaks to not overload my brain with so much information but there comes a point where I feel exhausted and can't look at the material anymore :/ any tips to help?",

      "text": "If you're studying at least days before test time (its Thursday where I'm at), I think you should not worry too much. What's worse is cramming the night before the test. You are studying early, which is good. Keep going and take breaks every now and then. Trust me the burnout will go away do not worry and allow yourself to have sleep. Please sleep the night before the test (I had a talented classmate that studied nonstop for days straight and sadly fell asleep on an entire exam... because she didn't sleep at all). As long you did your best, that's what matters.",
