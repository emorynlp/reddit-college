  "text": "When I was in middle school, I was offered a merit scholarship to a prestigious high school called Boston University Academy due to my excellent grades and top standardized test scores. The high school is operated by Boston University (ranked #42 in the U.S). The rule was that anybody in BUA who graduated with a 3.0 or above is guaranteed admission to BU. I barely made the cut after busting my ass off, lol. Funny thing is, I was valedictorian of my middle school. It was hard transitioning from being the #1 student in middle school to being an average student in high school. I already graduated from BU but just wanted to share my story.",
