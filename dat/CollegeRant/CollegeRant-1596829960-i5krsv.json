  "title:": "University changes on-campus policy 2 weeks before classes start",
  "text": "This is a short rant about how my university has been flip flopping on us for months now. For context, in May we received an email from the President stating that the Summer 2020 & Fall 2020 semesters will be online, remote learning. Cool, right? \n\nWell, then in July we get another email, this time telling us that all classes will have mandatory in person instruction with strict social distancing in place. Students will have assigned seating 6 feet apart from each other, everyone must wear masks, hallways will have new walking policies indicating which side we must walk on, classes will only have 20 students in them at a time, and we all must get COVID tested before returning to campus. Out-of-state and international students were left in the dust and essentially were told \u201cfigure it out\u201d by our President.\n\nPretty much everyone hated this and most of my in-state friends transferred to our local community college that is tuition free right now. Today, *two weeks before classes start,* our President has emailed us saying it\u2019s back to remote learning for the foreseeable future. \n\nI have a surgery scheduled on September 17 and have been told by my surgeon to quarantine until then and for 4 weeks after during my recover my period, this would essentially be the entire semester. So, for the last 3 weeks I\u2019ve been drowning in disability paperwork that I thought I needed to file for my university so I didn\u2019t have to come to class but remain a student remotely. But now it\u2019s suddenly back to remote learning. I wasted so much time trying to figure this shit out and it was all for nothing.",
