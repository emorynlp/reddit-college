  "text": "So I recently made a post on the college subreddit about how I got a bad grade in one of my classes and whether I should keep it or not, but I just found out that this grade will keep me from graduating this month. I thought a D in this class was a passing grade, but it turns out it isn\u2019t. I asked whether I could still participate in commencement anyways since it\u2019s just one class, but nope, I\u2019m not allowed. And the class isn\u2019t offered in the summer, so I\u2019ll have to retake it in the fall. It\u2019s hard to describe the feelings I\u2019m experiencing right now, but after getting a call that you won\u2019t graduate after you\u2019ve already bought all the apparel for it and your parents have told everyone including the neighbor\u2019s dog, you can probably imagine that I\u2019m not too great at the moment.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to ask or why I\u2019m even posting this. I guess I just need a place to vent. I honestly feel like crawling inside a hole and never coming out. I was doing fine before this pandemic. I really was. Honestly, taking a leap year probably would\u2019ve been better for me. At least then I would be delaying my graduation on my own terms and I wouldn\u2019t have a terrible grade. Anyways, I\u2019m just rambling now so I\u2019ll stop. Thanks for reading I guess.",

      "text": "Best case scenario was that you passed the class and graduated this semester. Worst case scenario is that your graduation has been delayed a semester.  You are now delayed but the important thing is that you tried. It could have easily gone the other way. Knowing that there are social pressures to graduate do play into it but in the grand scheme of things, no one minds that you will graduate a semester later than planned. The important thing is that you keep going and pass that last class. Perhaps this is a chance to land a job while still school. Fall recruiting is especially heavy in the beginning of the semester. Keep your head up and keep pushing on because you are almost there. The summer and fall semester will go quick. Enjoy your summer and don\u2019t be to hard on yourself. Be proud of how close you have gotten to graduating. You\u2019ll still be a 2021 graduate. You\u2019re nearly there. Good luck.",
