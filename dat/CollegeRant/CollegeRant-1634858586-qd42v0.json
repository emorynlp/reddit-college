  "title:": "Im emotionally attached to my family and a fear of letting them go",
  "text": "This isn\u2019t my first time leaving for college and living alone in another country, but to be honest I\u2019m tired of going through the same struggle of bawling my eyes out when I leave my parents home for college. For me it\u2019s just everything becomes so hard when I live alone, but when I\u2019m around my family, I feel safe for some reason and that I\u2019m happy. I wasn\u2019t able to see my parents for 7 months due to many factors, which some include my uni finish later than usual, and the airline restrictions in the country my family lives in. This was the most mentally exhausted I\u2019ve ever felt in my entire life, my days were always the same and technically this was the worst summer break I\u2019ve ever spent. Now that I\u2019m around them and I\u2019m leaving again in a week bc I don\u2019t want to risk failing due to being absent, I\u2019m not feeling like I\u2019m ready to leave, nor am I ready to bawl my eyes out on my way to the airport. I just need some tips on how to deal with this and get over my emotions",

I have a couple of friends in uni but it makes no difference for me I still feel lonely without my family being around.",

I think I'd just recommend trying to find something to immerse yourself in that will distract you from your loneliness. Sorry if this advice isn't very helpful. I'm sure you will be able to get through it though!",
