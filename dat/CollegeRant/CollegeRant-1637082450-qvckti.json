      "text": "You\u2019re in the wrong mindset. \u201cI\u2019m already not good at math\u201d. That is not true and I had that mindset for 15years+ . I grew up essentially getting C- in every math class I ever took up until college. I was convinced that I was \u201cbad at math\u201d because of that I looked at other major options and then one day I told myself I\u2019m going to give it my all and see what happens because I want to try engineering, even if I have to start at the lowest math class in college. \n\nSo my first semester of math was rough, but after studying for hours and hours, doing nothing but studying I did it, I got an A in my first math class. After that i did trig, I had a 120% at one point due to extra credit and scored one of the highest in the class.\n\nOver the summer I took calc1 this was a summer class so it was faster and I was also working 24hrs+ a week so it was hard. I got a C but I feel like i could\u2019ve gotten a B if I focused more on it but I\u2019m not too worried. Why you may ask?\n\nBecause in calculus 2 (regarded as one of the hardest calculus classes) I have a 98.5% and I got 100% on the integral exam which was highest in the class to my knowledge. I am now pursing a degree in engineering something I would\u2019ve never thought of doing because I was \u201cbad at math\u201d in high school and growing up.\n\nSo the moral of this is you\u2019re not bad at math. You just have to practice it and do a more review. Find what you\u2019re bad at (even if it\u2019s stuff in the past) and relearn it and do practice problems. If you get stuck even on older material I\u2019m sure your professor will help you. The initial hump will be rough for you as is with everyone but if you dedicate time and reach out to friends and the professor (office hours) for help you can succeed. Never give up!",

Once I got good at integration I enjoyed it sm I did them for fun. So what yeah I recommend going back and dissecting what you\u2019re struggling with in your problems. I have very little knowledge in stats so my advice could be useless to you but either way I\u2019m glad I can be some help to you. Best of luck on your future exams!",
