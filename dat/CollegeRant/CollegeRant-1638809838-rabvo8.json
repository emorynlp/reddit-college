It\u2019s too much to fit in my car in 1 trip, so I\u2019ll probably be up all night driving 2+ hours back and forth from school to back home. \nNobody in my fam can help me either (no fault of their own) and I don\u2019t wanna make someone drive 5 hours because I don\u2019t have money to pay them for gas. $30 to my name, already quit my job for the time being, this stressssss!",

Talk to your school's Residential Life or Housing Administration or whatever it's called for you - I almost guarantee that they'll be able to help. I've had friends who had to do this at my school before - you just call them, explain that you have a final on the day of your move-out, and ask if they can let you move out a day late or a day early. They may charge you some money for an extra night (usually not more than $60), but compared to the impact doing well in your classes will have, it's a relatively small price to pay.",
