  "text": "\nI\u2019m literally going to lose my mind\n\nI just made an appointment with the disability services at my school, to request accommodations being made for both the classroom and housing, and they just emailed me back saying they don\u2019t have any appointments until the 5th of January. I\u2019m literally crying; by the time they get to me, they won\u2019t have time to even make any accommodations because school literally starts the following week. Amongst few of accommodations, I was also requesting one of the single suites, as I have a history of severe migraines and need to be in pitch black darkness and silence. My medicine that I have been taking following my surgery also messes with my sleep schedule, and I\u2019m sometimes in physical pain and can\u2019t stand to be around people, among other things. I\u2019m so fucking upset. This is ridiculous. This school has been jerking me around for months, losing paperwork I sent in and requesting I redo it, my counselor started ignoring me two weeks into the semester and wouldn\u2019t answer my calls (I had to contact the president of the school), people in each department giving me conflicting answers. I had an appointment with disability last week, but I had to reschedule because I was getting a heart monitor; I asked the lady several times, if I reschedule, when does it look like I can have a meeting, and she wouldn\u2019t answer me and got really irritated. I\u2019m just so upset I\u2019m literally crying.",

      "text": "You need to go to a dean. Tell them exactly what you say here. Especially about how you need immediate accomodations, you've been getting conflicting answers, and how people are disrespecting you. If you have emails with the conflicting answers, screenshot them and put them in a file. All communication you've had with the other departments that have been disrespectful and put you off, either screenshot it, or type it out as best as you remember it. Document when it happened.\n\nTake this file to the dean. Don't call them, don't email them. Go into the office and don't leave until you have spoken to a dean. Counsellors and people at the disability resource center are bullshitting you because they don't think you'll take this up with the dean, who they answer to. \n\nI had to do this last week, and I found the magic words. \"I need to file a complaint about the inappropriate conduct of a faculty member.\" After an afternoon of a the runaround, I said those words and was immediately talking to a dean. \n\nWhat's going on here is inappropriate. The disability resource center is not helping you, they're being lazy and dragging their feet and you are suffering as a result. But once the dean gets on their case, you'll have that room so fast your head will spin.",

They are in the best position to help because the DOS is housed within student affairs. Academic deans aren\u2019t involved in these processes on the staff side because they are academic affairs, which is often a separate division.",

      "text": "No advice here since the other comments seem to be helpful, but as a disabled person who has cried about how shit disabilities services is every year, I empathize with you and express my solidarity. It took me SIX MONTHS for my school to get their fucking shit together and accommodate ONE additional disorder that I hadn\u2019t requested accommodations for the previous year but had looooads of documentation for already that the school had. And yet it took SIX MONTHS for something that should\u2019ve taken about a week. I really hope the dean does something about this because it\u2019s so so unacceptable. Disabled people have to deal with so much shit on a daily basis that other people don\u2019t and it\u2019s so unfair that non-disabled people who aren\u2019t helpful continue to make life harder for us.",

Fuck DS, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having this experience. Fingers crossed the administration steps up\u2014they can\u2019t just say \u201cfuck you, no accommodations\u201d like they are right now. Super fucked up and honestly I feel like it\u2019s hardly legal to deny a disabled student\u2019s accommodations because of appointment times.",

      "text": "I was able to get a single for my migraines. I scheduled a meeting in august to get accommodations worked out ahead of time. The day before the semester started they sent me my list of accommodations which was incomplete. I ended up going to a different counselor, explained the situation and got things worked out. I would recommend trying to cut that counselor out of the situation entirely, email another one who isn't assigned to you and explain the situation, at the very least they will be annoyed their colleague isn't doing their job. \n\nKeep notes of your meetings so you have something to refer back to as proof that they said what they did. It will make it harder for them to backtrack. \n\nCan you just show up to the office in person? It is harder to ignore someone face to face than it is to ignore their calls. \n\nBefore you talk to them again familiarize yourself with your rights. Look at what is stated as requirements on their website, bring it all to the next meeting. If they say they need something more tell them it is not listed as a requirement and you have been trying to contact them for months. \n\nAlso look for a club for people with disabilities. I joined one with people from my colleges and it is great to find a sense of community, and complain about administration. Older students will be able to advise you one how they got their accommodations.",
