  "text": "We\u2019re paying thousands of dollars for an \u201ceducation\u201d that consists of us staring at our laptops for hours at a time. I go to a school that is kinda known for business but we\u2019re not some Ivy League school. Every kid here thinks they\u2019re gonna work for Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan but that\u2019s simply not the case. I read this line in a book I\u2019m reading and I think it\u2019s so true. \u201cCompetition makes people hallucinate opportunities that aren\u2019t there\u201d. They got us competing with grades, clubs and recommendations for high paying jobs that clearly prefer Ivy League students yet we all think we\u2019re gonna make 90k out of college. The student debt just keeps going up cause more and more people are buying into this scam. Realizing this just made me completely lose motivation for school.",

Sure, while in-person classes existed, we all had to take those random gen ed classes that felt like a waste, sure we had random fees and overly priced textbooks with information you could google search, but one thing has been clear. This pandemic tested the abilities of administration and exposed a lot of poor administrative decisions which will ultimately hurt the student. Many schools have raised their tuition rates due to \"technological reasons\" despite receiving aid from the CARES Act, something that makes zero sense. While college is good for some and has benefits, you'd have to weigh out the pros and cons and see if it's a fit for you. Personally, if I could have found something else to do, I would have never went to college.",

I hated every second, working horrible fast food/retail/warehouse jobs, getting burnt with oil, yelled at by Karens, breaking my back from a falling package. I tried to teach myself programming but no one would hire without some sort of a college degree/internship. Sites like Indeed just auto rejected me to jobs. Eventually sucked it up and took my savings and enrolled full time in Computer Science at the local univeristy. I actually really appreciate how rigorous it is and my college offers free bootcamps, hackathons, career fairs for networking. I actually secured a $40 an hour full time summer internship as a junior- really excited to start. There is also a high chance they will offer me a part time job after the internship, so I will be able to pay off most of my loans, and the experience will be great for my resume. Without college I would have never had all these opportunities. I'm super excited to graduate and land a good paying job and be able to work remotely in a lovely tropical affordable place like Thailand! College is what you make of it, but it has been extremely beneficial for me.",

My cost of living adjustment (not everyone is lucky enough to receive) is lower than the percentage increase in tuition each year. Why is Richard Lee Aaron, a professor of cello at U of M in the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance getting paid $216,929 annually?

          "text": "But that\u2019s the issue. Everyone knows you don\u2019t need a college degree to be successful. That\u2019s more true now than any other time throughout Americas history. You can go to trade school, coding bootcamps, or just buy a course in anything you wanna learn. So although we know college isn\u2019t necessary to be successful the shift to more kids doing other routes hasn\u2019t happened yet so dropping out right now still looks bad. So although I know I don\u2019t need this, it\u2019s a waste of time and money, and there are options that would probably put me in a better spot to succeed,if I don\u2019t go to college I\u2019ll be considered a failure.",

If your parents aren\u2019t paying for your school then I suggest making a pros and cons list and doing what you think feels right.

Sorry English majors but as lovely as literature is, it doesn't pay unless your daddy already set you up with a trust or family business.\n\nIf you are going to get a loan, please understand that it is compound interest and your debt will grow fast. You will have to pay more than what you borrowed. A lot more. That is what compound interest does.\n\nAnd in relation to online vs. face-to-face, you are not struggling because classes are online, you are struggling because life sucks for everyone right now. I'm in my fifties and nothing has sucked more than this past year (honorable mention to my last year of my PhD though). The joke is that many grandmas die at the end of the semester.
