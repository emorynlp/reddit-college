  "text": "tl;dr: i\u2019m having trouble finding people with the same major as mine. i really wanted to start a discord or something! pls, it\u2019s so hard finding them at my school, i just wanted to create a small community of my major because we shouldn\u2019t be so tiny. comment if you share the same major as me, so i know y\u2019all exist \ud83e\udd72 honestly just seeing any kind of grade level major is enough for me because i\u2019m so alone ugh.\n\nokay, long story short, i am majoring in secondary education mathematics.  basically means i\u2019m trying to become a high school teacher in mathematics.\n\nwhen i tell you it is extremely hard finding people with the same major at my uni. which is bizarre because my uni is supposedly known for having the \u201cone of the best teaching programs.\u201d well then where are all of your applicants?? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nplease i wanted to make friends with the same major. at this point i\u2019ve resorted to elementary school majors, which i don\u2019t see as a problem, but i also feel it\u2019s just not the same. similar but not the same.\n\nmy uni does this thing where you can choose the dorm building that most people of your major lives. nope that didn\u2019t work, i\u2019m not even dormed with elementary school majors - they\u2019re clumped in another building. my entire hallway and below is some sort of nursing/animal science/pre-vet mixture and there is literally no education major on my hallway besides me.\n\nplease do y\u2019all exist? \ud83d\ude2d",

It was definitely hard to find other people with this major at the last campus I attended, but once you do some searching, you will have some super close friends.\n\nI was also looking for a discord server for education majors. No such luck! Someone should start that.",
