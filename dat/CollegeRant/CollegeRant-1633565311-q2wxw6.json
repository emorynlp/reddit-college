  "text": "But I am trying to keep it together. I am taking three classes right now. In my math class I literally have seven things due in the next few days, a chapter review, a chapter test, two video reviews, and then two assignments, then another chapter review, and another chapter test. All of that is due by Friday night. Well the last test is not due til saturday but still. I also have to start studying for the midterm next week which I am sure I will do bad on. Also I have to start my final project for my Javascript class which is due next week. and another project in my gaming class dude next weekend. I also work the next two days and will only have a little bit of free time. The math class has Late Passes but I only use those in extreme circumstances. I would also like to squeeze in No Time to Die this weekend somehow. Its just really stressing me TBH. Like seriously I wish the math class just had one assignment for each things and the reviews were not over 20 questions.",
