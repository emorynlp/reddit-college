  "text": "I attend a community college and have about 5 classes left before I graduate with an associates in businsess. I'm heavily considered dropping out because of overwhelming stress relating to school. I believe that I could teach myself more efficiently and effectively on my own, but I feel like I need a degree and want to experience graduate school some day.\n\nEarly in school I was considered \"gifted\" and skipped a grade but I failed almost every class in highschool and dropped out due to depression. In college I currently have a 3.9 GPA. Part of my stress comes from perfectionism and trying to maintain my GPA. This stresses me out because I feel like I need to maintain a high GPA if I want to transfer to a \"good\" college in the future. I feel like I missed my chance in high school. I never took the SAT. \n\nI already dropped out of college once due to stress. Now I have only been taking two classes a semester but still struggle with stress from school and the idea of graduating \"late\". For context I am nearly 25 and feel so far behind my peers. I've tried to break down the reasons for my stress as follows:\n\nMost of my classes have been taken digitally and my experience with them has been that the teachers are practically absent and it's as if the class is fully automated. We mainly read out of a textbook and then do exercises made by some learning company like Mcgraw Hill or Norton. We have weekly discussions where most students bullshit and write responses like \"I agree!\" as part of a participation grade. Students do not really reach out to each other, there are no study groups or anything like that. Powerpoints slides are pre-prepared by these companies and nearly every exam question is copy pasted from Google. I wish I was in an environment where the teachers and students were more active.\n\nWhen I don't understand something, there isn't anyone I can ask for help. Google isn't always reliable and for someone who doesn't understand the material figuring it out on your own can be a very long and frustrating process. Something that takes me an hour of googling could be answered in a few minutes by a teacher, and often what I find online doesn't match the format of my assignment. Most teachers write back by email in a few days, the response time is far too slow to learn effectively. \n\nI also don't like the way some information is presented and sometimes get stuck when I can't understand it. Because most lessons build on knowledge previously learned, this is a recipe for repeated frustration when I come across something requiring knowledge that I did not fully understand the first time.\n\nI'm also very disappointed in the level of organization of my teachers. It is very common for assignments to have incorect dates posted, typos, and missing submission links.\n\nI'm stuck and overwhelmed. I'm trying to hold out thinking that I might get a better education/learning experience at a better college but I don't know if that will be the case. \n\nWhat should I do?",

      "text": "I\u2019m about to be 27 and have 4 more classes until I get my associates and MIGHT consider getting my bachelors. \n\nI think the degree would get you better chances of being hired for higher pay but you need to stop comparing yourself to your peers. Half of my peers have their shit together seemingly and the other half is doing what I\u2019m doing. \n\nI used to freak out about my classes and how long I was taking but I stopped caring. I\u2019m so stressed from this semester that I\u2019m taking the winter/spring semester off and the summer and not starting again until the fall and I just don\u2019t care anymore.",

      "text": "Do not quit! Seriously, my brother dropped out and he struggles to make ends meet with his student loans and lack of compensation due to no degree. Also, many of those self-learning courses aren't respected by most employers unfortunately. The competition for good paying jobs is too fierce for you to drop out and get self-learning certificates.",

      "text": "I am in a similarish situation to you (sorta.) I graduated high school in 2017. Jumped right into a community college that fall and failed *every single class.* I was able to do nothing and slide by in high school, turns out that doesn't work in college. Anyway, I worked some shitty jobs for a couple of years. In summer 2019 I decided to quit my crappy factory job and try college again. I took two online accelerated classes and got A's in both of them. I'm kinda good with computers and did gaming a lot so I decided that Network Admin was the path for me. I took one semester of that and barely got a C in every class. \n\nI switched to programming the next semester, I same thing again. Apparently, anything in Computer science isn't for me. I was out of options but didn't want to drop out again and let myself down so I decided to take up the Associates in Business. Somehow with all this major switching, I didn't lose any credits. Last June I graduated with an associate's degree in business. Long story short turns out you can't do anything with a 2-year business degree in the rural midwest.\n\n So now I'm going back *again* to do one semester of welding and hopefully get a good-paying job. My advice would be to think long and hard before deciding to keep going or to drop out. Look at every company within 30 miles and find out what kind of work is available in your area. I hope you live in a big city and not in a backwoods town like me. I'm still feeling really burned out and worried myself. What if welding doesn't work out like everything else? \n\nDon't do what I did and get scared, then immediately jump into another program trying to find the magical solution. What are your goals? Do you have a family? Are you good at anything? What do you like doing? I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to pick my brain if you want.",
