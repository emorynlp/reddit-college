  "text": "If you've ever applied to college before you'd know it is time-consuming to prepare materials and (coming from the US) there are application fees, usually around $60 a school. It's such a waste of time and resources. This isn't a lottery, many non-top colleges have reasonable admissions rates. Quality over quantity is better.\n\nPeople are supposed to narrow the college search to colleges they would actually attend. You can estimate the financial aid/ scholarships beforehand. You can visit the schools. There's a ton of information online. This tells me the student probably applied to a bunch of \"safety\" schools, the schools with high admit rates and easy applications. The most admirable thing in this scenario is the dedication it takes to complete these. I think literally any average student could achieve this feat with there being 4000+ colleges in the US. \n\nTL:DR Come across too many articles boasting the number of acceptances people get instead of like actual goals or competitiveness of programs",

I realized that a bunch of the schools I had been considering were either lots of extra safeties, or I didn't really want to go after visiting even though they looked good on paper. I think a lot of students and colleges would benefit tremendously if all students had something they had to prepare for each school to keep their application numbers down like maybe an interview or something? I know it's different for every person and every major, but it just seems weird to me that I spent so much time preparing for 6 auditions at 6 schools while everyone else I knew sent 10-20+ applications over the course of a few weeks.",
