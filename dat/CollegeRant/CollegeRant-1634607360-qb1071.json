  "title:": "Failed midterm practical",
  "text": "How do you recover from failing a practical?\n\nTo outline: the course is split into 3 sections you must pass each individually in order to pass the course. You MUST pass the course to progress into the final year.\n\nOne section of the course is broken up into 40% - midterm practical , 10% - attendance, 50% - final practical and you need a minimum of 70% to pass.\n\nI studied hard, but had 4 other tests to worry about in the same week, so I could have studied harder still. I felt confident but ended up with a 62.5% on the midterm. The class average was only 75%. I came out of the exam thinking that I at least passed but knew my anxiety made me panic under the pressure and fumble a few things.\n\nThis professor is an egotistical maniac who belittles her students and looks down on everyone around her. She is zero help when asking questions and rather than aid you, she insults your ability to do anything and everything, implying you should know everything so you shouldn\u2019t need to ask questions. She treats class like an exam and tells us we all would have failed before finally teaching the lesson at the very end.\n\nI set up a meeting to go over my grade and where I went wrong and try to kiss her ass to earn brownie points.. but I cannot fail this course. How do I get over the soul crushing feeling of being a failure and the haunting idea I may have to repeat an entire year if I fail the final practical? How do I bounce back? How do I deal with this monster of a teacher?\n\nTLDR: professor is a dick. Failed a midterm worth 40% and need to pass the course in order to progress into my final year. Am I fucked?",
