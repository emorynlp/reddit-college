  "text": "I dropped out of the University of Southern California for film. Top ranked film program. I transferred in state in Florida to USF. I find it hard to be grateful to be here I am constantly wishing I was back at SC or even if I went to a better school like UF or FSU. I was thinking about trying to go to grad school just to feel more satisfied with my academic experience, but I don\u2019t think I have the grades",
