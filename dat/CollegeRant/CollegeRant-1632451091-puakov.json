  "text": "I've been doing pretty damn good in all of my classes this semester so far, A's on my math, psych, and A&P exams and A's on all my homework. However, I got a 69 on my 1st history exam. For context, the exam is all short answer with Part A being at least 5 paragraph regarding 5 different topics covered in class and Part B being a full essay (intro, body, conclusion) regarding a narrower topic the professor chooses. \n\nI studied like hell for this exam because no one knew what this exam was going to look like and our professor really didn't help us out in that regard. I knew all the material and used the entire 55 minutes given to me to complete the exam.\n\nWell, I got my exam back after feeling pretty confident about how I did and it was a 69% which is a D in that class. It was super demoralizing because I am so optimistic about this school and have genuinely been working my ass off.  All the feed back on the exam was so vague and seemed to be fairly pointless. Some of the feedback included: \"more detail\", \"try to look at this from a different angle\", \"elaborate\". Like, FIRST OF ALL, do you not realize this is a 55 minute class and you are asking for pretty much the equivalent of 2 essays????\n\nThe thing is I really enjoy this class. The professor is funny and engaging and seems very nice. However, he also seems like he doesn't like the administrative aspects of teaching like grading, making tests or putting in grades or whatever else. He doesn't like to provide us with any study resources except for a super skimpy study guide that apparently means jack shit. He also makes the exam like...the morning of. This would all be fine if you didn't hold your students to way higher standards than yourself. \n\nNo one did good on this exam, so the TA sent an email with a word doc attached that had an example of how she would do it, and assuming that her example would be considered a 100; there is NO WAY that my exam would get a D. That's why I'm saying there genuinely doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the way the exams are graded. I'm just ranting and also wondering if anyone else has had an experience/professor like this. I'm genuinely so discouraged by this.",

      "text": "I would totally email the professor with the TAs example and go ask him to explain why yiu got a D in more detail. Don\u2019t just let professors grade you snd not give clear explanation of why you got a grade because it\u2019ll more then likely happen again. While I understand you like this professors making material and grading it is literally a part of his job. A lot of time professors will change your grade on the spot if you can show that it\u2019s their fault you did something wrong.",

      "text": "I just got an exam back where I lost a point for not including a piece of information that wasn't even asked about. Giving context would be hard over a comment, but like it would've been the equivalent of if the question asked \"how fast was the car going\" and the point I lost was \"did not state the color of the car.\" I still got a B. Just annoying.",
