Anyways, I would suggest that you \n\n1: look into what jobs you can get with each degree and write them down \n\nAnd \n\n2: go through each job and decide which one has more jobs that you would actually want to do \n\nThis is how I\u2019m deciding on if I should switch or not. I hope this helps!",
