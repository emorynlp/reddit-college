  "text": "I'm struggling a lot with organization and being able to study. I have exams literally every week and it feels like I'm stuck underneath a sea. Being this behind makes me feel like it's impossible and I'm letting down my parents so I try to study and can't bring my mind off this for more than 10 minutes. My sleep schedule is also inverted which makes it so much worse cause I get mentally prepared and it's already dark out so I feel like I'm out of time.",
