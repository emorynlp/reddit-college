  "text": "I originally posted this is the college subreddit but I was afraid of getting judged so someone said this forum might be better since I need to rant a bit lol. I'm sorry if this comes across as overdramatic/ whiny\n\nI went to a mostly commuter school while most of my friends went to far away colleges. I did well academically, minimized how many loans I had to take out, and graduated early, but looking back I had literally no fun. I failed to make many friendships and did not join any clubs. I take responsibility and it is my own fault that I did not do more, but I did not realize how much I would regret it. I realize college is only 1 part of people's lives, but I'm afraid I will regret this for a very long time and don't know how to move on. I also feel like I did not develop independence like many people I know who went elsewhere.\n\nThis has just been consuming me lately and I feel ridiculous for it! I know that even if I had gone to a different school, my experience might not have been better because I'm just not the type to get very involved but the what ifs consume me. Sometimes I wish I could have a redo, but that probably isn't smart. However, I also graduated before COVID and I know that being in school now with that would stress me tf out so props to everyone navigating that. Sorry if this is incoherent lol I just need to rant\n\nTldr: I had a lame college experience and regret not doing more now, even though I know I can't change the past",

      "text": "Bro i literally have to make that decision. Whether I want independence and activities in a far away college or get into a nearby college, which has no campus life and I wud be living with my parents. No clue what to do. Sometimes Im like I can chill at home, and everything is safe and comfortable with no changes, but sometimes I feel adventurous and want to go to the one that provides a better 'experience' and seek discomfort lol.",

          "text": "It's such a difficult decision to make because I feel like there are a lot of pros and cons on both sides! I know some people who 100% wanted to go far away and had their minds made up but it was so much more difficult for me and I changed my mind a lot lol. I feel like I missed out on the dorm experience and campus life, but at the same time I get what you mean about being safe and comfortable because I honestly don't think I'd like living in a dorm that much with a twin bed and having to share everything! I think discomfort can be good and I wish I would have left my comfort zone more, even at the commuter campus I could have done more. \n\nI can't speak much about going away to school but my advice from my experience would be that if you do choose to go to the commuter school (and I don't think there's anything wrong with that) try to spend some time on campus and really utilize the school. I used to go to class and then immediately go home and that's what I regret. It did help me academically though cause there weren't many distractions lol. Obviously academics are the most important part of college but I should have balanced them with fun social things more. I know some people at the commuter school who had a better experience than me because they tried to enjoy campus more and worked harder to socialize. Even just joining a few clubs, talking to random people, going to some sporting events if they have them, or going to the library/gym/cafeteria would probably help a lot! It didn't help that I'm pretty introverted and not great at just going up and talking to people but if you are outgoing things might be easier. Also, you could always look at doing a study abroad at some point maybe because that way you could get both aspects. Basically, I wish I would have pushed myself more because at the time I was fine acting like it was high school and just going to class and then leaving, and I didn't realize that I would regret it. The school I went to did have some dorms so it wasn't fully commuter and there was a campus with some activities but not like a huge school, so I'm not sure where you are looking at if it would have that or not. \n\nSorry if this is kind of long and rambling I'm just trying to think of what advice I would give. Good luck to you in figuring out which path to take and weighing the pros and cons! I'm sure you'll make the right choice for you and you can always change things if you need! Thanks for the response!",

      "text": "Girl\u2026I know exactly what you mean!! Been there. Was also a commuter, didn\u2019t join any clubs, nothing. Literally went to class and then went back home and because of this I didn\u2019t even make friends. Just had acquaintances. I did end up regretting it. Not just not being involved but my whole degree and all. \n\nSo 2 years later (after graduating) I went back to college ( a different one, this time in nyc) to pursue a new degree that I was passionate about. But Covid hit and my first 2 semesters were online.  By the start of the second semester I was like I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore. I am taking this semester off for two reason: 1) I dont even now If I even wanna finish this degree and 2) I don\u2019t wanna get vaccinated and my school requires it. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m doing research on how to start my own business. Just wanna do something that\u2019s my own and be creative.",

          "text": "I'm the exact same way regarding making acquaintances but not friends. We'd talk in class and got along well but it never went beyond that! In the moment I was just going day to day and didn't care that I wasn't in clubs, but looking back I wish I would have forced myself to join even just 1 club or go to a few events just to feel a bit more connected! I'm sorry that you regret your degree too! I'm ok with mine but ai just don't know what to do with it lol \n\nWhen you went back to school, did you go for a 2nd bachelor's or a masters? I've considered going back but not sure! Having the classes all go online would definitely take away the experience you were going back for so I don't blame you for taking a step back and reevaluating what you want to do. I'm vaccinated but being in school right now with COVID just doesn't sound good at all to me and I feel like it would add stress. \n\nBest of luck to you on working on starting a business because I think that would be really rewarding! Thank you for the feedback, I appreciate it and it's really interesting from people who have gone through very similar experiences!",

      "text": "Something interesting i heard is that people love to fantasize what they never experienced. The idea of the experience is what you want, but the idea can be far from the reality. Scroll long enough on either r/college or r/collegerant and you'll hear about people regretting taking on debt for the \"experience.\" \n\nWhat you can do now is find ways to make your future enjoyable. You can make friends and join clubs outside the college circle, those things exist without university's help.\n\nBe proud of yourself with minimal debt, a degree, and your new found independence. (Its not a race so don't worry about being independent later in life)\n\nIf it makes you feel better, this random ass stranger on reddit thinks you made a smart choice thinking about finances at an early age. It takes maturity and intelligence. I wish you the best! Againyoumadetherightchoice!",

In my mind I have an idea of what college would have been like if I had gone somewhere else, but I know that in reality it would likely be nothing like that. I know my mind will keep imagining but I need to keep reminding myself of what you said! \n\nAnd true, I need to work on making friends after college with outside groups. It has been hard because of COVID and being pretty introverted, but I need to just put myself out there more. \n\nAlso, thank you for the reminder that life is not a race because so often I start to think like it is so the reminder helps bring me back to a more logical place! \n\nThank you again for the words of encouragement, I really appreciate it and it does make me feel better! Thank you for saying I made the right choise and I wish you the best too!",
