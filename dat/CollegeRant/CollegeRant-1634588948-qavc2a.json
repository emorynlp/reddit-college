  "text": "So I'm 16 from the UK, I've been going to college for about a month or two now and I honestly hate it. I've always been an introvert for most of my life but college brings out the worst of it. It makes my anxiety increase so much, just sitting in a room where I don't know anyone but everyone else is talking to eachother (friends went to different college) and I'm just sitting there in silence I can't handle it. So I'm taking a business course but I really want to drop out. Not because of the course but because of the environment altogether.\n\nSo I've thought about a couple of ideas, one, I drop out and do an apprenticeship ship instead, I either want to do a business apprenticeship so I have experience which could help me get into uni if I ever wanted to,or something to do with train driving as an apprenticeship. I could do a train driving apprenticeship (I either want to be a train driver or to work in the business industry) and learn about business on the side.\n\nThe one that I've been thinking about is doing an online course instead, I wouid love this since I wouid be home and would be able to focus on the work without anxiety completely taking over me. However it does concern me that I won't meet new people so I'm limiting my future if that makes sense like I'm limiting the people I can meet to be potentially friends. I have 2 close friends that I actually consider as friends and then I have friends I talk to now and again but not as often ever since we left school and go to different colleges. I might have to do more research to see if this is actually available for me since the college I'm at now it is available but only for people 19+ and you have to pay for it.\n\nI do want a good future but college is actually destroying my mental state and its draining me. Sorry for this being all over the place, I don't know what I'm expecting from this I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what people might have to say about it. If you wanted to see the options I thought about without the rest, here it is:\n. Drop out and do an apprenticeship for train driving instead while learning business on the side\n. Drop out and do a business apprenticeship\n. Online course (needs more research)\n\nSorry if this seems like a really small thing to actually wanting to drop out lmao",

      "text": "College has been turned into a party opportunity for the kids with parents who have enough money. The parents think they are giving their child a good jump into the world, while in reality theres so many people graduating anyway I don't believe that if you have the skill and have proven it in practice that you would be denied a job over someone who graduated but isn't as good or better. If you only want to learn you're better off using the internet. The idea of an apprenticeship is a good one, not only do you bypass college but you get right into the field immediately and as I said before you gain the recognition of your skill that can be directly referenced unlike a paper saying you went through a bunch of useless classes. Apprenticeship is not one I have personally doven into (because my parents also believe college is the best opportunity smh) but yeah I would give it a shot. I am all for seeing colleges get a big slap in the face for being the literal factory they were always designed to be and never changed. Hopefully, this whole reduction in college attendance will bring out the progressive and fun ones while destroying those that never decided to get rid of all these bloatclasses.\n\nWow what a broken bundle of words, its 1:07. I need to sleep",
