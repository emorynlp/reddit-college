  "title:": "The future of my college education is uncertain due to finacial issues and I don't know what I should do.",
  "text": "With financial aid and a scholarship I got from my university my out of pocket expenses are going to be roughly 9-11k each term. I can do payment plans which I can afford possibly if I can do it by annually monthly payments and its very unlikely I can afford it if I can only do them per term (monthly payment which end at the term).\n\nI can possibly get more scholarships on campus in my educational focus (zoology) which the college provides but I won't be able to know how much they'll offer till a week or two till I'm about to move into the dorms. Ill also need to get myself a job ASAP either on or off campus to pay for those payments. \n\n\nIts currently midnight and I can't sleep due to the stress, I come from a family where going to college was a rarity so knowing the expensive were foreign to me. I had gone to in state community college and I paid nothing out of pocket since financial aid covered everything but going out of state, on campus living hit me out of nowhere.\n\n\nThis is more of a vent post than anything else as I'm just entirely shocked at how much the costs are amd that its uncertain if its possible for me to juggle work, payments, keeping a 3.0 gpa for my scholarship that I'm dependent on. \n\n\nTyping this out made me feel a bit better as I have only a month to think on what I want to do for my future. I'm going to try to get some sleep.\n\nTldr: Anxiety is through the roof that I might not be able to afford college and just needed to vent.",
