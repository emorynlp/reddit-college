  "text": "Hi! Am I the only one who's utterly obsessed over everything college-related? I'm getting to my first year of a master's programme (French education system here called *Licence Master Doctorat*, or *LMD* for short) and I *cannot*, even on vacation, stop thinking about university. I need to know what I'll study next year, read the material in advance, get ahead, prepare and schedule. Not saying I'm good at any of that by the way, but it's constantly on my mind.\n\nTruth be told, it's getting on my nerves. But I can't seem to do otherwise. I just need to vent off and blow some steam, I guess. Can't be the only one... Thoughts? Is it unhealthy?\n\nEdit 1: forgot to add any flair, hope it's okay.",

      "text": "Yeah I feel this. I've been out of school since December (had to start my upcoming program in the fall term as a condition of certain scholarships) and have just been unnecessarily preoccupied for 7 months with NOTHING to do so I've been reading books related to my field, checking the school site daily during the week for any updates on things I need to do, buying materials I may or may not need. \n\nI don't know why my brain has latched onto obsession over my education, other than the fact that it's the only thing I've ever excelled in and that makes me feel like I'm contributing to something for once in my life.",

      "text": "So I have just completed my bachelors degree but hell its not something I would care to do again.\n\nCollege obsession is something all students go through. Its partilarly bad ar higher levels of education like masters degrees. I have only done a bachelor degree so far and I can say Its bad enough when your doing a bachelor thesis!\n\nI know one other thing. Throughout the course of my degree I switched from a medium coffee to a dark coffee. Its a sign of the times eh?",
