There\u2019s usually a 10-20 min delay in canvas notifications, so I\u2019m constantly logging in and checking like a crazy person. I wish my professors would hurry up so I can finally breathe again LOL Fml.. \ud83d\ude29\n\nEdit: meant to type canvas, not atlas",

The other day I had a bit of a fiasco with a project I didn\u2019t do too hot on because I didn\u2019t read the instructions carefully enough, and my professor was nice enough to give me a chance to resubmit it for up to a 90. So I redid it and turned it in and I really couldn\u2019t relax until the grade got changed. It doesn\u2019t help that Canvas notifications are delayed by an hour, so I kept refreshing the page.",
