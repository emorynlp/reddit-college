  "text": "So I have two pre requisites remaining before I can apply for the radiology program at my college. Both are A&P so I can only take one class at a time. However - dumb decisions from my past when I was newly 18 (trying to work full time with a full class schedule) led me to lose my financial aid due to dropping/failing, so the past two years (roughly 4 years after the first college attempt) I've been paying out of pocket. \n\nTo get my financial aid back, I have to raise my passing credits per attempted percentage (need to be at 67% passing and I'm at 52% I think) which means extra easy A classes since there's no way I'd be able to pay for more than 2 classes at a time, and the program is a full time schedule that's made for me. \n\nAnyone have any favorite easy A classes just to fill a schedule? I've already taken humanities since it was a required pre-req as was intro to psych. I was thinking about taking painting but it conflicts with my work schedule since it's right in the middle of the day. \n\n\n\nTl;Dr- tell me your favorite \"easy A- don't really need this class but the subject is interesting to me\" classes!",
