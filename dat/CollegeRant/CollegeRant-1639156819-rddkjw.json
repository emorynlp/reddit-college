Not only will no one ask for your GPA, they will also under zero circumstances scrutinize your transcript. Only if you plan on going to gradschool will someone be looking at your transcript and even then one C in a bunch of As might not matter that much.",

Where someone with a business administration degree generally (not always) GPA maters far less. Don\u2019t stress you\u2019ll be fine. College DOES NOT DEFINE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE OR CAREER. I cannot stress this enough to students",

You want to make sure you\u2019re on target for finishing at least 3.5 GPA or above bc that gate keeps a lot of the top dev programs in finance. If you lean more towards accounting then you might be ok but you still wanna make sure you know algebra better.",
