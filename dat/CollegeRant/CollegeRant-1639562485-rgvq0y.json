  "text": " So, I've seen a ton of threads in this subreddit where people vent about how they are lonely and frustrated about making no friends in college. While I never posted one of these threads myself, I definitely related to the sentiment and thought life would be easier if I made friends. I idealized the idea of having a plethora of college friends at the ready.\n\nThis semester, I transferred to a new university and made a ton of friends. This is a stark difference to the zero real friends I had made in my first two years at community college.\n\nI'm social now. There is one girl who I hang out with once or twice a week--usually we get drunk and watch dumb YouTube videos together. There's another girl who I've hung out with several times this semester and one day we even spent 9 hours straight together. There's yet another person who I've played ping pong with, there are tons of cool people I interact with in the numerous clubs I'm in, I've met so many wonderful people and have even gone on several dates this semester.\n\nAnd yet after an intense social interaction, I get back to my dorm and I suddenly feel very alone. I feel like I have no one to come home to, once the social interactions stop they just stop and I have nothing else to do or look forward to.\n\nI'm grateful for the friends I made, but I wonder if your base happiness level can never go up.",
