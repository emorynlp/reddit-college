  "text": "\n\nSo I\u2019m literally panicking rn. I\u2019m having a hard time breathing. I have a midterm in 2 hours that I haven\u2019t studied for which is worth 20% of my grade. Like I legit don\u2019t want to go and take it. I haven\u2019t been studying I know absolutely nothing. It\u2019s linear algebra btw and in person. I have been so depressed literally on the verge of killing myself. Im literally borderline suicidal. I have been starving myself I haven\u2019t been taking care of my hygiene let alone go to my class. Im thinking of dropping out. Like I legit don\u2019t know what to do. Should I email my professor and even then what would I say.  I legit hate myself so fuckn why I am such a dumb fat pig. I think I might see a psychiatrist today but like wtf do I do about my midterm.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t let it stress you out, I understand the toll it takes on your mental health and am too struggling. But you do have options. You should communicate your concerns to your advisor who can let you know what options are available. The more you let it eat you up the worse it will get. Your mental health and wellness is more important and your school will be able to help you. And if you are truly struggling with your mental health see if you can request medical leave or incomplete. Mental health is no joke and can be crippling if not managed. I\u2019ve been so stressed I haven\u2019t slept and have reworded the same email 20x. i suffer from fear of failure. What helped is when I reached out to communities like this and saw I wasn\u2019t the only one.",

Now I have no clue what I\u2019m gonna do because I\u2019m horrible at math and it\u2019s also 20% of my fucking grade. I should be studying for it rn but IM EXHAUSTED, DEPRESSED, and to be quite honest want to be dead. I haven\u2019t showered since like 2 days ago my hair looks disgusting, and to top it off I\u2019m failing Italian and my grade in English dropped from a 100% to a 72% today. I emailed the teacher and she goes \u201cit was a computer malfunction you never had a 100%\u201d ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. I\u2019m failing almost every class and my scholarship literally depends on me getting a certain GPA!!!",
