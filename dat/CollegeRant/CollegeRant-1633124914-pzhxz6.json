  "text": "I dropped a class before the withdrawal deadline. As a result, my financial aid package changed; it still covered the costs of my 5 credit course that I am still in and offered a refund. I also received an email that reflected this change.\n\nHowever, my tuition now says I owe money by October 12.  I have not registered, dropped, or added any classes after the add/drop deadline. I did not receive an email notifying me of this change and cannot pull up my former statements. I honestly wish I had documented everything prior to this.\n\nI have contacted financial aid, they basically told me I had to pay.",
