  "text": "I\u2019m taking a multimedia class for my journalism major that\u2019s been pretty hard. However I\u2019m doing well in the class but\u2026for some reason I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing a good job? This and another class I\u2019m taking are the last before I finally graduate and I\u2019m really feeling the pressure. I also think this feeling comes from an assignment that was due weeks ago that\u2019s 210 points. The assignment has yet to be graded and it has me stressed, everyone in class was a bit lost on that particular assignment. I\u2019ve never had an assignment worth so many points (even the final is only worth 110 points) and I\u2019m here thinking my grade is gonna drop drastically when he posts the grades. This has been a very anxiety inducing semester and I want it to be done.",
