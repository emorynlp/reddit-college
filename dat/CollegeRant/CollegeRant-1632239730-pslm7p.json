  "title:": "Why do STEM majors shit on business majors?",
  "text": "Some STEM majors seem to think business majors sit around and do nothing or party and get As. I\u2019m sure there are some people who slack off and cheat or are able to glide by but it\u2019s really disheartening to hear that when I know I work really hard and have a ton of homework. \n\nOr they just feel the need to constantly mention how much harder their major is. How business people have it easy. I know STEM is very difficult but it\u2019s not like every other major is child\u2019s play. And then it makes me feel worse when I\u2019m struggling in my business classes that are supposed to be \u201ceasy\u201d\n\nAnyway does anyone else feel this way?",

I don\u2019t shit on business majors, but what I\u2019ll say is what I experienced while in college.\n\nBusiness major classes, at least those I took are easier than STEM classes I took. Not easy, but easier. But that\u2019s not even important.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is, in my STEM classes, I never had, or at least noticed anyone flat out cheated on exams. I saw most of my classmates work hard on exams and projects. While in business classes, many people cheated. In one of my business department classes, more than half the classes failed the midterm because they used zoom call to cheat on the exam and got caught. There were even multiple times that someone just boldly asked me to tell them my answers for the exam (it was during COVID so everything was online). So at least in my experience, business students generally have worse study mindset than STEM students.",
