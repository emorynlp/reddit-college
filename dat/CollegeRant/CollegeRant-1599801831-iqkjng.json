  "text": "There is no joy to learning at all when I could just use my cellphone to see the answer. \nEveryone in my class basically cheats and I can't cheat because I grew up thinking fairly and had several consequences to cheating when I was younger which gave me that moral compass today. \nNow they get higher scores than me even though I stayed up to study. It's fucking unfair. I hate this system and I'm wishing for physical classes again :(",

If the information directly related to your major and you genuinely think youll need it then you should totally take time to understand the content. But when you're taking a class that isn't super related, just required, it's easy to not have your heart really into effort",

I need to be taught in person this is so frustrating. I feel like I cannot keep up with lectures that are pointless tutoring is even harder because they can't just look down at your hw you have to describe everything. I am not learning anything new this semester and probably never will until I have in person again. I'm so afraid of failing and like you, I was raised the same so I get it and your feelings are so validated.",

I don\u2019t know how well it stops determined cheaters however. I suppose there\u2019s even ways to cheat with that. Most of my other profs give open book/open note tests so they have built this into exams, and they\u2019ve accepted that people will also find the answer from their phones. A couple of my profs have decided on no exams only essays or papers. Students used to even cheat with scantron exams (I once ratted out on a cheater, he sat next to me and pulled out a cheat sheet, very blatantly, and it disgusted me, during my first semester.) \n\nMy anatomy prof, in spring, used to encourage us to use our phones to find answers to lab questions. My math prof is letting us put formulas for the exam on an index card.",

It's tough, but I think, when you cheat, it is even harder to feel good about a grade or accomplishment and gross when anyone says good job. \n\nAs a side note, I would ask... do you know that they are cheating, or assume that they are because they are doing better. Worrying about other's success in comparison to yours and looking for people doing worse than you or who are doing the cheating you wish you could is a pretty fixed mindset or mixed, at most. I know that online is making many students feel imposter syndrome to the max right now, I just hope that you find what you are looking for because these feelings are valid and reasonable af and I hope you find what you are looking for.",
