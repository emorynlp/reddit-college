  "text": "Hello guys! I am not a happy camper right now. I started a new class, and the professor is extremely strict about turning in assignments on time. The problem is, sometimes I mentally can\u2019t finish work on time. All my other professors I\u2019ve had have been extremely accommodating, but looking at the professor\u2019s syllabus, she doesn\u2019t seem like in any situation she will be reasonable, including no internet and for extreme reasons, we need documentation! So, I emailed the person who makes accommodations for me to ask to add extra time for assignments, and she says in these words \u201cBeing able to turn in late assignments is not a college accommodation.\u201d Like why? I had this in high school, and now it is taken away from me\u2026 so I sent a mean email that would most likely get me suspended or expelled, but at this point I don\u2019t care anymore. Here is the email. \u201cThen maybe college isn\u2019t for me. If you and (college) don\u2019t accommodate my needs, then I will find a different way to be successful! College is useless and you guys truly don\u2019t give a crap about your students\u2019 mental health. Too much money just to be set up for failure, college is a freakin joke. And no, I\u2019m not going to take care! I am now going to sleep for 2+ hours and eat a crap ton of junk food!\u201d I want to advocate and protest at this point! Our mental health matters, and it just makes it harder when you have a disability. Sometimes I just mentally can\u2019t handle school and it is heartbreaking that they don\u2019t care about us, especially with disabilities (I have Autism and ADHD for those wondering)",

      "text": "Ok so I have ADHD and I definitely turn assignments in late because of poor planning and it has caused some really stressful situations. I never received assignment extensions as an accommodation in high school, so consider the context that maybe you went to a super accommodating high school compared to the normal high school experience.   \n\n\nCollege is way different from high school in that you have a lot more free time and that you get a syllabus with a schedule on it. You know when all of the big assignments are due at the beginning of the year and it falls on you to make a long-term plan to get complete these deliverables. Not many job positions have easily flexible deadlines either. If your other Professors are flexible and this one is not, then just withdraw from her class. I'm sure that would be mutually beneficial, since I do not think you can recover your image in her eyes after this email. It's ok we all make mistakes, but I don't think this is a good prof-student fit. I do not think she is in the wrong either though. Grades won't make or break your career, but your ability to adapt to different professional standards and deal with unfavorable situations will determine a lot about your career. College is a safe spot to make these mistakes of tone, but it just displays sort of un-hireable quality.   \n\n\nAs someone with ADHD, I personally try to go for classes with as little homework as possible with heavy weighting on exams. I also get familiar with the late policies for each classes for any hw assignments so that I can choose to make the trade-off of submitting something late so that I can manage my time.  \n\n\nDeadlines are hard, but you either have to learn to deal with them or avoid them for the rest of your life. I say this coming from a supportive place. I'd say withdraw from that one class and if you think academia is not for you, then cut your losses and leave after this semester. You could go to trade school and start a career with good money and benefits.",

          "text": "I didnt send the email to the professor, it was to the person who makes my accommodations. I sent an follow up  email apologizing and saying why I feel this way \u201cSorry about that email\u2026 I sometimes just mentally cant do schoolwork sometimes. I get distracted or just feel so down that I can\u2019t do anything. I apologize, and I hope you understand how I feel. If you can\u2019t accommodate these, then maybe I have to drop out and take time for myself to figure things out.\u201d",

Take some responsibility for yourself. College is nothing like high school and you shouldn\u2019t expect it to be. Take some time off of college and work on yourself.",
