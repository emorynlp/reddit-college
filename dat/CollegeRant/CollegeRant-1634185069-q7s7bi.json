  "text": "I am a Sophomore in college and I am currently studying Environmental Engineering. I like the idea of becoming an engineer because i will be able to help with environmental problems we face. I would like to tackle the problem of plastics and their impact on the earth. However, I am not enjoying my college experience due to how much time I spend on school work. I don't have any real friends only classmates that talk to me during class. All they talk about is homework and classes they don't talk about anything real. On top of that I am already half way thru my first semester as a sophomore. I feel my college life just flying past me and I have no memoires to show for it, only fairly decent grades. \n\nI am just confused if all this means I need to reconsider my major or should I suck it up for the degree? I do think one alternative major is Environmental Sustainability. The thing is I mentioned this to my parents they immediately starting asking me what jobs will that degree get me. The truth is I dont know because I tried to search for jobs in that degree and I was not successful at all. I just dont want to switch my major and 10 years down the road regret it. While on the other hand I dont know if 10 years down the road I wish I would have switched majors.",
