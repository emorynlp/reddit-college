  "title:": "Anyone else feel like they're falling behind socially due to Covid?",
  "text": "TL;DR, I didn\u2019t put the effort into meeting people/making friends during my early years of college, and now Covid has thrown off my plans to make up for that this year. \n\nYeah, like the title says I feel like I haven\u2019t really had the college experience yet even though I\u2019m already a senior. And now, with Covid, I\u2019m paying the price and regretting some past decisions.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert so while I absolutely want to have close friendships and stuff, I never worked up the courage to put the effort in and actually meet people. \n\nI technically had a dorm room for a year, which should have helped, but my anxiety kicked in so I only stayed there maybe one or two weeks total because I kept going home for a couple more nights at a time. And I\u2019ve lived at home every year since for a variety of reasons.\n\nBut now with Covid, that\u2019s made me realize that almost all of my \u201csocial\u201d interactions were purely circumstantial, happening in class or at work. When I\u2019m not in those settings, it\u2019s nothing. So I have lots of people that I\u2019m friendly with when we\u2019re forced to be together, but outside of those settings I don\u2019t really have any true friends.\n\nI was going to put more effort into fixing that and finding some friends this year, but then Covid hit, so I\u2019m once again stuck living at home, with nobody else my own age. And all of my classes this semester are asynchronous, so I\u2019m not even meeting classmates/potential friends via Zoom. \n\nSince I\u2019m already a senior, I do still have a fifth year left but I still feel like this year was probably my last real opportunity to make those connections and then still have a year to just fully experience it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s making me really sad. I just want to do all the strereotypical cute college stuff \u2014 watch movies in my apartment with friends, go to a pumpkin farm/cider mill together, talk about life at 3 am, whatever it may be.\n\nI also feel like I\u2019m falling behind others with everything else too; since I don\u2019t really have friends, I\u2019ve also never been on a date or had my first kiss or anything (I\u2019m already 21!). \n\nIdk. I just really want to find my group of close friends that we can do everything together and be ourselves around each other and talk about anything and stuff with. Or even just any friends of any kind would be nice at this point tbh.",

I could cope and use social distancing as an excuse but that'd be a lie since people on my floor are having gatherings every day constantly and I'm pretty much the only one who's left out. They're nice to me, they just don't include me, which is fine.",

I know this entire year has been a bitter pill to swallow, to say the least, but we all just need a little optimism. \nI\u2019m optimistic that I\u2019ll make good friends and maybe even, if I can, start a serious relationship with someone. \nNot sure if that helps, but good luck to you! \nAnd to anyone who reads this, have a great day.",

      "text": "Idk your life but I feel like We\u2019re in a similar situation. It sucks so hard because I feel like we\u2019re always told or think that college is we\u2019re where gonna find our ride or die friends but for some people that\u2019s maybe not the case. Again, idk your sitch, but coming from someone who also works and goes to school but still lives at home, money is a b*tch. Sometimes those cute college friends are low key rich and they can afford to do fun instagrammable vacationy things. But we\u2019re the ones who gotta work and earn our keep. So if you\u2019ve got any good work friends, they\u2019re the ones you wanna keep. In my experience they\u2019re the ones who really get it. Cuz they\u2019re all college kids who\u2019re stuck living at home on zoom university too\ud83e\udd23",
