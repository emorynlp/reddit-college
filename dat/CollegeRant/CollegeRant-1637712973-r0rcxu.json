I\u2019ve had two for one class this semester and have the FOURTH today for another class lol. I guess any full-length exam that isn\u2019t the last of the semester is a midterm for them. Idk about other colleges or programs but this actually isn\u2019t unusual for my a lot of classes I\u2019ve taken in college.",

This is just for one class: data structures and algorithms. You just get used to not hanging out not doing anything fun in terms of social life.\n\nThere's a girl I've been trying to hang out with, but when she has a free weekend I'm too busy with assignments; if I have a time, she's too busy doing the same.",

      "text": "I've noticed that at some schools now any major exam is now titled as a \"midterm\" despite where it falls on the calendar. But in this case, based on your other comments, this IS a more traditional midterm, being worth 40% of your grade, so it is strange it's being given a week or 2 before classes end. I always tell my students that the purpose of a midterm is as a mid-semester \"check in\" more than anything else, but having it be this late doesn't give you much time or opportunity to self-evaluate or make significant changes.\n\nI wish more of my colleagues would stop and think about the impact of their decisions on their students, and maybe get some training in curriculum development as well.\n\nGood luck, OP. It sounds like you'll need it, unfortunately",

          "text": "The purpose of a midterm is to measure a students comprehension of a courses materials and identify areas that need work, via the conduction of an exam which may heavily affect the weight of an individuals grade (my midterm is weighted as 40% of my entire grade). To have this back to back with finals (weighted as another 40%), combined with a ton of other courses just seems messed up, and counter intuitive to making students learn the administered topics. Instead, we\u2019re faced with the prospect of finishing tasks and completing exams.",
