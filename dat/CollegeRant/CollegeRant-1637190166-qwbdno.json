He\u2019s super social and is good at making acquaintances but he doesn\u2019t really make friends it seems. And tbh I\u2019m fine with taking someone under my wing and introducing them to my friends, but it feels like he wants to be part of my group more so out of necessity and fear of being alone than actually wanting to be friends with me/my friends. He\u2019s always asking me where I\u2019m going to the point where I\u2019m actively avoiding him. I genuinely do feel bad for him but I don\u2019t like him and don\u2019t want to spend time w him. I really shoulda gotten a single  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Literally your RA is a resource for you. This is coming from an RA.  But yeah it's difficult living with someone you hangout with all the time",
