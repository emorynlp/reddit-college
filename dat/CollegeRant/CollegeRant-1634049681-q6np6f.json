  "text": "I'm in two upper-level programming classes that are kicking my ass right now. I panic as soon as I get assignments because the complexity of the programs seem beyond me. To make matters worse, there seems to be students in my classes who find all this stuff incredibly easy and they are very vocal about it. Every time the word \"easy\" gets brought up in class I die a little inside. I am beyond stressed out because these are the last two classes programming classes I need to take but they seem to be too difficult for me, but not for the rest of the students apparently. This shit is bad for my mental health and I feel *soooo* inadequate",

      "text": "This might not help at all but I 100% feel this. I feel so dumb sometimes and just the other day I was telling my family how college was already kicking my butt and someone said, \"Well aren't you just in the 101 beginner classes?\" and that made me feel like an idiot!!\n\nTo be completely honest though, everyone is different and everyone has a different way of learning. Just because someone else finds something easy doesn't mean that you need to as well. I am sure there is a multitude of other things that you may find easy that the other students in your class wouldn't understand at all. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nEveryone is learning-- that's why you are all in the class. I know it is far easier said than done, but you should stop being so hard on yourself! \n\nAs long as you are doing what you can (within reason), you should be proud of yourself.\n\nAnd, I know I am just a complete stranger, but *I* am proud of you!! \n\nI am so so sorry that you feel stressed out and inadequate--- I know that's tough. \n\nBut reading your post, I can see how much you care about this, and to me that says a lot in itself.\n\nI think you should just keep doing what you're doing and try your best to get through it.\n\nI believe in you!!\n\nGood luck!",

Application is so difficult, I wouldn\u2019t put too much into others saying things are easy. They probably struggle in private or have struggled with this previously and know how to do it due to past experiences, this is the first time you\u2019ve seen this stuff. Marathon not a race mentality has helped me a ton.",

It may be that a few critical concepts being shaky could be making the whole thing super overwhelming. There\u2019s no shame in getting some help.",
