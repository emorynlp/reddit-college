I just took a look at everything and turns out I didn\u2019t properly submit it so now it says \u201cnever submitted\u201d. I just emailed my professor explaining what happened so I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll email me back.\n\nFml.",

      "text": "Not to give you bad vibes but I had one teacher that hated my guts and argued on my final that was submitted online but somehow got corrupted (actually corrupted) and out of pure spite he failed me. I went to the ombudsman but they were also pretty stern on \"the file was corrupt, you didn't upload\". I had to graduate a semester later. It was the only class I had left.\n\nI smeared my chocolate sandwhich on his 3 series windshield and subscribed his home address to Jehova witness's mail list. Fuck you John you and your thermodynamics class can fuck right off.   \n\n\nI'm sorry to rant, I'm sure your professor will see that it was an accident, you'll get a second chance/second upload, I'm sure of it ;)",
