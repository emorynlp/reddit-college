  "text": " \n\nI don't know if this has happened to anyone else but I've struggle a lot in my investigative journalism class because I feel like everything i do is incorrect. Now, I do have an A in the class, but now is when we start to write our reports about our investigation, before we were just doing simple homework for our investigations like picking out a topic, etc. Even then, simple assignments had me at the brink of a panic attack cause i felt like i was gonna get an F every time I submitted. I can't even write one word in without thinking I'm stupid and that I'm gonna fail. I've had a few personal issues this semester and I haven't been giving my investigation my complete attention, so I feel like I'm off to a bad start. the professor has been telling us we are doing great but sometimes I feel like that doesn't apply to me. Its hard for me to focus, its hard for me to do work because i feel its not worth it. Everyone in my class seems more understanding of what they need to do and I'm the one struggling.\n\nJust Wanted to vent and get my feelings out there",
