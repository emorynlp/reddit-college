  "text": "I\u2019ve been going strong in my bio 3 lecture course  with a 98%. I have my final exam today so I decided to check out the syllabus again at the grading policy to see if the professor had A- (b/c not all teachers have to use this method of grading, it\u2019s optional). My prof decides to have A- set at 90.00 to 92.99%, I know it\u2019s not the biggest deal in the world but I have to get at least an 80% on my final to keep my 4.0; it\u2019s definitely motivating me to review all my notes/powerpoints but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the favor of the student.",
