  "text": "Hello everyone\n\nI come up to ask you guys about my research experience during lab. When you guys do research, do you guys know everything or instructor teach you to step by step?\n\nFor me, I never had any research experience or have never done research before so this semester is my very first time working in a research lab ( by saying working I did not get paid it's kind of more like I volunteer for the experience and recommendation letter). I feel that I kind of kept messing up and did not do perfectly like what my instructor expect me to. Then I have another problem, which was my lab partner which I feel uncomfortable with. At the beginning of the meeting, he keeps bragging that he has so many experiences in the lab and he is doing lots of other research and his research instructor is coming from UCSB ( he is an exchange student from Asia). He also announced that he will \"Train me \" =))) even though I never ask for it. \n\nThen things keep pile and pile up more for me. I did not see him being helpful for me in any aspect but rather than he push me to fit with his time schedule. He come into the lab, stole people's labcoat and keep asking me to take pictures for him in the lab coat while trying to do the experiment and claim that this is for his school. Then our instruction asks us to come on three days where he only comes two and asks me to cover up for him. I try to be understanding and yes I help him to do his part and after the lab, I come back and explain to him what we are doing today, updates, and stuff. and one Friday, he skips the lab just to go to LA, leaving me there trying to cover up his part. Not just that there is a Friday where he skip labs and went to UCSD to get into a lab and took a picture in the lab coat.\n\nThen the professor give us a task which was counting the cell for other members but on the first day of giving that task, I have stuff so I went home early, he did not tell me about it or update anything for me. Then the next day when I come to the lab, Professor told me about the task and I decided to clearly divide out the work when I will count on Monday ( he has class on Monday) and he will do it on Friday. And guess what? he pushes his Friday task on to me and claims that he has an important project. ( what's the point of having too many projects at one time and none of it is being done perfectly?)\n\nShould I just give up the lab at this point or continue? Our instructor is very busy and I don't want to annoy her with just small stuff like this but the more I try to understand and be flexible for him, I feel that the more he is stepping on me. I know that he was an exchange student and I really want to let him have a good experience in the USA and my school.",

      "text": "I'm going to be working in the human performance lab as a research assistant. I'm starting in one week, when my professor gets back after he's out of quarantine from having rona, and he's going to train me for a couple weeks before we actually get started with the project. He's kept me in the loop through the whole grant application and IRB process and after his project is complete we're going to be filing for a grant and an IRB on a project that I'm passionate about. You need to talk to your professor. It sounds like you're not getting what you want out of this. The whole point of undergrad research is to teach you about research. You need to talk to your professor about your partner too. It's not your job to cover for him. All it's going to do is burn you out and ruin what could be a very valuable learning opportunity.",

              "text": "No, honestly I knew nothing when I first walked into my professor's lab. It was a ton of equipment I had never seen or used before. He's super patient with me and had taught me a lot even before I was his research assistant. Right now, since he's out with the rona, he's been working with me through text, phone calls, and zoom to help me get started on writing my grant proposal for my experiment next semester and sending me videos and pictures to keep learning while he's gone. I will say, if your professor isn't interested in your success and making sure you're learning, you might talk to whoever is in charge of research for your department and ask if you can switch. Not all mentors are a good fit for everyone and there's no shame in switching if you aren't getting enough out of this. I'm also a little surprised you aren't being paid! That's a big time commitment for no money!",

Moreover, i really try to hold it in (start in Sept until now) I patiently wait for my instruction. But i can only quit I can't change other instructor because this is kind of like I email all of the professor in the bio department for a research opportunity and only this instructor reply.",
