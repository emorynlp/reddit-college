  "text": "I know most people are gonna say but that\u2019s because of covid but realistically it wasn\u2019t fun before covid. Unless you drink or party there isn\u2019t anything fun to do. Most of the parties I\u2019ve been to where boring and heavily depended on people being high or drunk and usually get shutdown extremely fast. If your in a serious major with a FASFA grant clubs and events at the college are virtually nonexistent, heck internships and undergraduate research is practically impossible. Also people who party and drink think about the consequences of your actions and how they will effect other people.",

I\u2019m only a sophomore (though i might as well still be a freshman cause my first year got cut short... thanks covid) and it\u2019s literally the most boring shit ever. I\u2019m more comfortable and happy at home than I was at that campus. Anyone who says college was the best four years of their lives lied. Even before the pandemic I spent most of my time doing work, studying, you know what school is actually for. parties sucked & were kept secret so I didn\u2019t attend. Clubs are intensely religious even though my uni isn\u2019t religious so that\u2019s no fun either. There\u2019s more fun shit to do around my uni (it\u2019s in a city) than in it (but i haven\u2019t made any friends at my uni so ofc i haven\u2019t been anywhere). I probably won\u2019t be able to study abroad either which is what i was looking forward to the most, cause I\u2019m graduating early next year (to gtfo this place, ofc) & this virus isn\u2019t budging so imo college is a complete scam. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i don\u2019t know how people find a work-fun balance with all these assignments we\u2019re being handed. And i certainly don\u2019t know how people can find college fun or get obsessively attatched to it like we Americans do. Wish I could be doing something that truly makes me happy.",

There was a clear correlation between my friends that had a positive experience and how many people they met and got along with (I went to a state uni where a lot of people from my hometown went). People that didn\u2019t make friends were so miserable they usually transferred. I was fortunate to live on a dorm floor of people my freshman year that were extremely friendly, fun, and in the same program as me. There\u2019s about 30 of us and we are all still good friends 5 years later. I live with 3 of them right now lmao. Big parties are WAY too stressful (an MIP would have been endgame for me in terms of loans/scholarships, my family can\u2019t help me) and honestly not fun at all. Reasonable get togethers with people you actually know who don\u2019t care if you drink or do drugs or not?? Amazing! We had a catan night and a card game night every week last year lmao, good times.\n\nEdit: the majority of people who party and drink do so responsibly. Me being drunk and enjoying myself after a long ass week of work and school affects... no one. Don\u2019t get upset with people for doing what they have every right to do with their free time just because your experience isn\u2019t the same as theirs.",

I really don\u2019t mean this in a rude way, but you\u2019re not as different  as you seem to think. I don\u2019t know what has happened to you in your life that has made you distrust others so much, it must have been fucked up whatever it was and I\u2019m sorry, but I promise you that people exist that share the same interests and general opinions as you. A key part of life is human connection, whether you are introverted or extroverted ([(social interaction appears to be good for your physical and mental  health as well, with meaningful relationships being more strongly correlated with better health, brain function, and longevity than even financial background).](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/can-relationships-boost-longevity-and-well-being). Feeling like you are the only one that feels the way you do and isolating yourself as a result is draining as hell, I\u2019ve been there. You can interact positively with people without putting your complete trust in them as well. Either way, I hope things look up for you soon :)",

There's a reason therapists are often paid the big bucks, too - it ain't an easy job (and it is just that - a job - a professional occupation that requires many years of highly specialized training to excel in, just like med school). \n\nIf you're expecting some stranger on the internet to do that work for you for free... well, I'll just say you seem to have some very unrealistic ideas about how conversations work (and people, more generally). You can't force people to \"just listen\" like some kind of doll. If that's what you want, might as well find an imaginary \"friend.\" Ain't nobody's obligation to be anyone else's emotional dumping ground.",

All the low-income kids that are dependent on scholarships and FAFSA grants/loans can't risk losing everything they worked for over being involved with underage drinking and illegal (even if they shouldn't be) drugs, when we'll be able to do that just fine when we graduate in a few years (assuming you started college at 17-18, you'll be turning at least 21-22 the year of graduation).\n\nWhat I will disagree with you on is that college couldn't be fun before covid. Pre-covid, you at least were able to hang out with people in your classes and bond over stupid things like that professor that's overly hard or that one inside joke on campus about some building being underappreciated or that one place in the food court having the best (insert good food here) that anyone's ever had.\n\nNot to mention if you were stuck in a boring major because you chose money over passion (hello FAFSA squad!) there were still opportunities to explore other hobbies. For example, I really like reading and writing, and apparently my college would hold several open-mic events throughout the year but not now because of COVID.\n\nFinally it was a lot easier to make friends (or maybe even more) because again, there are much more opportunities to talk with your peers outside of a class setting where you had to be professional and stay on topic with whatever you were supposed to be discussing in the Zoom room.",

A lot of classes can be related to something going on currently or will help you understand somethig in the future. \n\nAlso party's shouldn't be what makes college fun. Work party's can be just as crazy as college party's so it's not exclusively a college thing. \n\nFor a lot of people college isn't fun, it's not going away to a dorm and partying all semester and coming home for maybe the summer. It's a lot of the bullshit people don't like, working while going to school, pulling all nighters, and mental crashes. \n\nDepending on the classes you take college can break a person easily.",
