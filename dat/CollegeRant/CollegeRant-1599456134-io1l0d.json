  "text": "I'm currently in my senior year of college and started considering if going to graduate school would be a good idea for me.\n\nA few google searches later, I am thoroughly discouraged from even considering it. Not only do you need to write several essays, bug professors for recommendation letters, retain an average 3.0 gpa throughout all four years of school, and put yourself several thousand more dollars in debt, but you also have to take a bullshit entrance exam that's basically a more annoying SAT? Fuck that. God forbid I don't know what the word \"sycophantic\" means, or what the answer to a shittily-worded math question is. Shouldn't it be enough that we fucking *graduated?* \n\nI feel like this same thing could be said for any form of standardized testing, but this just seems completely unnecessary for something like graduate school.",

      "text": "I found a sort of workaround by accident. Some colleges drop all of those requirements if you already hold a masters degree. I went to Western Governors University which requires no letters or test grades to enter most masters programs. I completed their MSML program in one term (6 months) with a scholarship paying for $2500 of $3400. Its a management degree that I needed to get a promotion for a job in my department that\u2019d allow me to earn enough money to get the degree I really wanted from the school I wanted. Turns out the school I want to get into waves all regular Application requirements of one already possess is a masters degree. So instead of needing to get three recommendations (two professors and one professional), GRE scores, 3.5 GPA and a 4.0 scale, transcripts, submitting a writing sample of 10 pages, and a personal statement\u2014I can just submit my transcripts. \n\nIt seems like a long workaround, but I\u2019m excited for it. I didn\u2019t plan it that way, and I\u2019m not sure if planning it that way is advantageous or not but if you\u2019re interested that might be a way? Lol. My Experience was completely by accident, and I\u2019ll use the MSML degree regardless. I learned a lot and it was a great program. WGU is a college that just tries to break down the barriers to education, like expensive testing ,overpriced programs, etc. Not all masters programs allow for application requirements to be partially or completely waived, but I would look into the colleges that you are interested in and see if that something that they offer. You might be able to find a workaround with applying with a graduate certificate completed. Sometimes those entrance requirements can be waived if one shows work toward the Masters program theme by way of graduate certificate as well. In my experience most graduate certificate programs don\u2019t have Extensive application requirements.\n\nNote: I\u2019m very sleepy after a long day and used voice to text.  I hope this makes sense lol \ud83d\ude34",

However I feel like the GREs are just completely unnecessary, mainly because in my program I've already had to take several math courses and many more science electives which require some knowledge in scholarly writing for research and lab assignments. From those classes I already know how to write intellectually and use mathematical skills to solve problems and learn from them. To me it seems like the GRE holds no other purpose than to hold potential candidates back.",

I\u2019ve take the GRE and it is difficult but doable it\u2019s more of a way to test if people can handle hard work but it doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with work ethic or understanding, some people aren\u2019t good test takers but you still need a way to gage that.

For that reason I can understand why many schools still require it. Either way I just wish potential grad students didn't have to worry about more standardized testing just to continue their education.",
