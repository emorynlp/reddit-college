  "title:": "So fucking tired of group work",
  "text": "This shit is exhausting and it's so fucking stressful that my grade feels like it's not my own.\n\nI have a community project group for one class and absolutely no one contributes on anything until the last possible second. No one answers canvas messages or group texts. We're almost done with the semester and some kid last week texted me to ask what we're supposed to have been doing this whole time. *how the fuck* are you in your third year of college and still this fucking *out of it*? I made myself the point of contact for that group because I trust no one else to turn in the work or do a quality job, and they have me up until midnight every fucking due date because \"Oh I had work and couldn't start my part until now\" or \"Oh I wasn't sure when it was due\". I've started telling them that I won't accept contributions past 10 pm on the due date because I don't think it's my job to deprive myself of sleep before early morning shifts just because they can't manage their time. Of course that makes me the asshole. The TA has been useless and I'm honestly ready to talk to the prof.\n\nMy other class is all group work. Group assignments, group projects, group papers, and group exams. Nothing can be done independently and it is *so stressful*. No one communicates. They either do the work without you or they leave you to do it without them. They talk over you in the meetings or they feel the need to mansplain everything you say, or they say nothing and do nothing and leave it up to you to make sure things get finished. \"Just making sure you got my name on there.\" *GFY*.\n\nAnd then there's my chem lab partner who is *driving me fucking crazy*. We're there 30+ mins after everyone leaves because she is so anal about every single thing. Won't let me contribute but stops to text or have a random conversation with the lab TA every few minutes. If I move on with the work she feels the need to redo it anyway. Recleans my glassware. Rescans my IR. Frequently just takes things out of my hands because she \"likes to do it\" but does it all outside of the hood and gives me a panic attack with how careless she is. Somehow manages to get acid on herself every lab. I feel like I'm in hell.\n\nOf course I'm grateful to work with people who are smart. My partner knows more about chemistry than I do and she's helpful with assignments when she does them on time. I'm just tired of my grades being tied down by the productivity or lack thereof in people I don't even know. I always thought that people would be more serious in college but it's basically middle school for privileged narcissists. Everyone thinks they're slick just skirting by, riding on the work of others, missing assignments here and there and burning the rest of their group while they do it. Everyone thinks they're too smart to actually have to pay attention to instructions and manage their time on projects. It's obnoxious. Not to mention profs expect you to set aside way too much time outside of class. My school day ends at 10 pm pretty much every night now. I'm so tired of it.",

      "text": "Ik exactly how you feel. I was dealing with the same during my freshman year in college. Nobody was helping with anything till the last week it was due and during that time it was all wrong and even the chat room the school use for us students was filled with nonsense of a party happening and a fight that was going to happen (Etc). This is why I always contact my professors and send them proof of the work I've done and what little to no work they've done and the messenges they was sending out.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry! This has been the worst, especially the last part \u201cprofs expect you to set aside way too much time outside of class.\u201d \nOne of my profs had one day split between recorded lectures posted to canvas and in person lecture. This was supposed to make it so we only had one hour of in person and 20-30 minute recorded. But that one day is twice as long now because nothing has ever come out correctly\u2026 over two hour in person and at least an hour long recording.\nOne of my other classes is online only, and not much better in comparison. We met twice a week, plus recorded lectures, individual and group assignments due each week, discussion posts\u2026 \nOn top of trying to be there for every school related thing, I work a retail job and I have an internship. \nMy anxiety has been insane this quarter and I can\u2019t wait for it to be over \u2014 but I\u2019m also scared because I\u2019m on scholarships. I need to pass and I wish it was just on me instead of groups or partners.",

      "text": "Yeah, it's very frustrating. The worst part I think is just the lack of communication. Parts are assigned out and there's nothing back. Not even an, \"Ok, I'll work on it then.\" Just silence so you are wondering whether someone is working on it or are they fucking off til the last minute and then pushing it off on others or what? Even worse is waiting until the last fucking minute for an assignment where the work can be separated out in less than 5 minutes but nobody wants to get back to you.",

          "text": "RIGHT LIKE OH MY GOD. Literally spending half my time this semester in zooms where people just idiotically zone out or misread the problems like the assignments are 5 questions each. That's it. Somehow they take up all my time just because people don't know how to organize themselves and communicate. I wish so badly I could just do it by myself but I'd be missing points because \"scientists need to know how to collaborate\".",

I always get the final report to proofread and it's full of errors and I had to edit twice in the library 2 hours before it was due because they handed it last minute and we had to finish it up and print it. The thing is when you tell them that we should probably start working in little chunks early so it can get done gradually and stress free they think you're a crazy stressed out study person and then they say \"calm down we have time\". No we don't if we're working at your pace.",
