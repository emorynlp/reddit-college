Or go seek out clubs? \n\nRe academics - are you still Redditting and watching youtube during your studies/homework? Gone to tutoring/TA's and professors? \n\nAlso, why are you lying when you posted that you got into a party and drank alcohol?",

      "text": "For some reasons, several girls and their friend group completely ignores me irl despite never spoken to their friends groups in my life. The reason being is that I dmed those girls before college started so I can get a head start on making friends and not be lonely. I was never romantically interested in any of the girls so I never made a move on them and despite that, they treat me so weirdly irl. Girls are so confusing.",
