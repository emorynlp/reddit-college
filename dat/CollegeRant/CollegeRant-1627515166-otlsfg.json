  "title:": "I have a years worth of credits, but rather than have me be a year advanced, they are trying to giving me a more \u201crelaxed\u201d schedule, and it only got worse when I trued to fix it.",
  "text": "So I just graduated, class of 2021, and throughout my high school career I have amassed many credits, through college credit classes, an AP class, and taking actual college courses through a nearby college my senior year; all of which were accepted by my college.  I am planing on going into medicine which will have me in college around 8 years (4 pre-med + 4 med), so I decided I wanted get a year out of the way.  Fast forward to me making my schedule, rather than give me that year, they want to have me take a more relaxed schedule for my college career, and when I asked if I could get my pre-med done in 3 years, which I have the credits for, they said I would have to take a strict schedule consisting of little free time and many summer classes; I\u2019m not looking for a cake walk, but I\u2019m also not looking for a tight packed schedule, I just want normal.  After this they referred me to a separate advisor, who I would email day off; the email I sent him was of my current predicament, along with if there was anything could do to help sort anything out.  This man doesn\u2019t message me back for 2 days, this isn\u2019t even the weekend, and when he finally responds he has the audacity to act like an ass, saying that my email wasn\u2019t appropriate for an email (even though I was just trying to catch him up on what is happening) along with other things I won\u2019t get into at the moment; just know when I showed my dad the email, he was extremely pissed after hearing how this guy talked.  There were other things as well, however this was one of the biggest things at the moment.  Thank you to anyone who is reading this, as I wouldn\u2019t normally post anything like this, but the way this college has treated me in the past couple weeks has pissed me off a lot.\n\nEdit:  Thank you to all those who responded, with it being my first year there are many things I still don\u2019t know, so all of the info was helpful; this goes for both the positive and negative comments.  Although it was just me ranting, the feedback was great, when it comes to information.\n\nTL;DR  I got referred to an advisor who is an ass after trying to get my schedule to be normal.",

      "text": "If you are pre-med take your time, seriously. You want a high GPA, you want to be able to do research, do service, do shadowing, you want to be involved on campus and be a leader. Oh AND take the MCAT.\n\nThat's really hard to do in 4 years, it's almost impossible to do in 3. College is not high school, while you might have a few easier classes, those science classes will be harder.\n\nKeep in mind most people do a gap year after college, so that they are applying with 4 years of activities and experience, instead of 3.\n\nIs the special advisor a pre-med advisor? Some schools have great ones, others do not.  If you are at a big school, you might need to fend for yourself. Look for the health professions advisor's office, it's probably on their website.",

But either way I'm sorry you're having to be your own advocate. I've definitely been there with some teachers.",

Well I don't know how you feel about this or the area you are in, but some community colleges can get you started then you can transfer and finish the rest at a different college. Even with becoming a doctor and it will be cheaper for you and possibility of a huge transfer scholarship depending on your grades and involvement. Just a thought. But hopefully you find something that works for you even if you stay. Don't be opposed to taking out student loans because there are definitely some places or grants that will help you pay them later.",

My best advise is to talk to someone a year or two ahead of you in the same program. My other thought is if you didn't take ALL the credits for your freshman year in high school, you aren't a year ahead. You might have a years worth of credits but if they aren't the specific ones for your freshman year curriculum it will most likely take you just as long but with a somewhat reduced course load. This is because classes often have prerequisites. For my degree the chain of prerequisites starts the first semester. Its definitely possible to graduate early but I would take it normal for at least the first semester.",

I will usually give out primo advice one time, twice if you are respectful, but if you REFUSE to accept high-end guidance, or if you are straight disrespectful (which is disturbingly common), then best of luck should you find yourself in a jam, need something signed, need a seat in a closed course, whatever.
