      "text": "The problem with paying teachers more is that tuition would probably increase because, a lot of schools fund research, projects, and campus stuff. So finding a realistic approach, which I am not opposed of in the slightest, is tricky. \n\nThe college system is no longer aimed to educate. It\u2019s there to act as a proxy in a multinational modern \u201cspace-race\u201d to see who can innovate the fastest.\n\nNo one should ever pay thousands of dollars to attend a single class. Especially when you can Google all of it. The justification or value isn\u2019t there. Going into debt is no longer a fear. It\u2019s a reality and sets people back from contributing to society as a whole. It prevents people who\u2019re in  poverty from reaching said goals because, there\u2019s a natural \u201cprice\u201d barrier on education. \n\nI don\u2019t think that education should be free but, these elaborate campuses to make up for the lack of instruction need to go. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s crazy how unprepared colleges make you when it comes to computer science or any stem field. You literally have to spend months studying after you got out of college. \n\nIt feels like 4 years is a waste. General Ed classes are a joke. They do not contribute to \u201cwell roundedness\u201d. They make the school richer. Having to take 12 credit hours of history or dance electives, etc is complete and total bullshit even for a STEM major and respectfully, I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about any of those classes. If it doesn\u2019t directly relate to my field or can get me a job, it serves zero relevance to me. \n\nWhich is crazy. These days, that\u2019s considered a radical mindset while paying upwards of $40K a year is considered \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cjustified\u201d. \n\nAs the years go on, the education system will most certainly fail to adapt as we progress further into advancement. The fact that Google, etc are all widely available for free and accomplish the same thing is starting to finally desaturate the stigma of going to college.\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of holding said people accountable. Unfortunately, no one really cares enough to do it and college kids are on the lowest of anyone\u2019s priority list. \n\nI don\u2019t even like Bernie Sanders but, shout-out to him. He may be radical about making college free but, at least he\u2019s thinking about us. It\u2019s the thought that counts I guess.",
