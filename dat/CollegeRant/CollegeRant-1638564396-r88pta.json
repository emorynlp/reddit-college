  "text": "I'm currently going to a community college. I started out doing a networking admin degree but hated Cengage Mindtap so much and wasnt learning anything that I switch majors to Computer Programming. Turns out they used Pearson's myprogramminglab. I switched majors again and got a degree in Business back in May. I switched majors so many times but didn't lose ANY credits somehow so lucky me. Long story short I haven't had any luck finding a good-paying job so I'm thinking about going back to do welding. I was looking at the book list at the bookstore and EVERY class uses Cengage Mindtap. Welding, using Mindtap??? My mind is officially blown. I'm debating whether or not I want to go forward at this point. I'd appreciate any pointers you can give me.",

          "text": "Essentially they're still stuck with 1990s basics and charge 200 dollars or more to access their courses, after you've already paid for them through the college. On top of that, I feel like most third party learning software is made with the intention that the student is just doing that course and not any others.\n\nI've put in 138 hours in my Microsoft App course (which I've taken and passed before, but due to transfer red tape, my school is forcing me to take it again) and I'm not doing as well as I'd hope because while Canvas says my grade is a 96%, I just looked at my canvas grade and it says I have a 78%.\n\nSo not only are there numerous communication issues with the software, but there are also numerous issues in how it teaches you. I like to liken it to a keyring with a thousand keys to open 1 door. Too explain further, Microsoft Apps are pretty forgiving, but Cengage forces you to use 1 key of those thousand different methods to accomplish a task.\n\nFor example, say you're being told to copy and paste something? Surprise! you can't use keyboard shortcuts and get it **wrong** if you do, with no forewarning. Alright, so if that doesn't work go to the home section and find the copy and paste button? Also f\\*\\*king **wrong**. Can you use the search bar? **Wrong**. What about right clicking it? **Wrong**. Turns out you have to highlight it, wait a full second or five (because that's how slow this \"revolutionary learning program\" is for something so basic. Now think of those seconds added to everything you do) , and then finally have the \"quick\" help box pop up. Finally you can use that copy button without getting it wrong. Success right? **Wrong**. Now you've got to figure out how it wants it pasted.\n\nThat's just one example. There are 25 of them in tests. And about 50 tests, 25 projects, 10 major exams, and around 1,000 pages required reading material. Now imagine doing all of this *twice,* though now it's in conjunction with computer networking, business law and accounting.",

      "text": "Cengage f**king sucks lmao. I\u2019m taking Spanish and almost all of the work is on Cengage. Not only did I have to pay $120 out of my own pocket for a semester subscription for Cengage\u2014 it has genuinely been making me almost regress in my language skills. The modules and exercises are lazy and unchallenging and pretend to teach u language skills (or whatever subject skills ur class focuses on) by asking you to complete true/false statements, fill in the blanks and word banks\u2014 all of which are cheap ways to pretend ur making useful progress, when in reality you might be getting very good at learning how mimic ur language/subject skills on a computer screen but when it comes to actually applying those skills to real world situations like literally speaking the language out loud in simple conversation or using other skills to for some actual purpose, u realize that applying ur knowledge to online prompts and exercises is not the same as using ur knowledge to actually achieve some useful goal. Cengage literally leads u away from the skills u actually want to develop bc it makes u believe what ur learning is actually say Spanish, or Marketing, or Business or whatever the subject is\u2014 but in reality Youre j learning how to answer pointed questions abt basic Spanish knowledge, basic marketing knowledge or basic business knowledge\u2014 you\u2019re not learning how to apply that knowledge to applicable/useful skills. And this is v frustrating for someone like me who genuinely wants to learn Spanish, like I wanna drop the class cuz 90% of the work is thru Cengage and like 5% actually involves me speaking out loud. It rlly shows how they created this system w profit in mind rather than profit and benefit to students.",
