  "text": "Hear me out\u2026 recently I\u2019ve been sick with a gnarly sinus infection thats made me miss a few days of classes, including a lab. I emailed my professor (with a doctors note) asking how I should prepare for the missed labs. Nothing. No response. I went to check the syllabus and lo-and-behold, doctors notes are not allowed and makeup labs are not allowed. You would think in a time of a global pandemic that teachers would be more understanding of students getting sick. While I don\u2019t have COVID, getting sicker is not something that I\u2019m too keen about. I officially have a 25% in the lab, all thanks to missing ONE class. I\u2019ll try and talk to my professor, as I\u2019m also marked absent from a class that I attended and completed the lab.",
