  "text": "When I was growing up, my parents always believed I had the best shot of getting to a top university out of everyone in our family. I had mostly As in tough AP courses and pretty high SAT scores during High School. Then senior year, a medication I was on made me severely depressed and I failed nearly all of my courses. I barely got my diploma. Almost every university I applied to rejected me that spring, even my state's flagship school. To tell the truth it still bothers me.\n\nThis continued for another year at a state university that admitted me. I dropped out summer of 2019, came home, and began attending a local community college. I am finally off that medication and I'm doing well in my CS classes now. But the damage is already done. All but one of the transfer schools I applied to last year rejected me. I assume this is because I failed all my courses freshman year at my first college, before I pulled out. These weren't like Ivy Leagues either, just really good public schools in my region.\n\nThe local school that I am attending this fall is decent, don't get me wrong. Great CS and cybersecurity program in my opinion. Fantastic location for fintech internships, and the tech hub for a pretty huge company is opening here soon. But I still feel like a fucking failure y'all... because I am. How else do you describe what I did? I failed. I see all the people I knew in high school attending Cornell and UNC and Bowdoin and Duke... ugh. There is this constant sense of inferiority that I cannot shake. It's like no matter how hard I try, I will always be fucked because the vast majority of super successful people seem to attend elite schools for undergrad. Sorry if I sound stuck-up! I just want to get over this lmao.",

      "text": "Considering the other two commentors pretty much said it all, and I'm also scrolling through reddit about to fall asleep, I just want to say one thing, and that is that doctors do not know everything so trust yourself and do your research if you feel your medicine they tell you to take is messing you up. Always check side effects, and always speak up. I learned the hard way that doctors do not know if you will have side effects or what they may be or how bad they may be. I had a somewhat similar situation to you, only I was already in college. My medication made me severely depressed to the point I could not get myself to do things I formerly enjoyed and I was actually doing bad things to see if it would make me feel anything at all. The doctor assured me the meds could not made me feel that way. I ended up medically withdrawing from the semester, saying fuck the doctor and titrating off my meds the proper way (always be careful about stopping meds without Dr supervision, blah blah blah) and when I was finished titrating off the meds I WAS FUCKING HAPPY for the first time in months. And it stayed that way. Moral of the story - doctors don't know everything and trust yourself and most importantly do your damn research. But you sound intelligent enough I trust you will do your research. Good luck.",

      "text": "So, first things first, as disclosure, I didn't really shop around for schools much because I grew up in a city with a decent university which gave me the opportunity to stay with most of my friends and family while saving absurd amounts of money. This is to say that I don't have the experience of really dealing with the rejection of schools, but I do know what it's like to come out the other side from a middle tier school. Do elite schools get you further than a mid tier school? To an extent, but what really matters is the skills you build, the ability to market yourself, and the ability to differentiate yourself; things that can be done without the help of a nice school. Focus on less where you are going with your school and more about where you want to go with your career; find part time work that can help push you to your desired career path, network with people inside and outside of university, take internships, and work to get decent grades. \n\nWith my middle tier school and a liberal arts degree I have landed a pretty nice job at the corporate level of a company that is the third biggest in its industry and a household name in probably 2/3rds of the US. Hell, before COVID really changed the nature of my work, I considered it a dream job. Once you get your first job, your university schooling matters a lot less. I've been interviewing for new jobs and no one has asked me about my schooling at all. A lot of jobs are even now waiving degree requirements if one has sufficient experience in the relevant field(s) which goes to show just how much culture is changing around degree prestige. I know that doesn't numb the pain of rejection right now, but all this is to say that, in the grand scheme, it doesn't matter that much unless your goal in life is to become a big politician and I hope there is comfort for you in that fact.",

      "text": "Hello there!\n\nSorry that you have been feeling down. Sometimes I feel like a loser because I see other people I knew graduating and getting jobs at good companies while I'm currently in jobs with low pay and no benefits. It wasnt always this bad, just that the pandemic ruined good opportunities in my field. So I've been feeling down more than usual.\n\nI also had high grades and got good ACT and SAT scores during my senior year. I qualified for the state's full ride tuition program. Sadly because of my immigration status (DACA) universities denied giving me the scholarship which I earned (greedy bastards lol).\n\nBut small isnt bad because I obtained more opportunities through the small community colleges and trade schools. Honestly I enjoyed my time more at the community college and trade school because the professors actually taught and want to see their students succeed. \n\nWhen I finally entered engineering school I was extremely disappointed. You have to basically teach yourself from free Youtube videos because the professors who you pay an expensive tuition for dont teach. Everyone is so competitive and it is hard to make friends. Eventually I also realized that the curriculum taught at big universities are probably the same as the state universities. This is more true if you are doing an ABET accredited program. Every school out there needs to be accredited, which means that all schools must meet certain criteria in their curriculum. The exception is for-profit schools, which have screwed so many students over due to lack of accreditation.\n\nSounds like you're doing great. Apply for internships ASAP. Job experience matters more than the prestigious college in the current workplace. After all, even in prestigious colleges you will need to be related to a politician or a CEO to have a real head start in career. Everyone else who is just from a working class will have to compete for the same jobs as graduates from the state universities.",
