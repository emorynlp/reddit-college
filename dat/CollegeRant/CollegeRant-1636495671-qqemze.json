  "text": "I\u2019m shocked at how lazy some students who are older than me are. I\u2019m also pissed when professors say \u201cI\u2019m going to let you pick your own groups, so there is no excuses\u201d\u2026 makes no difference when almost everyone doesn\u2019t know each other.\n\nWe have a project and I\u2019m in a group of 5 and besides them handing in quick model drafts (looked like they spent a total of 10 minute) they did pretty much nothing else at all. I been left to do everything while having a job and 7 other courses.\n\nSo annoyed and pissed but I don\u2019t want to be \u201cthat dude who snitched\u201d, so I just bite my tongue and endure it because I might have to see them in my last 3 semesters.  Please, if your a student who behaves this way, think about the person who is doing all the work and their feelings.\n\nRant over\u2026..",

      "text": "Naw I would've snithed and sent proof. This happen to me before and it was a week before the project was due and nobody was helping me or sending out their parts. So I took the initiative and took screenshot of the chats we all was in of what they was talking about or doing (side note the chat was for school use only and monitor by staff and T. A but I wanted to make sure the professor knew this as well and I never really chated in the chat cuz two of the girls in my group got into a argument over he said she said mess.) long story short I got full credit and everybody else received F's. Group project was 45% of out grade and it was part of of exam.",
