  "title:": "I am a Computer Science Major. This is my story.",
  "text": "I am a Freshman this year, but, I have enough credits to be a sophomore. Basically, I was able to complete college classes in high school. In my JUNIOR year I took CS 1400. The introductory course into Computer Science and I loved and understood it. I even got an A. However, at the college I chose to attend, the CS 1400 course was taught in a different programming language than the one I learned the class in, so my advisor advised me to take the class again, but the accelerated version. She said I wouldn't have any problems what so ever. Flash forward to today. I am two weeks away from the end of the class, but I am stressing out because I DO NOT understand the assignments in my class. They are UNGODLY hard. I looked up my professor in rate my professor and... basically every other student that has had this guy says the SAME THING. (And only 44% of his students would take the class again.) The assignments are hard as hell. I have struggled for a few weeks wondering if Computer Science is the right major for me or not, but it seemed like the perfect fit. I love technology and programming. I understand what we talk about in the class, but then I get to the assignments and I get so confused my head starts spinning. He doesn't teach us enough to know how to even complete the assignments and I end up having to try and read the documentation or google search for what I need to be doing, and keep in mind: I HAVE TAKEN THIS CLASS BEFORE AND GOT AN A. At this rate I truly am concerned about what my next steps should be, but ultimately I think I am going to hang in there, because this is what I want to study and do for a career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: My Into CS Assignments are extremely hard and every other student that has had this professor says the same thing.",

      "text": "What do you think of your other programming classes? I've definitely have had my fair of shitty teachers that make things unappetizing but I think that your true preferences will come out in a class that you actually start understanding things and can accurately judge programming. Plus, programming is a very wide and has a lot of variety so even if you don't like one language you could do a different one",

              "text": "Oh god yeah python is definitely different than C++! It makes sense that you'd struggle a bit with no prior knowledge. Does your college offer any tutoring or have a student support center? Professors are normally pretty good about emailing students who come to them with questions. Does your teacher have office hours? When I struggled in my classes I would show up to office hours to get some 1 on 1 help.",
