  "text": "I didn\u2019t even do bad in my classes, I just hated them all. I\u2019m a bioengineering major and I love biology, anatomy, physiology, and chemistry. This semester I just had to take physics computer science and calculus requirements and i just hated them all. Had shitty professors this semester too. I didn\u2019t have any interest in my classes, loathed going every day. At least its almost over. I\u2019m just sad lol, like this semester I was so depressed and tired.",
