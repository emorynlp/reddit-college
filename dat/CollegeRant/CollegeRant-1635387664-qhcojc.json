  "text": "like why are people so standoffish?? why does every interaction feel like a business transaction? i don't think i'm doing anything or presenting myself in any way that makes others uncomfortable so i don't know why people always act like this? i'm in so many group projects this quarter and people literally only text about school-related stuff and it's supposed to be one of the ways you make friends so what am i doing wrong? fucking ugh",

      "text": "I think it's great you're still trying to make friends, don't get discouraged! Find a club that sounds interesting or try volunteering, you're destined to meet some friendly people that way.\n\nYou never know who you meet today will be tomorrow. It's all about who you know not what you know.\n\nYou can do it!\n\nI think a lot of people tend to stand-off for various reasons. Technology addiction, underlying beliefs, different priorities, past experiences, and the list goes on. Don't worry about them, you gave them a chance and that's their loss. Go be someone else's gain that's worth your friendship.",
