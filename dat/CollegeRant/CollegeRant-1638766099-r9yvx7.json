  "text": "I have done the reading and everything but I\u2019m on the verge of a panic attack every time  I sit down to write it. \n\nI have this narrative that I believe I am so stupid and need to have these high standards for myself. I\u2019m so hard on myself for no reason. But I do fine academically but I\u2019m so fixated on what I failed at.  \n\nTLDR: I panic every time I start a paper.",

          "text": "A timer is your friend. Also, separate your writing and editing time. Writing time should happen when you're clear-headed, got enough sleep, and have a decent chunk of uninterrupted time. Editing can come when you have less time and energy. \nFor example, you might set a timer for one hour to write. Tell yourself that this time is for getting your big ideas down and organized only. No agonizing over a single sentence. A few days later, you may only have 20 minutes during an evening. That time can be used to re-read and edit. \n\nNo one's writing is great on the first try. I say that as a professor and published author who teaches writing and STILL struggles to get started. The goal should not be a perfect first draft. You want a polished final draft.",

      "text": "How much time do you have? What kind of paper is this, and for what class? If I had 4 days, my approach would be to to open a page in word, and write the most important points I can think of in complete sentences.  \n\nLets say I wrote 8 sentences. I'll keep my font Times New Roman 12pt, but restrict the lines spacing to single. I find that this helps me more easily see where my ideas are going, and it helps me to stop checking how much more I have to write. (Seriously, when I start writing in double-line spacing, I get very distracted).\n\nAim to address two of your main points in full on one page everyday like this, and you'll be done in 4 days, with more than enough text you can cut down. Highlight all, format to double space, and you have 8 pages. Slap together your summary and intro on your last day based on what you wrote along with any extra text, ~5 sentences each. Keep it simple. Run it through grammarly before you reread. You can easily get this done by spending 1 to 1.5 hours on it a day without rushing.",

Writing is all about editing, so the more you delay due to perfectionism, the more you sabotage the final project. \n\nThe good news is, writing is the best way to challenge your perfectionism, because all writing starts with a shitty first draft. Try the pomodoro method if you are blocked, and then just plow your way through the first three paragraphs. Do something relaxing, and if you have time, come back the next day and do a quick revise of those and write three more. Do this until it\u2019s done, set it aside, and then come back fresh and revise again.  \n\nThe thing with writing is that you usually can only find your argument and the shape of your paper by writing it. This is why the first draft is necessary. Take the pressure off that first draft by just telling yourself, \u201cThis is my shitty first draft where I think through my ideas.\u201d",

Not saying you need to get high, but have some warm tea, a nice snack, and just sit down in a comfy Environment and write. Having a good outline was crucial for me. If it\u2019s a rough draft just let your ideas flow. Just try your best ok? I get overthinking as It\u2019s plagued me my college journey. Especially if it\u2019s a rough draft don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Don\u2019t focus on your failures as those only make you stronger. Keep pushing I know you can do it! \n\nAlso go to your schools tutoring center, office hours, and utilize online resources. Purdue owl has some great resources for MLA formatting as well if your paper needs it. Good luck!!! I\u2019m rooting for you.",
