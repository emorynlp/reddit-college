  "text": "So I'm not the best student my GPA is having out around 3.27 at the moment and most my grades for courses are Bs and As. But one course, I took during 2020 pandemic while working full time, I have a solid C in and while I'm not made or anything, it is bothering me to the core that I got a C and everything else is Bs and As. Should I retake it to improve my GPA? Or should i get this Bs over with after 3 long stressful near suicidal years???",
