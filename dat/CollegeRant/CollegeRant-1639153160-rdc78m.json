  "text": "Like it feels like going to a prestigious university can hurt your future because your competition is so much tougher and it is much harder if not impossible to stand out. I do feel like many students who went to prestigious universities would have seen much more success in their future if they went to a school where it was actually feasible for them to be at the top",

If he\u2019s unemployable bc he was a crappy student at a mid uni that is expected, if he\u2019s employable bc he did well at a mid uni that\u2019s also completely normal. It sounded like you were linking being unemployable to the fact that he went to a non-Ivy school",

Just being at Harvard or wherever doesn\u2019t automatically mean you are smarter or harder working than peers who go to less prestigious schools. There\u2019s a lot of variables involved. \n\nSorry I know that\u2019s not really your point but I just had to say that. For what it\u2019s worth, you are statistically speaking still benefiting way more from going to an Ivy League and being bottom of your class than being in the top at most other schools. Whether that\u2019s actually deserved or not is a whole other thing \ud83d\ude12",
