  "text": "The title says it all. I had a few in-person classes, but now my schedule is basically all online. I didn't think it was worth it to pay Room & Board to sit in a room all day to take classes online. It's disappointing because I wanted the college experience, however, with the COVID-19 pandemic it's not looking like it'll happen this year :((",

It's not a *huge* deal, since I'm an English major and a lot of my assignments are writing, but I'm also a criminology minor and those classes rely on discussion that obviously goes a lot better when it's in person :\\\\\\\\ I guess I'll have a lot more time to adjust to my apartment then lol",
