  "title:": "Physics Major-anxiety/adjusting back to on-campus causing a bad grade",
  "text": "I am a 3rd-year physics major with ongoing research experience in cosmology/astrophysics (which I love and understand well), this is my first semester \"back to normal\" since corona started a year and a half ago. During that time most of my tests were taken by ourselves (not proctored), open book/notes, basically a timed homework assignment. Now that I'm back at school and in the classroom I'm having a hard time adjusting back to totally closed book exams and currently have a D in Physical Mechanics (Classical Mechanics). \n\nWe've only taken 1 test out of 4 but my next test is tomorrow and I'm not feeling confident I will do well no matter how much I've studied. I've never struggled in a class like this before and I know 70% of my trouble is my brain working against me due to the severe anxiety I have surrounding this class (I'm doing just fine in my 3 other physics classes). I am the only girl out of 15 students and the teacher is somewhat cold and unapproachable. This class is also too specialized to have any tutors or anything (very small department). \n\nI know this sounds like wallowing but I really don't want to fail this class but I'm frozen in fear. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone can relate or has overcome this and can give some uplifting advice.\u00a0",

      "text": "Hey There. I graduated in 2020 from a very small physics program as well.\n\nThe way you are feeling is valid. Keep trying and working hard.\n\nI remember Classical Mechanics being the first time that physics classes became challenging.\n\nIt is possible that you feel like you're not doing well because the class may be more challenging than others. Keep on working hard and pushing yourself.\n\nIt may be beneficial to form/join a study group. Ask a classmate if they are in a study group that you can join. Or ask a classmate from a different physics course if they have taken the class before and if they can help you.",

              "text": "Physics graduate student here: Classical mechanics can be a whole new hell. Don't feel bad for finding it hard. It's often used as a place to introduce really complicated/computationally intense mathematical tools first because it's viewed as the least 'conceptually complicated' subject. Graduate classical mechanics was my worst grade first quarter for that exact reason. I swear the math was harder than the math methods course it ran concurrently with.\n\nIn general there is no such thing as 'hard' or 'easy' subjects in physics: It's all about the level of complexity you approach them at, and what you're naturally able to work with. For me, the abstract math of quantum is simplicity itself, but the moment I hear 'parsec' or 'Boltzmann distribution' my brain just shuts down. I know other people where it's the exact opposite.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a physics major too, and I relate pretty strongly to what you are saying. We literally had next to no time limit for our tests last year, and we could use any school related resources (textbooks, notes, lectures) for our exams. I recently took my first exam in my electricity and magnetism class, and it wasn\u2019t bad, but it really exacerbated my nerves after having been \u201cspoiled\u201d with such easy test environments from online school. Our test was very generous on time limits, but I still got such bad anxiety at the beginning about not getting done.",
