  "text": "My roommate and I were talking the other day and she mentioned that Harvard isn't all that, the campus is neglected and crumbling and it wouldn't be worth going there (this is just what she said, I'm not making any assumptions about Harvard just so everyone knows). This made me interested in thinking about universities that are renowned actually not being that good. I've only been to two universities, which is more than most undergrads as far as I know, but still not enough to give me a good idea of any other universities. If you know about a well known or renowned school that's not that great and have stories to tell about it, personal experiences or otherwise, this post is for you. (I posted this a couple nights ago and didn't really get any responses, figured I would post again and see what comes up)",
