  "text": "I hate my college. I can\u2019t really take this shit anymore. I am a senior but i really can\u2019t do this. Iam on the edge, literally. This place just keeps on ruining my life inside out. I cant hangout with my gf. I cant catch-up with my friends. All i do is sit at home, submit assignments and bla bla bla.\nMy gpa won\u2019t matter after college from where i am, it would literally be just a number. College keeps on stressing me and i rly rly cant i want to cry. My college is 5 years and i keep on motivating myself that ive passed the previous 4 and only 1 (6 months) to go but meh i cant.\n\nI always regret choosing this major (petrochemical engineering) and this college. I enrolled into this major for some reasons (that i prefer not to speak of). \n\nIdk what to do or how to act but iam like \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc",
