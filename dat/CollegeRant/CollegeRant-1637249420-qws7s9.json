  "title:": "College tuition should be cheaper and more affordable for college students",
  "text": "Dear broke college students,\n\nThis is a call to all students: a change needs to happen, and it is up to us. We are in control of lowering college tuition, not only for us, but for our future children and grandchildren.\n\nTuition is increasing tremendously every year, making it almost impossible to attend to a bigger 4-year university, without accruing an absurd amount of debt. Scholarships can be tough to achieve, and not everyone is eligible for grants. Have you ever looked at the requirements for scholarships and grants? Some of the requirements could include having a lower family income, having a high GPA, or having a high SAT score.\n\nMost of us hear about how expensive college was for our parents, along with how much college debt our parents are in. Yet, knowing how much debt our parents got into, we still blindly go to college, spending more money than we should, or have. Many do this without knowing what they are attending college for, going into debt, pointlessly.\n\nThe parents who attended college and acquired debt still didn\u2019t pay nearly as much money as we are currently. In the last 20 years, national universities prices grew 211%. Meaning if you were to pay $100 20 years ago it would be $211 today.\n\nThere are many changes that need to happen in order for cheaper college to become accessible. One change could be, \u201coffer 3-year bachelor degrees, commonly used in Europe.\u201d Doing this would allow students to take lighter course loads. Also allowing colleges to price classes cheaper and allow more students to attend their college. Another possible change is, \u201cReform the student aid system.\u201d Our student aid system can be confusing and inefficient. Often times not directing the help to the students who need it most. \n\n I personally wasn\u2019t able to attend the schools I wanted because the tuition was too high. Take Albion for example. Albion\u2019s tuition cost for one year is $47,000. With no scholarships or grants, if I had attended Albion for 4 years, I would come out of college $188,000 in debt. Not including the interest added on through taking out loans. With college being so expensive, it forces people who don\u2019t get a lot of scholarship money to take the Community College route\u2014like I did.\n\nCommunity Colleges can be a great way to get your first two years of academics completed for a cheaper price. Though, not everyone wants to spend money to attend a smaller school. With college being so expensive, however, it can force you to give up the hope of attending your dream school.\n\nWhy is it set up this way? If colleges are truly supposed to lead you to your dream career setting you up to be successful, why are they asking for so much money? Their prices make us unable to attend the colleges we want most. If we are paying so much for our college education, it leads people to believe they are guaranteed a job coming out.\n\nStill, it can tough to find a job you want that pays a high wage to support you enough to help pay for your college debt. Even if you found a well-paying job coming out of college, you would still have to worry about your loans.\n\nCollege debt can ruin your life, making it so you can\u2019t afford the fun things for years, while you pay off those stupid loans. We are in control of our lives and should not have to drown in debt for our education.\n\nSincerely, a broke college student\n\n TL;DR This is an open letter that discusses the issues with high college tuition costs. Along with ways we can work together to lower these costs.",

Adjuncts are paid pennies compared with full time faculty, and work with no benefits. We don't even know for sure if we will be teaching from semester to semester (they hire us on a semester basis).\n\nAt my community college, I make about $350/month during a semester (so roughly 3 months of pay) to teach one class. We aren't allowed to teach more than three at one school because that would force them to give us benefits. Our classes get cancelled at the last minute if they aren't full (the cutoff is different at each school in terms of number of students for a class to \"make\"). We don't get paid when we don't teach, and have to pay for our substitutes in some instances. We get to pay for parking, too, just like y'all. \n\nThe number of adjuncts teaching now versus the number of regular full time faculty is enormous and growing. When you walk into your classroom and look at your teacher, consider the fact that he/she/they may very well also be delivering pizzas to make their bills. \n\nCollege should absolutely be free.

      "text": "In Europe you also have an additional year of high school, so that three year degree gets you to the same place at the same time. \n\nCC is more affordable, but one of the reasons 4-year colleges are so much more expensive these days is because CC colleges high-grade the money making courses, and they dont teach the expensive ones. 4-year colleges are then stuck holding the loss leaders, resulting in increased tuition. State legislators increasingly demand that state schools streamline the transfer process for CC students entering a 4-year program citing the cost benefit of CC, which further incentivizes students to take this route and increases 4-year tuition. I am sure there are good CC out there, but you miss something important by missing those first two years. \n\nThere is also massive wage stagnation at the faculty level, bloat at the administrative level, cuts to state funding led by far right anti-education legislators, and a massive increase on reliance on NTT faculty who are undercompensated, overworked, and have no tenure protection. All of this increases costs (tuition), and decreases the quality of education. \n\nAll too often the villain in these stories is the greedy ass college charging too much for tuition. Colleges across the country are being squeezed, and employees are over and over being asked to do more with less. As colleges suck more, legislators get to point and say \"see, look at these shitty greedy professors taking egregious sums of student money and providing shit service\". Its a self fulfilling prophesy.    \n\n\nThe solution is to dedicate more state funding to offset tuition, which can only be done via the ballot box and needs a much larger buy in than just students. It could be done to some degree at the federal level, and through executive action. However, the most likely to succeed route is at the state level, at least as far as large state schools go. Dont settle for CC, dont settle for professors not protected by tenure, dont support administrative bloat, dont vote for state legislators who demand cuts to higher ed or resist equitable employee compensation.",

          "text": ">The solution is to dedicate more state funding to offset tuition, which can only be done via the ballot box and needs a much larger buy in than just students. It could be done to some degree at the federal level, and through executive action. However, the most likely to succeed route is at the state level, at least as far as large state schools go. Dont settle for CC, dont settle for professors not protected by tenure, dont support administrative bloat, dont vote for state legislators who demand cuts to higher ed or resist equitable employee compensation.\n\nI would also cut funding for colleges that do not make reasonable efforts to trim down costs. Any unnecessary, non-educational expenses like bloated admin, president's expenses, etc should be examined every 5 years at least and if not satisfactory, all funding should be withdrawn, meaning that the university is no longer a public institution (same for non-profit private institutions). Do that enough times, and other institutions will act.\n\nI actually understand Republicans with their notion of defunding education, they're just not targeting the right people (teachers rather than admin).",

I put in the errors to learn about loans and tuition. In May 2022, I will graduate with a doctoral degree. I went straight from a bachelors to a doctorate. My doctorate at one of the top programs in the country for my field.  I have 49k debt in my name, 10k in my parents. The 10k in my parents they will pay as that was their financial contribution to college. I didn\u2019t qualify for need based aid but was responsible for all costs but 10k myself. \n\nHow did I do it. First, I did research on loans and tuition expenses. Next I went to a school for my bachelors that gave me a 50% tuition scholarship. There I was a resident assistant for a year saving on room and board. Then I graduated a year early by taking extra classes each semester. I went on to get into every graduate program I applied to. I went to the school that gave me the most money. I only paid for 1.5 years tuition for my doctorate, the rest was paid. No one cares I went to a smaller school for my undergrad. Where I went for grad school matters. Upon graduation I will work at one of the best hospitals in the US. I did all this and kept my debt below my starting salary. Yes college prices are rising, but if a first generation student was able to navigate tuition to keep loans low then someone who\u2019s parent who took out loans should be able to do so too.",

The three most important ones seem to be that transfer students have fewer opportunities to form bonds with other students, have far fewer opportunities to be identified as potential research students, and most damaging, they have knocked their gen Eds out before they get to the 4 year and only have the hard classes left. Full load with upper division major courses only really fucks students up and allows little time for the type of extracurriculars that help you get into grad programs.

Sounds like you got some STEM degree where you could have made good money, hated your job or didn\u2019t succeed in it, so you went to school for a PhD and now teach and you\u2019re miserable your classmates in undergrad are making a lot of money and you\u2019re not.\n\nAlso considering I see patients from all over the world I would say I have a world view. Also I\u2019ve had 3 patients die this week so sorry if i have no compassion for someone saying \u2018boo-hoo\u2019 I could have made a half a million with my undergrad degree but instead I\u2019m a professor and get paid shit.
