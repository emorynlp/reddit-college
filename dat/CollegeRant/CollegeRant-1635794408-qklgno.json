  "text": "So this semester, most of my classes require me to present a project in front of the class. I absolutely DO NOT WANT TO PRESENT. I\u2019m terrified of presenting I\u2019ll\nliterally break down and cry (which is embarrassing). I stutter a lot and I start shaking\u2014 I\u2019d rather eat glass than present. What should I do ?",

      "text": "I\u2019m the same way and if you\u2019re like me the anticipation is the worst part, I get shaky and super nauseous but I found listening to music and completely spacing out before a presentation to battle the anxiety helps. Another thing is some of my professors are letting us make videos to show the class instead of an in person presentation, see if that\u2019s an option for you.",

      "text": "some people say practice, but honestly, i did speech and debate for all 4 Years of high school speaking in front of people every weekend by myself and i still get nervous giving presentations. i don\u2019t think it ever gets better for anxious people. \n\ni think the real key is mindset. you just need to remember that every single person in that class has to do the same thing as you, nobody cares what you\u2019re saying or presenting, nobody pays much attention, they\u2019re mostly just focused on themselves. just act like you are explaining something to a friend.",
