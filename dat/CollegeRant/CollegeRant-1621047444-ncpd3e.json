  "text": "Right now I\u2019m finishing up with my quantitative economics degree and am considering going to law school. I have a neurological disability that doesn\u2019t influence my intelligence at all, but rather other things that schools are required by law to accommodate anyway. \n\nAnd even though I have one semester left, I am constantly being told that what I want to do will be difficult as if I don\u2019t know. People still doubt that I can finish my degree because of the medical setbacks that I have. Every time I tell somebody I\u2019m studying for the LSAT, I am told \u201cthat\u2019s hard. Are you sure you want to do that?\u201d \n\nYes I do, and in fact I\u2019m in the process of doing it. I don\u2019t necessarily want something that is \u201cdifficult,\u201d but I absolutely have the capacity to do difficult things, and quite frankly, if somebody\u2019s first thought is \u201cI need to remind her that it is challenging\u201d instead of \u201cI\u2019m going to encourage her because I believe in her,\u201d I\u2019m not going to keep them around in my life. I don\u2019t have the capacity and time to deal with people that project their negativity onto me. \n\nI have an advisor that believes in me along with some very close friends, people that have already agreed to write recommendation letters, recent law school grads that see it was worth their time to help me prepare. \n\nBut being the sensitive person I am, I just can\u2019t stand there with a polite smile and try think of some sort of response to \u201cthat\u2019s hard.\u201d I\u2019m just going to walk away because I have nothing else nice to say to them.",

I remember my first year of college I was not doing so good where my advisor sat me down and told me and tried getting me to switch from an engineering discipline to an art discipline degree and I literally told her I don\u2019t want that then she got little frustrated it seemed like when I told her about courses I wanted to take. The problem was that I had very bad grades and had to withdraw from two courses over the freshman year. That summer, it was one of the reasons I transferred from the school. Now I\u2019m a year away from my degree. I also have a learning disability but has not stopped me from reaching anything. Very respect to you for knowing your abilities and following your own goals. It\u2019s also great that your advisor believes in you while mine didn\u2019t haha",

The majority of people saying that are just mad and jealous  that you\u2019re more focused and determined to do the things you love and have a passion for what you do despite your physical setbacks. They\u2019re mad that a person with a disability is able to do better than them at life so they feel like they aren\u2019t worth enough. Now this is your chance to succeed in doing what you love despite everyone trying to convince you not to. They don\u2019t have a legitimate reason for you to not pursue this career, but they feel a lack of an inner purpose if someone else is able to succeed and do what they love unlike them. Distance yourself from these people and do what you love and want to do.",

      "text": "They're probably jealous / insecure, or don't know you very well. People always tell me my major or school are hard (biology and washu) or that my ambitions are hard to accomplish (going to medical school). I don't listen. I didn't listen when they told me washu would be hard or when they said organic chemistry would be the hardest class I ever took. I nodded and smiled for the conversation, then forgot what they said and did it all the fuck anyway. Here I am doing well. The best advice that must be learnt is to stay in your lane and not to give a fuck what minor people in your life have to say about your plans / dreams. I am with you in that you should walk away from people that say \"that's hard\". They're not worth your energy. It's better to focus energy on people who naturally believe in those around them and want to see others win at life rather than bring others down because of preconceived notions of difficultly or insecurities. Good luck with law school! It sounds like you know what you're doing ;)",

I want to take on a public policy degree with a dual focus in that and data analysis. It\u2019s heavily quantitative, and the school I want to attend is known to be difficult. My family tells me that they\u2019re worried it\u2019s going to be too hard for me and I\u2019ll be miserable trying to pursue it. I agree, it\u2019s going to be hard. Any type of graduate school is no walk in the park. I\u2019m not strongly skilled in quantitative aspects, but I\u2019m confident in myself that I can achieve what I need to achieve. I\u2019m a rising senior close to graduating summa cum laude, something no one ever would have thought was possible given my grades in high school. I work hard and do what I need to do. \n\nDon\u2019t let anyone else tell you that you can\u2019t do something or that it\u2019s too hard. No one knows you better than YOU know you.

      "text": "Hey! I have ADHD and my goal is to attend vet school after undergrad. My family thinks I\u2019m pressuring myself and that I won\u2019t make it. You will make it. I believe in you. It might not be easy, but nothing in life comes easy. You need to understand that some people are afraid to dream and accomplish those dreams. You are not. Keep on believing in yourself and keep on working towards your goal. There are so many times where I almost felt like quitting based on people\u2019s negative perceptions of my abilities. Despite that, I tell myself that it\u2019s my goal/dream that I\u2019m creating and I won\u2019t let anyone else take that away from me. You got this! Message me if you wanna talk.",

          "text": "I\u2019m a college English professor with ADHD. It\u2019s all about our hyper focus. Mine is teaching/learning. I can hyper focus on those excessively, which is good for that career. It\u2019s all about how bad your brain wants to pay attention to it when it comes to ADHD, so sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nNow, as a teacher, there are a LOT of students who come in wanting to be vets, but many end up not doing it. The reason is usually that people didn\u2019t realize how much biology and chemistry is involved, for some reason, but I always tell them that the real thing people don\u2019t anticipate is that you\u2019re not just petting animals all the time; most of the animals they see will be sick or dying, and they\u2019ll be the ones helping them die. I tell them that it\u2019s a hard job like a nurse, where you deal with lots of pain and suffering, but if your true goal is to help animals and the people who own them, then you\u2019ll make it. But if you want to pet dogs all the time, just become a pet walker or pet sitter.",
