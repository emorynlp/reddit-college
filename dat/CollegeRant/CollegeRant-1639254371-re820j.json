  "title:": "Tfw when you get put with a professor who doesn't teach and doesn't reply to emails even though you strictly didnt choose him but they chose him for you last minute",
  "text": "Cant even drop the dumb class either because if I do I not only lose all my scholarships but I also have to pay the school back for dropping it. If i fail the class I also have the exact same outcome. My school literally f'd me over this quarter over their incompetent funding towards this department (funding) but yay to a 2 million dollar piece of art! Literally how hard is it to get a good professor in a department that is literally part of your whole school's jist? So much for an engineering school. \n\nWhats worse is this teacher has a 20% would take again rating. Thats how bad he is. Love college. Had a good first quarter and now my motivation is rock bottom because of this.\n\nMust I also mention how this class doesn't even benefit me at all in the career I want to? Because a Marine Biologist definitely needs those electric fields, circuits, and magnets! God college is the worse thing to ever exist.",

      "text": "Sounds like physics 2/E&M, pretty standard from my experience for most stem majors to need to take. Electric fields, Magnetism and magnetic fields may be more important than you think at the moment, probably not the basic circuits. There are quite literally studies being done about how these things affect marine life though. There are animals that are extremely sensitive to these fields and understanding how they work is pretty important. Sorry to hear you have a bad professor for the class though.",

Im more pissed that i strictly chose the other guy for the two hour two times a week class because I DIDNT want this professor but they switched him last minute and I couldnt change classes like I would have.",
