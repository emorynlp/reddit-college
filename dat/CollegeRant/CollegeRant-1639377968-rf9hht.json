Ba in history minors computer science and business\n\nTook a year off got an internship then covid.\n\nNow in post bacc at community college, I am fixing a lot of my undergrad in reverse. I still want my ms and phd/jd.\n\nBut through employment I gig jobbed my way into an auditor (low form) so I am taking that side trip. But I have a 3.5 or higher at 2 community colleges. \n\nMy parents helped me through undergrad and i regret a lot mostly social. I had a lot of toxic and bad around me.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard cleaning up the mistakes as well.",
