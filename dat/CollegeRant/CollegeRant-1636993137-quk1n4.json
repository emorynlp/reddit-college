  "title:": "First Tike Skipping & I Feel Horrible (A Vent)",
  "text": "Literally 19 minutes ago was my first time ever in my entire college career that I have skipped a class for any reason. Sickness, family emergencies, my own depression and among many other things have never been a justifiable enough reason for me to skip my class personally (though, I don\u2019t hold anyone else to these standards). \n\nThis is my junior year and the first day where I skipped because my burnout is the worst it\u2019s ever been. Between 3 jobs, 19 credits, honors research preparation and graduate school preparation, I am stretched thin. Beyond thin! I woke up late for my Research Methods lecture today and his attendance policy is quite frankly, and pardon my language, fucking stupid. The professor deducts 5% for arriving late even by a single minute. However, attendance is not mandatory. It\u2019s better to skip than to receive a deduction to my grade for being late this one time. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but going from an A to an A- because I came in a few minutes late isn\u2019t appealing to me at all?? \n\nEven so, even with this rational, I can\u2019t help but feel like a piece of shit for skipping. I still haven\u2019t found the energy to roll out of bed. My stomachache pain is probably the worst it has been in a very long time and I\u2019m fighting the urge to cry and have a panic attack. I already asked an acquaintance of mine in the class to send me their notes afterwards and it\u2019s easy to just read the textbook but god do I feel like the worst student in existence.\n\nTLDR: Skipped class for the first time and now I feel like a piece of shit. Anyone have any advice so I don\u2019t spiral further into my depression?",

That said, I think the best way to not wallow is to decide that you\u2019re going to use the class time doing *some* sort of homework or chore or errand, no matter how easy that task is.",

      "text": "It's okay to skip one class but it can almost get addicting. I used to have a good attendance record for showing up to classes everyday my first year, but like you I got burned out one day and I decided to skip cuz I knew my class was just a lecture talking about what was in the textbook. Then I started skipping a few more times cuz I knew that I could whenever I was just feeling a little bit stressed. Yes take a break but you gotta get back and stay engaged.",
