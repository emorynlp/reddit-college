Getting teach old outdated information for a bullshit degree. Don\u2019t go to campus study online is the key. Cheat on everything. School has a lockdown browser? Fuck them meet a hacker and bypass it. Even with a webcam I still bypass the shitting school system. Don\u2019t like taking test and quizzes and essay? Join the discord I\u2019m in pay the people $20 here and there and you will get all A\u2019s . School loves to fuck over the students . So this is what I do to say fuck school.",

              "text": "Yep.  The day before every exam I run a plugs-out test (look it up) of the exam session and ensuring that the video is long and seamless.  If it's short, repetitive movements are a dead giveaway.  If it's a jump cut, you're in even more trouble.\n\nIn OBS, make a video of you sitting at a camera for 10-20 minutes, loop it, then use the OBS VirtualCam as your browser lock's webcam source (Chrome will ask for that).  If it records audio, you're in for a problem unfortunately.\n\nAnother thing you should do is search for independent terms of a question rather than the question itself.  For instance, don't search for a question.  If you search for the question, you risk getting honeypotted.  Honeypotting is where one person creates items that are completely fake but blend in with the real thing, very much like phishing scams.  If you click on a honeypot result on Google, the test site is instantly notified.  I wouldn't find it a major concern if you're not on your own network, as they can't track who clicked on what other than your IP and user agent (browser and device information).\n\nI will also add that I have not done any of these things since 2016, and I began college some time later.  Every college exam I've completed in a locked browser uses real-time recordings and were pretty easy.",

Shit is like $50 at cheapest for a book that you know you'll only need for a semester at most\n\nLiterally during freshman orientation for this STEM student group I'm in, one of the biggest things we heard from the juniors/seniors that are mentoring us was \"don't waste money on textbooks, you can probably get it for free on [b-ok.org](https://b-ok.org), Library Genesis, or literally google it's name with \"pdf\" at the end. don't forget to share with your classmates, it's a good way to make friends!\"\n\nAnd they're right. This semester's assigned books would have cost me a bunch of money and I literally got the entire list for $0 by finding everything on Library Genesis and b-ok. Now if only fees for labs (what lab?! WE'RE ON ZOOM!!) and math modules weren't automatically tacked on to my bill :/\n\n***edit:*** *another thing is that because there's so much redtape and anti-piracy crap when you get a legal version of a digital (and usually cheaper) textbook, you can end up wasting money. Which is exactly what happened to one of my classmates who spent $30 on the digital textbook for our class and it ended up not working for her, so I sent her a GDrive link of my PDF and was completely cool for her.*\n\n*Textbooks are a scam.

I don't need that class to critically think. Critical thinking comes in many forms. Being a better global citizen doesn't help me in my field. And even if it did, that's obviously not why the college is making me take the course lol it's a 100 class that everyone has to take. I literally DONT need it. I'm not saying liberal arts education is bad it's perfectly fine. However, it is not useful for what MY major is at all and it has been 3 years and I still haven't used a shred of that information since passing the class. Stop taking it so personally",
