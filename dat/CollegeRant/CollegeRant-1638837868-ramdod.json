  "text": "I failed a class last semester and had a c- in another class. I took summer classes in hopes of catching up failed one passed the other. I\u2019m incredibly close to failing another class and feel like garbage. My other classes are fine one C two B\u2019s but I just hate the feeling of failing this much. Especially when I feel like I\u2019m trying but what I turn in just isn\u2019t up to the teachers standards.\nI definitely blame covid/online classes for the first classes but I\u2019m back in person this semester and I feel like I have no excuse.\n\nI just want people to tell me something to give me hope it\u2019ll be okay. Did you fail several classes and make it out fine? Has covid affected you in a way you can\u2019t help? I feel like the only one dealing with this and need stories of support thanks",
