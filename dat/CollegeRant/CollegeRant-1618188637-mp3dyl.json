  "text": "TL;DR: school is prioritizing new freshmen over the existing student population and their health\n\nWe've been getting emails warning us about a rise in cases and the school is saying it's because we're letting non-resident guests in and going off-campus. Meanwhile, every Saturday we see giant tours going on - they aren't social distancing and they're even coming in to see our dorms! My dad can't come in to use the bathroom but yeah sure let's allow a bunch of strangers in. I'm so glad I'm graduating in June, this is ridiculous... we get tested at least once a week! We aren't doing anything wrong! I have to fill out a form to leave campus for groceries!",

I don\u2019t know about other residents and what they\u2019ve done but we\u2019ve been given a lot of rules to follow - we get frequent testing, temperature checks every time we enter our dorm building. Like, do you see something in my post that places the blame on us students?",

Last Halloween, they threw a Halloween party and surprise surprise, some morons caught it. The college didn't punish them which is the most infuriating part.",
