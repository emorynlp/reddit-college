  "text": "Pretty much the title. Between a weird roommate, being homesick(I\u2019m literally less than an hour away), no friends and thoughts of wtf I\u2019m going to do after college, I\u2019m not feeling too hot. I got into a good groove with the online classes for the first year. I worked a couple days a week, did zoom classes and played video games. I saw my family everyday, my friends at least every week, and was just chilling. Now I\u2019m thrown into my 2nd year of college, and I broke the moment I got back to my dorm after my last class. Everything just came down on me all at once. Also the thoughts of what I\u2019m even going to do after I graduate weigh on me. I just want to snap back to when I was in High school. Just fucking around with my friends and still getting good grades.",

      "text": "I literally felt the same for the first two weeks and I\u2019m a sophomore who stayed at home last year. The first week was so rough because my campus was empty. The thing I did was to call my parents like 5-6 times a day. Slowly things have become easier. However, I still break down especially in the morning. Call, call, call!",
