  "text": "\nHello! I am a dental hygiene student in Landover, Maryland and my colleagues and I are in need of patients to graduate our program.\n\n\nThis is a great opportunity for individuals that don\u2019t have insurance but even if you do, you are still welcome! We know sometimes the necessary scaling and root planning \u201cdeep cleaning\u201dtreatment recommended by your dentist can be out of pocket and cost you around $800 and sometimes $200-300 copays with insurance.\n\nAlso, it makes no difference to us if it\u2019s been a really long time since you\u2019ve been to the dentist. We appreciate you and welcome you with open arms \u263a\ufe0f\n\nIf you\u2019re close or in this area let me and my colleagues help you save some money and still receive excellent care!\n\nThe $40 fee includes:\n\ud83e\uddb7 Oral cancer screening\n\ud83e\uddb7 Risk assessments\n\ud83e\uddb7Comprehensive exam\n\ud83e\uddb7X-rays\n\ud83e\uddb7Dental hygiene cleaning\n\ud83e\uddb7Sealants (on eligible teeth)\n\ud83e\uddb7Fluoride treatment\n\nWe also see children, adolescents(age 8-18)and veterans for $20\n\n*This is a learning institution so appointment times are around 3.5hrs each and depending on the treatment you will need, it may take up to 3 visits to complete. The one time fee will cover ALL visits as long as appointments are kept and your treatment is completed.\n\nYou can message me directly, sign up here https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0C4EA8AF22A0FCC61-interest or join our discord to connect with us if interested. \nhttps://discord.gg/ZqXBVcz6HP \nLet us help take care of your smile!\u263a\ufe0f",

If you're able to set up a fundraiser for them, that could work out. Or it could be that you could check with the church, and the church will cover a person's fee if they have someone down and out they want to send to you. Also, addiction recovery centers might have people in need of dental care.",
