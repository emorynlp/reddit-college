  "text": "It feels like when something good is happening, it\u2019s going to be followed by something bad. Like today I met with a lot of people and had a lot of fun, but now I\u2019m concerned something really bad is going to happen, and I\u2019m trying to figure out what it could possibly be. I\u2019m just nervous now, thinking about if I missed anything important or if something is going to happen, and I\u2019m not sure what to do about it.\nAnyone experience something similar? Im just really nervous and I don\u2019t know what to do.",
