  "text": "\n\nI HAVE TO VENT BECAUSE UGH! But let me start from the beginning, I am living off campus this year and I\u2019m currently living in a 4 bedroom with only 2 other roommates ( plus one of the roommates bf, i\u2019ll get to that in a second ) the other roommate bailed literally a week before moving in but I mean I couldn\u2019t care less lol just giving details. We each rent out our own rooms / have separate leases and only split the electricity. Anyways, when I was going through my application process for the apartment I picked random selection for roommates because I have no friends down here and didn\u2019t know anyone in general that I wanted to move in with. I didn\u2019t know who the hell my roommates were going to be until a week prior to my move in date welllllllll color me surprised to find out both of my roommates are in their late 30s and to top it off one is blind \ud83d\ude03 ( NOT that there is anything wrong with that but I personally didn\u2019t know how things would be living with someone with this disability ) AND then I get a text from the other roommate, we\u2019ll call her j , telling not asking that her bf is going to be living with us because his lease was up. Now, I\u2019m not a confrontational person at all it but I did text her about it & spoke to the leasing office but obviously it didnt matter because homeboy is currently living here. Fast forward, Move in day comes and as everyone knows moving is stressful as fuck so when I walk in the apartment I don\u2019t see nothing too off and I go about my business with moving everything in my room. I eventually finish and decide to go in to kitchen and look around, tell me why as soon as I open the fridge all I see is mayonnaise and ketchup just spilled at the bottom. I was immediately upset bc wtf! Oh I forgot to mention j had already been living in the apt before me and the other girl. @ that time I was in a rush to go get groceries so I left but basically J cleaned the refrigerator by the time I returned. Anyways, as time has gone on I\u2019ve constantly have had to wash OTHER peoples dishes bc if I don\u2019t they\u2019ll stay there for fucking days! I\u2019ve had to clean the countertops bc these people love to make shit and leave their crumbs. AND the. I cant even get mad at the blind girl but damn. I LITERALLY SCRUBBED THE KITCHEN FLOOR ONLY FOR A DAY LATER IT TO BE DIRTY AGAIN! I have to put up everyones dishes bc they wont do it. It\u2019s just very annoying when I, a 21 year old college student has to pick up for grown ass people. LMAO and dare I forget the fact that my room is right next to j\u2019s and her bf so I hear the screams and everything if ya know what i mean and its like how can you look me in the eye the next day when last night you were acting like you were in a damn porno. And recently they\u2019ve been home more often cs i think they lost their jobs and i absolutely hate it! and the smell coming from that room is like BO. Not to mention theres a whole cat in that room so its like three entities in one space. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

      "text": "Damn, you've got a real fucked up situation here. How are you supposed to be in charge of these 30 year olds and they're all already adults? Pretty shameful, ngl. If it becomes too much, try to see if you can switch rooms. If not, then try to make yourself explicitly clear that they live here to and need to step up their fkn game. For me, personally, I'm assertive and say that if they don't clean up their shit then it's free game for me to do wtvr I want with it. They don't believe me until they find their 2 week old chicken thrown in the trash and replaced with my fresh groceries. I said I'd take care of it and I fkn did, and now they step up their game. \n\nThis seems a bit aggressive, I know, but dammit sometimes it's necessary. As for your, ahem, roommate and the bf there's not rlly much you can do about that except blast a bunch of gangster rap or heavy metal to disrupt the mood. After all, why not? It's your place too, go wild with the music. But also if they lost their jobs they've got way more problems than they realize to just be fucking day and night.\n\nAlso, idk who's cat it is, but take care of it. Steal it if you have to, but make sure it's taken cared of.",

          "text": "Yeaa, honestly its really messing with me rn. I just got a new job so Im working 2+ jobs and going to school so Im extra stressed. I came home today from work and the kitchen was a mess. dishes by the boat load. I honestly don't think the couple is making the mess its the blind one.But I don't know what to do, like I cant tell her anything cs of her disability but Im also tired of seeing her mess. I swept and mopped the floor a day ago and then the next there was crumbs from the countertop to the floor. Im going to go my leasing office when I get a chance but I don't think they'll do much. Any advice for a non confrontational person? lol, if it helps im really good at being passive aggressive.",

              "text": "I know all too well what the stress is like, esp w/ 2 jobs + school. Fkn sucks, but what else can ya do? Gotta pay that tuition/rent, amiright?\n\nAs for your roommate situation, I believe there's a couple things that have to happen. \n\n1. There's this cycle of clean, dirty, clean again, then dirty again. The source is, well, your roommate with the disability. There's not much we can do about that, but what you can do is choose how to respond. I'm assuming you're a non-confrontational person, and you also seem like a reasonable person. For the person with the disability, and this might not be what you wanna hear, you have to be patient with them. I know, I know, they're already an adult and yes there are little excuses for being so messy, but the fact of the matter is that they're blind, you're not. Try positive reinforcement and help them get better whenever you can. Don't take CARE of them, no, but be understanding whenever they fuck up bc, well, they can't help it. Also, aren't there services to help blind ppl in situations like these? Like, I would assume, but I don't know for sure. \n2. For your other roommates, however, hehe yea there's no excuse. They're being lazy af and that needs to stop. If anything, the result of their laziness will be evident in due time when they see that the whole place is a mess, their life is a mess, and you, working 2+ jobs and going to school, are not going to pick it up for them. Here's where a little bit of passive-aggressiveness could work to your advantage. If they don't do anything to take care of their own lives, then they will see what happens next. Take care of yourself and only yourself in this case. If the place stinks, push them to clean up their mess whenever possible, but don't do the work for them.\n\nAlso, still try to see what the front office can do about this. It's a long shot but it could be worth your time.",
