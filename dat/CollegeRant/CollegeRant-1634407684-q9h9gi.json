  "title:": "My boyfriend's roommate steals his underwear",
  "text": "One of the gifts I got for my boyfriend for his birthday was some boxer briefs and they are themed briefs, not regular/common ones that someone else may have. One is an American flag stars and stripes and the other one is pizza themed. I have noticed that my boyfriend's roommate has been wearing them. His roommate posted a progress picture on instagram showing his weight loss and muscle gain, he's been going to the gym a lot and I noticed he was wearing the boxer briefs I got my boyfriend, and when I showed my boyfriend, he just shrugged it off like it was no big deal.\n\nAlso, the other day when I went over to help my boyfriend finish a paper, his roommate got out of the shower and was wearing my boyfriends underwear. I said \"hey those are josh's!\" and his roommate smirked and said \"oops\" and my boyfriend laughed.\n\nIs it normal for guys to wear each others underwear? My boyfriend doesn't seem to care, but I would get mad if my roommate did that. LOL",
