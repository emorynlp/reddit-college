      "text": "Why would you feel guilty? Just don\u2019t compare yourself to others, as long as you graduate you\u2019re good. Think about the end goal, I think it\u2019s crazy to expect everyone to graduate within 4 years, that\u2019s usually not possible for many students (including myself). I personally just couldn\u2019t afford to do that financially, mentally, and psychically. Life happens; you make plans and sometimes things don\u2019t go as expected, just gotta adapt",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it a tip, but you should consider this graduation fact. Even though bachelors degrees are written and planned out for 4 years, that\u2019s if everything goes according to plan. Do you know how much doesn\u2019t go to plan?? Life happens, classes don\u2019t make, people change majors... most people take 6-7 years to get a bachelors degree. The consensus among my colleagues (I work at a college) is that the bachelors degree is the hardest: you have to take so many classes you probably don\u2019t care about for general education, and what you\u2019re doing degree wise isn\u2019t highly specialized. College gets \u201cfaster\u201d in masters/doctorate classes because it\u2019s usually studying a topic you enjoy. \n\nI changed my major 3-4 times. I look at it this way: I\u2019m making my mind up now, and it may cause me discomfort for the next couple years in feeling behind all my peers, but at least I won\u2019t regret the next 40+ of my working life because I\u2019m doing what I want to do. I also work with a lot of non-traditional students, so it\u2019s easy for me to come to terms with getting my degree late. I\u2019ve helped people in their 70\u2019s come back and get degrees. \n\nInvesting in yourself is never a waste of time.",
