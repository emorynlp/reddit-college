  "text": "Hey y'all, I hope life is not treating you as bad as it is.\n\nI'm gonna be studying for math after I post this. Anyways, a couple weeks ago, we took our first precalc exam. I already knew I was going to be in a course with a terrible professor because of all the ratings on rate my professor, but I'm pretty good at math so I thought I could get through the class. There were no other sections to choose from and I needed this course to graduate this semester. Not to mention, I am in dual enrollment as well and I am still in high school. \n\nSo the first test comes along and I studied the formulas and whatnot and I was pretty confident. The test was something else. Like, nothing we learned about was on it and it was nothing like the homework or the review sheets she posted. Almost everyone but 1 person failed. The class average was a 45, and I got a 36.\n\nI thought to myself \"well it was only the first test\" but then I checked the syllabus. We will spend 100 hours on homework at the very least and it only counts as 16% of our grade. We have 6 tests and the average of those tests counts as 84% of our final grade. If it keeps going like this, I'm afraid I won't be able to pass the course. And even worse, I want to apply to medical school in a few years and I worked so hard for my GPA not to plummet. I'm sort of numb to the situation. It's even worse that we are all remote learning and the professor straight up ignores everyone's questions during the class period.\n\nHas anyone had an experience like this? How can I go about it? \n\nI'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this on or whatever, I only use reddit when I need advice. Thanks for reading this far.",

I had an amazing professor for calculus even.  And omg with the test being nothing you've even seen before.  How is that allowed?  Are they just trying to see how you process it?  Like, stop with that shit.  There should be a course called \"figure it out on your own\" because too many times this is the deal. I can't stand it.",

I took a statistics class where the professor was absurdly difficult and bragged about how most people fail his exam. Immediately dropped his course, went on Ratemyprofessor, and enrolled with a different professor.",

Yes withdrawing would be good if you can get through but I would speak to that professors boss about her lack of caring and enjoyment of people failing her class. I had professors that laugh and smile when they tell you 50 percent of the class fail every semester. Hard professors doesn\u2019t mean they teach well, mostly mean that are shit at teacher",

      "text": "Maybe you should see if you can still drop precalc. Check out other professors who teach it on RateMyProf (you should be able to find the other profs by looking at this semester and the past few semesters course catalogues). If none of them are rated well, maybe try taking it over the summer from another college.\n\nA 'W' for withdraw is much better than a failing grade that's going to stress you out all semester and make you do worse in your other courses because you'll still be fighting to pass it when you don't have to. The grand or so you pay for tuition to the community college for it as a summer course, taking med school into account, really wouldn't be the worst thing considering your goals.\n\nref: I did that for calc, taking it online from a local community college over the summer instead, and it was leagues better.",

              "text": "Ooooooof, rest in peace. It really seems like the professor is the problem, and that's just awful. What are the consequences of not graduating the academy on time? I ask because just in case that does happen, it still shouldn't be enough to completely heck you over. You should be okay either way in the long run, and try not to beat yourself up if it does happen.\n\nIf the academy has any sort of tutoring services, or if your course has any specific helpers [like, students who have already taken the course and are being paid to help teach other students who are currently taking the course], definitely try hitting them up. Especially the students who have taken the course and passed and are now helping out should be familiar with how to succeed with that professor, and will probably be able to help you immensely, having experienced it and figured it out themselves prior.",
