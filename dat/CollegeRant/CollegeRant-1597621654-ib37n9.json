  "text": "I\u2019m heading off to my first year of college and I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m scared shitless. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m super excited to see and learn new things, but I feel overwhelmed with all of the decisions I\u2019m going to be having to make. \n\nI have stories I want to share (these stories are going to be told through animated series\u2019, books, comics, video games, etc.) and so I am \u201cgoing to college for English and art\u201d but I have NO idea what I want to do for my actual JOB. I am worried that I will figure out what I like doing after college and have to go back and I know that\u2019s a common thing that people do, but I am going to SERIOUSLY struggle to financially get through this semester, let alone get through all four years or even go back! (My parents/family can\u2019t really help much). \n\nIm also scared of having to fend for myself obviously so misc tips and tricks are super appreciated!!",

      "text": "I say that you take it one step at a time! I was so overwhelmed my first year that I almost ended up dropping out (literally one meeting away from being unenrolled). But I got some advice to slow down and take things step by step, whether that was planning for classes or managing my budget or thinking about my future (I\u2019m also studying English/Literature yay!) and tbh I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been and gonna graduate soon so things may work out for you! there is no one size fits all formula for college so you gotta figure it out but I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned since everyone is scared shitless (trust me! I work with incoming freshman and EVERYONE is scared) :]",

Spread your gen eds through different departments (like don\u2019t do three sociology classes when you can take a soc, psy, and poli sci clas). It\u2019ll help you, not only become well rounded, but it\u2019ll let you see other majors that might interest you.\n\nAlso, come join us at r/englishmajors",

So don't worry too much, you will adapt to everything. \n\nRegarding what you'll \"do,\" don't worry about that too much. While a job after college is definitely important, if you bog yourself down in the details then you'll make decisions that will lead you to an unhappy life. \n\nJust be open to new things and be willing to make steps in different directions if you find something else that you would rather pursue. You'll get there eventually.",
