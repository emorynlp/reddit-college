Don\u2019t exactly have a ton of funds and dropping nearly $500-1k every semester on various books/resources and waiting 1-2 months to get that money back is brutal.",

      "text": "Teacher perspective here:\n\nI teach quantitative materials and the standard textbooks in my field have gotten stupidly expensive ($300 and up, some over $400). I found a decent text - decent, not great - for one class that was $140 so I switched. The book wasn't very popular. It's hard for a new name to get a foothold in some disciplines and this book didn't succeed. It went out of print and we couldn't even find enough used copies for my classes.\n\nMy options were to return to crazy expensive books or create sufficient materials to go without a text. I created materials for some of my classes, but I couldn't do it for all of them.\n\nI looked into ebook/homework combinations and found one for $120. My students don't usually read through the text, they just use it as a resource so an ebook should be sufficient. It's still more than I'd like my students to spend, but it's far cheaper than a physical text.\n\nI can see how it feels like they're being charged to access homework problems, but for me, it was best option I had for them to get a decent book at a somewhat reasonable price.\n\nWith some publishers, the single fee provides access to ***all*** of the publisher's books. If you can get enough teachers to agree on textbooks from a single publisher, then it would be even cheaper for the students. Unfortunately, faculty are fiercely independent about their textbook choices and it's nearly impossible to get them to agree on a single publisher.",

Not a text/homework combo\u2026just homework. So we have to pay seperately to access our book and our homework and it\u2019s almost always more expensive than if I had just got a book myself.",

              "text": "That sucks. I wonder if your teachers could choose the book/homework combination or if their hands are tied by administrative rules.\n\nI've been doing this for over 25 years and I didn't start noticing book/material costs until 15 or 16 years ago. I'm not proud of that but it just wasn't on my radar early in my career. Even when I started talking about book costs, I couldn't get many colleagues to pay attention. It's an embodiment of the principle/agent problem: professors (agent) select the books but students (principle) purchase them.\n\nFortunately, more and more faculty - young and old - are now talking about books costs. It won't change as fast as it should, but I think we're starting to make progress on it.",

I promised we exist who loath these predatory publishing companies and do everything we can to undermine them. \n\nMany dependents, colleges, and universities do not give instructors a choice. I highly encourage student protests and walk outs to force administrators to rethink this model of content delivery. \n\nOpen source materials are readily available in many fields. But know that lab fees are set by admin, not your professors. I have complete and total control over which texts and resources I require, but thats the exception rather than the rule.\n\nYou all should be furious about the current state of higher education, but most of that angst should be directed at the administration, not your professors.\n\nThey often have much, much less control over this stuff then you might think.",
