  "text": "I honestly think tenure is one of the most asinine concepts in the whole of the education system. I'm sure somewhere there exists an excellent tenured professor (though I have not met them), but having a prof who doesn't give a rat's ass about helping the students learn is unbelievably frustrating, in my opinion. Still, the issue is compounded by the fact that evals and feedback don't mean a thing. The courses will never improve while they're taught by egotistical jackasses, which tenure guarantees is for a long, long time. Does anyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "Tenure was originally designed to protect academic freedom and avoid political firings. So, if someone were doing research on something that particular administrators did not like, tenure would theoretically protect that person from unjustified termination. Tenure usually has little to do with teaching, though someone who doesn\u2019t do well in the classroom prior to tenure would have a hard time getting tenure at schools that aren\u2019t totally focused on research (most major universities don\u2019t really place a high value on teaching as research is paramount).\n\nHaving said that, some professors abuse it. They greatly slow down on research (if they do it at all), and they may invest the bare minimum in their teaching responsibilities.\n\nI don\u2019t believe tenure is garbage because it does offer important protections, but I also think the current system is too lax. Post-tenure reviews have been a thing, where professors may be put on modified assignments or have their workloads rebalanced if they aren\u2019t up to par on some things, but often, these reviews do not lead to anything more than, say, a higher teaching load (this is for folks who don\u2019t publish enough after tenure).\n\nThis is also where the self-directed nature of higher ed comes in and where complaints such as this one are usually dismissed due to some of them not really holding water. \u201cNot caring about helping students\u201d may be the interpretation that some would apply to \u201cmakes us read the textbook and doesn\u2019t reply to emails within an hour of sending them.\u201d It could also be a true statement, and the professor may really not care/not help students. It\u2019s hard to say based on your post as to what your situation is.",

          "text": "I can understand the original intent of tenure, and I suppose beyond that, I know that professors are researchers first and foremost. It would be nice to see something like a post-tenure review, as you mentioned, become more routine. At least, in my experience, it seems tenure actively discourages 'good' teaching, that is, putting in the effort to educate students and clearly outline what they expect from those students. I think this is compounded by the subjective nature of papers and a lack of clear feedback from a professor. When I posted this, it was under the pretense that college places a higher emphasis on the individual than earlier education. That said, I don't think it's fair to chalk it up to \"well students ought to do x y or z\" (I am not saying that you are doing this, of course, but with regards to your mention of such arguments). Despite the 'self-directed nature' of college, professors absolutely do play a part in the learning process, and a professor who is constantly unclear about their expectations, even when directly asked, yet simultaneously seems to expect particular things from their students (which is my situation) certainly qualifies as a lousy professor in my opinion. I suppose \"tenure is garbage\" may be too broad, but I do think the system inherently incentivizes people to put less work into their jobs.",

              "text": "I hear you, and there are definitely people who take advantage of the system. I see it every day, and it makes me sad to see colleagues who view students as a chore rather than a source of professional passion.\n\nTo your point about clear expectations, some professors are purposefully ambiguous about some assignments because they want to see what students are capable of doing without having their hands held or being led to each stepping stone on the pathway, especially in upper div courses. When expectations are so clear that no one has to learn how to make conceptual extrapolations, people can become too dependent on super-detailed instructions, and that discourages critical and independent thinking. Having said that, this kind of approach requires that professors stay within a certain latitude of ambiguity. \"Write a paper on X topic and turn it in by Y date\" is way too vague. The flip side of that would be \"Write 61 sentences averaging 9.7 words per sentence, and use this exact template that you don't have to think about.\" That, obviously, would not be teaching anyone how to do anything helpful, either. There should be a good balance of clarity and open-endedness, and there should be sufficient guidance when students have tried things for themselves first and still get stuck.\n\nCan you be more specific about your situation? What expectations are we talking about? What kind of assignment is it?",

It does cause some trouble for teaching, however. \n\nThe problem is this: in any discipline, at some point of expertise, you need to learn from true experts, the people doing research at the cutting edge of their field. Oftentimes, these experts aren't good teachers.\n\nThe standards have gradually fallen and weaker and weaker students are being admitted each year. This is a necessary outcome of opening the university system up to the middle class. Classes are now teaching basic material as the starting point for students who no longer have an elite education. \n\nThese introductory classes are being taught by the same experts, however.\n\nI don't know the solution for this, but I wish we had 2 more years of publicly funded 'pre-college.'
