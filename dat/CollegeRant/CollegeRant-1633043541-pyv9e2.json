  "text": "I have always been a straight A's student, maintained a 4.0 and got an amazing scholarship that pays off all my tuition because of it. I am a full time sophomore student  and this is the first time I go past deadlines and I just cannot get myself to focus or even start to do my assignments :'(",

      "text": "I was in the same situation as you and also in my sophomore year, no matter what I tried, when it came to doing homework and getting those assignment done, I just couldn\u2019t do it. I was so stressed and depressed at the time. My mind was telling me to do it, but I couldn\u2019t focus and think of anything other than \u201c I\u2019m not gonna do it, i can\u2019t study anymore, I\u201dll skip this assignment\u201d. There were times when I just sat in front of my laptop and couldn\u2019t bring myself to do those homework. I got a bunch of Cs and Ds at the end, had to retake some of the classes the next year, and I regret it a lot. \nUntil now I still don\u2019t know what was going on with me that year, maybe i was too tired between school and work, maybe i was not interested in those classes, maybe it was a stressful year for me. \nNow, I have to tell myself that as long as I turn the assignment in on time, it\u2019s way better than getting a 0. I tend to think it in a positive way that I\u2019ll be less stressed the moment I turn it it. I\u2019ll be happier vs getting upset when I see a big 0 in the grade. I\u2019ll be proud of myself for actually accomplished something even though it\u2019s as small as getting an assignment worths 5 points. I also like to get it done a day before the deadline so I\u2019m not in a rush and don\u2019t want to do it when the deadline comes. \nIf you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s okay, plan ahead so you can have time to do other thing to take your mind of it, relax, and comeback to do those later. Don\u2019t wait till deadline, you won\u2019t want to do it then.\nI hope you can get over it and have a successful semester. Think of it like it\u2019ll be over before you know it, it\u2019s better to get a B or C than fail and have to waste time retake the class. It\u2019s stressful and tiring but I promise it\u2019ll get better. You can do this!\n*sorry if I sounded confusing since English is not my native language*",
