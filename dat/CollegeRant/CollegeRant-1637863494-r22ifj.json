  "text": "My Chem. professor is one of the best in the game. I didn\u2019t think I would be doing as well in this class as I have been thanks to him. He tailors his class for understanding rather than high scores. Set up a group chat so anyone can reach him for help if they need it. Everyone has done well the past two exams majority got 80% and up. This past third exam however wasn\u2019t so great. The largest unit by far with a lot of info. The average was probably a C. Which isn\u2019t bad, you can definitely bounce back. As I was willing to do. Some weren\u2019t so motivated. They kept asking him to curve it. They kept pushing and pushing. He wanted to be fair and give us a choice to either curve this exam or curve the final. The debate about this got so heated some were straight up asking him to \u201cgive us points\u201d.  Prof. Then sends this message saying the class would \u201ccontinue as stated by the syllabus with no changes\u201d and you could just feel the disappointment. Just take the L and do better next exam like goddamn. I stayed quiet the entire time just kind of surprised they would take advantage of him like that after all he\u2019s done for us.",

          "text": "Yeah, you have to really put in the effort.\n\nMy advice is that during the first couple days of class, pick out a few students who seem to actually give a shit, and give them your contact info.  Form a study group, and be the one organizing meetings.  Even if it's just Zoom.  If your school offers free tutoring, use it.  And bring your study group mates.\n\nAnd you cannot be afraid of office hours.\n\nNot an exaggeration when I say that by the time we got to the final, half the class had dropped, or just stopped showing up.  And I was lucky that I had a good teacher who cared, and I can't imagine how bad the rates are with bad teachers.",
