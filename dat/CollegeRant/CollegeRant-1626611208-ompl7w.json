  "text": "I have an exam tomorrow and I\u2019m not done studying. That\u2019s unlike me, because I normally study 3-5 days before an exam but now, I\u2019m just tired. \n\nI just finished my first session of summer class, and now I\u2019m taking the second session. Both math classes and it\u2019s exhausting. Next semester, I have 5 tough classes to take and it\u2019s already stressing me out. \n\nI wished I changed majors earlier because even though I added an extra semester, nothing really changed. I still have to take summer classes. I am just exhausted. \n\nI am an international student so I can\u2019t say I want to take a break or anything.",
