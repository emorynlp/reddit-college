  "title:": "A professor lowered the mark of my master's dissertation because they hate my tutor",
  "text": "Not from the US and English is not even my second language. I'm on mobile phone. \n\nSo, here where I live your Master's dissertation marks goes like this: 40% your tutor, 60% a tribunal where you should defend your dissertation. \n\nWell, my work was outstanding, not by my criteria but my tutor gave me a 100% and the other people at the tribunal too. I was at the 'semifinals' for winning the best mark of all my Master's program, contesring against other 3 people. Here comes this professor, which, by the way, presides the tribunal. They decided by their own to lower the tribunal mark to a 80%. So, I got a final mark of 88%.\n\nHear me out, I know it's a great mark. But I deserved better. I have been working on this project all year round and made it 'till here just to have a mediocre mark. \n\nObviously, I complained. Chattering around with other students, turns out my tutor presided the tribunal of the tutored by the president of my tribunal and gave her a bad mark too. And, furthermore, they have been doing this for eons... I want to scream so bad right now and tell them to grow the f out. They are messing with our marks because they can't with each other.\n\nEdit to add a TL;DR: they have been hating each other for years and mess with students marks on their way",

All professors at the tribunal gave me the best mark. The president decided to not care and lowered it. So yeah, I \"deserved better\" than a fight between professors, because we are all adults.",
