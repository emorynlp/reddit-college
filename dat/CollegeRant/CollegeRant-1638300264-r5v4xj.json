  "text": "I\u2019m sitting in her online class and I fkn wish I could drop it. The way she post the assignments is super sloppy and I get penalized bc I did the assignment she posted early thinking it was the one that was due. I\u2019m so sick of this it\u2019s a fkn 1 credit gym class and you\u2019re gonna be an asshole. Like no wonder only \u201c20%\u201d of the class did the assignment you give out too much shit for a useless class. I can\u2019t even get out of this and might loose my grant I\u2019m just so frustrated.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve calmed down still annoyed but it\u2019s my fault for not reading properly and I should have start sooner (obvious things) I just have to get my shit together :,)",
