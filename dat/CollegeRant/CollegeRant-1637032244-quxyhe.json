  "text": "Hello, friends of Reddit! I need to share some deeply disturbing information that I need to make known. A student at the college I go to, Skidmore College in New York, was suspended for the entire semester for naming her abuser on Instagram. The abuser happens to come from a very privileged family and through careful maneuvering of the new Trump title XI laws was able to conjure ground to suspend the victim after the post was claimed to have broken the NCO between the two. As I am sure you can understand this is horrible. I  NEED the fine people of Reddit and college students around America to take a stand with me on this petition to state that sexual assault survivors will not be thrown out of housing by a corrupted administration. -- [https://www.change.org/p/new-york-times-skidmore-suspends-victim-of-sexual-assault](https://www.change.org/p/new-york-times-skidmore-suspends-victim-of-sexual-assault)\\--",

I'm not saying this girl is lying, but if she is, and she outed someone as an abuser--who isn't actually an abuser--do you know how much that can fuck up their future (think mattress girl)? Best to let an investigation actually play out before publicly shaming someone.",
