Also I always fall into the trap of telling myself that I don\u2019t have enough time and then I end up procrastinating by scrolling on Instagram or watching YouTube or tv anyway. This actually makes me feel tired because I\u2019m not getting a good social balance. Just join a light-commitment club where it\u2019s like an hour or two per week. In school you definitely can set aside an hour. Not to be harsh, but it sounds like a part of you is trying to avoid putting yourself out there. Remember, just because something new feels uncomfortable, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dangerous. You just have to gradually train yourself to become more comfortable to putting energy and effort into joining a group or connecting with people and being ok with whatever result you get. You got this man it just takes time and exposure. Also, you can label what\u2019s going on like \u201cI was really hoping to make more friends as soon as I got here, how do you feel about your experience at college?\u201d Maybe say something like that",
