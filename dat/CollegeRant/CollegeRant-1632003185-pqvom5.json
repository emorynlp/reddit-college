  "text": "Hey guys I have something to share that's positive. As you know, because of my college and my loneliness I felt really bad recently, as well as most of last year. But today I went to an exhibition about the different clubs and associations in by big city . I've seen some NGOs with stuff like human rights, helping people around the world and cultural stuff, sports clubs, LGBT, children's entertainment, etc. It was really really cool and entertaining! :relaxed: And also I've seen some clubs where I'd actually want to go, and it'll be nice, now my life actually has some meaning and will be fun! :blush: I hope I'll finally enroll in some of those organisations and everything would be better then! :kissing\\_heart: Good luck guys! :hugging:",
