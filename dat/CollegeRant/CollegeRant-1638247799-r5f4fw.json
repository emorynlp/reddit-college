  "text": "I have sooooo many assignments due later this week and while you'd think that would motivate me to get everything done, I seem to stress about my assignments more than I actually work on them. This late in the semester all of the information I'm trying to force in my brain is so complicated and complex that my brain immediately wants to switch my attention to something less mentally exhausting than the material I'm trying to learn (coding). I have *too* much to do and I feel like a deer in headlights, completely paralyzed. The fact that after this insane week is finals is almost too much. Christmas break is right around the corner so I'm trying to hold on but damn the end of this semester is just absolutely brutal.",

      "text": "Heyo! CS student too. Same situation. I believe this is called workload paralysis. I have been told that it  helps to chunk your work into smaller parts. What helps for me is telling myself I\u2019m going to do something for five minutes and usually I\u2019ll build up enough inertia to get it done.\n\nMost of the time, though, I tell myself:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to get don\u2019t anyway, might as well get it out of the way.\u201d",
