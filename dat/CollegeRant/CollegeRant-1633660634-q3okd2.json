  "text": "I'm currently working on finishing my master's degree and I only have thesis left. I've been having some incompatibility issues with my advisor and feel like I want to take some time off and come back with a new advisor.\n\nMy university requires continuous enrollment after taking 3 credit hours of thesis, which means that for each semester after the semester you took the 3 credit hour thesis you have to stay enrolled in one credit hour until you finish. So if I take a year off I could have to pay for four credit hours and then another credit hour to enroll in the semester I plan to finish. They consider summer sessions to apply to the policy which is why it would be four (fall + spring + 2 summer).\n\nI am reading that it helps encourage graduate students to finish their programs, but it really strikes me as a bullshit money-grab. Does anyone have any thoughts/opinions on these policies?\n\nTLDR: Feeling financially fucked over by continuous enrollment policy in finishing thesis",
