  "text": "Are you shitting me with that shit? Fuck my university, fuck any university that charges students so much money for fucking parking. \n\nSchools already so damn expensive, the fucking audacity! \n\nAnd contract parking, what makes you think I can afford that per semester? Maybe I could save the money but then I got bills to pay and tuition fees. \n\nSo honestly go fuck yourself school, go fucking fuck yourself. \n\n6 fucking dollars per hour! \n\nTaking transit is not an option for me, I\u2019ve got work right after class is over and I don\u2019t have time to run to the bus take some time to be late. I can\u2019t afford that.",
