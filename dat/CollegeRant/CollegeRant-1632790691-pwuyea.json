  "text": "For a decent amount of my life Ive wanted to go into the stem field, mostly engineering, considering a lot of people in my life always boosted up my head and made me feel as if I was just the G.O.A.T. at math and science. Like Ive even wanted to be an astronaut at one point. However upon learning about the cools things you get to do in architecture(I took 3 years of a drafting class in high school and have adored architecture since) I decided that maybe I'll go into a field that blends the two.\n\nSo here I am, at the only school of maybe 25 in the USA and only school im my state that has the Architectural Engineering major and im literally miserable in the math and physics part. I gain headaches everyday from having to star at a screen all day long by trying to study because I dont have the paper books or doing the homework. I have to stay in most of the time to do the homework that I have to just know how to do because the teachers dont really explain how to do problems similar to the homework unless asked so we have to go to the homework of the next subject before its even started on class to get our questions answered.\n\nAnd dont get me wrong, I try tutoring. To the point where im literally stuck being out all day everyday of the week(except for Fridays-sunday) in tutoring or doing my school work. And even then on the weekends I have to do the homework because its due on the Tuesday of each week so my weekends are spent with me frustrating myself over the homework while watching everyone else go out from my window. I barely have any friends because im always stuck trying to figure out the work while most people in my class are moving forward pretty fast. \n\nBut today someone helped me realize that i was literally only mediocre at math and not as good as everyone from high school always claimed and that my strong suit is English(I love writing(mostly fantasy) and can whip up a VERY nice essay) and being creative(blueprints) and even catch myself mapping out blueprints of buildings as i walk through them. \n\nSo now I feel like i want to switch majors from this engineering headache to architecture even though i know it'll prob be bad too but not as bad is what I hope. Im holding off for now but gosh I want to make stuff so bad. I can barely do my hobbies because of this engineering stuff its so draining and im tired everyday. Ugh.\n\nTL,DR: I was told growing up that i should go into engineering, now im in my engineering field of choice but I want to be a regular architect.",
