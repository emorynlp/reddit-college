At least in a real life proctored environment prof/ta/proctor is occasionally walking around checking. \n\nTbh it should all be #3, its not like the profs actually teach us shit anyway.",

      "text": "I only have two midterms this week and they're #1 (though the professor of that class literally talked with us about whether it should be #1 or #2 since all the quizzes have been open-notes because he's cool like that) and #3 (that professor is also pretty chill) \n\nI have yet to run into #2 yet since all the freshmen classes are chill like that and probably won't since according to my advisor, the school is leaning towards being closer to normal for the fall semester because of the way the vaccines are looking",
