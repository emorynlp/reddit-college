  "text": "We've been online due to COVID and now my uni is moving to in person classes. So, I'll need to park.\n\nI'll be on campus for one hour, one day a week, and the semester is half over.\n\nWant to know what they charge for parking for this amount of time? $141.\n\nWant to know what their economy option costs? $75.\n\nThere's no way in hell that I'm going to pay my ridiculous school nearly 150 dollars for one hour if parking, once a week, for half a semester.\n\nI don't think I'd pay that fee for a few hours, two or three minimum days a week, for an entire semester.\n\nLooks like I'll be walking through town to my campus \ud83d\ude43\n\nThis uni really has been shit to me and I've only been attending a year. I've never had issues with college until I transferred here.\n\nTldr: school wants $141 for one hour of parking once a week. Big dumb. Fuck that.",
