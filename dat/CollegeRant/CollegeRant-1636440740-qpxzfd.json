  "text": "Uggh. I can't.   \n\n\nI feel like such a moron, and really wonder if I should just drop out of school if I can't handle something so trivial.  \n\n\nBasically, I have to complete an outline for a research paper in a few days. I've never done a research paper before and am having a lot of trouble figuring out how to research it.  \n\n\nI keep procrastinating because I don't feel confident in myself, and I don't know what tf I'm doing.  \n\n\nThis paper makes up a large chunk of my grade, so I've got a lot on the line, and am anxious as hell, and lonely, and low self esteem. I really need to be confident and dedicated to researching what I should be, but I can't be motivated, and I have no experience doing this.",

      "text": "Most colleges have a writing center or some sort of writing resource/help. I'd suggest looking into that or even just setting up an office hour with your professor if they seem nice. Explain the situation and ask for guidance. If they're a decent professor they should be willing to help. It's what they're there for. Don't be ashamed and remember things worth doing are worth doing poorly even. Don't give up. I'd also recommend looking up examples of an outline for a research paper online or examples of a paper.",

      "text": "I know this is a rant. But out of curiosity, how are you in college and never have written a research paper before? In most US states, a research paper is a basic requirement to graduate from high school. I\u2019m not judging, just truly curious. \nI\u2019m not a fan of research papers either, but it feels great once you have completed one. Starting a paper is often the hardest step in writing a paper. You\u2019re not a moron\u2026.. it probably just seems like a ton of work (which it is) and you don\u2019t know how to break it down into smaller steps.",

          "text": "Homeschooled. There were gaps in my education, but I'm trying to make the best of it now. I was supposed to do a research paper in one of my earlier English classes in college, but that was when the pandemic hit, and they decided to go easy on us. So, yeah, first research paper, and I feel very lost.",
