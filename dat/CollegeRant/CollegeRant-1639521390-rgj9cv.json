  "title:": "Biology Extra Credit work makes the entire classes grades DROP",
  "text": "So I\u2019m in a Biology course and my biology professor decided to allow us to do some extra credit assignments if we wanted. It would bring up our grade by five points so if you had an 80 your grade would go up to an 85. I had an 83 so my grade should\u2019ve been brought up to an 88. \n\nSo yesterday the extra credit work was graded and despite it being the full 5 pts our grades DROPPED ranging from one point to 5 and one of my classmates contacted the professor and she said she would fix it.\n \nMy 83 was brought down to an 82 so I thought it would be fixed. Final grades were due today and not only do I have a B- but my grade dropped to an 81. When I emailed my professor she was like \u201coh the extra credit wasn\u2019t weighted the same as your other work and that\u2019s why your grade dropped\u201d\nIdk maybe I\u2019m just too mad to think straight but she EXPLICITLY told us our grade would go up 5 pts and now it\u2019s dropped and final grades are in and we can\u2019t do ANYTHING. I wish she would\u2019ve just kept it off",

              "text": "After you calm down, peruse the syllabus and the breakdown of grades. \n\nDid your 83 average include your final exam grade? \n\nIf so, is an 83 a B or a B-? \n\nIf it is a B-, then no big deal.\n\nIf it is a B, though, you need to ask for a detailed breakdown of how your grade was determined. Extra credit, by definition, should be factored as a #/0, which makes it impossible to lower your grade. While the numerator might have very little weight, the denominator *should have no weight at all*!",

My final exam grade was already calculated so the 83 was my final grade until I did the extra credit. I don\u2019t know how she managed to do this",
