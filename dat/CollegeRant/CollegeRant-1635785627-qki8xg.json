  "text": "Each class is only 10 weeks long or more like 8 because we don't learn anything in weeks 1 and 10. By the time we hit week 5 we have just finished unit 1 and taken a test and gave gotten maybe 3 lectures in to unit 2 and now you're just gonna drop a massive test on us that is essentially a repeat of exam one only for us to take the unit 2 test a week and a half from now? What gives?\n\nIf it's so important to give us a test on week 5 why not drop exams 1 and 2 and combine them for the midterm?",
