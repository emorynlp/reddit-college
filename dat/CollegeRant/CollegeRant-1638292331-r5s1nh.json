  "text": "Man been trying to get my grades up  in college, but its so hard when nothing is enjoyable anymore. After failing my Cal 3 exam last year its been so hard to try my best and get good grades at uni. I thought time would heal this wound I have from failing too many subjects but it did not. So Im trying other things. Depression is really strong and its so tough man.",

      "text": "Can definitely relate. I had to drop a Chem class after a rough start to the semester and trying my best. I also have a bunch of personal problems that make it hard for me to stay in school, but I have to have really good grades for my scholarship and grad school. I just don't really care anymore. I want to stay at my school,but I'm not really having a typical college experience and I have been trying my best to make it better, but I just feel left behind. I feel like it's really hard to succeed in college both academically and socially if you're not really outgoing and at every office hour and all the events. I try to fake it so I can get more involved, but I'm still not doing as well as I would like.",
