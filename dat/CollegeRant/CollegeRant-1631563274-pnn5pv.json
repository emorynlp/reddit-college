  "title:": "Absolutely no healthy food options on campus",
  "text": "Ugh, this is just a rant. I'm trying to eat clean and healthy, but there's no way to do that efficiently at my school. The cafeteria is only open for two 1.5 hour blocks a day and serves mainly over processed carbs and cheap processed meats. Their \"healthy\" options consist of a sugary chicken rice stir fry. I wish I were kidding. The \"salad bar\" is not self serve and extremely limited. \n\nThe only other food option is the student union which only has convenience store junk food and a limited greasy fast food grill with pizza. Fried chicken strips are literally the \"healthiest\" choice. The only other semi healthy option is the salad/sub shop... but even that has very limited ingredients and no unprocessed protien options. No eggs! No grilled chicken, only \"baja chicken\" which is loaded with soduim and sugar seasoning. No olive oil or real vinegar for dressing either! I'm left to choose sugary, fatty ranch or nothing at all. \n\nBecause they require me to purchase a $1700 meal plan every semester I can't afford to go out shopping for groceries. Even if I could, there is no communal kitchen or appliances allowed. My mini fridge cannot hold enough fruits/vegetables/protiens. No freezer either. I'm working very hard to eat healthy but these food options are making it nearly impossible. How is anyone expected to maintain a proper diet under these conditions?? It's just so frustrating, and expensive.",

Cooking for yourself is not that difficult and much cheaper and potentially healthier if you have discipline. $1700 a semester is ridiculous; considering a semester is about 4 months, that\u2019s $100 a week for food that isn\u2019t appetizing or healthy; I\u2019ve managed to eat quite healthily and happily for about $80 a week when I\u2019m in charge of my own cooking, even including eating out once in a while.",

I go to a smaller school (still a public state school, but small) and we have a legit catering company managing our dining. \n\nI\u2019ll never complain about how they cut back the menu (probably because pandemic) again.",
