  "text": "So I just submitted literally the worst piece of work I've ever written. The references are all over the place, the layout is fucked and it was like 1000 words under the word count... I figured it's better to submit something rather than nothing but I feel genuinely ashamed of it. I don't know whether to email my professor to apologise or try and delete it from turnitin or what. I submitted it at 16:29, the term ends (hence the absolute cutoff) was 16:30. I feel like an absolute knob. What's worse is I didn't even manage to submit one of my final pieces- I almost wish I'd done that one instead because at least I could have done a better job (as it was a smaller project)\n\nI'm going to try and access summer resits but I don't know how likely they'll be to accept as this is (meant to be) my final year. I was so fucking close. What a waste.",

I have had professors during the pandemic who gave everyone 100s on final papers because they knew that it has been a really rough year (let's be honest, more like over four if you are American). Not to excuse your behavior, but it is hope. I recommend you take a sabbatical and see a therapist, and then look at potentially working with your college on how to better yourself. If you are not well then you cannot be a good student.",
