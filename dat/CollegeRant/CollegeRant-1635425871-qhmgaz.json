  "text": "I did one year of collage last year games design animation and Vfx got a pass but still haven\u2019t received my qualification. Decided to drop out a year early so I got 1 abs a half a levels. I\u2019m now doing graphic design but I feel like I\u2019m not getting anywhere and when I\u2019m done I\u2019ll still be working in retail or something I\u2019d rather just invest my money. At least I\u2019ve made some friends out of college.",
