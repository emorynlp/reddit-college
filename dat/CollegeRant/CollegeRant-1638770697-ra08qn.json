  "title:": "Getting Kicked Out",
  "text": "I\u2019m doing fairly well in my other classes, but I\u2019m going to end up failing math. My parents said they would kick me out if I failed and it looks like it will happen. I have until February 28th to figure stuff out and I\u2019m not sure what to do. This is basically a rant I guess, but the thing is something happened to me in my personal life involving an ex in the spring of this year which caused me to stop doing school work. My family knew I wasn\u2019t mentally okay, but this semester they forced me to quit my job as a delivery driver at Pizza Hut, and go back to school even though I was not ready. Now I have no job and only two months. I\u2019m not sure what to do or how to not feel like a disappointment",

      "text": " I know it's stressful but the good news is that many college students live on their own without support from their parents. Once you're independent you don't have to do anything they say. So my suggestion is to work towards moving out so you can make your own decisions on your own time line and if you're parents still try to micromanage your life, ignore it, and focus on what you need first.",
