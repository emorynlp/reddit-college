  "text": "Even if it's a course that's a subject you already look into in your spare time, some professors will manage to suck all the fun out of it via overly difficult assignments and stress\n\nEven if it's a English-based course and you were really good at English in high school/scored well on the English/Reading sections for the ACT or SAT, you might get stuck with a professor who assigns a novel and expects 5+ pages on it within the same week\n\nEven if you don't really like your field and you think those particular classes are a reflection of your \"true major\", trust me, after a semester in bad courses, you will be very happy with your decision to stay with your current field,\n\nDon't assume that just because a class is in the humanities/gen-ed/diversity/social justice category, that it will automatically be a cakewalk compared to your normal classes. If anything, these classes might end up being more challenging and run by worse professors who don't really care if you are also taking several other credit hours.\n\nAfter severely struggling with my humanities courses this semester (I might end up having to use pass/fail for both of them), I talked to some upperclassmen who basically told me everything I just told you. Humanities classes can be some of the most difficult courses required on a major due to unrealistic workloads, shitty professors who take themselves and their course way too seriously, and students who set up the false expectations of thinking that they could pretty much just get an A by showing up.\n\nNow they key word here is some, not all. A lot of these classes actually are chill and keep their workloads pretty low and their course work pretty simple, but sometimes you only find them if you\n\n* Check the professor's rating on RateMyProfessor, if they have one before you enroll in a class (or at least before the deadline to withdraw from a class without financial penalty)\n* Talk to upperclassmen in your field to see what classes they ended up picking and which ones they loved or hated.\n* Don't be afraid to just withdraw from the class if the workload proves to be too much for you",

Luckily most of my professors have been pretty funny and well natured. One of my favorites tends to clap anytime anyone answers anything lol, really boosts my serotonin tbh. At least you'll know that you won't need to worry about making gen ed writing intensive credits (if ya'll need those, idk if it's a given worldwide), as most of the courses are by default writing intensive. I just wanna perish :)",

But for what I've seen Is a world where students Hunt and cherry pick \"Easy\" professors based off RMP sites. \n\n So now the question begs to be asked... What Is the difference between Stem and Humanities if most students are picking professor's courses based off how easy they are?.",

          "text": "First of all, your flexibility in picking a professor depends largely on who's offering it the quarter you're taking it and whether their classes fill up by your enrollment or not. You usually only end up with like 3 options, and most of the time none of them are \"easy\".\n\nSecondly, most students are not just picking easy classes. Many of my peers pick harder professors who teach better vs. easy professors who you won't learn anything from. Also students often choose to take harder classes as electives over easier ones because they're interested in entering the field. The most popular CS elective at my university, for example, is popular because it's related to software engineering, not because it's easy.",
