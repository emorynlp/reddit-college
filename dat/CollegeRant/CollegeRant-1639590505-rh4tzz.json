  "text": "Is it just me or is when you enroll in classes it\u2019s the most ridiculous thing ever you fill out papers online followed by more documents that ask the same question and then after you enroll there are things you have to complete to be able to build your schedule and if you don\u2019t do these things you might not be able to take classes but the stuff they want you yo complete is so frustrating and difficult to find on there sight or wherever they direct you to that you just don\u2019t even want to do it, my grandma said when she went to college it was never this complicated and she thinks that part of the reason why kids don\u2019t want to go to college is because how ridiculously repetitive and frustrating the enrollment process is",

If the automated voice said it was full, I had to put in the 5 digit code for my second choice, etc.  until I built enough units to count as a full time student. \n\nI've since gone to grad school and it is so much easier!  Sorry your system is inconvenient, though.  It does sound like a lot of unnecessary steps.",
