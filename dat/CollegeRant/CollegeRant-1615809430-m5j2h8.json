  "text": "I just need to vent a little. I am so disappointed in myself I want to cry, although I know it's not really the end of the world. Completed a macroeconomics group project a week earlier than the deadline with a lot of care and dedication (I am A student in uni) and forgot the most essential part, to f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* sending it. Only remembered this morning, 10 hours after the deadline. It is worth 5% of the grade, a considerable part. I feel so bad about my colleagues. I just hope it is not a 0 and that they are understanding of human errors.\n\nI am so stupid.",

It doesn't matter what happens next but if this happened to me I would the professor and take responsibility for what happened, letting him/her know that it was my fault for turning it in late and that it was my job.\n\nThat's just so maybe my partners would still get credit that otherwise may be lost. \n\nAgain, don't beat yourself up. Just recently I forgot to take a quiz worth 2.5% of my grade. We've all been there.",

      "text": "I feel for you. It\u2019s totally human to make a mistake like that. The good thing is that as time passes and you get more perspective the sting will fade.\n\nI think sending it in with an explanatory note is the right thing to do. You can\u2019t really control the TA\u2019s reaction; all you can do is your best at this point. It\u2019s true that beating yourself up about it just makes things worse (and I will also say from experience that it\u2019s good to know the symptoms of depression; one of them is holding yourself and others to unrealistically high standards).\n\nAnd this is a learning experience; it could spur you to work out a system of reminding yourself when to do important things (because, sadly, important deadlines exist post-college, and you don\u2019t necessarily get better at remembering them without a system).",

I sent an email to one TA which is really nice with an apology about it, saying that i take full responsability about the mistake, hopefully the message gets through. It was a 2 week assignment that could be done in 3/5 hours, so there's no advantage in sending it late.\n\nStill, I am not happy about myself, I should have done better.",
