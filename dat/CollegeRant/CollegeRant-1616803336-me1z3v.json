  "text": "I am a second semester freshman. Currently, I feel so alone. I am all online and which means I have no in person classes. My college canceled our spring break which is fucking annoying. The point of a break is a fucking break. Nope not for my college they said, \u201cScrew your mental health, work for 18 weeks straight\u201d. Everyday is an exact replica of the day before. I sit at my desk all day do work teach myself everything then collapse into my bed. This cycle feels never ending. I have no friends. This is my only college experience I have had. I guess the point of this rant is is this what college is actually like? I am ruining my mental health over online college. \n\n\nTL:DR Everyday is the same. My only experiences are through online classes. Is this what college is actually like?",

Idk why my college got rid of spring break, like  they don't understand us... I have some friends from other colleges who have spring break I don't see the point of taking that away from us........This whole first year of college I've been doing online.  I guess my real experience in college will start sophomore year hahah",

      "text": "this is not what college is like i promise!!!! i am a 3rd year college student and i feel the same exact way as you do right now. i try to leave my house at least once a day either to get coffee or to just simply drive around. i always make sure to set an alarm, get up in the morning and get dressed because it makes me feel productive. i usually would just sleep until my class started and listened to it in bed in my pajamas which was not helpful at all. do you have any hometown friends you can reach out to? i know its hard to hang out with people due to the pandemic, but maybe you could try to talk to people online. i think reddit could be a good start or even any social media apps, i know bumble has an option for friends to look for. you can always message me as well, it would be helpful for me too to talk to someone. you are definitely not alone with school burnout, my college canceled spring break as well and online school sucks. i wish you the best of luck and keep hanging in there even though its hard right now\u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "That really sucks in so many ways. As an upper classman, my suggestion to you is to make friends with some upper classmen. Or join some clubs with them. Many have established friend groups, which are easier to join / be added into than creating one from scratch. If you were at my school I\u2019d invite you to events and game nights and book clubs and whatnot that I\u2019m already part of! \n\nTo answer your question, no this is not what it\u2019s like in a normal year. Hopefully things will be in person next semester!! \n\nBig hug for you <3",

Having online classes suck too because I easily get distracted and this whole COVID situation Gives me no motivation so I Haven\u2019t been doing any of my work and giving it my all. I wish I had some left in me from high school or my first semester but I honestly see no future anymore....I\u2019m just tired and have the mindset of self hate because I should be doing well in school since it\u2019s online but I\u2019m not. Idk if any other freshmen feel the same, with giving so more shits and just letting grades drop but at the same time stressed that your a failure. I hate college, freshman year sucks",

But that doesn\u2019t fix the problems unfortunately.\n\nThe mindset of self hate is something that happened to me a lot before I went to therapy and I was able to challenge it. But I started colt and all the things i fixed about me came back in college. The only way I combat it is changing the story in my head. It helps to a certain extent.",

It really sucks that you don\u2019t get a spring break, I feel for you. This year, we are going to need to try extra hard to find ways to interact with people to make sure that this doesn\u2019t become the most boring year of college.",
