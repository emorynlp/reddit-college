  "text": "Long story and I\u2019m starting from the beginning.\n\nA couple days ago I had a meeting with my counselor that was an hour or so long. I left feeling very positive. I got into my car and I checked canvas as habit. My eyes bulged out of my head because on my to die list is says \u201c FINAL EXAM LOCKDOWN BROWSER due at 1:15 pm\u201d . I check the time it was 12:15 pm. Im full on panicked mode because the exam wasn\u2019t until the 13 in class not right now online. Im in my car quickly reaching for my laptop. I think to myself that I can\u2019t make it home to do the test so I had to do it my car. Side note: I really could\u2019ve went back in my school building. All I had to do was pray that laptop was charged. Thankfully it was. I decided to take the exam in my car. \n\nSo im taking the exam that im not fully prepared for at all but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s better than a 0. As I literally only had 6 questions left my exam locks me out. The questions disappeared. I was in disbelief until I checked my phone notifications. My prof changed the due date to the 13.  I tried to exit locked down browser but couldn\u2019t because it said I was still on an activity. So I was stuck. I emailed my professor IMMEDIATELY of the situation.  All he said was he never changed the date and it was always Monday. I\u2019m like ok fine I\u2019ll just take the exam again in person. No biggie. \n\nThe night before my final I couldn\u2019t sleep. I spent all night studying. Yes I know it\u2019s bad thing to do but I did it anyway. I showed up to class mildly prepared and \u2026.no one showed up. My professor was in his office so I think maybe I\u2019m to early. A classmate showed up and we started talking. After awhile we started to get confused so went to go see the professor. We ask if the final is today and he says \u201cyes online\u201d. We politely exit and once out of sight We let loose. \n\nOn canvas he tells us the final is in person and all we have to bring to class is pencils. ALso he says nothing about this in my email from before. I quickly remembered that I technically already took the exam but couldn\u2019t finish it so I went to go speak with him. I explained the situation and he says at first theirs nothing he can do it says I took the exam for an hour. I quickly EXPLAINED again with more clarity on why that was the case. He finally says that I can finish rest of my questions. \n\nI\u2019m happy for that but I\u2019m pissed as fuck that this situation happened to me to begin with. I took an examp way early than I meant too that I could\u2019ve aced just to get a B.  I pass the class which is great but I wanted a certain grade to help with my gpa but now that\u2019s in the toilet. They\u2019re things I did wrong in the class and I kinda wish one of them was not taking the exam the first time.",

I swear it's cumulative(I don't like that) I for the most part understood the last two chapters. And if it was just one that i could possibly pass the class but nope. I'm trying to stay positive about but there's not much I can do",
