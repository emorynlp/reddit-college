I did a Physics degree, but I took one class each year  - philosophy, political science, history of pop music, urban ecology - as a much needed break from all the equations and math.\n\nIntro Philosophy forced me to think logically, and greatly improved all my science classes. I highly recommend it!",

If you switch to humanities you need to have a solid career plan in mind, such as law or academia since they are not typically skill based degrees like stem degrees tend to be. In the end its your life and you have to be satisfied with what you do, if stem isn\u2019t doing it for you this is your chance to get out.",

      "text": "Two things.\n\n1.) I also got bored with science during COVID because I really enjoyed sharing my love for the subject with other people. Once that was gone, it was tough to enjoy it and I burned out not being able to bounce ideas off of other people. Now that I\u2019m back engaging with science as a communal activity, it\u2019s become inspiring again (and I\u2019m more excited to start my PhD!).\n\n2.) I too enjoy many other subjects - politics, economics, history, etc - and enjoy the conversations, reading, and deep thought come along with them. Honestly, there are times when science becomes boring, monotonous, and isolating for me too, but I stick with it because deep down I know I love it. The truth is any subject can get boring when it gets super hard. I always try to reserve time for those other subjects - being well rounded keeps me happy.\n\nThe real question is why do you think you are bored and what part bores you? Also what is your learning process, and how do you feel after a lecture or scientific conversation? Drained or invigorated?",
