  "title:": "How can someone be so clueless constantly",
  "text": "Honestly I almost feel jealous of people who are fucking clueless, so ignorant, with their head so deeply shoved up their own ass that they just simply don\u2019t give a fuck how their actions affect other people, or literally just have never learned the art of self reflection. Must be peaceful and nice. \n\nMy roommate is actually fucking horrible and I basically am a commuter now because I just cannot live with this bitch anymore. I had read roommate horror stories before but wow. This is my reality and I fucking hate her bro. Like god she\u2019s just awful she has clearly never lived with anyone she slams shit and turns on lights when I\u2019m trying to sleep and plays loud music, never lets me know when she will be back, could be 8 pm, could be midnight, could be 4 am. Then she comes in when I\u2019m sleeping, turns on lights and slams down her shit, plays videos on her phone, takes fucking phone calls at 1 am. Like wow. I am truly amazed this person is in college. 6 year olds act like this. Not 20 year olds. \n\nAnyways I just needed to rant because I\u2019m about 2 seconds away from just telling her she fucking sucks and if she acts like this throughout her whole life then people will really hate her. She lives in her own little world in her head and no one else matters. I swear she forgets I\u2019m even in the same room with her.",

You\u2019re an adult, address the situation like one. Have a calm constructive conversation with her.  If you\u2019re in a dorm you can also talk to the supervisor.",

I don\u2019t think ranting on a rant forum is acting like a 6 year old. If I were doing things on purpose to annoy her and be petty, then yeah I\u2019d be acting like a 6 year old. I\u2019ve been extremely patient with her. She\u2019s just an asshole.",
