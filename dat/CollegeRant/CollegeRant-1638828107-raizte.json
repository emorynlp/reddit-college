  "text": "I\u2019m having the worst imposter syndrome rn, I feel so delusional because I know that I\u2019m not stupid and that not everyone is doing perfectly, but I just feel so stupid.\nI used to be an amazing student but after this semester my grades dropped significantly, and I feel so embarrassed. I can\u2019t remember the last time I actually felt confident in myself and in my work. I used to base my worth 100% on my grades, and it was one of the only wants I felt connected to my family . Whenever I had no friends or was extremely alone, I would always tell myself \u201cat least I have good grades\u201d and use it to define my worth. Now Every time I see another student I always think to myself \u201coh I bet they have all A\u2019s and are in a healthy relationship and have tons of friends\u201d and sometimes go in depth and imagine these fake lives for these random people on campus .\nI\u2019m so sick of feeling stupid, I wish I could redo this semester and prove myself as a student, but I also wish I could have made friends and actually had a social life as well.",

I feel the same way but have come to realize most kids at college are just going through the motions and get C\u2019s. I always find it helps to connect with professors. They will hype you up. Make them your friend!",

      "text": "I have been the same way this semester. Straight A's until this semester, luckily I scraped by on my finals and I have all C's. I have super high anxiety so I don't really make friends well, but if you're forced into a group project or anything, be super friendly and continue to talk to them afterwards. That's how I have the few friends that I do. College is hard and everyone quality of life is pretty low right now. Just do the best you can and that's enough. C's get degrees my friend.",
