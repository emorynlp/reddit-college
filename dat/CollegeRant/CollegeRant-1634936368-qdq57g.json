  "text": "She drives up my blood pressure so much, I have to make an effort to chill out. She seems to think that this class (which I enjoy very much) is a private discussion between her and the professor and that we're all here just to listen to her. She talks so much, very audibly and physically agrees with whatever is being said, and had her hand up super high while someone else was trying to say something, like expecting to be called on while this other person was talking. And she tries to be funny and say 'relatable' stuff in hopes of generating a response. Idk she just annoys me so much. Maybe it's that she reminds me too much of myself when I was 14, a very insecure person who didn't know when it wasn't supposed to be about me. Not a big deal, it's just that every time she raises her hand or I hear her voice it makes me cringe.",

      "text": "God, I know a guy like that and he always thought he was the smartest and best student because nobody else was supposedly as fascinated with the material as him. He is smart and he knows a lot but he was also wrong a lot and super disrespectful. Simply insufferable. Nobody liked him or wanted to do group work with him and that's probably how it has always been for him and truly I feel sorry. He didn't make any friends and obviously the professors didn't do anything to integrate him because this obviously isn't elementary school anymore. \n\nI haven't seen him since covid and hope he dropped out of the teachers' education program to pursue a regular BA because he would be a terrible teacher.",
