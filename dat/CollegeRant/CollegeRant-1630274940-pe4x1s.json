  "text": "I seriously do not know how I got this far. Beyond basic adding and subtracting I legitimately don't know how to do any math. I can't multiply, divide, nothing. I do above average in every other subject, but I just can't fucking do math. Now in college I'm being required to do all these high level math courses little do they know I unironically have 2nd grade level math abilities. \n\n  Obviously the easy answer is to go to tutoring and study more, but I would basically have to learn ALL of math up to this point. Idk I might just be fucked at this point.",

My first college math class and how extremely frustrating it was to fail it with all the help/studying/tutoring I could cram into my schedule was actually the catalyst for me being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and H O L Y  S H I T  I cannot do justice to the complete difference this made for me, academically and in life generally. Does your campus have a counseling or psychological services department you could contact? I really recommend at least looking into it. All the best of luck to you in your classes!",
