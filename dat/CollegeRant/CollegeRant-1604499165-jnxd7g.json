  "text": "First year in online college (covid-19) and my midterms were far from great. Got two 55% and one 60%, after hours of studying. Extremely difficult exams (lack of time and very difficult questions).\n\nOnline school don't seem to help me.. I have anxiety, no concentration, etc. It's the first time in all of my life where I failed this much, always had A in all of my courses (never less than 85% and a top R score).\n\nThat's not even the worse part. \n\nAll of my midterms class averages are 70%. Because half of the students failed (45-50% range) like me or they got great grades (100%). I will let you guess why half of the students got 100%... Cheating during exams in big zoom groups. Seriously.\n\nThe school administration and teachers know about it (online difficulty and cheating), but they seem to close their eyes on these problems.\n\nI'm done with university. If they don't do something about it, I will drop out.",

          "text": "I've realised more and more that white collar jobs are maybe not the most lucrative jobs (in terms of time, happiness, salary) out there. Too much competition. Everyone is trying to get on the top, but they forget the enormous amount of lucrative jobs bellow. \n\nIt makes me think of the myth of the plumber winning more money than the medical doctor. Even if it's not true in terms of salary, the plumber has much more time for him and his family, a less stressful education and career, etc..",
