  "text": "I see some professors commenting on here supporting or gunning for some messed up professors and it's crazy...honestly. Just like there are bad students, there are also bad professors. You do not have to stick up for a professor just because they hold the same title as you do. It's okay to consider the fact that a fellow professor may, in fact, be in the wrong.",

      "text": "From a faculty perspective I can tell you that other professors dislike bad professors as well. A terrible faculty member can be anything from disheartening to infuriating. I've even seen the worst case scenario where bad professors drive away the good ones, end up hiring more like themselves, and end up poisoning an entire department. Often faculty don't have good tools or political position to address these issues even if they want to. Unfortunately, that means it falls on students to take action against infractions that the department is fully aware of.",
