  "title:": "Why is there so much emphasis nowadays on \"finding your passion,\" even if the school system doesn't let us do that?",
  "text": "I've always wondered about this axiom: \"find your passion.\" \"passion is worth more than money\" \"do what you love.\" How can we do that when the school system restricts us from most of the classes we take? Even in college, as I'm in now as a 17-year-old baby, at least for my college, many majors are unavailable to students, and it's nearly impossible and a hassle to transfer into them. Additionally, waitlists are in the hundreds, and people who don't get off get kicked during the second week of classes. College should be a time to broaden one's horizon. Why are we still doing the same things we've been doing in high school; taking worthless General Education courses that don't relate to our major and causing a massive hassle if one decides to change their major? Along with this, why is the enrollment system so cutthroat? College is supposed to be a place where you can take the classes you want.\n\nTo be more specific, 7 \"smaller\" colleges at my public university have specific GE requirements. Sadly I didn't realize the weight of the college I was put in, so I gladly accepted a role in one of them because of the school's ranking. My college is in the quarter system so about 3 quarters per year excluding optional summer, and my mini college requires me to take five quarters of history, called \"Making of the Modern World,\" be proficient with the fourth quarter of a second language, and take 3 \"regional specialization\" courses (more history). The five quarters of history in MMW aren't even as recent as the old white people in USH; they're as old as 3000 years ago when Buddha was still alive. Seriously? I'm going to college to learn the sciences and technology, and you make me learn about people who've been dead for 2000+ years? I've been looking back, and I feel like I made a big mistake about my college decision. All I cared about was the prestige, and now it's bitten me in the ass. I feel that there were much better choices of college that would have offered me more breadth in terms of the classes I could take. Also, I don't know what I'd do if I wanted to change my major. Now I feel like I'd have to suck it up since the history courses for my college do not transfer into any other college whatsoever, and the transfer college would nullify the work I'd done in that area.\n\nIf there's anything that you can learn from this, it's to do your research. Please don't focus on prestige; instead, focus on the freedom that the school is giving you and how easy it is to change your major/find your passion at the school.\n\nAny comment is appreciated. Thanks for attending my TED Talk.",

      "text": "Because your passion will motivate you for the next 35 years. Vs doing a job you hate but it pays a salary. Your passion usually will give way to some sort of path to a level of success you enjoy. \n\nI followed mine. Got a mfa in animation. I teach animation at a university and work with young adults that enjoy learning. I work on films and run a business I love. Life finds a way.",

      "text": "The argument for Gen Ed classes is more \u201cwell roundedness\u201d. Realistically, for the college, it\u2019s more money. \n\nPassion and money are two different paradigms. One brings you long term happiness, the other doesn\u2019t. One brings you a stable income, the other may not. Finding that balance is typically key.\n\nI think that it\u2019s smarter to find what you sorta like that pays well to eventually give you the means to follow your passion. However, if your passion pays well, go for it. \n\nWorking a job you hate is part of life. Even if you\u2019re passionate about it, you\u2019ll hate it eventually. The trick is really to stay happy for long term benefit. I\u2019m still having a hard time figuring this out. I have passion and job that pays really well but, I just don\u2019t have friends, a family or any of that sort. I get sad when I talk about it but, I did follow my passion. It\u2019s different for everyone.",

      "text": "weirdly enough I am living through this now.\n\nI literally graduated in 2018 with a ba in history minors in computers and business after 5 years. minors should be my majors and had to be reversed over bad advisors.\n\nI literally in 5 years had no help from my college. what happened, a acquaintance (as he and I no longer talk) and I were talking about passive income and could we make enough with passive earnings to not work.\n\nNeedless to say, he moved on with life. I am sitting here with \"mystery shopper and business auditing jobs\" to the point my eyes could bleed. but I get paid to test a restaurant or stores app and process. and compare menu prices to price my local airport.  I also w2 vendor at walmart, clean up battery boxes and get the left over sample machine items. \n\nSo basically after numerous attempts at getting a full time job, I am sitting with accounting books from community college to post bacc a cpa license and get my information science degree on the side. \n\nall because I liked talking survey sites 3 years ago. last year I was databasing photos at my local library so history is here too. its weird.",
