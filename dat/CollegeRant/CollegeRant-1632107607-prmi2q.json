  "text": "I'm so fucking tired of spaces I thought of as remotely safe being trampled by herds of people who don't give a fuck about anybody but them having a good time laughing and screaming and shooting off bottle rockets and firecrackers and COUGHING THEIR LUNGS OUT. \n\nLike you don't think having to leave class 15 minutes in to have a minutes long coughing fit in the hallway that is so bad that you can barely breathe while wearing the loosest fitting cloth mask I've seen in my life isn't, idk, a good reason not to come to class? I thought I respected you! Every single time I have the misfortune of walking past the gym, I see 20 maskless athletes gasping and panting and writhing like blind puppies, and in the evening when I see them tumbling into the library like a swarm of sweat-stenched locusts with nothing but a paper-thin surgical mask clinging for its godforsaken life to the lowest part of their upper lip, I see the home that isn't safe to go back to. I see the school nurse that refused to test me because the school had no tests left, I see the graphs of vaccine effectiveness declining over time. I see all of the hospitals spilling with blood and shit and the death rattles of nurses, babies, and elders, and the people who died outside of them. I see the orphans, I see my grandparents, I see my friends, I see my professors, I see all of the people who \"survived\" COVID with side-effects that will haunt them for the rest of their life, and I wonder what it must be like to give so little of a fuck about anything.\n\nThey put up 500 million signs everywhere, in the simplest possible language, that you have to wear a mask inside, but nobody gives a fuck! Nobody knows, or nobody cares. Every single time I see some group of maskless kids chuckling like morons, and 90 people sitting for hours in the cafeteria without masks, and worse, nobody stopping them, a little bit more of my soul dies. If you can't learn this shit after two fucking years, TWO FUCKING YEARS BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T LEARN HOW TO WEAR A MASK, I don't think there's any more hope for you. I had to watch this, along with everybody else in the entire world, transform into a sprawling omniscient monster with the failures of the public and the government, and I hope every single goddamn college student who thinks \"oh it's fine:)\" after going to a frat party knows what a miserable little cog they are. It doesn't matter that we're still both in a global pandemic, just keep eating your shitty little lotuses! You know who you are, and I hope you're ashamed. \n\nIf you don't wear a mask in public space, here's my message to you, baked with 100% pure love and affection: you are a selfish asshole, and I hope every risk you present to others is brought on you 10 fold! Have a great day, and I hope your throat falls out of your body!\n\nAnd I have a lovely special message for the people who wear it only over their mouth, as well: You're a fucking idiot! Don't give up - I know you'll learn how to read soon!",

You're talking like you're a man baby right now who doesnt understand freedom of choice and selfishness in humans. \n\nLet me key you into somethings thatll make more sense as you mature.\n\n1. You're not the main character and the world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n2. Literally nothing you do will change anything about everything you complain about and sulk about so you might as well try to find the positive side to life. \n\n3. If you're going to be nihilistic then at least stop pretending like you didnt expect this to happen in some degree. You're trolling and edgy and this is bait for sure",

When the vaccines were first being offered and the online systems were completely flooded, I sat down with my father and got as many people appointments as we could. I scanned textbooks for my classmates so they wouldn't have to go out to get them, and ordered groceries for my friends, and did everything I could to help my professors adapt to online.\n\n\n\nDoes that give you any idea why I'm so angry? I'm so far from perfect, but I've been doing my best to do what's right by others for a year and a half now, and it's rendered null by this kind of deliberate behavior. It doesn't matter what I did, or what I tried to do, all it takes is some maskless jackass with the delta varient staying a bit too long in the same space as me or someone else and that year and a half of concious avoidance is worth nothing, and if I'm not careful, that could mean a death. That could mean several deaths. I just didn't realize it would be that much of a problem for people to *just wear a mask inside.*",

There is a sign on every single door that you have to wear a mask inside. This is written in every syllabus I've read this year. They're not following the rules. \n\n\nTo be clear, I completely agree that it's the schools,' the government's, and *especially* the capitalists' fault that we're even in this situation in the first place, but this is something that affects me personally in all aspects of my life right now, and it's a lot easier to get angry about the lower increments of that problem than the grinding, soul crushing despair that comes along with thinking about the American death machine.",
