  "text": "up until this semester, i\u2019ve maintained a 3.6 GPA (which was hard considering i earned a 2.6 my first semester after being in a major i absolutely had no interest in) and now i\u2019m falling apart. i don\u2019t have the energy to pick myself up and be the student i once was. my anxiety has gotten worse, i\u2019m now throwing up multiple times a week bc of it, seasonal depression has really been hitting hard, complete meltdowns almost daily, and my professors have been cracking down on their students extra hard this semester as if we\u2019re not still processing the current state of our world. i feel so overwhelmed with everything and it\u2019s not like my personal life is making it better. my grandma is currently in stage 6 of her battle with alzheimer\u2019s and being 7hrs away from her, unable to help or see her is also really taking a toll on me. i want to take a semester off, but i can\u2019t afford it if i can\u2019t find someone to take over my lease. i also lost 3 of the best friends i\u2019ve ever had after making the hard decision to cut a one of them out of my life.\n\ncolleges also cares more about a check than a student; our student mental health services are terrible and very understaffed. a friend of mine once tried to go after losing a close relative and they told her that unless she was suicidal or planning to commit suicide, they couldn\u2019t help her. but when a student actually does commit suicide, they act like they care and try to shift the attention away from them. it\u2019s awful, i\u2019m putting myself in tens of thousands of dollars in debt just to be miserable. no wonder so many college students develop substance abuse problems and even though colleges are usually a main factor in these issues, they really could not care less. they charge you up to $40 to file a leave of absence that might not even be approved and then it\u2019s either dropout and start paying off college loans that are virtually wasted, or suck it up and ruin your mental health.\n\ntl;dr: colleges don\u2019t give a single fuck about students or their mental health, all they see us as are objects to get money from. also, college is hard and not very understanding.",

      "text": "It doesn't get much easier from here on out either. You will be met with unreasonable expectations from employers and other people. Get in trouble for stuff you didn't do. Get burned out on a job because you work hard and get nowhere. \n\nLife is rough. Work and school sucks. I'm not telling you to suck it up. But you're going to need to find a balance and a healthy way to help cope with the many tough things in life that are coming. If you can't you will continue to be stressed and depressed. And that is just not good for you in the long run. \n\nFind a healthy hobby. Cut back on school credits. I decided to go back to school at 27 with no previous college experience. College isn't going anywhere. You can take it slow and be happier in the long run.",
