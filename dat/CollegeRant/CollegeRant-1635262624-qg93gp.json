  "text": "I live on an all female hall with about 30 people and community bathrooms. Lately there had been so much drama amongst people. I\u2019m honestly not sure what\u2019s going on. There is one girl who has been consistently living on the hall like it is her personal bedroom and as a result a lot of people have started to dislike her. Apparently she had made a list of residents she wants to try and get kicked out of the hall because of \u201cbullying,\u201d which I\u2019m not even sure is accurate. I just feel exhausted with  all of this, we are in college, not middle school.",
