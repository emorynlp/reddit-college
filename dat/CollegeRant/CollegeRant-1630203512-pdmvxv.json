  "text": "Heading into my second year of college and so far I haven't made friends. This was the same issue in high school (although I talked with a few people and knew many since it was small), but it's been worse in college. Now this year I'm going in-person five days a week instead of one or three days, so that should help. Hoping the college clubs will be more responsive this year. Even with all that I'm worried I'll be friendless and still barely knowing anyone.",

      "text": "I'm not sure if you should worry about it. Of course, people usually don't like loneliness, but it may create a big benefit for you - you can spend ALL the time just to your advantage. It's a great period for self-development and trying new things, alone. And if you've already decided to change this situation, you can try one good method - **study with others**. Be sure - a lot of students have some study gaps, and they'd be happy to study with others to understand unclear moments. If you wonder about how to start, I recommend having a look at [this post](https://ivypanda.com/blog/studying-with-friends/) \\- it includes some well-working tips and effective tools for studying together.\r  \nHope it helps ;)",
