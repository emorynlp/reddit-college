  "text": "She has a B.S in biology. And you know what job she has now? She\u2019s a frigging medical assistant. Bro, if she wanted to become a medical assistant, she could\u2019ve just went to a community college and spend 5 thousand dollars on a certificate. The only difference between her and other medical assistants is that she went into tens of thousands of dollars of debt to become one",
