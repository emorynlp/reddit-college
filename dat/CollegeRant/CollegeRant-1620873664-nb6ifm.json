  "title:": "My biggest regret this semester is not dropping this useless math class",
  "text": "I\u2019m in this math class right now and I don\u2019t even need it anymore bc I changed my major (kinda) but I decided to stick it out and we\u2019ll.... regrets. This is going to sound kind of silly but this is how my mind works since I\u2019m a very anxious person who likes to plan for the worst just so I have a plan in case the worst happens.... I have an 82% right now. I know, not bad. My first midterm I got a 82, which is fine for me since I\u2019ve never been a math person. It was barely proctored so I admit I was able to use notes... second midterm I got a 41...... bc I didn\u2019t understand the material well and was highly proctored. This third midterm is another 15% of my grade and I\u2019m struggling with a big portion of the material. Our final is 20% but he will replace the final grade with the lowest exam grade if we get a better grade on the final. To barely pass the class with a C, I need at least a 20 on this next exam and at least a higher than a 20 on the final so it can replace the grade. Which I know I can do better than a 20 obviously that\u2019s a super low grade but I\u2019m anxious that I will still somehow end up failing. I don\u2019t understand the material very well and it\u2019s making me mad because I don\u2019t need this class and it will likely drop my GPA. And I\u2019m planning on transferring from my CC too next year. I just regret not dropping this class while I was able too.",

      "text": "What math class is it? When I was having trouble with math this semester I went to office hours as needed and went to our writing/math center for free tutoring. If you have options available like that, use them. Math is something that doesn't always clicks the first time, so a 1-on-1 explanation of what you're having trouble with can certainly help.",
