  "title:": "Immaturely Inconsiderate College Students",
  "text": "I transferred from community college to one of the best public universities in the country, and there are still students who act like they and everyone else are in high school.\n\nThe guy plays video games during class and ostensibly is only there to copy down board notes that aren't really clear in lecture videos. He leaves right at the end of class, even if the professor wants to go over by literally a minute or two. Of course all of this is certainly his prerogative and whim, the professor shouldn't go over as some people need to leave for other classes, and it's my fault for letting him freeload during discussion sections. But when he leaves lecture, he has the audacity to talk loudly with his friends as if nobody else gives a fuck about the end of lecture, like in high school.\n\nNext time this happens, I will shush them, and if they don't stop, I will escalate my language and volume as necessary. If they want to act like high school students, there's a high school down the street (or a community college, if they want to pretend like they are \"mature adults\" that attend high school 2.0).",
