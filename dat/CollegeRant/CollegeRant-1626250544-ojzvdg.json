      "text": "I could be misunderstanding this but if each class is 3 credits, then that\u2019s 15 in total and pretty typical. I know my school requires you to take at least 12 credits per semester in order to be considered a \u201cfull time student\u201d. Then again I have no idea what type of program you\u2019re in or how difficult the classes are. Either way, don\u2019t let the number of courses bog you down, take things one at a time and try to focus on time management. It\u2019ll help you become a more responsible person. You\u2019ve got this!",
