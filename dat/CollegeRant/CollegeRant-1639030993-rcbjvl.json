  "text": "I think I have to abandon my physics major but I don\u2019t know what to do\n\nCurrently a sophomore pursuing a BS in physics but will end with a cumulative 2.1 gpa at the end of this sem. I\u2019ve struggled with a lot of mental health issues over the past 1.5 years and also bad study habits.\n\nPhysics has been such a big part of my life and I wanted to pursue a masters in it. But sadly my spark of motivation came too late. I didn\u2019t realize  that there was almost no way I\u2019d manage to be a competitive applicant to grad schools. So now I\u2019m left here feeling more hopeless than ever because I don\u2019t know what I want to do. I feel so reluctant to invest effort into anything else. Would I even be able to transfer into a different major? I just recently disassociated from my group of friends here so transferring to a different school would be easier to handle but could I even get accepted anywhere? \n\nIm going to try and set something up with the transitional advisors but finals are going to be time consuming. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why but I just feel like I\u2019ve failed in life and that there are no opportunities to bounce back. I know that there\u2019s a way somehow but at the same time I\u2019m hopeless. \n\nSorry this turned into a rant. If you guys have any advice or stories to share, please let me know!",

      "text": "Hey, don't give up!! You can still recover that GPA. Maybe not this semester, but it can be salvageable in the semesters that are yet to come. I've read stories of people who were able to get into grad school even with low GPAs so it's not impossible. Be gentle to yourself and take care of your mental health, but don't give up.",
