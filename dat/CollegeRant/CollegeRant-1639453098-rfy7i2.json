  "title:": "Stop blaming the professor when you were just lazy",
  "text": "So I'm a senior and I took a 100 level psychology course as a general elective, which was literally a cakewalk.\n\nThe homeworks allowed for unlimited attempts, could be turned in up until the last week of class, and the professor basically posted the answers after a couple weeks went by. Final exam was open notes and literally just a completion grade; as long as you got a 70% or higher, you got credit. She allowed multiple attempts on that too. And on top of all of this, she was seriously the nicest professor I've had in college.\n\nI went to RateMyProfessors to give her a good rating after the semester ended and it was just filled with complaints. Some person spammed upvotes on bad reviews and downvotes on good reviews to make her look bad. People clearly didn't go to class, and the reviews showed it. I can barely even trust the reviews on RateMyProfessors anymore when half these people are just mad that they were too lazy to do the work.\n\nTL;DR: Seriously, take some accountability for your actions. It's not the professor's fault that you failed one of the easiest courses offered in my college.",

      "text": "A lot of people won't admit it (and, to be fair, they probably don't even know any better), but most students are the farthest thing from \"college prepared\" - some even being borderline illiterate and/or innumerate.\n\nAgain, it's not exactly their fault since a number of confounding factors which were present before the pandemic were exasperated with its arrival. That said, undoing this mess without simply \"passing people through\" (like high school) is going to be an enormous feat for those working in higher education; it's going to require *a lot* of reality checks and confrontation.",

Colleges started trying to change course by implementing the \"First-Year Experience,\" but that turned more into getting students into a social net than teaching them how to learn and get something out of the money they are spending on education.  \n\nStudents basically have to (1) recognize there is a problem with how they go about their work and (2) be willing to do something about it.\n\nIt's easier to just complain and blame the college/professors/etc.  But no matter whom they blame, they still are the ones who lose in the end and get stuck in shitty jobs.\n\nThe ones who attack the problem on their own come out way ahead.  It turns out those skills are actually useful in careers that require ongoing learning.",

I almost wonder if in the next few years universities are going to need some kind of intensive \u201cboot camp\u201d to figure out which students are prepared enough to deal with even the most entry-level of courses and basic of self-management requirements (ie, using a calendar to make sure they do stuff on time). The problem is, what about the ones who aren\u2019t prepared for even that level? That doesn\u2019t even consider the inequities across high school education along a variety of dimensions.\n\nUgh, now I have a headache.",
