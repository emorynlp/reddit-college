  "text": "My day started at 3:30 am when I was woken up to take shelter in the basement because of a tornado. By the time we were given the all clear, I had 20 minutes to get my shit together and then had to walk across campus in the storm to make the shuttle to the airport. Now my flight is delayed by 2 hours and I\u2019m going to miss my connection.",
