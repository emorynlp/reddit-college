  "text": "Hello this is my first time on this subreddit. I just wanted to vent what seems to be a problem so unique to me. You see I have to take some specific classes from specific parts of my major, which is fine and dandy normal I would not complain, but and it's a big old but. My school does not open lessons for those classes, and since I can't attend classes that are not there I can't graduate, but I can't graduate because college refuses to open those classes. I am in this school for four years and I can't graduate because despite there being \"108\" different topics to cover from those lessons, they never open it. I am about to go crazy, which is only more aggravated by the fact that nobody else seems to have had this problem before, which makes me feel extremely lonely\n\nTl;DR College does not open up lessons I need to pass.",

Long story short I have begun the process of taking classes from another College and my advisor is not getting any punishment but is being pushed to be more helpfull in the future, so I guess all is well when it ends well.  \nStill thought it is good that others have encountered this as well and I don't feel so lonely.",

This can happen if you \"take to long\" to complete your degree. Been there, done that.",

I'm and Physics undergrad and in my university the department is relatively new. We only have 4 professors including the director and maybe a couple adjuncts. So to kind of bend the rules a bit we were offered the opportunity to take classes in applied math to satisfy some electives or to take the equivalent class at another university. Maybe you can ask to take equivalent class at your school that satisfies your degree or take them at another university?",
