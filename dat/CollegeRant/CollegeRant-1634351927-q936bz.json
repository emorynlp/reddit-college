  "title:": "First Generation Woes: Feeling extremely burnt out, unsupported, and inadequate (long-ish, tldr at end)",
  "text": "Third year first generation STEM student. Remote learning has been a disaster for me.\n\nMy home situation is a small apartment with my family. I don't have a proper workplace. All I have here is an uncomfortably cushiony black leather couch. I have to twist myself in awkward positions if I want to use my laptop and a notebook, which I often have to do for lecture notes or studying. The couch will often get uncomfortably warm, making me have to change positions often.\n\nMy home being so small and in my neighborhood it is often very noisy. My siblings making a lot of noise, loud music, the TV is loud, guests came over unannounced, random BS going on outside, among other things all happen often. I don't have anywhere to escape to. Having professors that push for us to interact over Zoom is a nightmare. I cant unmute or turn on my camera. During my first online semester, people pointed out how they could hear the spanish channel news playing or my family talking in the background when I unmuted. In classes where I absolutely have to unmute I run to the bathroom or outside in the moments I do.\n\nMy family has been giving me a hard time, especially as of late. My parents come from a place where most people don't even finish middle school so I deal with them not getting US college in general and the Pandora's box of what that entails. They keep urging me to get a job, despite my older brother's advice (he is also a student) and me being a full time student. They often bring up what some so-and-so is doing to shame me. I get constant shit for \"being on that computer\" all day. Then they interrogate \"You ARE going to graduate on time, RIGHT?\" Don't they get that I'm doing this for them?\n\nHaving taken up the role of the \"unemployed student son\" is weighing down on me. I have the most chores and have to be ready to do random tasks or errands at any given time. The most random, time consuming tasks have come up out of the blue. I've even gotten in trouble for not completing some chores all the way, but I couldn't do them because I was busy with school!!\n\nThis semester is has been by far the worst for me. We aren't even halfway and I'm already feeling the same burnout most of us do during the final quarter of a semester. I am either too busy to hang out with friends or they are all far away in their homes or campuses. I'm under a lot of pressure for reasons relating to me being a first gen student. The worst part is I didn't even want to take courses this semester. I wanted to take this semester off to get a job, help around the house, just things I need to get in order. Most importantly I didn't want to keep decimating my GPA doing school from home. I brought up doing this and was shot down, that I would get shit for postponing my graduation.\n\nI will sometimes look at photos of the dorm I lived in during my only \"year\" of actual university with sadness. I look at other students doing remote learning in better situations then me with major jealousy, envy even. God I cant wait to be in person again.\n\nTL;DR: Doing all online school while a poor first gen student sucks. My home situation is horrible, don't have anywhere to actually work comfortably, get shit on for small things, lots of things to disrupt me working, and I cant even participate in Zoom all the way. I didn't even want to take classes this semester but have to bc of what's expected of me. I'm extremely burnt out and alone.",

What are the people who are supporting you dealing with? I know narcissism is the common trend but maybe think about the people around you keeping you at school.",

          "text": "You went into a board about rants to tell people to stop complaining? Weirdo activity. Its not the school that's hard it's the many factors I have to deal with at home that make it harder than it should be. I damn sure am complaining about my home situation, and I dont make it anyone elses problem. I sure would like to do trade school but then I'd catch shit for that from my family too. I've been working a \"low skill\" trade since middle school so dont come at me with no \"lazy\" accusations either goofy",

              "text": "Ironically that's what Reddit recommended so I guess you should blame the algorithm. I mean it seems like you're blaming everything anyways so sounds kind of like par for the course.\n\nI actually didn't say anything related to lazy. I didn't even imply that so maybe you have some sneaking voice in the back of your head.\n\nI actually suggested you have some empathy for the people around you your support system. They are supporting you as you said like it or not. \n\nIt sounds like to me if it's so awful at home maybe stop worrying about the family opinion and do something that will get you out of your current situation. College isn't always the answer for everyone.\n\nI feel people who are truly hungry to succeed don't make excuses like my chair is uncomfortable they find solutions. Maybe go to a thrift store and find a second hand chair. Craft a pillow out of shirts and duct tape. Do what you need to succeed.",

                  "text": "\"I didnt call you lazy\" then \"people who are truly hungry for success dont make excuses\" lol. It's always the next move for you 'just do trades' headasses. \n\nI do have empathy. The main reason I'm going to college is to get us out of here and to help support them before they retire. Problems can exist in the same place as good things. \n\nThat's why I wanted to take this semester off. But they are concerned with what others will say and that it will extend my graduation date (by like 1 semester and I will be doing a few years of postgrad anyway). \n\nI physically can't improve my situation. There is no moving out for people my age and class in this state. The best I have going is to get a Wifi hotspot and go to some detached garage but I will still have to deal with all the things that take me out of my studies currently.",
