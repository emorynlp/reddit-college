  "text": "Coming to the university not knowing anyone there at the start was frustrating. Note that I don't study in the US, but meeting peope here isn't easy for me. I feel I need to force myself into everything. Nobody in my classes asks me if I want to go eat with them or go on a beer after lectures, for example. People aren't open to me. If I want to socialize, I need to force myself into friend groups that don't care about me. Maybe I'm the problem but uni sucks.",
