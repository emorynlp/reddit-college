I\u2019m literally crying as I am doing this stupid simple assignment that should be easy but my mental health is at the bottom that I cannot do anything. Least I\u2019m gonna see the school therapist tomorrow so hopefully that does something for me. Next semester most of my courses will still be remote. It\u2019s never ending.",

I ended up taking time off school/going part time a lot and even though I'm graduating on the later side I'm in a much healthier place than I was back then when I was trying to do school full time and I also got the chance to finish up some of the passion stuff I wanted to do (performing) I while I still could. It really helped me gain the motivation to go back and be super committed.",

My nursing related classes and my first clinical start next semester, so maybe once I start actually learning something I\u2019m interested in I\u2019ll do better. Also, the campus is going to be open, so maybe just being there for the first time will help. Right now I\u2019m trying to focus on the positives, but yes summer will be my break of no school, thank you for the advice :)",
