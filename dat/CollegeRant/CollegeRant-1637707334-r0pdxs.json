  "text": "Hey there. We are a young startup, and we noticed a problem in the process of teaching students. It seems challenging to store and organize data, notes, etc., in one place.\n\nWe are making a product in which students can store all their study materials. And quickly dumb your thoughts turning them into beautiful documents. \n\nIf you are experiencing the same problem, please leave some comments.\n\nWe don't sell or advertise anything but want to figure out how to make a valuable product for education.",
