  "text": "Sophmore here, but last year was virtual, so in the same boat as a freshman. I just feel so depressed living in the dorms. I feel that no one genuinely wants to be w me. Ive tried meeting new people in classes and clubs, but no one seems interested in me. It seems that everyone has friends and is doing all these amazing things, like eating out, exploring the nearby area, partying, ect. Ive been trying to make new friends but nothing is working. I feel so depressed that I just want the pain to stop in any way possible. I was a loner in hs, and I rather be dead than feel the same way again\n\nTl;Dr: No one wants to be w me and i feel super depressed all the time",

      "text": "Trust me, it may seem like you\u2019re missing out, but a lot of folks are feeling the same heat right now. First and foremost to shrug off the depression, make sure you\u2019ve got a healthy diet, sleep and get outside regularly. Way too easy to forget these things when you\u2019re living on your own for maybe the first time.\n\nSecond, remember that a lot of people in college are eagerly trying to form new connections, especially right now after such a long hiatus from in-person stuff. Offer to form study groups; ask about hobbies; get some cookie mix and bake cookies for your dorm floor; just do whatever you can think of to create excuses to meet new people. You might just need a bit more time to find the right crowd at your college. That might be through your major program, or through a hobby, or just random chance, but you\u2019ve got plenty of time left so don\u2019t give up hope yet.",
