  "text": "I'm so fucking done with my family. I'm so fucking done.\n\nMy dad is verbally abusive and inconsiderate and doesn't care if he's yelling or distracting me, yet still wants me to get good grades. He has a sick and twisted view of what a family should be like, stuff like how I owe him for all he's given to me (like raised me), and throws a tantrum over every little thing. He calls my mom and I ungrateful, lazy, selfish, spoiled, and thinks he's the most selfless and generous person in the world. I've dealt with this for my whole life but every year of college gets tougher. He's a hypocritical, inconsiderate, self-righteous piece of shit and I'm just waiting for the day he'll be permanently gone from my life.\n\n\nMy mom has to deal with this shit every day. If she ever makes a mistake or doesn't read his mind of what he wants, he'll get mad, and then another tantrum well ensue. She's at her tipping point right now and she's just complaining about him to me everyday, which I don't mind but I have stuff I need to do. I've never learned to be emotional responsive and available, given my family situation for the last 19 years of my life, so I don't know what the fuck to do. They can't divorce, they're financial codependent, so until something regarding that is taken care of I'm stuck with this.\n\n\nI've tried to calmly talk to my dad about this, of course he basically disregards everything I'm saying (asking him to be more calm, quiet, and understanding) and said how I'm unappreciative and selfish and lazy again. Then he started yelling and I left back to my room where he was mad for the rest of the day and let me know of it.\n\n\nI'm taking 18 credits, I'm part of a research program, two clubs, and I have to put up with all of this every single day for the next semester, if not the rest of the year. I just wanted to go to college, the physical place, escape my household environment, and have fun with friends, but instead I'm stuck here, studying amid this mess.\n\n\nI just want to finish college, get out of this house, get a job, a find a therapist.\n\n\n(In case it comes across this way, I'm not suicidal and I won't think of self harm.)",

      "text": "God I felt this. My stepdad is the same way, and has threatened to throw me out numerous times for being \u201clazy\u201d (projection at its finest). He\u2019s the most narcissistic piece of shit I\u2019ve ever dealt with, and my mom willingly stays with him. He insults me to my face, and she lets it happen. I almost failed my senior year of HS because of it, and came close to giving up at one point. He expected me at one point to \u201cplan my classes around what [he] wanted\u201d \u2014 as if my profs will do that. And the chances of me going back are slim; my uni will just go fully online and will kick whoever moved in early out, and probs won\u2019t allow everyone else to move in. I\u2019m fucking over this virus and the selfish twats who won\u2019t wear a mask or social distance.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to go throw the same thing man. If you\u2019re able to anytime soon, get out ASAP. Hell, DM me if you need to vent. I hope you\u2019re able to get to a better place soon, if only for a short time. That mental break might be what you need.",

So, were you on campus before or not? Anyhow, I am sorry for the situation you are dealing with and I hope you can make it out soon.",
