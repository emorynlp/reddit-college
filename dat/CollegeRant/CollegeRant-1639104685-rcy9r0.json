  "text": "So like I always do, I waited until almost last minute to get my semester projects done. Submitted my web development and programming projects and got full points. Almost done with my database project and theeeeennn I looked at my small business project and I have to write a 20 page business plan. Just kill me now. I started it last night and made a bit of progress but it\u2019s rooouuggh. I picked a half ass business idea in the beginning of the semester since I don\u2019t actually plan to start a business and I dread writing about it every time. This class has been the worst and I can\u2019t wait for it just to be over. I\u2019d deal with programming headaches all day if it meant never writing another thing about this small business. \ud83d\ude29",

          "text": "Agreed. This has easily been the worst class I\u2019ve ever taken, but the teacher is half the problem. He just assigns a shit ton of work and calls it a day. Literally just posts as many exercises out of the book as he can. There\u2019s no lectures, no actual class, and then on his tests he\u2019ll have questions such as \u201cAs discussed in class\u2026\u201d and multiple questions with similar answers or possible answers to trick you. Im just staring at it like\u2026wut? Lol. Oh well, it\u2019s almost at the end.",
