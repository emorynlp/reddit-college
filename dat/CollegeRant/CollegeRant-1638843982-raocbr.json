  "text": "I live in Massachusetts and I can't afford to attend one those prestigious private schools (Tufts University, Boston College, Brandeis, etc). I don't have 50k/yr to blow. I attended my local state school for my undergrad and I will attend a state school for my graduate studies as well. If I get my MBA from my local state school, how will this impact my career prospects?",

      "text": "Not particularly. I mean, it helps if that's a minimum qualification somewhere, but MBAs without the strong reputations and networking opportunities that major universities have tend to lack the kind of boost folks are hoping for.\n\nHave you been working full time for a while? That can help a bit (and will make an MBA program more worthwhile, regardless of where you complete it).",

      "text": "Going to have to disagree with the PhDapper dude.\n\nNetworking is networking. You don\u2019t have to be top tier to understand how to network. Majority of the time, your degree is there to get your through a filter. Now, that being said, the trick here is to sell yourself. And to master the ability to formulate and communicate in an effective manner that both makes you seem great as hell and makes you a preferred candidate.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford or justify spending that much money then, don\u2019t. If you can\u2019t get your company to pay for it, don\u2019t. Go to the best school if it\u2019s not coming out of your wallet. Otherwise, make amends with a \u201clesser\u201d school and learn how to network like everyone else. \n\nFYI, no school out there is \u201clesser\u201d. Education is a privilege and I\u2019m sure that those \u201clesser\u201d people that everyone seems to look down upon would absolute jump at the opportunity for any education at all.\n\nJust my 2c.",
