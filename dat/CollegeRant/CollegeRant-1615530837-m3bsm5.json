      "text": "I don't know almost every teacher I know would give you an f for that, or read the first 3 pages and grade the entire paper off of those regardless of what was in the last 3.\n\nThe paper sizes are there for a reason, not only is it supposed to get you to be able to get the correct amount of stuff they want in the specified space (which is rather important to know how to do) but 8t also prevents the teacher from having to go through like 50 crappy but long papers. Learning to get your point across in less pages can require for you to go and make the writing better rather than just endless monotoning. Try to look at your paper and ask if what your thesis is then look if each part of your paper supports your thesis and explains how it supports your thesis. And anything that doesn't directly support your thesis cut, doesn't matter if you think it's relevant if you can't or don't explain how it is relevant to your thesis then it doesn't belong (hardest thing I've had to learn about my own writing but doing that does make your paper so much better)",
