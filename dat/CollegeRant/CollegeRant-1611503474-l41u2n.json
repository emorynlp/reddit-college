  "text": "I know y'all countries favor local students obviously and it's to \"protect\" the students or because we never paid your tax but why does it have to be THAT expensive? I'm finishing high school this year and unless some miracle happen, I won't be able to find 200 times my parents' salary just for tuition for 3 years. And this does not even include accommodation. My country's education system is focused on fields I do not study and the most affordable colleges abroad are still freaking expensive. And let's not talk about the scholarships. Thank you i appreciate a 4k discount on my 25k tuitions, it really helps. Also, why is your scholarship available to international students if it \"favors domestic students\"? I can't focus on studying for my finals because I keep on thinking about how I'll have to change field and be stuck in a dead-end job (if I ever get one) in my home country because I'm not well-off enough. Did the price really have to be THIS exorbitant? :/\n\nTL:DR International students have it tough",

              "text": "I haven't looked into it, but you might be able to join a community college in another country. There's no way that their international fees are as great as big universities. There's also online college, which might cut down on the price but depending on your home situation it can be difficult. I did my first year of college from my parents' house and saved a lot of money, but it was also really noisy in the house and made it hard to study. It's an option if your parents let you though",

Unfortunately I won't be able to do my full degree in online school, because practical classes and stuff and even if i do have a year online, I won't be able to gather enough money. Right now I'm depending on winning a scholarship. Or else I will be able to study in France though my college fund will only be enough for a year of tuition. There, I'll have to make things work, find a job, or get a loan :')",

Which, I don't necessarily recommend, because I'll be paying these bills for the rest of my life. I picked up a side job but be careful it doesn't ruin your studies. I know it seems backwards, but as best you can, think of your education like an investment into a better job. If you don't get the scholarship for France though, you can always work an entry-level job for a year to save up some money :)",
