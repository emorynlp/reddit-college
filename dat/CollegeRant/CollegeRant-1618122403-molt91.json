  "text": "I have been forced to use these MindTap trash labs for a couple classes now, and I have to say, it has been one of the most frustrating things I have had to deal with as far as college goes.\n\nMy most recent class to use this trash software is in a digital forensics class. Luckily, not all of the labs use Shitgage, but the ones that i have ben forced to drudge through have been terrible.\n\nFirst off, every lab I have taken consist of several spelling errors. I'm no grammar Nazi (God knows I make a fair share of them), but the errors in some cases are so bad it's hard to make out what it's trying to tell you to do. The virtual machines we log in to will have files or drives missing that are integral to finishing the labs. In terms of explanations the type of language they use feels almost purposely misleading, it's sometimes impossible to discern what the damn thing is telling you to do. The instructions are either a jumbled mess or to obtuse too understand.\n\nThe worst part of it all is I feel like I'm learning nothing from them. In many cases a 5 minute Google search on a topic teaches me more than a 2 hour long \"lab\" this company provides. I always have a headache at the end of it because all of my mental energy is spent on trying to decipher the instructions of the lab. It makes me wonder how any serious learning institution would choose this over the litany of other options available?",

      "text": "Yeah, dude I just spent 4 hours trying to complete a couple labs\u2026. I could only finish 1 of the 3 because the other two kept crashing. \n\nNot to mention how slow and unresponsive the program is when it doesn\u2019t crash.\n\nI lost my fucking mind today. I had to physically leave the house to get away from my laptop.",

They can't keep getting away with collecting a paycheck and charging us tuition, when I could have just bought the access code myself, without enrolling in university.",

Pass the Pdf files for free in the class forum???  fucking teach the class without asking us for already extra 100$ on top of what I'm already paying????\n\nIt's abso-fucking-lutely ludicrous we gotta pay those prizes for what it could take any sensible teacher to come up with his own exercises and give pdf files to the class all for free. There are zero reasons whatsoever for a teacher to not provide class material that they already hold mastery over.\n\nEnd Rant.",
