  "text": "If I need financial help, I don\u2019t need more debt. I need more options for earning money to help me NOW so that I can pay less later.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted my financial aid office and another organization that I\u2019m in a few times about my college financial concerns and now I get loan emails every single day. No. I don\u2019t want more loans, that\u2019s the whole point of why I reached out. My goal is to need less loans and find more scholarship or grant opportunities.\n\nAs a side note, why are there literally no opportunities for current college students? I can only find them for high schoolers or first years..",

What\u2019s annoying is that my school offers scholarships specific to my major.. but they are only offered only for those who enrolled in 2020 and beyond. I enrolled in 2019, which means I basically get shit. I\u2019ve talked to my financial aid multiple times about how much money I would be getting if I were treated like a 2020 first year and showing the unfairness to current students but they\u2019ve always refused to budge, saying they don\u2019t have the funding for the current students from 2019 and earlier.",

          "text": "I try to search for scholarships and grants and cannot find any additional ones that I qualify for. Keep in mind that I already get financial grants such as the Pell Grant and I also have academic scholarships for a little less than half off my tuition. I will likely owe around 30-40k in student loans once they are fully paid off. Additionally I also pay $4k-$6k out of MY pocket each year (not my parents money).  I got another job to earn more so I could afford this out of pocket cost easier and now I\u2019m losing my Pell Grant because I \u2018make too much\u2019 which will now have me owing $8k-$10k out of pocket, which I cannot afford regardless of what the government believes (don\u2019t forget that I am already taking out loans). I have been searching for scholarships or different grants to make up for this loss and I feel stuck. I do not want more loans. \n\nAlso, my college favors incoming students and if I had started college 1 year later then my tuition would have been fully covered under their new academic scholarships. Knowing this doesn\u2019t make me feel better and the fact that my college\u2019s only suggestion for financial aid is to take out more loans is disgraceful and disgusting.\n\nThe fact that people like YOU exist and believe current students aren\u2019t trying their best to find these other ways to pay off college besides begging for loan cancellations is sad and honestly very ignorant. I\u2019d never expect my loans to be canceled, but I hate that colleges expect my only option to be loans.",

Not to mention that a full ride scholarship is pretty hard to get, you could get a few 1k scholarships but thats a drop in the bucket. \n\nGrants are based on your parents income. My mom has an awesome retirement account, so I dont quality. But.. thats money for *her* future. She helps me a lot dont get me wrong, but not paying for all of my tuition type of help. \n\nIts unethical to have a system where minimum wage work doesnt support a person in a 1 bedroom in any state, and if a person wants to get an education to increase their potential, they may be in a situation where the only payment option is predatory private loans. \n\nNo ones holding a gun to their head to take the loans, right, but you have to admit that for some people that is their only option for getting an education and thats shitty.",
