Failing is part of the learning process. Just study and do good on assignments and you are fine.\n\nIn times like this, I try not to stress the grade too much, but this is also when I say college is a scam and your grade does not matter on assignments or quizzes but 2 exams. SCAM!!",

Remember, they\u2019re (theoretically) there to make sure you understand the information. People not doing well in their class doesn\u2019t look good for them either. Ask to go over the material you don\u2019t understand and strategize as to what you can do to make up for it in the last half of the semester.",

Is this the way grades work outside of hungary? \n\nIf we fail any test we get one opportunity to correct it, and if we fail that, we fail the class and have to retake it.\n\nTo answer your question though, we all fail at some things some times. You will never 100% understand anyithing, it's just a part of life. You can get sad about it, have a beer with your mates and move on. Or you can get angry, and relearn the thing because that bitch of a subject is not going to make a fool of you. Kick it's ass.",

          "text": "No youre not misunderstanding. In the US you take a lot of tests in college. For example I am taking 3 courses this semester (august-december) and each one of them has 3-4 unit tests plus a final each. Unit tests are typically worth about 15% of your final grade, final exams are worth 20-25% of your final grade. So if you fail a unit test even with a 0 you could still get at most an 85%, a B, overall in the class.",

              "text": "I guess this has to be a difference in how uni finances work. In america ,as far as i know, uni is for profit; so they want you there for as long as possible, to get as much money as possible. \n\nIn hungary uni is free, funded by the government. So it is in their interest to have us there for as little time as possible, and put as much knowledge in us as possible (so we bring the greatest return for as small an investment as possible).\n\nFor reference, i have 10 courses this semester, my roughest so far was my last semester with 14 courses. I'm taking 43 credits (equivalent to a 43 hour work week plus all home assignments). Each course has 2 tests and/or assignments, and one exam. Failing any one means you have to repeat the course (you do get one opportunity to repeat one failed test / course). A BSc is 6 semesters with a minimum of 180 credits, and an MSc is 4 semesters with a minimum of 120 credits. Aditionally, if you plan on going into academia, you best be in a research group by the time you are doing your masters. So i'm doing research too, for no credits or money or anything other thatn being allowed to use a lab. This is done as part of a system called TDK, which is esentually a student research competition.\n\nI have one last question. Is it true that in the west you can do a PhD after your BSc, withot an MSc?",

We also had a for-profit college phase, but most of them went out of business because they were trash and, ultimately, a scam. Our college\u2019s are not in the habit of turning a profit, in the sense that you\u2019re referring to.\n\nWe take several tests. Tests, quizzes, homework, labs, etc; they all account for a certain % of your grade. However, midterm and final exams do account for an incredibly large share of your overall grade. I had some classes where my midterm and final accounted for 65% of my grade.",
