  "text": "Took a class this semester, was really interesting but the prof assigned a ton of work. I'm talking daily labs, weekly papers plus a big group project every couple weeks. So many people couldn't get their work in on time that the prof just went \"f it\" and gave up on deadlines completely. That's really lenient ofc, but it sucks having to keep working days after every other class is over just on cranking out late assignments. I just wanna be *dooooone* man.",
