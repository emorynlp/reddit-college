  "text": "I\u2019m taking an ethnic studies class, it\u2019s for my college writing intensive graduation requirement so I have to pass it. This Professor is a hot mess. She told me parenthetical citations don\u2019t count (wtf does that even mean?). She assigns essays every week basically and if you turn something in 1 minute past the due time you get an automatic zero. She wants things pasted into a box online. I tried to email a essay once, she bit my head off and refused to take it (it wasn\u2019t due yet but I wasn\u2019t able to submit the text box due to technical issues). However it takes her approximately 6 weeks to grade a damn paper. She emails in all capital letters. Her online picture is a picture of her laying sideways. It\u2019s the weirdest learning experience I\u2019ve ever had and honestly I am having a hard time faking it in this class. I even have special accommodations for a disability which she has been notified of by the school and refuses to acknowledge. \ud83e\udd2c",

Every research document/document that uses evidence/ideas/etc. from a different source(s) needs parenthetical citations AND a bibliography of final, complete citations.  If you are only doing parenthetical citations, then she is correct.",
