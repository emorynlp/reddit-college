  "text": "Let me start by saying, I can see how there were red flags, I KNOW. But I\u2019ve have a positive rapport in the past with the person, they always appeared to be of utmost ethical behavior. \n\nI\u2019ll try to shorten this -\n\nI qualified for and applied to be in an Honor Society program at my school. I\u2019m a Dean\u2019s List student & very involved. \n\nSaid Professor said she would let me know the next steps. I don\u2019t hear anything further, I check in with her by e-mail, no answer. I send her a text (extremely common form of communication with this person by many students), she replies with various small things of no substance. \n\nI assumed she was super busy and I that I just had to continue contacting her first. \n\nThis went on for three months, I checked in once a month. Last month she said that I need to pay dues & that she would collect dues from all of us and pay them as a whole. I checked in today (I had paid said dues to her) and she said that I was virtually inducted and would send the link to me tomorrow. \n\nI found the induction myself online and low and behold, I\u2019m not in it. \n\nWhat\u2019s the next move?",

If they're the only person in charge, go to an advisor or a student success coordinator and they may be able to help you. Keep all your emails and texts as proof. \n\nIf it makes it any better its probably a big accident. Though I'm not excusing the behavior.",

          "text": "Yes, she is the only one. \n\nI guess I should\u2019ve added that I paid the money today (I just received instructions today on how to get the money to her.) She told me it was fine and that I was already inducted virtually, that she could send my certificate after I paid. But the virtual induction took place on December 1st. \n\nSo, why accept the money after the fact? \n\nI sent it so quickly just out of my excitement to finally be told what I needed to do without fact checking things for myself :/",

          "text": "The virtual ceremony required input from the attendees, requiring them to say that they accept this and this pledge and the recorder recorded that in the minutes. \n\nSoooo if she truly thought that I was in the ceremony, shouldn\u2019t she be asking me how I didn\u2019t know about it or missed it, since it required input anyway? Idk maybe I\u2019m thinking too much into it. \n\nIt\u2019s just been so long dealing with this.",
