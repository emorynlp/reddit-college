  "text": "One or more of my neighbors smokes pot at least twice a day. It wasn't a problem until the weather started to get warmer. My apartment is now unbearably hot without the window open but with it open, the smell of weed comes in and there is only one window. I have a dog and don't want either of us to breathe it in or anything that masks it. I don't know which neighbor it is and even if I did my complex wouldn't do anything about it. I have tried putting a fan in the window blowing outward and yelling out the window as politely as one can yell to please stop neither has been successful. Does anyone have any ideas to prevent the smell from coming in or anything I can buy??? I'm a college student so my budget is pretty low.",

      "text": "I think there are a couple spray type things that get rid of the smell, though usually you (and pupper) may need to leave the apartment for a bit (typically says on the can) to let it do its thing and beat up the weed smell in private lol; I haven't any myself but there's plenty of options in terms of different sprays. \n\nHonestly if it's more than one person doing it though, it might be tough just due to timing and all. To prevent it though, sadly I think the main thing you can do is just close the window and buy a couple fans to blast in order to keep cool. The easier solution honestly would be on their end since there's a lot of ways to cut down on how much smoke there is, but that might be wishful thinking lol. Idk if you actually went to whoever manages the complex, but it's worth a shot. \n\nA last ditch idea I just had may be kind of ridiculous, and I'm not sure if it'll really work, but if you could get dryer sheets and basically make a screen of em (idk if you have window screens where you are, in Hawaii they're common) and place it as a make shift filter. I just remembered this as they're used in DIY spoofs for smokers to use so that the smoke won't be as noticeable. Although, since legalization in certain states and everything, I imagine there could be a type of item made that does what you're looking to do but I can't make any promises. I hope you do find some kind of thing that works out for you however!",
