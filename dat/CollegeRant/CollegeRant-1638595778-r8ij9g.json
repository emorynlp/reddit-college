If I had been a better student this wouldn\u2019t have affected me as bad. I feel like I\u2019m too stupid for college and I hate myself for letting things get so bad and hate my anxiety and depression I wish I could just be a normal person \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude3b",

We all do meaningless roles to achieve a meaningless job to do meaningless work and then, we all die. Society, money, etc are all social constructs. If you think about it, we are a speck on a floating ball in space. One astroid or life ending event and everyone dies. Rich, poor, any, fly, beetle, etc. Nome of this shit makes any sense. \n\nSo, point is, you\u2019ll get through this. I wish you the best of luck. And make the best out of your life. Pedialite >",
