  "text": "For context I draw in class. This is something I do in every class though, and I was told by our student coordinator that it\u2019s actually a form of learning\u2026\n\nBut the way I see it my mind is constantly abuzz, sketching makes me stay grounded and in the moment, if I\u2019m forced to sit still I start daydreaming.\n\nBecause if this, my professor always calls on me. Legit for every class I get called-on at least once. I have social anxiety too and although he doesn\u2019t know the extents to my anxiety he was the one that sent me to counseling services for some mental help. So he knows I\u2019m anxious.\n\nI\u2019ve answered all his questions to the best of my abilities but I don\u2019t get them 100% right. I just get too nervous with my name being said in front of the entire class. My answers haven\u2019t been wrong either, I just don\u2019t answer it to the amount of detail he likes.\n\nI do openly ask questions in class, and any material I don\u2019t know I write down. In other words, I think I\u2019m involved enough to not be given shit.\n\nWell the other day I was with my group mates (you make a group in this particular class), and I was wondering aloud why the professor always calls on me.\n\nOne of my group members claimed that I was probably being called on for sketching and \u201cnot paying attention\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve explained the reason behind my sketching to my professor so\u2026 I don\u2019t understand. Yes I\u2019m paying attention. I\u2019ve proven it many times, I just have the unfortunate combination of personality traits that make me seem like I\u2019m not.\n\nMaybe I do have a mental health problem that is yet to be diagnosed, like adhd.\n\nOr maybe this professor needs to stop busting my fucking balls.\n\nUgh. Rant over.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve read all the comments, and I appreciate honest feedback. I understand how it does seem like I\u2019m not paying attention. This could really be resolved by eye contact, which I admit I do hate making, but it\u2019s better then not learning any social skills. Just know that I\u2019m dramatic and an over thinker and blah blah blah\n\nI consider this post a moment of weakness, which we all have as humans.",

      "text": "Think of it from your professor's perspective: you look like you're not paying attention. If someone is sketching something while I'm talking to them, I'm thinking that they're not listening. Not to say you AREN'T paying attention, but it sure as hell looks like it. I'm not surprised they call you out. Professors get really insecure about people not paying attention to them",

      "text": "sounds like you\u2019re overthinking this, to be honest! you seem to have a good relationship with your professor- they\u2019ve at least expressed enough interest to suggest counseling and clearly find what you say meaningful if they call on you so consistently. with all due respect, some other random student in the class has no more insight into why you\u2019re called on frequently than you do. but i would bet it\u2019s because your professor values your input and effort in answering questions, even when you don\u2019t get it 100% correct all the time (and no one does!). being called upon doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re \u201cgiving you shit\u201d",

It sucks, I know, but it's an important skill and you can stare at their nose instead of their eyes to make it a bit easier. Also, have you tried a silent fidget to get the energy out?",
