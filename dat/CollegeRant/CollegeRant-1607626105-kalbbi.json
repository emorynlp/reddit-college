  "text": "It's the last day of the fall semester and I just balled my eyes out after receiving a 50% on a huge assignment I worked my butt off for and all I could hope for now is to pass the final and possibly end with a C-. Would you believe I had an A just a week ago?? I'm exhausted to the max and I'm burnt tf out. I'm almost done with college and school forever and I'm just so done.\n\nAlso, public 4-year universities in America are a scam. Just go to CC, you'll literally get the same education for less tuition, and the professors there might actually care more about you and not your money.",

          "text": "Yes, and no. You make a lot  of valid points, but the negatives of college are not stressed enough. There is a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  of marketing out there that misleads and misdirects students. However, a lot of the urge against cc's comes from parents too- in my case mine were not particularly happy that I went to a cc  first instead of a four year university. It is just a generational thing I assume as college, was much much cheaper 30-40 years ago. Anyway, back to the negative points of college: inconsistent teaching standards, the high costs, depending on the school- lack of accommodation. None of this is really told to students in high school, and if it is it gets quickly drowned out by the college was so great rhetoric. Thus failing to emphasize that college is a glorified degree factory designed to churn out good little worker bees for the system, and not people that use proper critical thinking skills. Add all of that on top of how the U.S does college and you have a disaster in the making.",

          "text": "Ya when I decided to go to CC I asked a lot of adults about it and every single one said they wish that had done that instead of doing 4 years because of their current debt. Yet all my friends and people my age debated by saying how the expe would pay for itself or that they don't want to go to a comm college for the sheer fact that it's community college. They were constantly super stressed whereas almost every single one of my 100 classes were easy and I didn't end up financially screwed when I decided to change my major and take a year off. Was just able to pick up and start a different major. No debt. Now those friends have graduated and when I mention college/debt they talk about how they probably should've just done community and that the dorm experience wasn't really worth it",

I just took all the gen eds I needed, that is the majority of the first two years of any bachelor's program any way, and transfered without an associate's degree. Focusing on the associates is essentially pointless if your going to transfer anyway",
