  "text": "I\u2019m a Computer Engineering major and I\u2019m usually alright when it comes to math. It\u2019s just that my calc 1 class is an 8am class on every day except Wednesday\u2019s and sometimes I don\u2019t understand the professor, because of his Asian accent and I just get lost in his class.\n\nI got a 46/100 on exam 1 and a 24/100 on the midterm which is exam 2 and I\u2019m worried about the fact that I\u2019m gonna have to take calc 1 again next semester, and how my parents would think about this F I have in the class.\n\nMy backup plan was to just take a virtual calc 1 class in the spring semester and make up calc 2 in the summer so that I can catch up and not be behind a semester in math. \n\nI also thought about just dropping this class and switching to another professor, and making up any missed assignments that I didn\u2019t catch because I wasn\u2019t in the new class, but the semester is already half way done, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\n\nI can\u2019t drop the class and not replace it with something else because in my school, calc 1 is worth 4 credit hours and I\u2019m taking 14 credits this semester, so i would not be a full time student anymore because the minimum credits you need to be a full time student are 12.\n\nI\u2019ve never really had any Fs or Ds in middle school and high school and usually had a very high GPA so this would be my first class that I got an F on and I\u2019m concerned.\n\nMy mom told me that it\u2019s ok to fail in life as long as you try your hardest and that no one on this planet has succeeded in life without failure.\n\nI\u2019m just worried about my class and wanted to vent to Reddit about what\u2019s going on. Any suggestions??",
