  "text": "Well, except one. I'm sensationalizing the title. Anyway, this semester two of my three finals are taking place this week during class time, not in finals week which is next week. This means I also have projects due for those classes during this week in addition to the finals. \n\nThis is the first time I have seen my university do this.
