  "text": "I am not having a good time. I'm a sophomore and have already considered transferring every single semester. First semester was totally online and at home for me and I thought about transferring but figured I needed to give it a better shot, since that's not what college is supposed to be like. Second semester was online but I lived on campus. I emailed another school about transferring, but never took any further steps because I figured it was still not what college is normally like. I'm on campus this semester and everything is normal and I still don't like it. I just applied to transfer to another school. Every semester I take another step towards leaving this place but I still find that I'm convincing myself it will be fine if I give it more time.\n\nI have started thinking about community college but I don't know if it is worth it. I know I would save a lot of money and possibly even time, but I really want a great and fun college experience. I'm starting to think maybe I just have expectations that are too high. Is the college experience worth it? Should I stay and stick it out or should I try somewhere new and go from there?",

If you want a \"college experience\", you can see if there are any clubs that interest you or you can get housing with roommates and hang with them. If your college has greek row you can see how to rush it.",

I don\u2019t really like the school that I\u2019m currently at for a number of reasons so I can\u2019t decide what to look for in another school. I don\u2019t really want to do something that requires me to go somewhere specific so I have a lot of options, which is good but super overwhelming.",

      "text": "I am a college junior and I have experienced pondering all these same questions and just recently have I reconciled with myself about the answers. I have been EXTREMELY wary of going into debt for college, especially now post-pandemic. 2019 is when I graduated so I got one full semester of college pre-covid. This was a great semester and definitely starkly different than the way things are now. I believe it is not worth going into debt for college now especially at a university. When things are so limited cause of covid you are getting nowhere near the full \"college experience\". I think it's even safe to say that \"experience\" you might be envisioning doesn't exist anymore. The keg stands and parties on campus today are not worth $50K+ of debt nor risking getting covid. \n\nCommunity college is what I will always recommend to everyone. I have been at a community college for the past 3 years and I can say I am extremely grateful to have been here rather than at a university paying for programs and facilities that were cut off or moved to online only. Also, employers are only concerned that you went to school. The place your degree comes from is arbitrary. \n\nI would also recommend doing work-study at your local community college. I work-studied moved to part-time and I just was offered a full-time position working at the gym on campus. This job offers healthcare benefits and 9 credit hours per semester for FREE! I also am on campus every day which gives me time to talk to my profs, go to the library, or anything else I need to do for my classes\n\nDon't let people make you feel like is the only way to succeed is to go into crippling debt OP. Best of luck.",

              "text": "Yes I have met a handful of cool people at my CC. I think there\u2019s a lot of different factors that go into that though. How strict is your college on Covid? Is student life hosting events for students? Are common areas open to students? How open are you to talking to strangers? These all play a role in the social aspect. In my opinion the only big difference between CC and university is the cost and public perception. A student can get equal academic/social/ life experiences from a CC just depends how you apply yourself.",
