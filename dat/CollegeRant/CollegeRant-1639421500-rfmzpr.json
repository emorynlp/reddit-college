  "text": "I'm an English literature student. Everything in my uni has been going so well and now I'm at my final year. For some fucked up reason, the uni decided to change most of our professors, and the new ones that showed up are the most useless professors I have ever seen in my entire life. Literally we dont take shit, they didnt even bother giving us some material. like i dont even care if they bothered to explain or teach their class, but at least give us some materials so we can study by ourselves. \n\nMidterms got announced on Thursday and I had to get a bad fever (my temp went up to 40 degrees Celsius) couldn't study anything, and they wouldn't extend my midterms or let me redo them or anything. \n\nso anyways today was the first day, and as i mentioned the professors didn't give us shit, well for some reason, they decided to fill up the exam with some bogus shit I've ever seen >.> \n\nliterally like wtf is wrong with them. we work so hard, just to get fucked by shitty professors...   \n\n\nsorry for the the curse words, I'm just in a really bad mood and i hope my marks don't get affected much cause I'm a scholarship student.",
