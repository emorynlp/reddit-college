I have like 30 papers of review work then comes exam there\u2019s hard as fuck questions some questions were not even on the Review sheet I\u2019m just in the exam not trying to rush but I feel disappointed I was the second to last to leave the exam that shit was so fucking hard and knowing I studied so hard but still know I\u2019m going to get like a C or maybe a D is eating me up.",
