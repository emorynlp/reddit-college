  "text": "Either 1 person did the reading or no one did it and we are all scrambling trying to find the answers to the questions before we have to present. \n\nMe and 1 other person did the reading and we had 2 other people with us and we were each assigned a question. We ran out of time to finish the rest of the questions. \n\nThe professor was annoyed and after our messy presentation, he had a long talk with an annoyed tone about how we need to be prepared in these readings. \n\nI mean, they are super long. It\u2019s like 40-50 pages, he would release the documents the day before. And many of us are working on other things or are working, etc.\n\nMany of the readings are really old, like a 1700-1800 speaking and it\u2019s hard to make out the words and try to understand. \n\n\nNot all of us have time to read that many pages before our 9am class and be prepared to present. \n\nHe said next time, he won\u2019t give anyone points if the readings aren\u2019t done.",

      "text": "I completely agree with you. This semester my chemistry professor puts us in breakout rooms every week for our lab and literally no one talks. I would be like, \"Hi guys!\" and complete silence. Not even a message in the chat. I'd ask them questions and try to collaborate and still no answer. So at this point I've just stopped trying. Labs are just solo work now and the questions are already hard, but not having anyone to work with makes them 10x harder. I wish my professor would at least switch up our breakout rooms every week but nah, I'm stuck with the same lame people.\n\nSo yeah, breakout rooms truly suck and I feel your pain. \n\nThanks for making this post btw! It's good to know I'm not the only college student struggling with breakout rooms.",
