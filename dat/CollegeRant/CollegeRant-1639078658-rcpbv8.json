  "title:": "Finally Narc'd out two kids who refuse to do any work or take our final project seriously. I have a meeting tomorrow with the professor 1 on 1 and I'm just upset and exhausted. Fuck lazy group mates who want to pass via otherpeoples work.",
  "text": "Fuck those lazy fucking frat boy's. I got stuck working with 2 kids who wanted to be partners while the rest of the class was assigned random groups and these lazy fucks havent done any work. Everytime we had zoom sessions outside of class to work on the project they were always either hanging out together or discussing the next party/event they wanted to go. There were numerous occasions where one kids girlfriend fucking was talking the whole time resulting in the kid not doing the work. We spent a in-class session today where we were supposed to work on the project and ask the teacher questions and they pretty much didnt do shit and said everything was fine. I tried to speak with my teacher after the class and I think one of the kids realized I was going to narc them out and he refused to leave. It was me, the professor and this kid. until the teacher finally ended the room. I emailed her right after class and now I have a meeting with her tomorrow where I have to pretty much ask her to do the assignment alone. This is so fucking unfair. I've literally done most of the work and the few things I asked them to do they didnt even make an attempt at it (we are on google docs and you can see who writes what and when). I asked them if they did the work and they said \"yea\" to which low and behold they didnt. One kid incorrectly submitted our draft and didnt give a fuck.  Fuck this bullshit private school, I went here thinking I'd get a better education but no... I've been stuck with lazy entitled priviledged fucking frat boys and international students that don't even speak english but somehow continue to get passed on when its clear they're not even doing the work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm fucking killing myself here and I'm tired.\n\nI've told the teachers, director of business undergraduate programs and no one is willing to address this or provide me with any sort of help. This is the first time a teacher is actually willing to meet with me and thankfully I've done extremely well the whole semester (straight a's and multiple participations during class etc) \n\nTo you kids who want a free ride and force normal students like me to fucking pick up your slack go fuck yourself. \n\nFun fact my tuition for next semester is 18k and I'm expecting to deal with this same level of bullshit. College, ever since I've transferred here, has been bullshit. This happens every god damn semester.",

He wanted to read the whole thing and just have me add details here and there. I talked to my professor and he agreed to it. He went up there, had no idea what was going on, and just butchered even the simple words. It was very satisfying.",

There' no policy (that I'm aware of) for most universities/colleges that you can't do this; make it known that you're not afraid of confronting them over it.",

He plays it off in person by talking about things we need to get done and telling us he will work on it later that day. But looking back in the work log, it is easy to see he hasn't been contributing. What he has tried to add to the project, all of the other people in the group had decided to not focus on. It can be really frustrating.",

It\u2019s what we should expect in the real world because people are fundamentally lazy. And especially depending on the college, people think their lives are handed to them on a silver platter so they just coast.

After our presentation the teacher went on a long rant about how freeloaders never make it far outside of class and those in the professional field can spot them a mile away. It was so satisfying watching my two partners squirm during it. We have one more group assignment which is turning in a final draft. It\u2019s funny watching their text messages. Suddenly they\u2019re team leaders trying to plan how it\u2019s going to go and how we need to communicate. Fuck them I\u2019m not replying lol they can see how it feels.
