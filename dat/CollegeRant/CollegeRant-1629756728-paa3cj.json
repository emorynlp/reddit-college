  "text": "What a waste of fucking time, energy and money. Forcing me to sit in a class that I couldn't give any less shits about listening to a monotone professor read off of some powerpoint slides. When I was online I could skip, or minimize the zoom or do some other more productive shit. Now it's in-person and I have to sit in the class and pretend like a little goody-two shoes that I give a shit when I don't. Have to spend money to commute and on top of all that shit, you got the pandemic. Great. Fucking great. Schedule ruined. Everything ruined. I could workout during a online class, now I gotta sit on my ass and stare. I could do homework or do my passion, but no now I gotta sit and stare. Fuck in-person classes.",

I assume you think I'm sort of slacker whiner, good stereotyping. I hope you realize students on the opposite side of slackers feel the same way for different reasons. Slackers hate classes because they want to be lazy, other students hate classes because it wastes their time and they want to do something more productive like an actual *relevant* class to their interests.\n\nThis is r/collegerant not r/\"be grateful you can have an education\". No shit I know it's a privilege  but it doesn't mean I can't be upset about it. Just because I have food to eat doesn't mean I can't complain about the food I'm eating. What a stupid false dilemma.",

He knows exactly what his dumbass was implying and decides to backtrack and cover it up as some \"positive\" asswipe. See through the lies my guy. you like everyone else lap up shit like there's no tommrow. and then when that person turns out to be a bad person you're all in shock. same problem with shit like celebrity worship.",
