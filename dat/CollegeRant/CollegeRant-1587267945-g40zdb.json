  "text": "I am so frustrated right now and letting it all out on reddit. I\u2019m sick and tired of the virtual classes and how some professors are going about it. My prof is purposely making exams extra hard because it is online now & even if you had your book wide open and notes during the exam, you still could fail. \nI just finished one of my online exams & I feel like I legit failed because I didn\u2019t finish in time & because the questions were nothing like the study guide questions & more of things you had to figure out on your own since they aren\u2019t in the book either. I am trying so hard & purposely studied before hand to get a good grade. I am struggling with the online learning & feel it is making my grades suffer. I need suggestions or some advice because I am in the worst mood I\u2019ve been in a while. Sorry for the rant",

      "text": "FWIW, it sucks for us profs too.  We signed up to teach on ground, which many of us really enjoy and have honed over years or even decades.  And then we've been shoved against our will into a teaching style we've never experienced, never been trained at, with students who don't want to be in this modality, with bosses who tell us to not compromise rigor while also going easy on the students, oh and we're being judged not only on how well we do, but also on how well our students do.  \n\nIt's a shit situation for all of us.  I personally have been teaching online for 10 years, and I'm glad that some profs are finally getting a wakeup call and being shoved into the 21st century, but I wish it didn't have to be at the expense of students.  I'm also glad that many schools which have been anti-online education are now also being dragged into the 21st century, but again this is at *everyone's* expense, and simultaneously we're in the middle of a pandemic.  This sucks SOOOOO bad for everyone, including the profs who've taught online for a while, and even for the students who are with those profs.",

But its a huge leap when you go from online classes designed around disability to teachers who have no clue what the fuck they're doing.\n\nAt least I have one teacher who is understanding and takes the time to caption the zoom sessions. Another told me there's no possible accommodations he can make and that I'm required to be in class. Even though I understand nothing. So there's no point to me being there because I don't understand anything. And it's a writing and research class. I'm just taking the class next year with a teacher I KNOW is reliable.",

There have been a lot of instances of cheating \n\nAnd even at a community college if the professor gave me a take home similar measures were implemented tbh. Still had hard professors at a community college too. It just depends really some are more lenient some aren\u2019t I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dependent on what college tbh.
