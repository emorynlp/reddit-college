  "text": "Does latin honors really matter? Not that education in a pandemic yields a better grade but I get insecure that my friends would have the chance to graduate with honors and there is even a higher chance because of the current set up.\n\nIn a pool of latin honors, here i am. I can only achieve high GPA. I'm also a student leader on the side and pretty much skilled in terms of art and graphic design.\n\nBtw, I'm a statistics student and in my country, I think no more than 10 universities offer this program. But chances are still low since we are competing with CompSci, Applied Math, and Math Graduates.\n\nFor context: I no longer have the chance to get a latin honor because in my Uni, once you get a certain grade on a your courses, you'll lost your chance. I've had a tough freshman year and that's why and I witness how cheaters these ppl can be to achieve such honors. I'm only starting to enjoy what I'm learning since I got the time to give myself a chance in a pandemic.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I hope I can hear encouraging words and experiences from you guys. :))",
