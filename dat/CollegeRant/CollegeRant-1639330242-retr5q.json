  "text": "Honestly, I could give any number of excuses as to why I got such bad grades in the past 2+ assignments; being tired of the online school format, lack of motivation, not really feeling or enjoying the past few projects... But ultimately I have no one to blame but myself, and being in this position absolutely sucks. I just completely dropped the ball and damn near gave up during the end of this term. I was barely even putting in 50% effort, and it resulted in sloppy work that didn't live up to the criteria which I also didn't pay close enough attention to. I don't know how I let myself just flop over and ruin whatever momentum I had going. Feel like a failure.",
