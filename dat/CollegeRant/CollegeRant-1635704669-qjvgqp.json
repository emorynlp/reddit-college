  "text": "to summarize everything \n\nMy senior capstone class is my senior fashion collection class. Where we are making garments to make a final collection at the end of the school year. \n\nThis particular professor is just \u2026. Picky. Although she comes across very nice and sweet . Last year having her & now her teaching me it us very apparent she thinks very little of me or doesn\u2019t care for my work. Since as many design students , particularly in the fashion department it\u2019s a very opinionated which is inevitable. \n\nNow mind you this is a class, which we do prototypes of our garments. Prototypes are just rough draft of your final piece. I have been getting low grades and get not liking my prototypes. Like D & C. For my first two . I understood half of the reason. I ran out of time and it was not my best effort, because of construction issues. But the feedback to fix the issues IS NOT HELPFUL. this woman only talks to me for 5 minutes then leaves me. Then when I have questions she goes idk your design or just criticizes my fabric choice. Or she goes like just redo it. Like it\u2019s not helpful for my issues. But I talk to her asking what she is looking for. I am being very proactive in this class. \n\nLast week I listened to her and I vented to her about frustrations. Everything that is going on why my prototypes were wrong, why I need a bit more time, and even told her that I feel like she doesn\u2019t think I care. I feel like everything I said went out the other ear to her. My final prototype look like this . I create a off the shoulder dress. Now I pressed it out , the seams were nice & crisp. I lined the dress and put in a zipper. There were tad minor issues, but in all very well done. In critiques she see it and goes \u201c this is one of my more successful looks\u201d and dies not provide anymore than just pressing it out more ???? Like wtf I am supposed to do with that info to improve . \n\nOne of my best friends is the TA for the department. He works under my professor. My friend tells me is very ok in class. My professor tell him \u201c so there this girl in my class ( my name) asks him that I needed help. Luckily he goes that I\u2019m his friend if I needed I would have asked him. \n\nIts the sheer that she did not once talk to me or approach me for extra help. I don\u2019t even know why she thinks im unapproachable. I talk to her every class and expresses help to her directly. I get nothing or little then she leaves. Or she gives this \u201c do you understand\u201d I say no and refers me to a textbook or another person. I don\u2019t even know how much I should even more . \n\nI\u2019m at a lost. This is a class I need and this only this professor.",
