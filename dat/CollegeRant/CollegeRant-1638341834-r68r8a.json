              "text": "Well. I can\u2019t answer that for you. Personally my first semester was my worst. \n\nI got a D+ 2-3 C\u2019s a B and one A. Second semester I got 3 C\u2019s a B and 2 A\u2019s. This semester is looking more like just B\u2019s and A\u2019s with maybe a C. I\u2019ve improved as I went on in my program. \n\nCollege is a big learning curve for some people but the more you do it the better you get at it. But I know not everyone work that way. If money isn\u2019t a factor then retake what you have to before moving on.",
