  "text": "When you're an accounting student and the pre-req for a class is basic accounting, and someone still doesn't know the #1 formula that is THE MOST IMPORTANT AND BASIC (and simple) accounting formula, it makes me wonder how they even passed to get into this class. And now we have to do group projects and my team member doesn't know the basic formula? If you're an accounting student, you should know that assets = liabilities + equity. Again - Accounting 101.",

              "text": "The math classes are useful because they teach you skills about how to deal with personal finance and paying rent and whatnot. Unless you choose not to take the easy A math classes. Pre-reqs are crucial because they prepare you for more advanced problems in the future, regardless of whether they directly relate to your career/profession. It's all valuable. Just try to look for positive qualities in your classes. School becomes a lot more tolerable when you actually try to enjoy it.\n\nThink to yourself, \"At least it's easy. At least I'll never have to worry about this again after I pass the class. At least I'm not getting any dumber.\" Maybe you don't feel that all of it is 100% necessary, but it doesn't hurt you at all. Think of it as GPA building.",
