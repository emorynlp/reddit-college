  "text": "First things first, I\u2019m not a snitch and I don\u2019t even think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with cheating on a test. But like make yourself a little cheat sheet or something, stop asking me for answers??\n\nI\u2019ve been struggling in my history class all semester (failed the first test, made low Bs on the next two.) I\u2019ve been stressed out because of work and other classes so I haven\u2019t had much time to study for the next test. Girl in my class messages me offering $50 to give her answers. I tell her I\u2019m not even prepared for the test, so no. This morning, another guy in my class messages me offering $50 for answers. I ignore it. \n\nFirst girl messages me again \u201chey I can help you out on this test if you help me on the final\u201d. WHY?! Like the final is 3 weeks away. If you just took that time to study the material instead of trying to cheat then you would probably pass? Like I said, I\u2019m not above cheating and I get that people are desperate, but I personally am not going to jeopardize my academic standing to help someone else\u2014$50 or not.",

      "text": "Some people are just too deep into the rabbit hole of cheating that they have no immediate escape. They lack the fundamentals to understand higher level concepts, so they remedy their grades by cheating, which makes them even more behind. If they were to study, they'd have to start from the beginning which can be very time consuming and frustrating. \n\nThis is why you should put in the effort from day one. If you get lazy and think, \"I can just cheat for this one,\" you'll screw yourself up for the rest of the semester (or even future semesters).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with refusing to give answers. That's the right thing to do.",

          "text": "I think you\u2019re totally right. With online classes, it\u2019s been shockingly easy to cheat on tests so most of my professors have just made tests open book/note to combat that. This history class is the only one I\u2019ve taken that makes us use Respondus with our webcam on so cheating isn\u2019t an easy option. I think people get freaked out because they\u2019re not used to actually having to memorize the material.",

      "text": "I completely agree. Except I do think cheating IS morally wrong. It isn\u2019t just a harmless crime with no victims. When enough people cheat to pass a class, the class and college as a whole will compensate by making the tests and class harder. This makes everyone else\u2019s life more difficult. If they don\u2019t compensate, than the value of your degree goes down as more people are able to earn it without actually meeting the requirements and doing the work.",
