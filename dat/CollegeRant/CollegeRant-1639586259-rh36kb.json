  "text": "Title.\n\nOur final assignment in a module is due in less than 12 hours. We are all supposed to write 2000 words each then put everything together as one whole paper and submit it.\n\nI was the dumb one for accepting the responsibility for the entire paper, and now I have to AND have been constantly nagging (once a week) my groupmates about their part for the past month and a half or so. They either don't open the messages, or just say \"they will\". I also have to make sure the paper has a uniform formatting, everything, you can imagine.\n\nEvery member besides me started working on their part today, and one of them is also radio silent. Someone already broke the wonderful news to me that they will only be able to send me their part by midnight... Guess I'll have to stay up for their sake.. The assignment itself is due tomorrow at 8am, and they really expect me to do all these (and will sadly), even though we are all graded individually.\n\nI have been thinking of just staying loyal to my sleep schedule and going to sleep when I have to and upload whatever they have sent to me by then, but I hate being a douche. Kinda scared of their backlash if I do something like this but I have been thinking that their parts were literally their own responsibilities... The teacher has known about the situation already weeks prior and told me to set deadlines for them but I have dozens of times already and none of them cared.\n\nReddit pls give me power, this is my last assignment before my exams, after this it is all Malibu and stuff.",

Like u/MechanicExtension565 said, you probably shouldn\u2019t worry too much if you\u2019re graded individually. If your professor does peer reviews and grades as appropriate, make sure to take advantage of the opportunity.",
