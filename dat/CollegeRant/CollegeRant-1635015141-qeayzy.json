  "text": "Hey all, little bit of a question and a rant. I'm in college studying public affairs/criminal justice but I'd always been curious about biology since I had been an EMT even before going to college, and recently got certified as an AEMT. Unfortunately, this class is not like EMT or even AEMT school. I honestly thought I could work hard to catch up since the material was really hard, but that's looking like less of an option because of how much there is to catch up on. It turns out that pretty much everybody in my lecture except for me has taken AP biology, and we're running through a ton of material at breakneck pace. It doesn't help that the professor goes off on tangents about things that we hadn't covered yet, leaving me confused half the time, and he doesn't really take questions so I can't ask for clarification. I failed a test, but I was apparently in good company since the class average was a 66. I don't really need this class since I had a vague thought of maybe going to medical school after this, but absolutely not anymore. I'm past the add drop period, and I don't really know what to do since hard work has usually worked for me in the past. I'm honestly pretty sure I'm gonna fail and am running out of ideas.",

      "text": "It kind of depends on what kind of bio the class is that you\u2019re taking what the material is like, but I would really recommend seeking extra help. Most universities have some sort of tutoring available or go to office hours and get help there. Also Khan Academy, Crashcourse and the Amoeba Sisters on Youtube have some of my favourite bio videos, they\u2019ve definitely helped in the past. I normally study with flashcards and then do the diagrams separately. Not sure if this is helpful, but good luck! Worst case scenario you fail it and even then it\u2019s not the end of the world I promise.",

          "text": "Seconding Khan Academy and the YouTube channels! When I took bio in high school our teacher played a few videos by the Amoeba Sisters and I found them really helpful! Nothing else, try to make a groupchat with some of your classmates. Some of them might have more ideas than we do and have a better idea of what you\u2019re going over in class. Good luck, OP! You\u2019ll survive!",

      "text": "Hi! As someone who\u2019s taken a lot of biology classes & helped out students in biology \u2014 this is what I recommend: \n\u2022read the book ahead of class \n\u2022go to lecture and take notes \n\u2022if your handwriting is messy, rewrite your notes ONLY once \n\u2022create concept maps and use test questions in your textbook to practice\n\u2022you need to work on active learning techniques, this will increase your learning retention \n\nHere\u2019s a link for examples of active learning techniques:\n\nhttps://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/studying-101-study-smarter-not-harder/\n\n\nBiology classes have low averages always. Don\u2019t feel discouraged. You CAN do this.",
