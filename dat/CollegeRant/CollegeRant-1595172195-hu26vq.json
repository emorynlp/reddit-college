  "title:": "If I don't get an internship will I never find a job?",
  "text": "I'm about to be in my 4th year of college (but I'm not gonna graduate on time) and I've kind of just been cruising through. I have a 3.4 gpa and I do pretty well in my classes. I'm now afraid that if I just keep going through the motions, I'll graduate and struggle to find a job and have to work minimum wage till something comes along years later. I'm in university because I've been made to feel that if I go to college, I *will* get a good job.\n\nI'm an art major (graphic design) and I feel like I chose an intimidating field but I dont think I can do anything else because I'm almost done with college and I actually like what I do, but everyone talks about how hard or competitive the field will be and it scares me.\n\nI am so stressed during this time of my life because I have to work a lot outside of school and don't have time for much else. If I don't have a minimum wage job rn, I will starve and I'm living on my friends couch. I'm basically broke and homeless while attending university and it is occupying my time and priorities. \n\nI know I should be focusing on school and finding internships and building up my portfolio but I feel to stressed and like i never have the time. But if I dont focus up on my career then all this struggle will be for nothing when I graduate and can't get a real job. I want to know if I'll actually be okay not having an internship and stuff. Or is it actually as deathly crucial as everyone makes it out to be.\n\nSorry for the long rant but I feel hopeless about my future.",

      "text": "Any sort of practical experience you can still get while in school to add to your portfolio will definitely help. Your portfolio will be one of the most important things for you finding a job, so it would be good to focus on building that as much as you can now. I know it's difficult to do this while working on top of school, especially design school since it requires so much time (I was in a similar position last year working a lot outside of school, so I hear ya), but the more you can focus now on developing good projects, will help you so much later on.\n\n An internship is *usually* a good way to do this too- if you can find a good one that will allow you to truly put your skills to practice or lead to other opportunities. At least in my experience for me and my classmates, it could be hit or miss that you would actually get decent design work, or any work at all, which in that case might not be worth the time. Not sure if that's just in my area though, since my school required you have some sort of internship and didn't really care if it was a quality position or not. That, and a lot of companies only bring on interns without pay, especially in design, but if your school accepts academic credit, at least you can get something out of it. If you do search for an internship, just beware of this, as the quality of positions like these vary greatly. \n\nUnfortunately, I do think having good connections is a major part of it, as someone else here mentioned, which makes it hard because obviously some people are going to have an advantage over this due to their school and location, etc. And I'm sure it's going to be tough to try and make connections this coming year with the current situation and all that. But, even just asking your teachers for feedback or help with finding internships can help.\n\nIf anything, I might recommend trying to find freelance work. This way, you can at least get practice working for clients and still be able to make a couple dollars. You will probably still need a portfolio set up to get any work, though. Upwork is a good one I hear, and if you haven't heard of Behance yet, that's a real good creative platform to get a profile going on, and they have job postings there too. It definitely doesn't hurt to pick up some basic skills in HTML/CSS, photo, video, After Effects, Adobe Xd, etc, if you haven't already. A lot of people in my class weren't as interested in these areas and therefore don't really learn them, but it helps to be versatile from what I've experienced, because you never know what the future holds. \n\nI know this was a lot and might not have given you a direct answer to your question, but I hope this helps. I just graduated and have yet to go through applying for actual positions, so I can't really speak about the nature of the market at the moment (I've luckily had some freelance work, at least for the time being). It is competitive and that can be quite frustrating, but, if this is something you're truly passionate about, put in the work, and are versatile with your skills, I think it can be done.",

      "text": "I'm going to be super frank with you as someone in an allied field (my degree is similar to graphic design but with additional photo/video skills and some coding) who just graduated, even if you do an internship (or some other kind of big professional experience like a fellowship) the field is still super competitive and doesn't guarantee a job or even make you more employable because of how saturated the market is with people who have years of experience. It  comes down more to what school you went to, your portfolio, and the luck of the draw of who you know/ you can meet/you can get your application in front of. \n\nMost employers in the field do not consider any kind of personal projects or freelance work (especially work on platforms like fiverr, upwork, etc.) \"real work\" for employment purposes so keep that in mind. Basically anything outside of full-time paid agency work (or some specific paid part-time roles) will not help your application at all for the decent positions. \n\nFor every person who graduated in my cohort or the cohort ahead of us who has a decent creative job, there's about 5 people who either in completely unrelated work that doesn't require a college degree (so like waiting tables, working in retail, etc.), a job that is design related but not in a design role (so taking logos developed by someone else and placing them on templates developed by someone else for manufacturing packages, working in large format printing, etc.), or something equally bad and unrelated to their degree. And out of those people who did get decent design job all but 2 of them got them because of their parents or some other relative. With the other 2, one got it by temping in a completely unrelated position (I think the temp job was in hr or like an administrative assistant or something like that) and the other got lucky (their words not mine).\n\nSo what I'm saying is that especially in the post-COVID design world you're going to struggle getting a job no matter what even if you have the best resume and portfolio, especially if you didn't go to a super prestigious well connected school, have parents who can get you a professional job at their company, or get super lucky (or live in one of the 5 cities with a decent amount of creative jobs). The creative positions have typically been one of the first to be eliminated and the ones that are being listed right now you will go up against people with over a decade of full-time agency experience who are willing to take an entry-level salary and you simply can't compete with that (I know I can't and I was one of the top graduates in my program this year). An employer will be more likely to have you move into a more creative role if you are already doing a professional job at their company (think going from an administrative assistant to a production artist and then moving up from there). At least then they know how you work overall.\n\ntl;dr: COVID has completely messed up an already super competitive and saturated field so you need to focus more on transferrable skills right now to just get a job. Then later on try to transition into a design-related role. The caveat to this is if you already know someone who can get you a job at their company (think parent or second-degree relative) then ignore everything I said.",

Build a website with your work, maybe volunteer with a non profit somehow. It's a very competitive field in the USA, if you are going to get a decent job you absolutely need a strong portfolio and a solid resume.",

      "text": "I don't think you necessarily need an internship, but I'd recommend it, even if it's a few hours a week. If you choose not to get one-which is fine, many people I know don't get one and still figure it out fine!-as a graphic designer, you do need a kick-ass portfolio. Build it up with class projects, and then offer to do some freelance work around if you see companies who need it on Fiverr, Craigslist, etc. An internship is all about getting real-world experience in your field. If you can do that in a less time-consuming way while getting a bit of money from it, I'd say go for it!",
