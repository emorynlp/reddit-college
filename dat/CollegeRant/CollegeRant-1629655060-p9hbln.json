  "text": "Essentially I\u2019ve made no new close friends in my two years of university. I have a couple acquaintances and that\u2019s it. My existing friends have all made new friend groups and whilst we\u2019re thankfully still pretty close I feel so weird that I only have them whilst they have tons of other people. I\u2019m an introvert and have social anxiety so I prefer to have a few close friends but I feel such a pressure to do what everyone else does. \n\nThis year will be my final year. I would like to have at least one new friend but I feel like everyone has made friends at this point and it\u2019s awkward for me to try and fit into existing friend groups. I\u2019m going to try to join societies and talk to people in class. But I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on that amazing social life everyone else has and it\u2019s too late now :(",

Doesn't help when everyone there seems to know what their doing and I go to University everyday wondering why the heck I'm even there in the first place. I know a lot of others feel the same as me but I just feel like I'm so much more immature and stupid looking for my age in comparison to everyone else.",

I\u2019m completely alone here but I\u2019m here to study not make friends, still though I feel kind of lonely but I\u2019ll get by and so will you. I feel it\u2019s comforting to know that I\u2019m not the only one that has no friends. \nWell hopefully I\u2019ll make at least one friend or not either way I know I\u2019ll be okay\nI also feel like I\u2019m more immature and stupid looking or that I\u2019m on a lower level but I\u2019m not going to let those thoughts get to me and neither should you.

Now I\u2019m going into Junior year with pretty much the same friend group as Summer 2019. But whatever honestly, I\u2019m in my hometown for college so I still hang out with my childhood friends who are still in-state.\n\nAlso know you aren\u2019t in this boat alone. Very little people have been able to successfully socialize throughout the pandemic.",
