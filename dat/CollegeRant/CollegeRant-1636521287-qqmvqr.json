      "text": "i have this same problem, with prior eye problems and static vision.\n\n1. blue light glasses are your best friend. if you already wear prescription, when you get your next pair, it's about a $40 upgrade if you don't have eye insurance (i know because i don't either).\n2. if you use docs, you can add a dark mode overlay in google themes. even if you don't, ALWAYS change the page color to a dark grey under file -> page setup. i would also recommend changing the font color to a light grey instead of white/black, as the minimal contrast is very easy on the eyes. even if there's no dark mode on your school's official site, this during paper writing will spare you so many bloodshot eyes.\n3. 20/20/20 rule. every 20 minutes, for 20 seconds, stare at something at least 20 feet away. seriously, crazy helpful. i game on top of my constant schoolwork, so i'm staring at a screen for about 8 hours a day. if i didn't do this i would probably need prescription eye drops, too.\n\nand of course don't forget to get up and walk around every hour if you're sitting at your desk for a long time. :)",
