  "text": "Had to take 2 hour exam on proctorio this morning. I\u2019m supposed to be alone in the \u201ctesting room\u201d. Husband forgot I was taking exam, walked into my \u201ctesting\u201d room and started talking loud. Proctorio immediately kicked me out of exam. Luckily I was finished but merely checking over my answers. Didn\u2019t get to check over the rest of them and got some wrong because of it. Husband knows better than that. Grrrr. Tried to contact prof on zoom but he\u2019s no longer there. fucking proctorio.",

Also, many students do not have strong and reliable internet connections in many places, so it is really unfair.  Faculty need to rethink how they give exams and what the goal is. I gave my students 24 hours to do the exam and upload their answers. Sadly, someone  uploaded the midterm to Course Hero (a site that lives on plagiarism), however, the solutions that they bought used techniques not covered in class...\n\nIn the real world, people can look at books and check methods. This means that the test should be about how and when to apply the methods to a problem and demonstrate that process.",

Some students don\u2019t even have their own room or desk to take exams. Not to mention, there are plenty of ways to cheat when using that software, making it pretty useless in my opinion. So not only is it creepy it\u2019s also classist, ableist, and not even effective.",
