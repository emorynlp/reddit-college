      "text": "I dropped Calc in the first two weeks, 3 semesters in a row. I pushed through the 4th time. The week before the final was a 3 or 4 day weekend. I was practically already drowning in a D, if not an F (it was an F), and I fell into a DEEP depression where I only ate alcohol and didn't leave my room before the final Monday morning unless it was to get food (alcohol). I think I had a cold too but I really can't remember. I didn't eat because I was so nervous about failing again and possibly destroying my GPA even further. I didn't even really think about food. \n\nThe last moment, Monday morning, panic hit me and I decided to show up cause I figured it was better to show up and fail than not show up and fail....WRONGO! \n\nI sat down in my seat a little hungover, felt pretty ok cause I knew the outcome. That's when my stomach started rumbling. It went from a rumble to the sound of wet spaghetti getting shot through a low velocity canon in a matter of seconds and I just felt sick like I hadn't eaten in 4 days. I kept pushing through cause I was hoping the sound was only audible to me...until the class queen shot me the death stare because I was distracting her (rightfully so). I kept pushing through until the kid sitting next to me couldn't take anymore and started giggling like a school child. I smiled at him and said fuck this...handed my wrong answered, half filled out paper and never came back. \n\nTalked to my faculty advisor about how bad at math I am and it's going to stop me from graduating. He didn't care about that. He just knew it was the wrong major for me. Switched me into one I am feeling much better in. \n\nI'm not saying you're in the wrong major, just know when to stop...and keep eating.",

          "text": "There are 2 sides to this coin. I took calc one with a guy and we both failed. He switched majors (out of engineering) and into a major that requires courses like physics with algebra and non-technical courses. He found his fit. I failed calc 1 twice and got my shit together and will graduate with an engineering degree next year bc I learned that I was just being lazy and didn\u2019t study enough. True, some people aren\u2019t geared for some majors but others just need to buckle down and grind",

Wasn't til after the previous story I found out I have the math level equivalent to a sixth grader. Those circumstances definitely aren't going to apply to everyone. Some people just need to actually study.",

But that didn't stop me from actuallying switching INTO becoming a chem major. \n\n\n\nHowever, my luck has not been good with calc 1. I am a second semester calc 1 student (first semester withdrew) and this semester probably won't end with a pass. But I kind of refuse to let it stop me. I want to take it again, truth is, outside of doing the HW assignments, I just didn't study enough... The first time I had too much going on with other courses and in life and currently I just been kind of miserable but I don't care how bad I am next semester I really want to just drill it all in no matter how painful and miserable I become. Before calc 1, I looked at the review sheet and got A's. I slowly notched up the amount of studying in calc 1 in both semester since that but it simply just wasn't enough.",

Theres a lot of reasons I kept failing, but I could\u2019ve handled it better or taken an easier class at a state school. Either way, good luck to you. If you think studying for next week will help, absolutely do that, but if its a lost cause,  forget the ones you\u2019ll fail and focus on improving classes you\u2019re stronger or have better grades in. Thats my advice obv, but I hope it all works out no matter what you choose to do.",

Just try and fix what got you into that situation in the first place and change it. On the bright side, you already know the course material more or less and know how the course is gonna work.
