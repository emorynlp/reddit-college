  "text": "I feel terrible and I feel terrible that I feel terrible.\n\nBackground: I am am undergraduate senior but started this semester on my graduate degree too. I took 1 undergraduate course and 3 graduate courses. On top of that, I worked 30 hours a week in corporate America.\n\nUntil this semester I had a perfect 4.0GPA. But I just made my first B ( in one of the graduate courses) I know this sounds dramatic but I am a perfectionist. I also sensed that I could have done better. I am now facing an 89.1. To make it more dramatic, I feel that I failed myself. I am already in grad school and I already have a job. So I shouldn\u2019t feel bad as GOA won\u2019t make a difference, but I can\u2019t handle myself right now. \n\nJust a rant.",

      "text": "I know what it\u2019s like to feel this way. We put so much pressure on ourselves for no reason sometimes. I also had a 4.0 for most of college until a similar thing happened. That first B is like ripping off a bandaid. Once that happens, you will eventually feel the pressure of that 4.0 come off of your shoulders, and it\u2019s so freeing. When that happened to me I realized that my mental health and getting joy out of life is more important than some stupid number. Wasting years of my life feeling intense stress, and pressure to achieve \u201cperfection\u201d just isn\u2019t worth it if at the end of the day I\u2019m going to be miserable and hating my life. At the end of your life you\u2019re not going to look back and be kicking yourself for getting a B. You\u2019ll be proud that you got your degree and that you had a fulfilling and happy life beyond that. Your degree is only a small part of your life and who you are, and the GPA on it is even less significant",
