  "title:": "my professor responded to my email about group work and health accommodations super passive-aggressively",
  "text": "i asked my professor how i can approach working with a group that might not be timely with their portion of the work and organization of group meetings and also that i needed an extension on my paper due to my migraine on the day before the class, and instead of actually addressing any of my concerns, she implicitly accused me of not working with my group and implied that i'm asking her to \"micromanage our meeting times\" (what?) she outright refused to acknowledge that i was *bedridden from a freaking migraine* and couldn't send the email until i actually recovered. it's fucking frustrating dealing with a response like this because it feels accusatory to point out that she didn't actually... answer any of the questions i had? i was always an active participator in class and i only missed one class in the quarter thus far due to factors beyond my control so it's just so infuriating that she wasn't responsive at all.\n\ni didn't even know what to reply to something like this so i just decided to avoid further conflict and made it short and curt. i hate being wrongly accused of being a poor communicator when i'm the person who's been managing pretty much all our group work and meetings and communications. i had to do lots of extra work in group assignments, but somehow asking for an extension on the sole day i missed class due to *being sick* is out of the line? this professor even emphasized being compassionate with one another as learners and educators during a turbulent time, so it's pretty shitty that she's being this hypocritical and standoffish. i wanted to take another one of her courses because i thought she was cool but i don't think that's happening after this",
