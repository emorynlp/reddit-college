  "text": "I\u2019m so tired of everything. I truly hate school. I regret coming here more than anything. I am so academically understimulated and I will never be able to go anywhere fucking better because I was rolling around suicidal during my first year. Nothing I can ever do from this point will matter on that front. I hate it here so much. There\u2019s nothing to do. \n\nI have no friends. I\u2019m lonely all the time. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I\u2019m so anxious and scared every time I go out because I\u2019ve just been so fucking isolated. I literally can\u2019t just walk up and talk to people anymore. I\u2019m so tired of hearing that. I\u2019m so scared and besides that everyone still looks at you like you\u2019re crazy because of the fucking rona. There\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019ve literally been ghosted by multiple clubs and there\u2019s never any fucking info about meetings just posted on the goddamn website.\n\n\nI hate it. I want to die.",

I have to get a degree for my career path. Of course I\u2019ve considered other options. This is my only option. If I go to the ER tonight (they won\u2019t do anything but watch me for 24 hours and maybe give me a Xanax! All of which I can do for free in the comfort of my own home.) I\u2019m still going to feel just as bad when I get out and all of my problems are still here plus I\u2019ll have new medical bills. \n\nAgain, I really do appreciate it. I genuinely do. Thank you for trying to help. \n\n\nBut as I said\u2014 I am literally doing what you suggested. All I have said is that I am seeking professional mental health help, and will continue to do so in the present. Recovery is a process, it\u2019s not like an infection where I can take some antibiotics and be done with it. Why would I be posting if not to vent and get advice? \n\nChecking into inpatient treatment doesn\u2019t magically fix things. Sure I could go check into the hospital for the next 3 months and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d make some lovely therapy progress and learn some good coping skills. But then I\u2019m gonna get out and be homeless and unemployed with multiple months of insurance copays built up to pay back. It\u2019s not that simple.",

There are a lot of ways you could make changes. Many, many people take breaks from school and come back. People change schools, change majors etc. all the time. Many people don\u2019t finish degrees. Many people never start. The smartest guy I know from school actually ended up dropping out of a physics degree and going into a trade. He\u2019s making great money as an electrician and is much happier. \n\nIt is really hard to see options and figure things out when you\u2019re in a situation that\u2019s become so negative. Please take a step back and take care of yourself. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. Burn-out in school doesn\u2019t discriminate, it happens to the best of us. Get yourself feeling better and the way ahead will be more clear.",

I\u2019ve been working since I was 14 (10 if you wanna count under the table lol) and I think I can say pretty definitively that \u201cunskilled\u201d work isn\u2019t gonna work for me long term. I\u2019m still working part time rn at a job I really love and it has helped, but I do know realistically I\u2019m not going to be happy or even able to make ends meet working any position I\u2019m qualified for at the moment. I could drop out right now and work full time and realistically I\u2019m not going to be able to save up enough money in a year/semester\u2019s worth of time to build up a savings that would allow me some wiggle room. \n\nI also have a lot of personal circumstances that make it unfeasible to drop out. I\u2019m going to be responsible for taking care of several relatives in the future and I frankly don\u2019t have time to waste. My GPA is too low to transfer anywhere because of my mental health struggles last year. I\u2019m kind of reliant on pursuing grade forgiveness at this school to be able to get any scholarships, transfers, etc. which ofc means I\u2019m gonna be stuck for at least another semester. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is that I really don\u2019t have options besides to try to improve things here as best as I can until I\u2019m at a place where I can actually move on. \n\nTotally do have lots of internal things to work on myself (that I\u2019m working on and will continue to work on!) , but the point I\u2019ve been trying to make here is that the root of everything is really some external factors need to change haha. I took a super lightened course load this semester and I still have all the same problems. Totally understand where everyone\u2019s coming from with the mental health angle, but I am seeking help for it and there\u2019s not many ways to speed that process up lol. \n\nBut seriously thank you again! People keep seeming to read this as me denying help for some reason, but I am genuinely so grateful for your time and input. The reassurance helped a lot, and that\u2019s definitely solid advice for most peoples situations haha. Thank you again! I hope you\u2019re having a good day. Sorry for the rambling paragraph",

I don\u2019t think people comprehend how different COVID has made things, especially for people who came in last year. It\u2019s not just that we missed out on whatever fun extra nonsense, I mean all of the root issues like not being able to socialize/poor grades due to awfully implemented online learning are still effecting us this year. \n\nYeah it\u2019s remarkable that people think going seeing a professional will just magically fix every problem in your life? This girl really told me that I should \u201cjust try antidepressants\u201d to not want to kill myself like she knows me better than my doctor HAHAHHA. And then argued tried to argue that I\u2019d be better off going to long term inpatient treatment even if it meant I\u2019d be homeless when I got out? And then started trying to mock me for not having friends because she was mad that I had already tried what she was suggesting? Idk the logic gaps are amazing. \n\nAnd yeah 100%, while I recognize more than anyone that I need to keep working on my internal issues, there\u2019s so so many external factors that are gonna keep causing the same problem. Of course I have benefitted from my treatment greatly, but being able to cope with stress or unpacking trauma doesn\u2019t magically fill up my bank account or boost my gpa or change my life circumstances haha. \n\nI tried taking a super light course load as a break this semester and it didn\u2019t make a difference stress wise, I just felt guilty for it the entire time lol. I\u2019ve actually worked food service forever and enjoy it! I have a job at a nice little family restaurant currently and it\u2019s been wonderful in terms of support and a social outlet. I do have friends in my coworkers, and i totally should\u2019ve specified in my original post that I was mostly melancholy about the lack of friends at school lol. \n\nThanks so much for replying and I\u2019m sorry about the rambling response!",

      "text": "Yes. Yes yes yes everything yes. I feel the exact same way and dont agree with the people replying to you post. I have not agreed with your post more-i felt so alone thinking this way. I have not made a single genuine friend in college and have tried so hard. Gone to so many campus activities, tried clubs and even tried iut greek life in act of desperation. Iys gotten so bad ive also started to feel genuinely suicidal-something i havent felt in 5 years and it terrifies me. I want to transfer and leave so bad but my family has given me the ultimatum that if I leave they will completely abandon me. They are terrible and abusive anyways so i wouldnt be missing out on much but it is still terrifying to leave. I will say though- a degree is not everything. It has hit me more then ever this year especially. You can make a lot of money without a degree, i wouldnt put as much worth onto it as you do. Dont consider yourself a failure or beat urself up for leaving with out a degree. Seriously. Ive known a lot of people drop out part way in due to college being shit then pick themselves up at a easy to get job then either return back to school for a degree specific career (like nursing or teaching) or continue thriving at their current job. I hate school-more than anything ever. it has set me back so far mentally and has inspired me to lose passion for education and my dreams. Ive been a very school oriented person my entire life and even then ive been smacked with the reality that college is not for everyone. As a side note: option you could look into would be community college. If you are still very persistent on getting a degree without taking a break I highly recommend community college or online school.\n(Edit: i think its important to state that I do not plan on going through with suicide. I have two people from home who are my reason to wake up every morning. Ive just been having thoughts frequently due to the loneliness of my closet sized dorm. I am seeing a therapist on campus regularly to talk. Its not helping things get that better but it is definitely saving it from getting any worse.)",

It is SO HARD even when you are mentally healthy so I can\u2019t even imagine how it is for you. \n\nIf you see this, what exactly is the path you\u2019re taking with college? I guess I\u2019m just asking what your degree is and your plan for it? I saw that you said you\u2019ve considered trades and stuff, but you really need your degree. I find that most jobs that require a degree, don\u2019t require just one bachelors degree - like the medical field for example. I ultimately decided not to go to medical school because my mental health is simply not good enough for me to survive that. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve considered all your options already, but that\u2019s something I didn\u2019t realize/accept until recently. Sometimes you just CAN\u2019T do what you initially planned or wanted to do. \n\nAnyway, good luck with everything. I also cope with my mental health by laughing about it lol.

      "text": "I understand completely. You are definitely not alone. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that has gotten me truly out of my head has been doing hands-on hobbies, like art and building things. Hell, just hammering a few nails into a log really helps me to get some of my frustration out. Or, going for long walks/hikes alone with just my music to accompany me. \n\nAlso, a thing that reassures me the most is that I don\u2019t *have* to go to college to be very successful. I could work as an apprentice in a trade and/or go to trade-school. Trades are always necessary no matter where you live or what year you live in, and they pay a shitload of money out-the-gate (I\u2019m talking $100,000/year). College isn\u2019t necessary to be financially successful. In fact, I\u2019d almost argue that it does the opposite (especially if you live in the USA, where teachers and office-workers tend to be paid abysmally low). I\u2019m only in college because I am curious about pursing a career in a creative science, like engineering and/or computer coding. But, if it turns out I truly hate what I\u2019m doing, I will gladly drop out in a heartbeat and learn a trade (I\u2019m thinking of learning both electrical and plumbing, as well as painting and tiling). \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that you truly aren\u2019t trapped in college. I don\u2019t care how many asswipes who make $40,000 a year (if that) tell you that college is the key to success. It isn\u2019t! There are so many things out there that pay extremely well and require no college. There are also so much to do that pay extremely well that college helps you get into. There are so many great-paying career paths out there, it\u2019s almost guarantee that you\u2019ll enjoy at least one of them. \n\nSo, whatever you do, don\u2019t lose hope, and definitely don\u2019t hurt yourself. I understand fully how shitty life can be. For reference, I\u2019ve been in therapy for years and am taking medications for the worst symptoms of my anxiety/depression, but I still feel like shit. Also, my life is pretty shitty, too. But, this ain\u2019t the oppression olympics. No matter where you\u2019re at or who you are, your feelings are valid. \n\nBut, you have to keep going. Even if all you can do right now is keep breathing, great! But, I\u2019m here to tell ya that there is much more to life than just breathing. You can literally do anything you want, and get paid a shitload of money for it. It just takes time, research, and curiosity to figure those things out. If you have to take out some student loans, so be it. As long as you don\u2019t choose a career in teaching or management, then you will be able to pay them off with ease.",
