  "text": "I\u2019m so tired of everything. I truly hate school. I regret coming here more than anything. I am so academically understimulated and I will never be able to go anywhere fucking better because I was rolling around suicidal during my first year. Nothing I can ever do from this point will matter on that front. I hate it here so much. There\u2019s nothing to do. \n\nI have no friends. I\u2019m lonely all the time. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I\u2019m so anxious and scared every time I go out because I\u2019ve just been so fucking isolated. I literally can\u2019t just walk up and talk to people anymore. I\u2019m so tired of hearing that. I\u2019m so scared and besides that everyone still looks at you like you\u2019re crazy because of the fucking rona. There\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019ve literally been ghosted by multiple clubs and there\u2019s never any fucking info about meetings just posted on the goddamn website.\n\n\nI hate it. I want to die.",
