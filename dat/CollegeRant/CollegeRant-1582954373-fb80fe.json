  "text": "STEM major here. I feel like I\u2019ve lost a crucial part of myself when I started college. Everyone says science is one of the most creative programs, but so far I haven\u2019t experienced that. All I do is study and try to measure my worth around this \u2018all or nothing\u2019 framework that doesn\u2019t allow for creativity. Everything is so rigid and by the rules in all my classes and I don\u2019t see where the higher level thinking comes in if all college requires is memorizing and cramming as much information to regurgitate onto a test or to apply in a lab. \nWhat do you do when you have all this creativity in you just longing to be let out?",

You\u2019ve made me realize that I definitely should continue with academia if I want any opportunity to create and solve within my field instead of being commanded by others. I\u2019m definitely just going to try to push through undergrad and look into getting a masters and PhD. Thank you :)",

It really helps to have some kind of \u201ccreative\u201d hobby, whether that\u2019s music, programming, art, writing, whatever. Also, I\u2019ve found that being involved in research stimulates me in different ways from classes because I have to think through a problem and how to approach it. You could also look into joining a club on campus that does creative things, like improv or a music group.",

It\u2019s really interesting you say people tell you science is one of the most creative programs, because I have never heard that and I certainly haven\u2019t experienced it... So to me I\u2019m almost not surprised that it kills my creativity, but I am surprised that college in general has stunted it so much. I haven\u2019t been able to solve this problem myself, but I have been trying to give myself allotted time to just do what I can e.g. draw or paint a little, even if it\u2019s something really small. I also try to read before bed but sometimes I just get so caught up in school/work/studying I\u2019m too tired by the time I lay down to put any mental energy towards even a fiction book :/",
