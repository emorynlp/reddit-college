  "title:": "Can professors stop sending us to breakout rooms every friggin class",
  "text": "I\u2019m a junior taking classes with all the seniors and super seniors because my degree usually takes 5 years but since I took college classes during high school and was doing well in my courses, my advisor suggested that I take these classes (without taking the prerequisites for them) so I could graduate in 4 years. I\u2019m trying my best and am constantly studying to stay on top of the material but what my professors like to do is lecture for 25 minutes and then send us to breakout rooms with different people to figure the problems out on our own. We also get graded on those problems and also on our participation in the groups (we are forced to rank each other). This is so stupid because firstly, I haven\u2019t taken the prerequisites so it\u2019s obviously going to take me longer to figure things out and secondly, why the heck are we responsible to teach each other such complicated topics when we\u2019re paying 60K to you to teach us the same. It works when it\u2019s done occasionally but I cannot do this every single class period. I\u2019ve been in groups with such misogynistic jerks that I preferred to fail the class in peace than to ask them for help. I am so annoyed and tired of this and will consider transferring to some other university if the professors at mine continue to be lazy like this.",
