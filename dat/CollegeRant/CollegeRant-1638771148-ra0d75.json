  "title:": "My college pushes an unhelpful MBA program on fresh business grads. I feel like it\u2019s morally wrong.",
  "text": "This is long, sorry. I graduated with my BBA in management/marketing last May. I was fortunate enough to graduate debt-free, so I planned to stop there and continue my education later, when I had a clearer career path and more money. I also wasn\u2019t a fan of how limited the options were - No concentrations, and no majors. Not sure how other schools do it, but that seems very limited to me.\n\nAfter talking with my dean and advisor, they aggressively advised me to continue into the MBA program immediately after graduation. I constantly got phone calls and emails from the department. When I went in later to discuss graduation, they scoffed at my plan to wait on further education and dismissed my financial concerns because \u201cthe return on your investment will open doors\u201d. After thinking about it for another week, I signed up, taking out $12K in student loans. Their reactions and advice made me feel like I would be making a mistake if I didn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m winding up my first semester, and am now planning to withdraw. The courses were painfully boring and a bit over my head, which was my first indicator that this wasn\u2019t good. I talked to several people about my growing concerns and learned that getting an MBA straight out of undergrad can actually be a detriment to career prospects by locking you out of entry-level jobs due to being overqualified on paper, but also is no help to your chances with higher-level jobs because you aren\u2019t likely to have the experience employers look for to back up the MBA. My conclusion is that this degree is for someone who has 3-5 years of experience in their field and needs the degree to move up. \n\nLooking back, I feel like it\u2019s morally wrong for my university to not tell the whole story about this degree and its place in the industry. They push students into more financial risk when the return may not exist for them. I know colleges are businesses at the end of the day, and yes, it was ultimately my choice to pursue the degree, but I feel like we should be able to place some degree of trust in academic institutions to have a bit of integrity when advising students.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Has anyone had an experience like this?\n\nTL;DR: My university pushes MBA degrees on freshly graduated students, and it seems morally wrong to me after being one of those students. What are your thoughts?",

      "text": "As a marketing professor, I wholeheartedly agree. MBAs have become a major revenue stream for colleges of business (and, therefore, universities as a whole), so they often get aggressively pushed onto students. This is terribly myopic. MBAs really don\u2019t have value until students have been out and working for a while (5 years is typical). In fact, at universities with strong reputations for MBA programs (ie, the Ivies, any of the state flagships), you aren\u2019t even considered until you have at least five years of work experience. Funneling students through straight out of undergrad does them a disservice and waters down the worth of the MBA.",

          "text": "I\u2019m glad to see agreement from a professor. It amazes me that more prestigious MBA schools don\u2019t even consider you until you have experience, and this school is the complete opposite. They even offer an integration with all of their BBAs so they can lock you into it when you\u2019re deciding your major as a freshman. Many people have said I\u2019m doing myself a disservice by withdrawing, but everything I\u2019ve seen and heard is telling me it would be a disservice to myself to complete it.",

      "text": "My interactions with admin during undergrad have led me to totally mistrust the organization. I guess that not everyone experiences this, but I have had some super crazy conversations with administrators that make student life worse because they do not put a shred of effort toward fulfilling the responsibilities of admin offices. Makes me crazy. \n\nI\u2019ll say for them to play up the positive benefits is one thing, but for them to scoff at you is crazy and I\u2019d recommend confronting those individuals and recall that moment together and then you can tell them that you found it inappropriate for them to belittle your undergrad education and to misrepresent negative emotions as a persuasion effort. It seems to have somewhat corroded the trust you had with this educational institution. Check them. Let them know.",

          "text": "I totally agree. I've had a lot of interactions with admin/faculty that have made me abandon just about all faith I had in my university. Zero concern for student welfare, and an \"I just work here\" mentality when they're the ones who are supposed to care, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nThe way the dean and advisor acted towards me was especially shocking because I was familiar with them and had relatively positive interactions with them in the past. I did call my advisor after that meeting to ask her why that meeting felt so different from others, and she didn't have anything meaningful to say about that. I've tried to warn other students about what I've found so they go into future interactions prepared.",
