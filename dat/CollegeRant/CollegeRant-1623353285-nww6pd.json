  "text": "I understand that with the pandemic and all in person classes aren\u2019t going to happen at the moment, but math online sucks. I\u2019m taking college algebra, and it\u2019s not a hard class at all. The problem is the damn cengage site is horseshit. I keep missing points because I put an extra decimal point or I add an extra space before a numbers. What inspired me to write this post is that I\u2019m currently doing a homework assignment and we are doing the quadratic formula (not a hard concept at all) but this assignment keeps throwing in equations with uppercase letters, Greek symbols, and letter subscripts and I keep losing damn points because I can\u2019t type the little damn o as a subscript exactly the way they want it. If this were in person the professor would award me the points because it\u2019s right but cengage only gives you credit if you have the exact same answer as them. I\u2019m tired of it.",

      "text": "I am taking an accelerated summer precalc class online and Im fucking drowning. The teacher has a youtube channel with really short, unorganized videos and a powerpoint that starts off with questions before it even tells you what the chapter is on. We use Wiley for assignments and it works decently and has a textbox that has symbols, super and subscripts, but it is still not perfect. I pretty sure I am going to fail because math is not something you can teach yourself. ;-; sorry you are struggling OP",
