I did the math and (obviously it's not completely accurate because I'm just using limited info), but if the amount of students that attend each pay the base tuition and fees, (whether that's from financial aid, scholarships, loans, or personal funds) then this particular small uni is getting approximately $88,000,000 a year. And don't tell me that that is going back to the professors. Of course I don't know how college budgets work, or all the details. But there's absolutely no way that they can justify this and there's money going somewhere that isn't actually benefitting the education we students are paying for...",

It's super cheap compared to buying a regular monthly pass, because it's discounted for all the university students at different schools in my area. So instead of paying $100 every month, you pay $150 for the full semester. It's amazing for those of us who transit.\n\n*BUT* it's included in everyone's fees. So for anyone who drives it's $150 every semester for the college transit pass + whatever the parking past costs that they have to purchase extra. Even if they don't use it.",
