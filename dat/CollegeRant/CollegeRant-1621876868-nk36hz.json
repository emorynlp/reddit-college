  "title:": "I\u2019m on the graduating class list for my community college, and I really don\u2019t believe I deserve this at all",
  "text": "I (22F) had a pretty rocky semester because I was taking two classes: mass media and society and environmental science. I had an easy time with my media class since my professor in it was flexible and understanding that students may have lots of things going on outside of their academic schedule. On the other hand, my environmental science professor was very much a test heavy professor which our grade in the class was based on our test grade. All of my test grades were shit, but I was still doing everything I could to try and pass my environmental science class. Unfortunately, I did wind up failing my environmental science and I felt my heart sink when I saw my final grade because I realized that everything I had planned went into shambles. After I found out that failed, my mom asked me to go to the mall, so I did just to try and keep my mind off of my failing grade. I had to walk out of a store and sit on a nearby bench. As soon as I was about to cry, I immediately swapped my glasses to my prescription sunglasses and started crying my eyes out because the fact that I failed a requirement class for my degree was starting to hurt. Fast forward to Saturday, I got my graduation box and I saw my name on the graduating class booklet, but I still feel like I don\u2019t really deserve it. Along with my graduation cap, I still felt ashamed of myself because I failed a class. How do I even deserve to have such an accomplishment when I still need to retake that one class? On the bright side, I talked to my college friend on the phone and I felt slightly better about it. If anything, I\u2019ll retake that class with a better professor in the fall and then transfer to the university I got into in the winter. I will be talking to a counselor to see where I should go from there. \n\n\ntl;dr: I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve to participate in my community college graduation because I failed one class that will be retaken with a different professor.",

      "text": "One time a professor told me, \"You don't deserve grades, you earn them\" This isn't exactly a grade but I'm trying to say it might not be how your planned it but you earned this, I can understand that you might not wanna do graduation with something left to redo though that sucks. Hey you'll redo fall and then after that it'll be in the past, don't beat yourself up, you'll be just fine.",

I know what it\u2019s like to beat yourself up over failing a course. You can bounce back and come back stronger. \n\nIt took me three tries to pass remedial college algebra at a community college before I could move on to college algebra. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Now I have a Master\u2019s degree (theoretically, I\u2019ll believe it when I get the degree in the mail \ud83d\ude02). I also had to take a statistics course for my Bachelor\u2019s and another for my Master\u2019s. \n\nYou can come back from this and be successful. I learned A LOT about student-ing trying to get through that dang class. That failure helped me be a better student down the line. Maybe looking at it from the perspective of learning from your experience will help you?",

A lot of people never get to college, and a lot of the people that do drop out in the first year, and even after those there are people who fail multiple courses throughout their program. You should be proud of yourself for getting to where you are now. If I were to hazard a guess I'd be willing to bet that the reason you're being so hard on yourself is because after all of the hard work you've put in, you're mentally exhausted. You have nothing to feel bad about, and everything to be proud for.",
