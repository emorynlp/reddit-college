  "text": "Hi, I found this subreddit a while back and I feel like it might be a good place to talk about the previous semester. I meant to post this a while back, but I forgot about it. If it matters, this is my first year at a college I transferred to after graduating from a two year college. It is long. A TLDR is available at the bottom.\n\nI came back home from my dorm close to a month ago, where I doubled with another student I didn't know before moving in with. College was on campus for most of the year save for a few days (first week of classes was remote). Typical protocols were in place like testing, masks, and social distancing, which wasn't all that bad, and I didn't get sick. I also got both rounds of the vaccine during the semester. I had lots of reasons to get the vaccines, but I believe my college will want to see my shot card before I get my room key.\n\nI guess most of the pain came from this past semester - I was told that I would have to take six classes for the next two semesters to graduate next May. I managed to find one of my classes over this summer and am working on that right now.\n\nBefore I get started, I am going to be deliberately vague about what these classes were. All classes were taught by six different professors.\n\nOf my six classes, I had three good ones. One was a subject I love so it didn't feel like work, and two more were with really good teachers. Then there were the other classes. One had a professor that was cleared to be off campus for classes. He never held lecture, just \"Hi! No lectures. This is the textbook, read Ch. 1 before next session. Email me if you need help.\" To be clear, I signed up for a physical class. I understand not being able to make it to campus, but I did not like having no lecture. The other one I blame myself on a little bit. This was an online class with a major paper assigned halfway into the semester that I had to hit the gas on a few weeks before the semester ended. It made it into the in-bin on time and I got a decent score. This was a mostly textbook class too.\n\nThen there's the last class. This class was later in the day with a topic that is not my forte. It never has been. Some things that the professor taught I found fun to learn. Notes were another thing, the professor go through the slides quite fast for certain topics. Some of the things in class were not well discussed like how to do certain tasks in a specific system. I had a D and an F on the first two tests, respectively. Part of that I can pin on myself because I didn't study well for that class' exams and not reading the text for that class as thoroughly as I should have. Some complained about the ways he wrote tests, I believe.\n\nThere was a group project that was to be done for that class, and I joined an awesome group that worked diligently to figure things out and we managed to get a rough project in. We got a great grade, even if my side was a little spotty. I went down one letter grade on that assignment for not submitting something I thought that only one person had to send in - apparently everyone had to do it. It was on the rubric, and something I did not look at extensively. I was debating sending an appeal to my professor about that, because he did not explicitly warn us about this in class. I flip-flopped on my decision after messaging my teammates about what happened, but I decided that I would probably be rejected because I didn't read the rubric carefully. Since it is after the semester, there's nothing I can do now. At the same time, I understand college is not supposed to spoon feed everything to you, but I feel like that was a petty move. But in the end, at least I passed that class with a good letter grade.\n\nThis was an exhausting semester. Not to mention, two days out of the week, I had a ten hour day (two back to back in the morning, an hour for lunch, then two classes separated by two hours). I wish I could have spread them out more (the other days during the week only had one class) but I guess that's how it is.  I feel like that is one the reasons why I feel burnt out after this semester. \n\nI found out one of my required classes was available online, and I signed up for it. This should make next semester a little easier, so five classes instead of six. \n\nTLDR: I had a less than great experience doing six classes at the same time. Several classes were especially tough, especially one professor with a teaching strategy that I did not like at all. I overall feel burnt out. I found one class online and now I should have less of a burden in the fall. I have a year of college left, and once I am done, I want a job.",
