  "text": "So I've been doing classes from home for the last two weeks due to a medical emergency. I had to have my leg amputated through the knee and my doctor wanted me at home resting and healing for six weeks. Most of my professors have been amazing and they've worked really hard to help me keep up and be successful even with the situation at hand. I have one professor though that's making my life difficult. He said he would record and send me the lectures, but he finally told me that the lectures weren't recorded and that he'd record them and send them to me. I still haven't gotten them and the test is Monday. I'm freaking out, but I'm also really scared to keep bugging him about the lectures. I'm a 4.0 student and this is kinda my worst nightmare come to life. I worry that he's going to get pissed at me for pushing him for the lectures, especially since it's like 5 hours of material, but taking the test without that information is just setting me up for failure. Anyone have any suggestions? I have all the official paperwork from the University about the absence and I've been in contact with disability services. I just don't know what more I can do.",

      "text": "Make sure to stay in touch with disability access services, get in touch with your dean, and also contact your ombudsperson (this is an office that can help resolve student issues that have gone beyond the minor day to day).\n\nAs a disabled person, and as an educator, I encourage you to honor the fact that you have survived a lot. You deserve accommodations. Additionally, once your office of disabilities approves a disability accommodation, you are also legally entitled to them. If it really does get to the point where someone sets you up for failure, you have the entire legal system of the United States on your side (assuming that's where you're located).\n\nI've had to occasionally get really tough with people (like professors and administration), but super respectful and calm, and say things like, \"I understand where you're coming from, and why you might say that. You may not realize that what you are saying is against United States law and university policy. I'm guessing you didn't mean it this way, so let's fix this together.\"\n\nGood luck, and I'm sorry you've had to face so much medical trauma this year.",

              "text": "It's really unfair that you're in that position. I understand the need to act diplomatically. In your heart, know that what you are asking is 100% valid. You can always soften things by saying something like, \"I made sure to talk with the dean so that all my professors are updated. It seemed like it was important to get everything about my situation on the official record with the university.\" This makes it sound like you're being proactive instead of targeting him. It's not a bad trick - making people feel like the solution was out of their hands, and you fixed it for them. It does get tiring though.",

I like your idea of having disability services connect your professor with someone from tech support. Ideally that professor would have done this before lectures so he doesn't have to teach them again, but your approach seems like a good plan at this point.",
