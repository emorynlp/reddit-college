  "text": "I'm currently taking a test for an anthropology class which is comprised of 5 essays. Someone explain to me why as a Computer Science major I have to spend 8 hours minimum on a pointless class to me. \n\nIf schools want to produce the best students please don't waste time on classes that don't relate to what they wanna do. My Cs class takes 2-4 hours per week while this Anthropology class takes around 15. It's a clear waste of time.\n\nMy mom said to me \"well employers want well rounded students\". I said \"Do you think the people at SpaceX care if I know about a tomb of some king I've never heard of till now, or if I can build and write software to SAFELY bring people to mars and beyond?\" \n\nThis not a knock to someone who may be studying this, but the reality is if schools want students to be the most prepared in their respected feilds, majority of their time should not be spent on non-major classes. \n\nIf it were up to me, students would take all classes that pertain to them, and if they want to go out and take other classes to find interests, then that's awesome, but don't require students to take things like gen eds. It ruins school. If you want to, take them, but don't require it then have it take up most of the kids time.\n\nSorry for the rant, i'm assuming most people here won't agree with me.",

My school had two options a test administered by the English department, or one specially selected list upper division GE classes that also included more writing to meet the graduate writing requirement .

The prompts were so weird compared to SAT essays or AP Lang and composition (got a 5) and AP euro (also a 5), or the other lower division writing classes I took. The college exam like asked me to evaluate how well my college\u2019s motto matched up with the actual teaching and stuff. Meanwhile I can write great essays on a particular speech in history or about the industrial revolution or something, but when asked about something fluffy I had not idea what to write. Ended up taking a boring corporate comma class and passed with flying colors...",

      "text": "Usually you have a selection of courses that you can take to complete gen Ed requirements. \n\nGen Eds exist for two reasons: \nFirst, (at least in the US) high schools are inconsistent; just because my high school says I am ready to go on to calc doesn\u2019t mean I have the necessary skills to actually be successful in a college level calc class. \n\nI used calc as an example, but discrepancies in students\u2019 math levels isn\u2019t nearly as inconsistent as writing. Students may have straight As in lit classes in HS without ever having read a single book, or without being able to write a coherent paragraph throughout high school. So, gen eds are kinda there to teach college kids: \u201cokay, you\u2019re not a baby anymore \u2014 this is how you are expected to perform while you are here\u201d that sorta thing. \n\nNext, as many have touched, already, is money. If you force someone to waste their time for a year\u2019s worth of credits, that\u2019s like 50k extra the school gets before you even \u201cstart\u201d anything. \n\nFor \u201cbreadth\u201d of knowledge concerns, or \u201ccritical thinking\u201d concerns\u2014 I disagree that these are actually valid reasons to force a year\u2019s worth of gen-eds. If that\u2019s the concern: give the option to have the \u201ccritical thinking\u201d or writing intensive courses topically related to the major. \n\nAnthropology and computer science don\u2019t mesh well, but poly-sci, law or philosophy \u2014 especially a course related to privacy, Ethics of AI, or net neutrality: yes. History of computing, or evolution of war-time cryptography: yes. \n\nThese are important for comp sci people to think about, and they are all about critical thinking, and they widen the student\u2019s breadth of knowledge to things outside their \u201cdirect\u201d area of study, and force them to strengthen their critical thinking skills, without being a giant waste of time and money.",

      "text": "One of the main \"points\" of college is to produce well-rounded citizens. Most colleges and universities were founded on the concept of [liberal education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_education#/search) (also called \"liberal arts education\") meaning that in addition to discipline-specific knowledge and skills, college should also provide graduates with a broad range of knowledge and transferable skills (e.g., critical and creative thinking, engaged and informed citizenship) that can only come from learning across different programs and fields. \n\nLiberal arts and the humanities help students (and thus professionals) consider the ethical and practical implications of their work, understand the context in which their work is situated, and thus create new and better things that learn from the past. It also helps people learn about historical and ongoing societal issues and recognize, for example, when harmful rhetoric is being used to spread falsehoods (\"fake news\") or propaganda, or how to address issues of structural inequality.\n\nEdit to add: no, your coworkers won't care about what you know about \"some tomb,\" but think instead about the broader lessons that course and others have provided. They help you communicate more effectively (especially with people outside your specific field/subfield) and build tools that account for (and maybe even counteract) societal issues or concerns. What ethical considerations should be addressed when helping to build SpaceX's \"Starship?\" To that end, what kinds of \"space ethics\" might be necessary to consider to ensure humanity has learned from history while morally and culturally evolving to finally \"explore the cosmos?\"\n\nA [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/08/06/why-computer-science-needs-the-humanities/?sh=89b8f27f45f2) article talks specifically about why the humanities are important to computer science (i.e., \"to understand the 'why' behind computer science\u2019s focus on the 'what.'\"). \n\n[Here](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/02/03/computer-scientist-urges-more-support-humanities-opinion), another computer scientist \"laments\" her earlier push for increased STEM participation at the expense of humanities education.\n\nThis [article](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/05/21/how-humanities-can-be-part-front-line-response-pandemic-opinion) talks about why the humanities are important even during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nFinally, this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AaronRHanlon/status/1226868631159660544?s=19) outlines the myth that STEM graduates automatically make more money, or that liberal arts/humanities majors are more likely to be un(der)employed. Bonus: this [tweet](https://twitter.com/GeogTeacherBen/status/1253331837906108417?s=19) gives a funny take on the topic.",

I\u2019m an Accounting major and I can\u2019t focus on my major classes as well as I wish I could because I\u2019m trying so hard to keep my head above water in calc. \n\nI am never, ever, ever going to be utilizing any of this shit in my career so why am I wasting time, energy, *and* money on this useless effing class? \n\nThis fucking class, man. 4 exams, 1 group project, 1 individual project, 2 quizzes a week, and 40-60 HW problems a week ON TOP OF 4HR LECTURES. \n\nI\u2019m so damn exhausted. \n\nIf they wanted us to be \u201cwell rounded\u201d they should at the very least allow us to take courses we\u2019re interested in, but nooo, we have to meet all these bullshit criteria instead.\n\nFuck it all.",

I see way to many CS people who have really poor critical thinking or reasoning skills. So they do poorly at some types of jobs that require it. I say run with it and take on board those skills.",

Case in point, I'm studying Accountancy. It's a difficult subject, and while I'm somehow maintaining an A, I'm not focusing it on it as nearly as much as I should be because I'm so busy trying not to fail Calculus (which i will never *need*) and writing weekly essays for an Art & Society class that my college insists I need to graduate. \n\nSure, Islamic Art is pretty rad, but what's even radder is having the time to be able to truly grasp the concepts I'm learning in my major classes.  \n\nIt's one thing if they gave us free reign over the non-major courses we choose. There are so many interesting classes I'd, frankly, love to take! But because the requirements are so strict and the options are so few, it's just an exhausting waste of time. Killing yourself for a class you're not remotely interested *and* has no value to you is hell.\n\nSorry for the essay!",

It definitely makes scheduling and ensuring that freshies are starting out on the right track for their major easier, but damn, that sucks.\n\nI actually started out in nursing; since they wanted us to get humanities out of the way early so that we could really hone in after, I ended up taking a few that first semester. I think my original schedule before switching out to CS for synthetic biology was actually anatphys, chem, and otherwise humanities \\[that definitely changed lmao; kept the anatphys regardless\\].\n\nWhen I asked my advisor (still hadn't been 100% certain about changing my major at the time) what she thought would be most useful for my intercultural humanities given the type of area that I grew up in, she got really pale and cut in with her conservative views like bro... it didn't need to get political, it just needed to be \"hey where do you think I'm probably most lacking given this background, so I can use this opportunity to learn and better relate to a wider variety of patients?\" Looking back, her response was so awkward like daaamn. Someone trying to get educated where they're behind so that they can perform their jobs better is not some kind of political faux pas that you need to insert your political ideas into.\n\nAdvising can be very rough. I handle most everything on my own now, and will reach out to whatever staff seems most appropriate when specific concerns or ideas come up.\n\nBut like, that really sucks for you. Hopefully now at least you'll be able to pick courses that at least fall closer to your interests for these requirements?
