  "text": "Why do teachers and parents tell you that your marks matter so much???I grew up giving so much importance to my grades only to now in college realize that none of the bullshit I put so much fucking effort in is ever gonna matter in my future.\n\nI genuinely don't understand. I mean I as an 18 year old can confidently tell a kid that he should just focus on having fun until he is in 11th grade and give 0 shit about his Mark's till 11th grade.\n\n So why did every1 tell me to care about these useless things to an extent where I had to sacrifice what I wanted. This mi8 be an exaggeration but I feel gas lighted. I distanced myself from my friends coz every1 said I shouldnt be distracted and should be focused only to now find myself lonely as hell with not a single person to talk to. I  never pursued the things I liked when I was young coz my \"so very important grades\" could be affected. This was all coz from a very young age it was engrained and carved into my brain with a knife that my grades are my future. \n\nAnd ik I could technically still do the things I like now but that's the thing I just can't now coz now ,  minor anxiety , major social anxiety , massive self hatred , extremely low self esteem has all entered the picture( which wont allow me to even get outta my house let alone go in a group to  pursue the things I love even just as a hobby) which again was induced by this society's \"concerns\" and these concerns are basically just hurtful comments on your appearance , accomplishments, personality and pretty much everything. How do I now do what I want to? How do i now get back to the life i wish i had? I dont even have many memories from my childhood coz I was busy studying\n\nI just wanna go back in time and focus on my friendships , on the things i love and to make memories. I'd even fail sometimes just for the fun of it and not give a shit. I just wish I could redo my life. I fucking hate what I am now. I feel talentless. What do I with those stupid A+ grades now?\n\nEdit : Personally, the only time my grades got me something useful was in 12th grade for college admissions. But apart from that all the time and effort I put into everything just seems useless",

Especially in competitive fields, but even in STEM where they supposedely not matter at all it is often about your grades at first.\n\nYou cannot change what happened but you can make the best of the future ahead. I also missed a lot of years due to minor neurological disorder that affected my social life. But I have come to the conclusion, that I just have to make the best of the stuff that are to come, there is no sense in overthinking the past.",

Work/life balance is very important, and college is a full time job. \n\nGrades matter much less than you've been told, unless you want to go to medical or law school, in which case they very much matter. It's more important that you study something that genuinely interests you, or you'll burnout and end up with either no degree and student debt (assuming you're American) or a degree in a field you don't give a shit about. \n\nThis is your life. Do what makes you happy. \n\n- a Millennial college professor that's sick and tired of the lies about college that keep getting repeated to today's youth.",

Changing majors is the very common thing... look up the sunk cost fallacy, as it seems to be driving your thinking about this. \n\nIn a few years you're going to be the same age, either with no degree, a degree you hate, or well on your way to a degree you will actually use. \n\nLike isn't about getting a job and making money until you die. If something isn't working for you, change it.  That said, this sounds like burnout, depression, and potentially anxiety as well. Please seek out professional help. Your university should have mental health resources for students. \n\nYou're in crisis even if it doesn't feel like you are.
