  "text": "This is more of a rant and I sorta just want reassurance that i\u2019m not the online one who feels like this. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be friends with my roommates, I don\u2019t want to introduce my roommates to my friends. I\u2019m down to like maybe get food with them or do small fairs for them like get groceries, but I don\u2019t want to be \u201cbesties\u201d with my roommates. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I hate my roommate, she\u2019s pretty chill and cool, but she\u2019s having a hard time making some friends. Something I get food with her cause she\u2019s shy and sometimes I offer to go places with her. \n\nBut she\u2019s been so insistent on me taking her to parties or introducing her to my friends and I absolutely want none of that. As well as getting to know me more and being \u201csuper close\u201d. \n\nAgain, she\u2019s a great person but I find being super close to a roommate being wierd and I can\u2019t explain why I feel that way. It\u2019s getting me really annoyed. I want to hang out with my friends and not include someone I basically live with in the same space. \n\nLike it\u2019s too much, I see you in my room, why do I have to see you every hour of the day. \n\nI think I\u2019m gonna get a single next year. Again it\u2019s not that so hate her or she\u2019s shitty or that I hate living with someone else. But I don\u2019t want to be friends with my roommate.",

Being kind, asking how her day is, talking to her about something interesting you learned in class\u2014 how hard is doing these? \n\nAnyways, your roommate will also not want to be friends with you if you don\u2019t want to be friends with her. She will instinctively understand how you feel about her and move on with her life.",
