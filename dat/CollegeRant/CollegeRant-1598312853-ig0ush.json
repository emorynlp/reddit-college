  "text": "hello all, we started school today and majority of classes are still in-person. I\u2019m just angry in advance because it will be inevitable that schools transition to all online soon, and when they do it will be because students didn\u2019t \u201cwear masks and social distance.\u201d We could do this all year and someone would still fall ill, that doesn\u2019t make it our fault I feel like. We are just being set up and locked in so our schools make fat stacks. Rant over\n\nedit: today I had 3 in person classes. In my last class, my prof openly told us that he and a group of other profs are actually betting on when school will go all remote and his guess is Sept. 18. And the 2nd prof I had for the day, there\u2019s about 16-18 of us and we are supposed to have a lab day once a week, but he told us it doesn\u2019t make sense bc in the lab only 9 people are allowed at a time so he\u2019s gonna split us up, except the class we are in regularly is the same size as the lab but all of us are in there.",

Even in my country, India, schools and colleges are about to reopen and we are currently registering 70k new cases a day. I do not think this reopening will be sustainable but they are going to do it anyway, because this is going to make them money. Utter disregard for the life of students. \nFeel sorry for ya mate, I will probably have to go back to college as well. And this same 2 week thing is going to happen here as well. We have already seen multiple news reporting about such incidents of schools opening and then closing back again due to sudden rise in infection.",
