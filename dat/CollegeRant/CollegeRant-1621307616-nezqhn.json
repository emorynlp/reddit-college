  "text": "So I\u2019ve been almost 4 years in community college. My friends from high school are all graduating university and I feel bummed about it. I\u2019ve paid for community all myself and this upcoming 2022 year I\u2019m about to receive my associates for transfer. I\u2019ve taken breaks from cc because of either bad mental health or money issues. I\u2019m proud of myself for getting through college but bummed that it\u2019s taking me longer. Anyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "Don't feel bummed look at what happened to those who transferred in 2020; they paid full tuition and stayed at home! You spent those years learning about the economy, job employment and what you wanted to do. You're fine. Just focus on a major you like and that is in demand and work towards attending university",

I was messing around, taking classes that didn\u2019t matter, ended up transferring to a university and now only one class away from graduating. It may take longer than others, but you\u2019ll get there. At least I believe you can.",

I\u2019m STILL going to school and working toward my bachelors. Instead of comparing yourself in a negative light, look at how persistent and determined you are to not give up and create more life opportunities for yourself.",

At least not from the first two years anyway. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.",

I\u2019ve been on and off with college too because off my mental illness. I\u2019m going back this fall hopefully it works out. Don\u2019t get bummed about it. We all have different paths in life. You\u2019ll get there. :)",
