  "text": "So since the pandemic started college went online for almost 2 years now and I fell out of touch w my friends in college, and basically, after a lot of drama and misunderstandings and fights later we completely stopped all forms of contact and I\u2019ll be entering my third year in a week offline at campus and I\u2019m paranoid and nervous because at this point I\u2019m not friends w anyone in my class or college and idk how to go and socialise and make new friends so late into college while everyone\u2019s already so close knit w their friends and already grouped up. Any tips? I feel so judged and vulnerable to hang out alone in college and I\u2019m dreading it.",

I even go to school with a lot people I used to know very well in high school and they won\u2019t even respond when I try to reach out.",
