  "text": "For context, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/qlc237/really_nervous_about_how_i_did_on_a_test/). \n\nI got 21 points out of 100 and I'm really embarrassed. I previously got C's on my first two stats tests so this is my first time failing. My grade is D now as well and we don't have any other graded work besides discussion posts. I'm not gonna blame my professor or anything, I'm just really sad and angry at myself. \n\nLately, I'm just struggling with my work in general. Even though I got passing grades on them, I keep getting stuff wrong on quizzes for my other classes and I got a lower grade on an essay for my English class. I used to be doing really well but now I'm really anxoius and I have no idea what to do.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Sorry if it's a mess I just want it to get it off my chest.",

They may even bend the rules in your favor. Peace and love \ud83d\udc9a",
