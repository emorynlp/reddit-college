  "text": "I am having a really hard time keeping up with everything this semester. I feel like there\u2019s not enough time in my day, no matter how early I start or how I study. I am a lecture behind my anatomy class, my neuroanatomy class I am 7 lectures behind and I have a midterm in 2 day, my psychology class I am like 4 units behind. The only class that I\u2019m not behind on is organic chemistry but I probably just failed the exam because I didn\u2019t study enough despite thinking I knew it. It seems I am also playing catch between anatomy and organic, and I am neglecting my other 2 classes. I am overwhelmed.",

      "text": "I switched to a different major and being in college during this pandemic, my concentration, motivation, and drive to succeed have basically dwindled. Some professors need to realize that this is a horrible time for everyone, both academically but also financially for many. Fortunately I\u2019m not in a bad financial situation, but many are, like many students at my university are having a difficult time finding ways to fund their education. \n\nIt also sucks because doing any schoolwork at home doesn\u2019t feel like working for many people including myself, it\u2019s like a mixture of an eternal siesta and a fever dream. It\u2019s difficult to follow lectures and stay motivated, and it\u2019s also difficult for me to do all of the practice problems they throw when I have 4-5 other classes to worry about. Like I\u2019m already overwhelmed enough, lol.",

Even though I have a dedicated space, I constantly feel like I\u2019m being lazy when I\u2019m at home and NOT doing things, but also don\u2019t feel motivated when I am supposed to.
