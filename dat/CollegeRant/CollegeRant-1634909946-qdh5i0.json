      "text": "I sort of feel the same way. I\u2019m going to share my experience. I\u2019m a history major. I had the worst approach to studying for my exams. I haven\u2019t gotten them back yet. however I think I failed one and barely passed the other. If I do poorly I\u2019m going to talk with them in office hours to ask why so I can figure out a better approach to my next exam. \n\nCollege is hard. Don\u2019t blame yourself. You may have as well had a bad approach. Ask a TA or prof about what you could have done better and go from there. Ask upper years about the course (almost schools have a Reddit page), check to see if you have access to free tutors, check rate my prof (sometimes former students give tips on how tests or quizzes are formatted). Lastly, don\u2019t fix your intelligence with your marks. If you have the mentality of you \u201cwill never get anywhere\u201d that will become true. You are meant to learn in college so use the resources given to you by your school and adapt to do better next time. Don\u2019t fret over a small quiz mark. I\u2019m sure you are a smart person. \n\nHere are some study tips I found helpful: \nTextbook reading https://youtu.be/nqYmmZKY4sA\nHow to study: \nFull lecture: https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0\nSummarized lecture: https://youtu.be/23Xqu0jXlfs",

Last week someone called me smart and I didn\u2019t know how to take it.  \n\nAlso maybe find someone to talk to when you do poorly/ feel inadequate in college. Upper years are great for this if your a freshman or sophomore. \n\nI hope you do better for the remainder of your term/semester! Good Luck!",
