  "text": "College is already stressful as it is when your trying to figure out what\u2019s your purpose and what are you gonna do for the rest of your life to survive. But if you have problems socially like all of a sudden you don\u2019t have any social skills, then it\u2019s gonna be hell for you. Like I was decent in high school when it came to social interaction (not the best but it was good enough to have friends at the time) but now none of those skills exist.",

      "text": "It does suck & I hate to say this, but it is harder in the work world. My only advice is to join clubs (and you may need to join several/quit them/join more) until you find your tribe. I joined a movie club (it requires less time than a book club); we\u2019d meet once or twice a month to watch a movie then go out for burgers after. I don\u2019t keep up with any of those people any more but it was something to look forward to for me & I saw some movies I never would have seen on my own.",

              "text": "I joined a couple I thought I was gonna love & I  didn\u2019t; too sorority for me. Luckily my dad told me to keep trying. His exact quote was \u201cit\u2019s not you, they\u2019re just bitches.\u201d The film group actually had only one other college student the rest were older. I went to school in a large city, so there were a lot to choose from - but it was still uncomfortable...until it wasn\u2019t. \n\nThat saying about fake it until you make it applies here. Also, look for things outside of your college major. One group I liked a lot but couldn\u2019t afford the trips was a bird watching group. They traveled out of state & I just couldn\u2019t. Another one I thought about, was urban hiking.",

      "text": "Same, it sucks. After having tons of friends and being like universally liked, an athlete and all that in high school I kinda just expected that to come to me in college. Now with my final semester of school coming up it still doesn\u2019t feel like I belong and I have the friends I need, where I\u2019m supposed to be y\u2019know. I think the secret is that everybody has that dilemma in one way or another, the more people I talk to the more it seems like what I have is the mean of the modern day college experience, lots of people who look like they\u2019re thriving are floundering like this and figuring out how to alleviate it as best as possible is the answer.",
