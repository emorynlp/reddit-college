  "text": "Was very into the idea of doing biology since I like plants and animals, but I still\ndon\u2019t know what I would want to do with it or even pursue higher education.  Plus, my counselor said that I probably won\u2019t transfer within two years because I have a lot of math classes to catch up on (math is also not my strong  suit).\n\nThe one career I\u2019m actually interested in having is art and video media, but the field is incredibly competitive and jobs are way harder to find compared to like STEM fields. Even I struggle in art classes at times because I like to make art at my own pace and not at a deadline. Not to mention that there\u2019s countless of art resources online that I can look at instead of attending an actual class.\n\nOkay rant over. If it sounds like I\u2019m being overly pessimistic is because I am. I\u2019ve thought of having so many different careers since middle/high school and none of them stuck to me. I also come from an immigrant family so everyone expects me to go to college right after high school, graduate exactly within four years, and get a good, high-paying job. It\u2019s making me feel really pressured  because of it.",
