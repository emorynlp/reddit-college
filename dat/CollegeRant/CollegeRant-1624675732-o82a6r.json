  "title:": "Need Advice - and Genuinely Concerned About Incoming Students",
  "text": "I go to a small private liberal arts college in Ohio - and I am so concerned about my incoming classmates, and want to do everything I can to warn them about how terrible my college is. I have gotten sick from this instituion, harassed and followed home from surronding areas, left with no access to food, and I cant just watch more students be put through what I was out of apathy and not speaking up. So much has happened ti myself and others at this college out of pure negligence, I don't even know where to begin.\n\nMyself and some other students want to create a lengthy post/PDF about our experiences and back it up with the information we can link to online - but my college has a very vindictive and political admin that would definitely continue to make my life hell. I want to go to grad school, but it feels selfish to compromise helping others with my own academic journey, since I could see my institution sabotgging my applications (as they did with my transfer ones). \n\nHow do I publicly drop this information somewhere I can link to without hurting the academic careers of myself or others?",

          "text": "Not really without revealing more personal details and getting myself in trouble - to vaguely elaborate as much as possible, it's well documented with my institution, and something a lot of other students have experienced. We are surrounded by sundown towns, so being harassed/followed home or even stalked is common. They are well aware and our security services won't respond to calls about stalking or take down license plates because they have connections with the local police department that isn't fond of our school. Food insecurity is also rampant - our dining services do not provide meals consistently and without personal transportation, you are basically stranded because we're in a rural area. \n\nI have personally tried to mediate this with programming and reaching out to donors, we have some great staff that care but our actual admin just ignores it.\n\nAs for getting sick, our college evades updating our ages-old dorms by claiming that they're 'historical' but many of our campus housing units have differing kinds of mold. I got sick from being placed into a dorm with no AC or hot water. There was mold in the carpets that made it hard to breathe as it got hotter, so I didn't sleep and couldn't breathe. I let my college know about this because I am also responsible for the students within my area of that space, and they said they couldn't do anything. Most of the said residents moved away but I contractually had to stay in that space, I am still dealing with the impacts on my lungs and sleep today. \n\nI keep trying to effect change at this college and reach out for help or ask for advice, but I get talked down to and brushed off because I can hardly elaborate on how bad it really is in anon spaces. Those are just the details I can kind of share without revealing too much, it gets much worse, but my school will retaliate.",

If you do, you would want to go to the nearest large city newspaper or news station.  You also might have some success if you contact the accreditation agency or the state health agency.  Good luck!",

          "text": "haha not a manifesto, you can see the other comment I left for further details, I don't know if I can in good conscience watch other students ask for help and get boldface lied to. I work for this institution and have answered mental health calls so bad that I had to go back to therapy because staff dealt with it so poorly. Our rate of suicide is insane, the conditions are unlivable, I am on my way to a better institution (which they tried to sabotage) but it feels wrong to watch other students get physically ill or watch their mental health decline because of the dorms. It is a shittier fact of life, the file sharing service sounds good - I just want to make sure I am protecting my co-writers more than anything.",

If you can do so safely I say expose what's going on behind the scenes so people can see what's being covered up. You're a good person for caring like this.",

We just had a lot of our staff quit as well, they receive similar treatment which makes all of our services on campus incredibly poor, overall worsening the situation.",
