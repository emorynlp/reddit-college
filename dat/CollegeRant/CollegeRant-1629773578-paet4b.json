  "text": "Ok so right now most of my community college classes are online and we have this thing where first 2 years are free as long as you take Gen Ed classes, and one of these are math. \n\nI already struggle with math, but I found out we had to pay $80 to take the actual class to access a website to turn in homework,  take quizzes, etc. This just makes me mad honestly because most of our classes are online anyways and they\u2019re not charging anything for using canvas, but my math class is. Just makes me mad I have to pay this much just to turn in some work.",
