  "title:": "This is fucking hard",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first semester freshman and all I have to say is this is really fucking hard. It\u2019s not even the classes- this adjustment to the culture and lifestyle of forward thinking is so hard and I feel so stupid and socially behind. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life right now. I didn\u2019t think being a first gen student was gonna mean much- but MAN, it is HARD. I didn\u2019t realize how much of an impact it has on my work ethic, the sacrifices, the surplus income and therefore social activities, and even choice of major/job prospects. I\u2019m doing my best to keep myself optimistic, but I\u2019ve never cried so much in such a short period of time. It\u2019s so hard to not call my parents and talk about how shitty i feel and how confused I am because they have never gotten this opportunity. So my heart goes out to all the first gen kids out there. We are surviving this life. This is hard, but this too shall pass.",
