  "title:": "nothing that a friendless, addicted loser like me could do in college in the first place",
  "text": "for someone with a mind like mine, it's just being given impossible task after impossible task over and over again. this is the lamest, most meaningless torture. I have zero work ethic and zero motivation when I feel that things are overwhelming, useless, or unfair. and no one cares, it's just me in misery alone, because why should it be otherwise. I can't even die or talk to anyone or be a regular human - I tell myself to spend just 2 seconds, 2 seconds running my eyes over the things or contemplating how to fix things. I can't do even that. this is so, so completely, utterly lame. it doesn't matter how much I wish I could know more things or even just die. even though I'd hate it, I wish someone would come kill me already.",
