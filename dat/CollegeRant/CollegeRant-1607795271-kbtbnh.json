  "text": "Just wanted to say that for those who might feel like they were the only ones struggling. Before it\u2019s asked, this WAS my first semester of senior year. I took on a part time job to cover my bills, and all of my classes were writing-heavy. Missed the withdrawal deadline due to work and so I have to stick with these classes. I\u2019ve never performed like this before, but asking to suddenly adjust to distanced learning, and see my bedroom and desk (which are often seen as a place to relax) as my new classroom wasn\u2019t going to magically happen. \n\nEven better, I was teaching myself this semester. I\u2019d be fine if I was actually able to go to the library or anywhere outside the house to actually focus, but I could never get into the subjects. It didn\u2019t help that the only contact I got from all my professors but ONE was a weekly email with all the readings, assignments and PowerPoints to look at and do. More ironic, these are COMMUNICATION classes, and this is the worst communication I\u2019ve seen. But yes, let the university pat itself on the back for its fantastic job as they sit in the county with the highest amount of COVID cases in the state. \n\nI got a single D in my freshman year from an entry level class that tanked my GPA, and just last semester I got it back up to what is was before then, but all that progress is gonna go away in an instant due to this semester. I\u2019ve already accepted it, really just said fuck it because I\u2019m paying the same amount of money I do every fucking year just to teach myself and fail out lol. I\u2019d rather just work if it means not dealing with this bullshit.\n\ntl;dr couldn\u2019t focus on courses due to the incredible lack of engagement and having to teach myself. Failing every class as a result, have little motivation to continue even in my senior year because the grading system is an absolute joke and it shows this year.",
