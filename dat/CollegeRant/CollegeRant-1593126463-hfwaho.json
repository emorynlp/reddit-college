  "title:": "College feels like a scam even for STEM majors",
  "text": "Exactly like the title says. I'm majoring in mechanical engineering, but I'm doing it because I'm decent at it and I like it for the most part. I don't care what people major in, even if it leads to a lower paying career. I just think that there's going to be an oversaturated market for STEM majors (if there isn't one already). Every counselor that pleads students to major in STEM is touting a scam.\n\nI'm sick of everyone bragging about how much better STEM supposedly is compared to humanities, pedagogy, etc. STEM majors still have crippling debt. STEM majors also don't earn as much as you think they do, especially when you factor in the cost of living. STEM majors still have to learn too much useless bullshit and pay top dollar for it. Job prospects aren't that much better, and there's the whole catch-22 of \"getting experience in order to get a job\" that hasn't been resolved. And once they do get jobs, all of the corporate bullshit that exists for non-STEM jobs is still present.\n\nJust major in whatever you want and treat it like an investment in yourself. Don't do it if you're not ok with the debt. Do it because you're interested in what you're learning and you don't care how much you make after graduating. Find some other way to make money, preferably using your degree. Even non-STEM majors can still make a lot of money if they market themselves right.\n\nOk, rant over, have a great day everyone!",

      "text": "I completely disagree with most of your post. STEM majors are essentially the only majors that are worth the cost of college. I agree that there's a bunch of useless shit that comes with getting the degree (trust me, as a computer science major I know my fair share of useless theory classes). But starting salaries for STEM majors are higher than any other field, especially compared to the humanities and liberal arts. STEM majors also have the lowest unemployment rates compared to other majors.\n\nI get your frustrations because I sometimes feel them myself but you need to realize that any field is saturated with new grads. The difference is that people, such as engineers, struggle to get the first job sometimes but they eventually do after some networking, resume building, and interview prep. People that major in humanities or arts do not have clear careers that they qualify for, so it is exceedingly difficult for them to start a career related to their major since it's broad. For example, someone with a nursing degree will be a nurse, someone with a mechanical engineering degree will be a mechanical engineer. Someone that majored in humanities has no clear next step other than grad school and even after that it's a little murky.\n\nThere are hurdles to jump through but even with all those annoyances, STEM is the clear winner when it comes to salary, job growth, and low unemployment. I know college sucks (I hate it too) but unfortunately, it's the most accepted path by employers so we need to push through.",
