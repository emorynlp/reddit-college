  "text": "im failing a course required for my major and decided not to withdraw because that\u2019d be a W on my transcript and I\u2019d just have to retake it anyways\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to explain to everyone (my mom, my friends, and my advisors) that I don\u2019t know anything for the class and they just don\u2019t believe me. You could ask me a question about the subject and I\u2019d look at you with the same confusion as someone who\u2019s never walked in the door but they keep telling me \u201cjust try to get a passing grade\u201d \u201cyou know this you just aren\u2019t trying hard enough\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point in hacking the system and getting a perfect final when I don\u2019t actually know anything and will end up in a higher level class where I still don\u2019t know anything?\n\nDo you realize how demotivating and how much it beats down on someone to repeatedly go to a class and sit there and know nothing while everyone else understands?\n\nIt\u2019s like running a marathon where you know everyone else is about to cross the finish line but you\u2019re still at start and no one will let you throw in the towel. At first it\u2019s nice and kinda sweet but past a certain point it\u2019s almost sadistic to force a mangled animal to drag on when you could just put it down",

You can always retake the class later with a different professor or with a tutor and you'll likely feel better about it then. \n\nIf it's too late to W I agree with the other comment. You can contact the prof if you're having trouble, go to office hours, look up tutorials online, go to tutoring, ask anyone for help really. If you can at least pass you won't have to retake it.",

      "text": "I believe that you're confused and struggling in your classes. I also believe, however, that it doesn't have to stay that way. Check out your school's resources. There should be a student success center, a tutoring center, and a study group or two. If for some ridiculous reason none of those options are available, try watching (credible) youtube videos. If all else fails, reach out to your instructor(s) and see if they can give you some extra help.",

I am the same way and it really does suck because when you\u2019re Asian, if you\u2019re not a genius.. you\u2019re a disgrace and let me tell you first hand, I have been a disgrace.
