  "text": "As the title says I accidentally deleted all the citations I had for the research paper that I am writing. I had initially written a part of it on Word and then decided to use Google docs. I ended up not copying the citations (by mistake). I lost all the data on my laptop the next day. \n\nI am trying to find all the articles I used using the history tab. I don't know how successful it will be. Does anyone know what would happen if I somehow end up missing a few references?",
