  "text": "Holy fuck they are toxic. The social clubs I\u2019m involved in are cultural social clubs, but the people are horrible. Gossiping, ostracism, it\u2019s all packed in there. \n\nI became the black sheep of my community after I opened up about my mental health struggles. Ever since then, my relationship with my own community hasn\u2019t been the same. Fuck them. I quit.\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m a person of color in a predominantly white college, so I\u2019m in a very awkward situation. As a freshman, I was able to lean on my community, but once it was known that I\u2019m damaged goods, most of my friendships went up in flames. I wish I never opened up about my mental health. I barely have anyone. I\u2019m alone, once again.",
