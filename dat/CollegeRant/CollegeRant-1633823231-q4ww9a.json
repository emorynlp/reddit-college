  "text": "Sometimes I\u2019m just walking around or in class and I catch the same like, 3 people looking at me. Sometimes i catch other people I barely know staring at me. I get I should say hi or whatever, and if I know them a bit I try to, but like, why tf are you staring at me for? Am I really that ugly? I\u2019m sorry my face looks like shit or deformed to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s alright to stare at me. Sometimes it just makes me anxious, and makes me want to run to my dorm and hide or something. I just want to be like, not looked at, or to blend in a lot more. I feel like they\u2019re laughing at me, but I can\u2019t name one thing that I did to them, and it honestly just really bothers me. Like please, just let me live. What did I ever do?",

I used to feel the same when my anxiety was really bad. It got better with time and therapy. But don't worry love, I can guarantee you that these people are not judging you.",

Most peoples brains are so busy though, they might not even realize they\u2019re staring! I do that all the time, I zone out and then I\u2019m just staring at someone. Also, if people really are laughing at you (although I don\u2019t think they are), they\u2019re small minded and insecure themselves. Confident, happy, secure people don\u2019t laugh at others in a mean way.",

      "text": "I know this doesn't help bc, like the comment above said, this sounds like social anxiety. I struggle w/ it too on a lesser extent but I just try to remind myself that people that aren't my friends generally won't think about me that much. It's called the spotlight effect. In a more blunt way, people don't care about you as much as they think you do. They're probably thinking about an upcoming test, their S.O, the next episode of squid games or whatever. \n\nAlso, I have ADHD so I stare around A LOT. I turn my head at every noise and sometimes find myself staring at someone. Some people just glance around and observe a lot more than usual. I don't usually judge people I just think \"Oh that person has on a cool shirt... okay back to that show I was watching...\"",

              "text": "That's what makes social anxiety, and especially if it's a chronic disorder, so hard. Logic can't really defeat it. I will always have OCD (leads to a lot of social anxiety for me) and ADHD. It might become subclinical and not affect me as much during certain times but certain things may trigger it. This is where I have to refer to what my therapist, research, etc. has taught me off how to overcome it. \n\nOne thing I sometimes do on rough days is try to do a \"this is the one thing I'll do to overcome it until I have more energy/tomorrow whichever comes first.\" I'll not let social anxiety change a decision, I'll not do a compulsion of my OCD, I won't take an hour break after 5 minutes of studying, etc. and then I'll let them take over. But then I try so hard to make sure I never do this again. I might take a 55 minute break after 5 minutes of studying but it won't be an hour. Slowly improve day by day and week by week. Social anxiety, even if it's not a disorder, is not something overcome in one day. It takes baby steps. It's hard for me to do it to bc somedays I really do just feel like crap but give yourself grace, patience, mercy, and love. Sometimes I really do just have to try to look at myself from an outside perspective. What would I do if I was my friend? Would I allow myself to live in a messy room or would I clean up one section at a time over a week? Would I say I'm the worst student in the world? No. \nNot sure how much of this applies to you bc my lovely brain has a mix of ADHD and OCD (w/ social anxiety) but, good luck, OP. It's hard and the work will unfortunately most likely extend past college but it'll be worth it.",

The vast majority of people don\u2019t care what other people look or dress like unless you really stick out in some way, and even then, they will have a range of thoughts about that. I\u2019ve found myself looking at people because I like the pattern on their shirt, the colour of their hair/eyes/skin, the frames on their glasses \u2026. It really doesn\u2019t mean anything. This sounds like a case of your own brain/thoughts tormenting you, which is something that you can address and work on. See if you can get cognitive behavioural therapy to work on your distressing thoughts.",
