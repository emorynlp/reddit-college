  "text": "So I just started my freshman year this semester, and as everyone knows, I left home missing my parents. Now I\u2019m back for thanksgiving, and all I want to do is avoid them. For one, all my dad wants to do is criticize me for joining a fraternity or all other manner of stupid shit and my mom is here just treating me like a child (I\u2019m 20, goddammit). \n\nPoint here is that we all just got in an argument over some stupid shit with that happened with my roommates and now my dad is threatening to force me to drop my fraternity and/or not pay my tuition. I\u2019m sick of this shit and really want them less involved in my life at this point. What do I do?",

Its a really awkward transition because you\u2019re supposed to be making bigger decisions and becoming your own person but at the same time your parents believe they know whats best for you and for most kids are gonna be the ones financially supporting the whole thing. They\u2019re panicking because they\u2019ve spent 18 years of their lives raising you and now you\u2019re leaving off into the world. It gets better man",

I want to start off with 3 reasons why I joined: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ . Can you please list what makes you instinctively dislike it?\"\n\nA good reason for you to cite here - only if historically backed up is \"I was having a really hard time making friends and the social life is built in at a frat\" or \"A lot of my friends were joining and I thought about how lonely I would feel if they all joined and I didn't. I'd feel kind of left behind.\" and if your dad gives you shit for having feelings you can hit him with the \"I'm just trying to be real with you. You can't hate me for fearing being alone. that's a human thing.\" and walk off - potentially a really cutting line \n\nThis is a powerful opportunity to display how you are mature to your dad. He seems very stubborn about his judgements. If you take the high road here and lead by example, then your dad might see you more as your own person who is developing a strong character.\n\nGen X moms will always coddle. No advice for that.",

There are plenty of things parents should not ever hear about.\n\nAnd sorry OP, of course I don't know the details so what I'm saying may be irrelevant.",

A lot of people's parents aren't going to accept their kids' feedback or go to therapy and work out their judgement/communication issues. They just don't have the capacity for self-improvement. I have repeatedly, over years, asked one of my parents to stop talking to me about grades because I get decent to good grades and I am stressed and self-loathing enough about it. My parent will not stop asking. It's like an obsession or a habit. So instead of constantly asking my parent to change, I just lie. I say my homework is done when it is not, I say I have a handle on things when I don't. I conceal how much I hate one of my classes right now. It is my parent's fault for having a stubborn expectation for grades that I can't live up to. That is a crushing thought. I avoid getting crushed by getting out of the conversation as soon as possible. That means lying. \n\nDo I wish things were different? Of course. Do I think that I am doing the best I can to walk the line between having a relationship with my parent and not feeling inadequacy or shame about my existence? Yes.\n\nAlso, trust is only broken if you get caught lying. \n\nThis guy's problem about the frat is there are dues he needs to pay, so he probably cannot lie about it and get away with it.",

It was my first semester and exam and I was actually sick during the time near the exam.\n\nWhen I told my mom not only did she get mad but somehow our relationship kinda soured from there. She spent most of the summer working overtime at her job to pay for my tuition so she felt that I was wasting her money and effort or not being serious about school.\n\nFrom there, I felt that my mom was often angry and bitter towards me and I never really wanted to be in the same room with her. She even threatened to not pay for my tuition. I spent several hours each day studying and receiving tutoring and eventually earned a fragile B. Half the class either failed or barely passed with a C. Then a couple students who were close with the professor got an A. I never cried over a class so much. From then now on I was never honest with my grades and I work several hours a week to pay for college so my parents wouldn't use tuition as a leverage against me. I always tell my parents I have an A no matter what grade I earn. I don't feel guilty. If they aren't approachable or calm enough to handle I cannot be a perfect student then they don't deserve my honesty. I hated the fact that my mom told me to get a 4.0 because it put a lot of pressure on a teenager who was about to start college. Its not high school where I can make up with a weighted honors or AP class. Once I get a B that's it.",

It's like not reprimanding your kid for drinking so that you actually have an idea of how much they're drinking. Then create a situation where you emphasize affiliation and autonomy and then guide the kid to make better choices on their own. It should be on the parents to hide their disapproval n do all that legwork. On the other hand, with the state of the world rn I'd say there's a good argument to experientially teach your kid how to sneak around and effectively lie as it would likely help them spot manipulators later in life. :P",
