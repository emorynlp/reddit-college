  "text": "Sorry if this is a little dark. I\u2019m too worried to tell anyone I know but felt like I was going to explode if I didn\u2019t put this out somewhere.\n\n\nWarning: mentions of self injury\n\n\nI wish burnout was a more recognized thing in college. It\u2019s so terrible. It\u2019s like trying to floor a busted up car which damages it even more. I can\u2019t believe I was actually enjoying myself in the middle of the semester. Now, it\u2019s getting harder to get out of bed every morning, even on weekends that I specifically set aside for assignments I\u2019ll lay in bed wasting four or five hours and not starting until the afternoon. And I\u2019m battling more intrusive thoughts that are affecting my schoolwork. I really cared about my work before, now I\u2019m just making it look done and handing it in. As long as I make at least a C I don\u2019t care. I just want my classes to be over. My mother wanted me to focus on meeting other people than my grades this semester but I\u2019m so addicted to seeing my high GPA and good grades stacking up that those are the only things I truly care about in school. Opportunities to get another A will always take priority no matter how much it hurts me, like an addiction. I hate it so much but I can\u2019t stop.\n\n\nAnd my professor noticed I was having a difficult time comprehending the shading of a subject for a drawing. It\u2019s difficult to focus on drawing when you\u2019re burned out and so tired you are having a tough time keeping your eyes straight ahead and trying to ignore intrusive thoughts related to self harm at the same time. On top of that, I have a mental condition that affects my processing and focus, and I overestimated myself and was too stupid and optimistic to get accommodations at the beginning of the semester. Because \u201cit will be different this time\u201d and \u201cin the professional world you either git gud or get broke\u201d. I\u2019m five semesters in and still don\u2019t know better.\n\n\nI\u2019m just so, so tired, I\u2019m torn between just wanting the semester to end and wanting it to last longer for the sake of the assignments I\u2019m behind on. I\u2019m so tired, the few only ways to keep me awake while working on assignments is scratching my arm or the pain from leaving a small bag of ice on my leg. The mental fog is so thick I can barely see my hands in front of me. I\u2019m so upset that I can\u2019t work at the steady pace as everyone else and I might not be able to meet the demands of my professors. The dark part of me hopes that sometime this week I\u2019ll end up with a minor, but painful injury that will give me a good excuse for why I\u2019ve been the way I\u2019ve been lately, and hopefully get me assignment extensions.\n\n\nTLDR: burnout and being addicted to grades is absolutely horrible and is killing me inside.",
