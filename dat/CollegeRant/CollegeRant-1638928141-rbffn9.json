  "text": "I\u2019m kinda freaking out. I\u2019m at community college, already filled out transfer apps and I\u2019m in a program that guarantees my acceptance into the school that I really like, as long as I maintain over a 3.4 GPA. Im at a 3.63 currently and calculated all the required grades I\u2019d need to keep above a 3.4. Basically it comes down to these 3 finals, and of course all 3 opened today and are due tonight. I can keep the GPA requirement as long as I have a C or better in Calc, and a B or better in both Econ and Bio. I have a 78% in calc, and the final rn makes up 20% of my overall grade. If I did the math right I\u2019m pretty sure I just need to get 31/80 on the final, which shouldn\u2019t be that bad but I don\u2019t know. In econ I have 89.57% and so I\u2019m hoping even if I bomb the final, that I\u2019ll be all good. Then Bio I should be fine in. Also the reason I didn\u2019t do the finals earlier today was because I\u2019ve been working on homework\u2019s + 2 essays for my other classes (art history and English). Rant over, wish me luck",
