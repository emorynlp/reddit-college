  "text": "\nI\u2019m always more than happy to help people with questions especially because I know the favour could be returned if I ever needed help but it kinda irks me when people just straight up want me to send all my answers to them on something like a problem sheet that could have took me 4 hours. I kinda know this guy who is really nice except when it comes to this. I know he hasn\u2019t attempted the questions, says he is finding it difficult and asks for my answers. We are on different class schedules so my work is due later than his and he will message more than once asking when I\u2019ll be finished and if I\u2019m done yet. Once I sent him some of my work that goes toward my final grade that took me 6 hours because I offered him help with a question he was finding hard and he said just send it all over and I felt bad. Which means he spent 30 mins doing it. He\u2019s pretty chill and I want to be friends with him because we get on really well otherwise I just don\u2019t want to be used.\n\nPs sorry for it being all over the place was a bit of a rant",
