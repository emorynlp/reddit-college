If the parents outright paid for the student\u2019s tuition, I think you would say they have a right to see their grades, yes? If that\u2019s true, what makes it fundamentally different to say \u201cI\u2019ll pay for your rent, utilities, insurance, phone bill, food, but just not your tuition per se.\u201d What does it matter whether the money is going directly toward tuition or toward other things? \n\nIf the student can support themselves financially without the parent\u2019s help, then I 100% agree that they have zero obligation to show their parents their grades. But if the parents are financially supplementing the student\u2019s livelihood to the extent that the student would not be able to continue school without their help, then the parents have the right to know your grades if they ask.",

The law governing parents\u2019 access to their children\u2019s educational records is [FERPA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act). Under this law, the parents need written consent from their child if they are over 18 to view their grades, regardless of financial support given. OP has no legal obligation to share this information with them. \n\nI would also argue that they are not morally obligated to share this information. Will refusing create difficulties in their relationship? Probably, and it might cause them to withdraw support. So you\u2019re right that the real question is whether OP can deal with that or not. \n\nI was financially supported by my family through college and beyond. I had a part time job throughout college but it was only enough to have a little extra spending money. But my family never once asked to have access to my grades or online school account. This is really invasive and controlling behavior from the parents IMO. OP already tells them their grades when they ask, but for some reason there is a lack of trust there. Clearly OP is doing well in school, so it wouldn\u2019t appear there is a reason for the parents to be distrustful. So it comes across as overbearing.",

I would personally show them my grades regardless of how wrong they are (or even how illegal their actions are in this case) \u2013 it's a tradeoff. \n\nUnless OP can refuse to show their grades to their parents while also staying in their home, it wouldn't be worth it to be rebellious if it meant getting kicked out onto the streets. What would you do and why?",
