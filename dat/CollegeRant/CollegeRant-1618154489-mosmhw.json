  "text": "Throughout high school, teachers and counselors were always like \u201cthere\u2019s a scholarship for everyone\u201d but it\u2019s actually a lot harder than that. I had a teacher tell me that you can get a scholarship just for being left handed, and it IS a thing, but you only qualify if you live in Texas. It\u2019s so frustrating trying to find scholarships because just when you think you have all the qualifications checked off there\u2019s always that one last oddly specific qualification that messes it all up.",

Since I was a kid who couldn\u2019t sit still and didn\u2019t get the best grades these activities were perfect for me!
