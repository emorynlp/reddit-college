  "text": "i am about to obtain my second associate\u2019s degree with a trail of certifications before moving on to my bachelor\u2019s. i have two professors this semester who are primarily using learning software, namely norton\u2019s inquizitive and pearson\u2019s mymathlab. these programs are built for children, and poorly! they mark you wrong on correct answers, gives wrong page numbers to \u2018study\u2019 when you get the question wrong (despite it actually being correct) because the system is moronic, takes far too much time, uses outdated crap like flash player, and the list goes on. i\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end and i\u2019m just over halfway through the semester. \n\nnever mind the fact that you can cheat your way through the entire software (in both cases) and not learn a gd thing the entire semester. *especially when it marks you **falsely** incorrect*. how am i supposed to learn anything when the answer the book gave me is being marked wrong by a ridiculously idiotic program *that\u2019s made for the book*?!\n\nthe way i see it, this is lazy teaching. *and that\u2019s coming from a teacher*. if you\u2019re a college professor who primarily and regularly assigns your adult students learning software, rather than taking the time to teach the subject material yourself, perhaps it\u2019s time to find another career. \n\ni have four other classes where not only do the professors teach their subject matter in its entirety, without the help of learning software, but two of those classes don\u2019t even require a textbook because the professors create all their own materials. \n\ni\u2019m not paying thousands of dollars a semester to be given software and teach myself. ***do your damn jobs, professors!!!***\n\n\nTL;DR: i fucking hate learning software and the poor work ethic of professors who utilize it.",

      "text": "I hate how they are tied to your grade and these systems are just busy work, doesn't really teach me anything, and barely functions. I had to use one of Cengage's programs for my college algebra homework (the name escapes me, I apologize) and it didn't even work half the time and it when you got a question wrong, it wouldn't bother to teach you why you got it wrong. You could get the answer right, but because the answer wasn't in the format the program recognized, that question was wrong.\n\nSome are alright, but have irritating downsides. Cengage's Mindtap simulations for some of my Microsoft Server classes have been an amazing help for learning, but holy shit is it slow. You're fucked if your internet goes out in the middle of it or if it's an issue on their end that disrupts your work because it makes you start over.\n\nWhat I'm not a fan of is now that tools for remote learning are getting more and more available and a lot of classes that could be taken in person are now only available as an online course (this was also the case before the pandemic). I love tech and even going for a major in the industry because I have a passion for it, but I'm not a fan of remote learning. I choose face-to-face meetings on campus anytime over trying to learn from home on some shotty software.",

Honestly, it is usually 6 videos with about an hour and some change of content. Very easy to watch a video, then watch a YouTube video, and swap back and forth. (It is very boring material, so can't focus long however well she teaches, which is pretty great)\n\nHowever, when you get told to buy a Pearson subscription and they upload a five minute video going over what to read and some links to resources, I want to scream. That is not worth the money. I could have done that and taken a test to place higher in math when entering the college. That is penalizing people for staying at the university to learn. Ridiculous.",

I used to love class when it was in person because I was learning something, now it's hours of hell all wrapped up into my laptop.",

          "text": "online classes can be amazing when taught by professors who actually care to devote the work necessary to make a *good* online course. i only went on campus for maaaaaybe three classes for my second associate\u2019s degree; i feel i learn more when not bogged down by a classroom full of students who don\u2019t listen to the professor and ask questions that have already been answered, thus making a large portion of class time useless to anyone who was actually paying attention. these two professors that i mentioned here just sit back and let the programs do the teaching. my math teacher has not given us a single piece of material from herself, it\u2019s all website links and lectures from a professor at a university across the country. i can\u2019t stand that shit. i don\u2019t get why i can\u2019t use materials from other students because that\u2019s \u201cplagiarism\u201d even if i cite it properly, when professors can devise an entire course based off of someone else\u2019s materials with no consequence.\n\nedit to add: the limitless programs and stolen materials from other professors turn a 1.5 hour, twice a week on-campus session into a 20 hour a week online course.",

Just because we can work a smart phone doesn't mean we can magically teach ourselves higher level mathematics on our own. Plagiarism rules can be ridiculous at times. I had a professor tell me that I plagiarized because I wrote about the same idea in a paper that inspired me in my own words.",
