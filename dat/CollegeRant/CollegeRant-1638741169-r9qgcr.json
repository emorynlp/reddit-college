  "text": "I am finally finishing up my associates and beginning my bachelor's in spring. I took two last prerequisites and two electives to get my 60 credit hours and despite it being incredibly tedious I currently have all A's. I'm honestly completely burnt out and trying super hard to care but literally i just want to hibernate until January for a fresh start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck to everyone else on here who might also feel this way we will get through it but i just had to get this out lol.",

For some reason the exam closed before exam week started. \n\nMy thought process was, focus on the project then do the exam during exam week. Obviously that didn't work, it dropped my 108 in the class to a B. \n\nDo your exams.",
