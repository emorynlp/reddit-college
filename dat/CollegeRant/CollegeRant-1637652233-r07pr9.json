  "text": "So\u2026\n\nI\u2019m in a group. I\u2019m a girl in her early 20s. I\u2019m working on a group final project, we\u2019re about to turn it in. 2/4 of our members have put in the bulk of the work. One of those two includes me, the other is a group-mate. It\u2019s a long story and no we\u2019re not happy about it. I will refer to them as gp. He is male in early or mid 30s\n\nGp and I have worked on projects together before, we\u2019re a good team, I guess.\n\nLately the conversations with him have been\u2026. Sexual? But not in a way that I can downright call flirting. And anytime he implies something between me and him I don\u2019t address it.\n\nHe\u2019s made it clear he\u2019s into girls with my ethnicity. He has called me pretty. He\u2019s made jokes about\u2026. Sexual stuff with me.\n\nI\u2019m friendly so I haven\u2019t really addressed it, maybe because things like that don\u2019t bother me and I\u2019m sex-positive.\n\nI\u2019ve considered it and.. no. I won\u2019t fuck him. I\u2019m in the middle of a dry spell T-T so of course I\u2019ve thought about it.\n\nBut\u2026 no. No god no he\u2019s not my type at all. He\u2019s made it clear his Dick is big. He\u2019s having emergency surgery this week.\n\nHe\u2019s asked me to take care of him for the first couple of days that he\u2019s recovering.\n\nI have said yes. Because\u2026. I DINT KNOW??!! JESUS FUCK. I\u2019m so conflicted. Am I uncomfortable? No, he has yet to make a move on me\u2026. I think\u2026 I AM pretty socially awkward. It takes me a while to realize peoples intentions\u2026 sometimes.\n\nFor him, I think his intentions are to make it clear he wants to sleep with me if given the chance. But he def. won\u2019t make the first move, in a way he is a gentleman. (Waiiiit but do gentlemen talk like this???) But\u2026 I\u2019m so conflicted. I have hope he won\u2019t try anything. I have also implied HEAVILY that I\u2019m not planning on making any booty calls with anyone any time soon. \n\nHe has asked me if our zodiacs are compatible(red fucking flag). And I told him \u201chaha no. You should go for a [completely different zodiac sign than mine], and I should go out with [not his sign]\u201d\n\nBut Christ man, this isn\u2019t the first time guys have talked to me like this. Especially like this. He\u2019s fucking shooting his shot isn\u2019t he? I\u2019ve just come to that realization. He\u2019ll keep shooting. And if I turn it down? Directly? But has he asked me out directly? Maybe, but like I said for every attempt I\u2019ve given a soft no. I guess this cycle will just continue\u2026 or at least for however long we need to interact with each other\u2026 I just want this semester to be over\u2026",

      "text": "I think being direct is important for any relationship cause it clears up gray areas of confusion. Especially if it was someone close to you, you want to make sure you have an idea of each other's boundaries or at least communicate when one of you feels uncomfortable or needs clarity about the intentions of the other person. \n\nSad story, but my Mom in college had a very sweet friend & decided to study at his house alone & ended up being raped. Not saying this could happen to you, but talking things out to see exactly what's going on in his head can give you a view of his intentions. Even if he doesn't directly say it he could speak it through his body language or maybe he continues to do sus things.\n\nHopefully, this was helpful. It can be difficult to communicate when you are not the best with social skills (I am not the best with being social lol). But the only way to get good is to actually do.",

      "text": "Just set stronger boundaries and don\u2019t go to a man\u2019s house you barely know if you don\u2019t wish for it to go any further. Instead of \u201chinting heavily,\u201d just say NO. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to, and it\u2019s not wise to put yourself in potentially compromising situations like this. You barely even know him; he can find someone else to look after him. Own your boundaries and respect your limited time and energy.",

You need to look out for yourself. \n\nI hope I'm not coming across as harsh, I just want you to know that's it's ok to be strict with your body and boundaries because you're the one who has to live with you.
