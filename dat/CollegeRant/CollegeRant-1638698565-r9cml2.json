There\u2019s the story of this guy that got a commission to catalog a thousand birds for a new book, he postponed everything until the night before he needed to submit. He runes panicking to his dad saying \u201chow the hell am I going to catalog a thousand birds in one night?\u201d And his dad answer \u201cbird by bird\u201d. Sometimes when I\u2019m panicking over assignments I like to think of this and just repeat to myself \u201cbird by bird \u201c",
