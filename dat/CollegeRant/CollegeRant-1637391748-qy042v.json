  "title:": "I\u2019m feeling lonely and hate senior year of college",
  "text": "I am a senior in nursing, (in college) and I am starting to really struggle with friends and wanting to be there anymore, but I had plenty of friends my freshman to junior year. This year I decided to cut a lot of toxic friendships out of my life or people that weren\u2019t making me happy because I realized that it wasn\u2019t worth it anyway. It has also been hard because a lot of my friends from before college never came back when we went back to person or they dropped out. I currently live in an apartment with my boyfriend and my friend, who is no longer really my friend at the time because she has been a horrible roommate and kinda moved in her boyfriend without asking, who doesn\u2019t clean up after himself or help with any bills. She is also leaving dirty dishes in the sink for several weeks as well as they both wake me up in my sleep from talking too loud or yelling, even when I ask them several times to be quiet. With that being said it\u2019s created tension in the house since I started standing up for myself and expressing that I didn\u2019t like what she was doing, so she essentially stopped hanging with me. So now I\u2019m left with only my boyfriend and one close friend at school to hang with and I\u2019m starting to feel lonely and depressed because I feel like I have no one else. It\u2019s a hard change for me, especially since I\u2019m used to having a lot of friends and things to do, making it extra difficult because I am now not even comfortable in my apartment. I don\u2019t know what to do or if it\u2019s normal to only hang with two people, I just want to feel happy and enjoy my last year of college instead of waking up everyday wishing it was just over!",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this op, I know you how you feel I\u2019m currently stuck in a friend group that\u2019s very toxic but I don\u2019t have anyone else so I haven\u2019t ditched them yet. I\u2019m a junior but I\u2019ll be graduating in the spring a year early. Props to you for cutting off those bad friends I haven\u2019t had the guts to do the same yet. My advice would be try to make the best of the last of your senior year. This could be a great time to make new connections . If you have the time maybe consider joining a student org? Or if you work you can try to make connections w people at your job. Idk I actually don\u2019t want to graduate early at all but I\u2019m just gonna try and make the best of the spring semester",
