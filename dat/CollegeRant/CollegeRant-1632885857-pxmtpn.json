  "text": "I went to college, got 2 degrees and it got me nothing. Okay let me be honest I spent **5 years** at community college and 10 years at a state college. It took me **15 years** which should have taken me 7 years. I just don't know what to think of this because when I went into the job market I was too old and no job recruiter wanted to take me in. I just want to know what other people think of this.",

Getting a degree that is worthless because of no experience. I'm telling you what happened is that the college never told us about this problem because all they wanted was our tuition money.",
