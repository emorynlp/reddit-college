  "title:": "Classmates making our lecturer mad",
  "text": "I have 3 \"problematic\" classmates that always causing trouble to our lecturer and dont listen to rule, instruction and stuff. The thing is our lecturer has been very big-hearted and show empathy towards them. For example when they are late for the exam, our lecturer always give them extra time. But today, our lecturer finally snapped and decided to show no mercy to them AND this includes the whole class for equality. Exams will be harder from now on, marking will be stricter, due date for assignment will be shorten. \n\nFuck those classmates, we are all adult in college now but they still act like a fucking spoiled 15 years old brat. My blood is boiling and I literally wanna grab my chair and smash the chair right in their face that moment. I feel bad for the lecturer, being too kind and you get bullied, being too strict, people hate you. Fuck this double standard.",

If nothing changes contact the department chair, dean, or an advisor for help. If they\u2019re acting like children in college then they\u2019ll get a rude awakening soon.",
