  "title:": "Parents asking for copy of transcript for insurance discount",
  "text": "So I'm on my parent's car insurance, and apparently there's some kind of discount you get for being a student and getting good grades. So they need a copy of my transcript. Problem is, I've been letting them believe that I've been a straight A/B student every semester. This was the case for my first several semesters, but that past 2 semesters I've received 3 C's and a D. I still have a 3.4 GPA, so to me it's not that big of a deal, but I know they're going to be PISSED. Also not sure if I'll be eligible for the discount. I know I probably shouldn't have lied to them about my grades, but the first time I received a B they gave me a huge lecture and it was awful so I learned to keep my grades to myself. Not really sure why I'm posting this, just looking to vent and wondering if anybody else has gotten an insurance discount for their grades?",

      "text": "Funny enough my mom came to me about this same thing last week. I had no idea this was a thing but great :) It\u2019s hard to get your parents to understand that a C is still a passing grade, but hopefully the fact that you\u2019re keeping a 3.4 gpa will make them feel better? Also are you paying for your tuition yourself? I think my mom is much less strict with my grades now that I\u2019m in college and I am mostly paying my own tuition, so maybe that\u2019s a factor for you too. In the end, just know that they are most likely making your grades a big deal because to them grades = success and they just want you to be successful. In the future, I would encourage you to be honest. They might be more upset that you led them to believe you had perfect grades. Good luck, hope they don\u2019t tear you a new one.",
