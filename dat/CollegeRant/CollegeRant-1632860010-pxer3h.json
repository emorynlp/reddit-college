  "text": "Hi guys its my first time writing on this subreddit but i needed a place to vent and i have no one do to so,idk i thought it was a good idea.I just flunked another year at medical college,i did so once before then went on to the next year and flunked this,i am hardworking,dedicated student who doesn't party or anything and yet i still managed to flunk out again.I feel depressed i have let my parents down,my girlfriend but most importantly myself.I can not show myself to my friends who are in college because they are flourishing,i feel ashamed,disgusted and i don't know what to do with my life.I just don't understand how i dedicate almost 6 years of my life and still am behind people who don't even try 10% as hard as i did.I was always a hard worker in high school and middle school,i don't know how this happened,even more so a second time.I am afraid of what the future hold and what are my chances of being a good doctor or even finding someone that will hire me as a doctor.Thank you anyone who devoted their time to read this.",
