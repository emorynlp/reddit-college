  "title:": "I Did Not Move Back to College After Initial COVID Breakout and Now Feel So Alone",
  "text": "Last March, I had to move out of my college dorm due to COVID-19 and go back home, as I\u2019m sure many of you relate to. However, I only live about 25 minutes away from my school. I lived there because I have a scholarship that would cover it. \n\nSo, up until this semester, ever since last spring I have only had to go to school one or two days a week, so I just stayed at home and commuted. Now, during the current semester I go to school 4-5 days a week and am there until noon but could stay later because I do temp work and will not have to worry about going to work until November. I still commute because I feel that it isn\u2019t worth me living in my college town when I only have classes until noon. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s worth mentioning that I am graduating early, but even if I wasn\u2019t, I would still be graduating before my friends do, due to them changing majors or dropping/failing classes, which is totally normal. Sometimes I almost feel like they are mad at me for almost being done with school when they still have much more time there left. \n\nI am also the only one of my friends who has a significant other. I feel like this is also something my friends aren\u2019t happy about for me. My S.O. has already graduated and we are in a semi long distance relationship (only about a 3 hour distance). I go see them every other weekend, and they come to see me here as well. But to be clear, my friends are involved in the school band and typically are busy on Saturdays anyway, so I am not blowing them off to spend time with my significant other. \n\nSince the semester has started, my friends go to parties, hang out, just do general college friend stuff and never mention it to me at all. I am never invited out to do anything. I only ever know about it after the fact when I see an Instagram or Snapchat post. When I lived there, I worked all the time and couldn\u2019t always go out but when I could, I did. I am the only one who ever tries to get all of us together and they never try to meet up or anything, yet it seems like they go out without me at least twice a week. \n\nI couldn\u2019t tell you the last time someone besides my partner or my parents invited me out or asked me to go do something with them despite the fact that I used to spend so much time with my friends when we all lived on campus. They ignore me most of the time when I send a message in the group chat. It doesn\u2019t help that it seems like everyone else already has an established friend group that is impenetrable. I am starting to feel isolated and so very alone. I made the decision that felt best for me by choosing to live at home for my last year of school but I didn\u2019t realize it would result in me losing all of my social life even though I\u2019m still available to hang out whenever they do. It\u2019s just hard to understand why I\u2019ve suddenly been pushed away. \n\n\nTL;DR- I didn\u2019t move back to my college after we had to move out last March due to COVID-19 (because I only live 25 minutes away) and now my friends exclude me from everything.",
