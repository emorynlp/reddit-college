  "text": "I don't know if I am alone on this, but here's my thing:\n\nI feel like tests are not designed to help a student reassure his/her knowledge about a particular subject, at least that's not the case most of the time. It just seems as though students are literally learning how to do nothing more than to just perform well on a test, and to accomplish such a task, they have to study for as long as possible even if they have to sacrifice sleep time, work time, leisure time, family time, rest time, etc. But then after the student has taken the test, it doesn't take even a week for him/her to realize that he/she has forgotten most of what he/she had studied for days.",

Like you can just get a sheet of paper and write down as much as important stuff you can remember, then if the amount of content you've written meets like a certain number, then you are good.
