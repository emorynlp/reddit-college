  "text": "I got extraordinary lucky to get into a really good program for my first year at college. Only requirement was however to take calculus and maintain above a B for my grade. I spent two hours being tutored over the homework and I went over it 3 times before the quiz. Eventually the quiz comes around and I get a failing grade. I don\u2019t even know how to cope with this considering the material that we are going over for the next quiz I don\u2019t understand at all and I\u2019m afraid that the college will kick me out of the program.",

Sometimes the issue with quizzes and tests is that the format is not similar to the practice work. Look up previous exams for the class from your university if it\u2019s available as this also might help.",

There are a variety of resources including homework help from school, tutoring, online information, videos, and Reddit help! You got this! It is better to try the first time that to have to repeat over again don\u2019t give up as one mess up doesn\u2019t dictate your whole grade as long as you get better!",

Start  brushing up on your fundamentals because they'll all come around before the semester ends. \n\nIf possible, do a little bit of work in your class everyday. You'll probably see better returns on from the time you invest if you review each day, rather than long cram sessions once ore twice a week.",

Ive started the year with bronchitis, havent fully recovered from hand surgery yet, both my kids got sick, & I\u2019m dealing with my house being repaired for a slab leak (repipe & remodel). Im behind in all 3 of my classes so far. Keep going to tutoring. Watch some Khan videos 1st & write down your questions (or the time stamps of what\u2019s confusing) so you can go over those with the tutor as well. Talk to your professor & your counselor, they can normally give you extra help",

I finished with an 87 or 88 I believe. My professor did give us like like 10 sheets of homework to do 2-3 times a week though so maybe that helped me when I didn't understand the content well. Continued to get tutored or even try to watch YT calc professors. They definitely helped me understand some topics I was having trouble with.",

Which means you can't fail or withdraw from anything.  If thst happens it only takes two semesters to get off that probation.  I wouldn't worry about it until the last couple weeks.  Just try and get thst grade up.",
