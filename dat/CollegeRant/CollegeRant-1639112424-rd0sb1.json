  "text": "silly little me didn't check my professors on RateMyProfessor BEFORE registering for courses because I've just never done it before?? it's only my first year of college, but OH MY GOD!!! please look them up for your own good. every single professor that I had a problem with this semester has a bad score on RMP.\n\nI am majoring in biochemistry. the work isn't hard for me; I understand everything that I am lectured on and taught. but the communication... omg. i can admit that my communication isn't the greatest. i have ADHD and anxiety so I get scared of confrontation when I have to message a professor about being late (idk why I'm so nervous they'll be mad at me, it's literally their job but whatever (thanks mom and dad for the genes!)). BUT THESE PROFESSORS have changed late policies multiple times throughout the semester, come unprepared to class, and offer no help?? \n\ni also very much am the problem too!! I'm a very smart person, learning comes easy to me, but I just don't feel interested in what I am being taught. im a very creative individual. im wondering if maybe I'm in the wrong major?? wrong school?? wrong location?? \n\ni feel useless when I am not performing well in school and get mega depressed. i guess I just don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR check RMP on all of your professors. im depressed.**",

      "text": "im glad i didnt trust RMP in community college. the high ratings were all for easy professors that teach the basics and test the basics, and all the \"unfair\" and \"bad\" (thorough) professors got low ratings. all the easy profs got comments like \"teaches really well, easy to understand\" and hard profs got \"unapproachable, impossible to talk to, lectures make no sense\" when they actually were really nice in office hours and did make sense if you weren't struggling with prerequisites.\n\nunfortunately the \"easy\" prof in my CS department was the only prof that taught 3 required courses out of 5, taught the intro class, but never taught the last major CC class. So some CS majors would end up taking 4/5 with him, getting easy A grades, only to drop out on the 5th one because it was too hard. It was really sad to see some of my friends have to take extra semesters because they decided they couldnt do the major and wanted to change. I hate to think of his students that got screwed later after they've transferred to a university and paid tens of thousands of dollars. Everyone is pretty sure he's the reason the CC's CS courses don't count for the local university's CS major anymore.\n\nI was kind of screwed because he taught some of the math classes (discrete math) which is important for math/stat major, and he basically taught stuff easier than Khan Academy, easier than the textbook. Literally the only reason I took the class was to satisfy a course requirement. So I was behind on combinatorics, probability, and proofs after I transferred. People say \"why go to lecture when I can just get a better explanation from Khan Academy/Youtube?\" Literally that.\n\nhonestly it was easy to guess if a student took the easy prof's class or the hard (regular) prof's class just by looking at how they programmed or did their math homework. Unfortunately, the easy prof I was talking about is the co-chair of his department (department has a total of 2 full-time professors including himself, the others were adjuncts).",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been in college since 2018, I didn\u2019t start using RMP until last semester. Turns out I had some really difficult professors but I didn\u2019t notice. I used the app because it sounded like fun. When I saw that my professors this last term were hard and apparently not at all nice, I worried way too much. Yes they were hard, but they actually were nice to me. RMP is not all that accurate. And if you rely on it too much, you could end up giving yourself more anxiety. For me, it was a mentality thing. I read the reviews and I subconsciously chose to believe everything I read. It was mainly about how bad the professors were; they never responded to emails, bad at communication, rude, didn\u2019t teach anything. That was not true, so with everything on social media I\u2019d just take those reviews on RMP with a grain of salt. Maybe don\u2019t use the app next semester and see if you have any issues then.",

Also, may be a hot take but I don\u2019t trust RMP, for the most part it seems students get on there to vent and not give an objective review.\n\nIf I had trusted RMP I would have missed out on having the chance to be a student of some truly amazing instructors. Just please interpret those reviews with a grain of salt. For the instructors I\u2019ve had the \u201cbad review and warnings\u201d proved to be untrue in my experience.",

Of course there's bad eggs, but my professors are mostly great, knowledgable, helpful. But outside of the professors, that where the real magic happens. My academic advisor is amazing, put a fee deferral on my record found extra funding for me when I was struggling, is always up for a chat about how I see my path. Our library has peer tutors, as well as free editing and proofreading services for papers. The librarians are always happy to help out it with research.\n\nWe have accessibility services, which have helped me work through my ADHD and get permission for things like extensions, recording in class, extra free professional tutoring. They auto-send messages for students, so we don't have to email professors directly, and the profs basically have to listen (most are chill about it anyway).\n\nOur student union is also great. Although I can't speak to them personally (never had to use them) from what I hear handle any issues with unfair grading super efficiently.\n\nIt 100% depends where you go and it's not about the professors or what research the school does (until later on in your degree or grad school). It's about the admin and support staff. So make sure you're taking advantage of what your school does offer! Yours probably offers much, if not all of the above, you just have to ask for help.\n\nAs far as Rate My Professor, my tip is to ignore the ratings and focus on what people say. A lot of genuinely good profs get marked lowly because their classes are \"hard.\" But really it's because they expect students to show up, put in effort, and learn the material before giving an A.\n\nGood luck!
