  "text": "I just spent the last half hour writing a discussion post on Blackboard, I think I did a pretty good job on this stupid discussion post. I press submit, and guess what it does? It doesn't submit. Instead it prompts me with my university login, I scramble to log in and I get in. It puts me on the main page of Blackboard. My post is nowhere, it never submitted. There is no draft, there is nothing. I just spent 30 fucking minutes for nothing because of Blackboard. This website is just terrible, I cannot think of any reason why this should be used instead of Google Classroom. It is difficult to navigate and I cannot deal with this type of shit when I have so much to do.\n\nTLDR; I write a discussion post on Blackboard, I submit, it's fucking gone.",
