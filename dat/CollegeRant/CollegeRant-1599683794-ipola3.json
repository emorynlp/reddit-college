  "text": "Idk if it's just me but college is not as \"glamorous\" like people often perceive it to be. I was told college was gonna be the best years of my life, so far it's not. It's alot of work and frustration. Racial incidents are occurring on my campus as we speak, making matters worse. Living in dorms suck. People are so nasty and have no respect for others. For now, I hate it. And no I can't dropout, because my family would think I'm a disappointment and a good for nothing. Sorry for the rant, I'm just overwhelmed and angry.",

After that, how many years grinding every single day for your share of scraps going around with your little piece of paper acting like someone actually cares about it or it matters (let alone cares about you)? Are you studying something now a robot or developing world freelancer can't easily do for 1/10th the cost? Colleges bring you in to make money, greatest credit sharks you'll ever meet. They sell you on a promise to make more but leave you owing one-tenth a million with no experience in the job market. But hey, McDonald's is always hiring. Most college operate like businesses in the USA and most students (to make matters worse) waste their time in college, playing a bunch of video games, jerking off everyday, perusing social media, doing the bare minimum studying, drinking wildly, just checking the box. I doubt the \"best times in someone's life\" are based on studying 8 hours a day or whatever the benchmark is that's set in most classes. Those fond memories likely come from a time when they weren't weighed down witn mortgages, kids, ex-wives, high blood pressure, debt, male pattern baldness, hopelessness, etc. They look at 'being young' with fondness because now they are older and that era seemed more carefree. You write that \"college is overrated,\" well so is a career, so is partying, so is everything that you base someone else's opinion on. College is unneccessary if you have half an idea what you want to do with your life. It's not about a job title, but more about the relationships you cultivate, the passion projects you continually work on, how dedicated and disciplined you are in staying healthy, showing up to work, the people you serve, and the awareness of your life spirit, breath, and moving toward greater happiness. No institution is going to give you any of that. But you can find it within. But regardless, I believe you can make college work for you. Snap judgements two weeks in will not be overarching. You'll adapt I believe and find that \"it is what it is,\" for better or for worse.",

Just as Motivational speaker, Jim Rohn, once said \u201cYou are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\u201d I think that quote really rings true in terms of the way in which a college age individual perceives the atmosphere at their chosen institution.\n\nBefore I transferred to the University of Arizona in 2019, I thought all universities were overrated in one way or another. But after I moved away to college, I found a whole new crowd to folks to socialize with an met my roommate, who I will will be rooming with again when I return to Tucson, AZ in January for senior year. My roommate and I are very good friends, we text multiple times a week just to shoot the breeze.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is don\u2019t dismiss or rule out the \u201ccollege experience\u201d just yet. Give it time, feel it out. Hang out with or talk to folks you have never hung out with or talked to. You might meet some interesting individuals who will positively impact your life in some way or another. There will be some unpleasantness in your life everywhere you go and in most settings.\n\nI have endured my fair share of ups and down in life and at college. There were many times when I wanted to lay down and give up, but I always went back to the bigger picture and and reset my motivation. From that, I learned that Life\u2019s not fair, it never was, it isn\u2019t now and it won\u2019t ever be. Get over it and get on with it.",

Mine was Baptist. Still counts.) as it behaves.) that I was going to regret not living on campus and getting the #campuslife.   \n\n\nLike, buddy, I'm already disenfranchised with college because I spent undergrad on something I didn't actually want to do as a profession. I chose it because I *needed to choose a fucking major.* I'm in grad school now because it took me forever to actually find out what I really wanted to do.

Most students that aren\u2019t wealthy, are studying challenging majors, and are financially smart aren\u2019t having fun because they\u2019re too worried about being successful.",

Personally, it wasn't easy for me. As I went along, I quickly realized *I really wasn't that great at this*. Like, not to self-deprecate, but the people I worked around were far more talented in the area, both in the technical and performance sides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy didn't I just switch majors? Cause I was told I \"just needed the degree\" by my dad (He really does think that a degree will just open doors for you. Explain that to unemployed STEM grads. Doors never just \"open\".), was told in H.S that everyone needs to go to college because reasons never disclosed to me outside of \"you'll be more successful/make more money.\" (I know all about the statistics that say degree holders earn more yearly, and it's extremely misleading.), was in my school districts AVID college prep program at the behest of both my parents (It's okay, I learned cornell notes.). And honestly? I didn't switch because I didn't know what I wanted. I never had any actual guidance counseling to help me decide if college was right for me, and what major/career path I'd want to consider, so I stuck with what I did more out of being too far in/complacency. That, and if I dropped, I'd have to move out of my parents house, in California no less. I'd be homeless if I did that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that we expect everyone to go to college. Not everyone should. Now I'm pursuing my teaching credentials so I can be the teacher and counselor I wish I had. We throw too many kids out into college and just expect them to figure it out. Many just end up indebted.",

Easy is also subjective, some people find writing essays every week hard and others love it. Some people find singing hard but others enjoy it , it all requires effort and time but your investing in yourself to be able to gain that well rounded knowledge in the real world. Now with this being said yes most people will be un employed OR work in something different from their major but it shows the employer your worth ethic because college is Jed and you\u2019re at least well rounded enough to be adequate at whatever job you\u2019re at. It definitely should cost less but it still has to be valuable. Freshman and sophomore year you\u2019re kind of fucking around and getting through but junior senior year when you have electives and things get harder you realize oh shit I need to graduate and really try. \n\nSome people get lucky with podcasts,starts ups, influencers but not everyone is .. which that also can be hard work bc of marketing, exposure and likability it just depends on what you\u2019re willing to put in effort in in order to get something out of it",
