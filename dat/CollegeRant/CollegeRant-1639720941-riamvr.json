      "text": "You\u2019ve got this! Just keep doing the hardest math questions over and over. If you do the easy ones you have a lower chance of doing well on the exam \n\nTake it one step at a time. Also even if you can only get something partially done submit it. Partial marks are always better then 0\u2019s. \n\nJust breathe you will get through this. You can\u2019t do well if you are stressed.  Find some small pleasures to get you through. Such as a fancy coffee, or an enjoyable podcast, even rewarding yourself with pizza or something. \n\nRemember final exams will just be a memory in a few years. I believe in you. Good Luck!",
