  "text": "I\u2019m trying to take a chemistry course at my community college instead of my university because the only available professor for the class is complete shit and doesn\u2019t want her students to succeed, but my university doesn\u2019t approve transient forms unless there are no seats available in the class at my uni. It\u2019s so fucking annoying. I struggled in my last Chem class because I had a shitty professor and I just want to do well, and this professor is actually worse and everyone who\u2019s had her says she\u2019s horrible. Fuck college, they only want our money and couldn\u2019t give less of a shit if we succeed.",

Like u really need to take some math and a science refresher before walking into that course.",

Like bro if only like 6 people are gonna be left at the end of the semester maybe take it as a sign you fucking suck. Dropped that class immediately lol",
