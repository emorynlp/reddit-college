  "text": "I hate the food at my campus, it tastes good sure but its all fried and unhealthy! They said they'd add a vegan option (im not vegan) but i never once saw it. I have PCOS and gastritis so fried foods and sugary foods should be the last thing they should serve. My classmate has diabetes and she said she couldn't eat the stuff here. Idk why its so hard to add some vegetables or fruits, I feel like they're trying to kill us.\n\nWhat made me rant is the fact they gave us cookies for breakfast, I just walked out. This is why I cant with this school.",

      "text": "My dorm is very small, so we are lucky enough to have pretty good and healthy food. The staff even take suggestions for what to make! However, they don\u2019t serve food on the weekends and I have to travel to a bigger dining hall. The problem with these is that they are trying to introduce everyone to diverse foods, but then don\u2019t make these well. This creates bad attitudes towards foreign foods that are actually really good when made right. Also, it leads to me just getting what I know will be good which is usually pizza or burgers or something like that and this really isn\u2019t very healthy.",
