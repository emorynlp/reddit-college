  "text": "I've never enjoyed college. I don't like partying at all, friends are too much of an obligation so I keep my interactions somewhat limited, and I genuinely just don't really know what I want to be doing. I really like making music. And truthfully, that's all I have in mind.. is to make good music. And yes, that's the classic \"I'm not going to college - music is my calling\" response which I'm mature enough to realize is fairly unrealistic. Honestly, I've only been making awful music lately that I just end up deleting which puts me back into the \"I guess it's back to literally just existing throughout college.\" I'm happy though. My classes are done by noon, and I go to the gym, do my homework and study, and then work on my hobbies. My days are so fast it's like time isn't stopping anymore. So what do I do? I'm pursuing a finance degree, but I have a 3.3 GPA. I don't do any clubs, and I don't really want to because I like working on my hobbies. But my resume looks like the most average resume I've ever seen. I feel like I can't even score a good job with something like that. My dreams have always been to start my own business, or do music. I am definitely a dreamer. But I have no idea WHAT kind of business I could make - with no idea, I have no motivation to drop out and create a business that's just going to barely support me if it were just another generic business.\n\nWith a finance degree, I'd really want to work at a record label.. I feel like I'd be able to make some cool connections that would tie into my music passion. My parents are taking care of my college tuition which I am forever grateful and fortunate for, yet I still feel like I'm wasting my time. Does getting a job at a record label seem like a realistic goal? Also, despite wanting to be a producer/artist, I always procrastinate going to my desk and sitting down and creating. It's all very weird.\n\nThis seems like such a rant, and quite honestly it is just that. Do you guys have any advice? Such a weird time in life. Thanks.",
