  "text": "Hi everyone, I started uni about 3 weeks ago and I won't lie, it hasn't been great. I don't know maybe its homesickness, maybe I didn't really settle in yet, or maybe uni was different from what I had been imagining whole summer. And not to sound pathetic but I'm really not liking it that much. My high school friends seem to be having so much more fun and doing exciting things than me on social media and I'm just here. Is it gonna get better? Cause I don't know if I can mentally endure 4 years of this.",
