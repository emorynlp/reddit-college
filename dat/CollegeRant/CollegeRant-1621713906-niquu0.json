  "text": "it's my first year at uni (Economics and Sociology) and I feel like such a failure, I'm on a 75 average at best (C+?) , I really feel stupid cus of it and it's messing with my mental health. \n\nI was always the type to just get the material whatever subject it was (both literate and STEM), I could just logic my way out of exams and assignments and get good grades, but for some reason, I don't know if it's the intensity or the weekly papers and assignments I'm just really struggling, and even if there's a course I'm really good at (to the point I'm explaining the material to all my friends before exams and such) I still get a low grade even if I fucking know the subject (god I hate multiple choice exams they're the worst). \n\nand what really gets on my nerve is that other students in my class who have a sack of sand for a brain, who really just can't think for themselves get better grades, because they're this archetype for the neurotic straight A student with perfect hand writing and copy paste machine, you just want to punch in the mouth. \n\nI feel like quitting every other day, I just feel so bad about myself.",

      "text": "You're gonna have to study harder and buckle down! Don't give up just yet because this is only the beginning. What helps me is that I sit down, read and highlight the chapter, then create a Quizlet. Make sure that it is thorough and includes lots of details. Study those flashcards day in and day out. While reading your flashcards, make sure to read them out loud and pace back and forth. When you are done studying your flashcards, review them. After that, use the testing portion to test yourself because the format of them is similar to the one that you are about to take. Another thing is to make sure that the room is QUIET! Having distractions such as your phone being on the desk is a huge one! Put the phone away, on silent, and don't take too many breaks. When you're done reading and highlighting, take a five-minute break to use the restroom or a bottle of water. Do the same thing after you're done studying the flashcards. Your mind does need a break, but having too many or too long ones can be detrimental to your memorization skills. One day when you have your college degree, you will look back on this day and be proud of all the blood, sweat, and tears that you had poured into your education. That's what makes it so rewarding! I just got my Associate's and I'm about to transfer to a big university with a 3.8 GPA and a scholarship! You need to have a little bit more faith in yourself! If you don't, then you will not get far in college. The last tip that I'd like to give you is to not analyze the question. Answer it and keep moving on to the next one. Doubting yourself on an exam in college is a huge detriment. Most likely, nine times out of ten, you are correct!",

              "text": "Drop out here, just wanted to say my view on this.\n\nI guess \"naturally smart\" means some people's brains click, logic and understand faster than others. But those with fast brains who also study go turbo fast!\n\nI know I'm a drop out but it irritates me how you said you were born with an already fast to understand brain and you're mad at others for being born with a faster brain and want to punch them in the mouth. It's like being born into a rich family, getting a Ferrari and wanting to punch another rich kid who beat you in a drag race.\n\nNot you specifically because I rather think of it as nature and life instilling these toxic traits unto us human beings. If we all hate and argue against each other it would be a toxic shitfest. I hate that so I rather think of the \"jealous/despicable trait\" as bad itself despite you saying you want to punch someone \"naturally smarter\" than you when you consider yourself fast to learn.\n\nI don't mean to sound confrontational or rude but from what I read it seems like you have a slightly unhealthy mentality when you say\n\n1) \"I feel like such a failure, I used to be smart what happened?\" \n\nSmart is a word that gets thrown around a lot. There's different types of smart: street smart, logic smart, different types of learning smart and so on. I hate it because it praises people for just being born with it or raised in an environment with parents, family, friends and community who make learning easier compared to others who had it rough. \n\n2) \"low grade even if I fucking know the subject\" It sounds contradicting to me, or maybe somehow the grading was bs. Me begin an asshole saying this but fucking knowing a subject would imply you know the subject as a full doctorate or phd or unless you mean at a student level. \n\n3) \"want to punch in the mouth.\"\n\n4) \"I feel like quitting every other day, I just feel so bad about myself.\" You want to punch people in the mouth, quit, and feel bad about yourself. I already quit so you beat me there.\n\nI'm a dropout so I already know I'm a sucking loser because toxic online trolls already reminded me of that.\n\nBut it sounds like you do at least study effectively, at least the summary. Explaining to others is a great way to learn, but the details in the full pages of reading are where the grades come in!\n\nThe nitty gritty part sounds like difficulty in understanding, comprehension because I assume academic text is written to be understood at face value or taken literally for what it means so there should only be one interpretation of it.\n\nI know I'm all keyboard warrioring right now but I try to help with my limited experience. Maybe you could try posting in other subreddits for study advice because I read that's how people pass college when their fast brain isn't enough.",
