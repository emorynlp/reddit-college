  "text": "Health science major here. \nInitially when I got into my studies, I was stoked to learn everything I could about medicine, health and helping people. \nBut I'm not sure whether it's my mental health/depression or if I'm just now realizing maybe healthcare isn't for me. I don't do well under stress, I hate long hours that interfere with work/life balance. I like to believe I'm somewhat smart, albeit not very ambitious in any high regard. I'm not a crunch time student that spends all his free time studying. I like to do my work, study a little bit, and live my life when I can. \nBut now I'm terrified that I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I just want to find something that makes me a little bit happy, and allows me a little bit of disposable income to enjoy my shitty life, but everything just requires so much extensively schooling while I just want to be trained and employed already. I'm just so depressed and I can barely handle it lmao",

          "text": "Thank you for your words. I definitely do feel pretty overwhelmed, but developing a routine souls help. This is one of my harder semesters with anatomy and physiology. Additionally I have a pretty bad professor for my lab, so that has been a soul drain for the last couple of months. Best we can do is try to survive the semester and recollect ourselves afterwards.",
