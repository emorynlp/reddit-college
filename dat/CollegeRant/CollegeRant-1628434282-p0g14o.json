  "text": "Heya,\n\nI\u2019m heading into my senior year of college. I\u2019m a bio major, pre-veterinary.\n\nI\u2019ve had a busy summer and have been juggling a few responsibilities, really not much of a break. My anxiety\u2019s sky high already (something I\u2019ve struggled with my whole life, nothing much I can do about it) and although I usually look forward to going back to school, it\u2019s going to be stressful.\n\nI failed o-chem I sophomore year due to a deep mental health spiral \u2014 not uncommon, I\u2019ve had several major episodes of depression  these past three years of school and I just manage to pull myself out somehow without telling much to anybody. I had to retake it junior year and passed both ochem I and II. My parents have no clue, they think I passed the first time around. It\u2019s better if they just don\u2019t find out, I don\u2019t want to disappoint them any more than I think I have. I\u2019ve been beating myself up for this forever. \n\nNow, because of my academic fuck-up, I\u2019m taking biochem alongside physics I (vet schools require a whole year..fun), a thesis class, and advanced human anatomy (closest thing to animal anatomy) this fall, along with the labs. I also have a chem minor so after biochem I have to take another chem course like advanced biochem, p-chem, etc. things I\u2019m definitely not smart enough for.\n\nIf I fail any of those courses I won\u2019t be able to graduate on time. My family is eagerly awaiting my graudation in spring and they actually think I\u2019m smart and capable enough to get accepted into vet school the first time around. It\u2019s really nice of them to have so much faith in me but I really don\u2019t know if I can do it.\n\nI really wish I could talk to someone. I\u2019m too afraid to tell my parents because they may think I\u2019m incapable of any kind of stress at all. I just don\u2019t know how to face this semester in particular. I don\u2019t want any blunt words about just doing it or sucking it up. I try to mention how my anxiety affects me every day and my parents just accept it\u2019s just my personality and that if I\u2019ve made it this far with a 3.5 cumulative GPA and dean\u2019s lists most semesters then Im completely, totally okay. They ramp up my accomplishments so much to people they talk to and it hurts. I\u2019m not good enough.\n\nTL;DR: anxiety\u2019s been bad this whole summer and my fall semester is jam packed due to my failure sophomore year. I\u2019m applying to vet school and don\u2019t have much hope in myself and really want to reach out for help but don\u2019t know how and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fail or go into another episode of depression again.",

      "text": "1. Find someone at your school to talk to. Most places have counsellors to talk to, if you aren't sure - reach out to the health center on campus. Perhaps they can refer you to someone to prescribe anti-anxiety meds.\n2. Vet schools don't care if you have a minor - really they don't. Take the classes you need and don't worry about anything other than biochemistry\n3. It's not unusual to take more than four years for college.  I don't know your family, but most parents are understanding.  You can tell them you got behind or had to retake a class because your GPA wasn't great in Organic.\n4. Are you applying to Vet school now? I know the cycle opened earlier this summer. Applications are stressful, this is part of the reason so many people do a gap year.  It would also help you get more animal experience and get your mental health in a better place.  If you think undergrad is hard, Vet school will be 3X harder.  Don't be afraid to talk to Vet school admissions about this - they can tell you where your application is weak. If you want to do a gap year or take a 5th year in undergrad you can use this information to explain it to your family.\n5. Do you have a pre-vet advisor? Maybe they can provide some wisdom too.\n6. You are good enough - it's OK to take more time - especially if you will be in a better place mentally.",

          "text": "(I hope you don\u2019t mind that I answer numerically as well..thank you for breaking down your response as it helps me read through it better)\n\n1. I used to see a counselor on campus up until the end of spring semester of junior year, this spring. She was the counselor I went to and trusted to pull me through some 3-4 month long depressive episodes and chronic, concurrent anxiety. She was immensly helpful but she left my school to practice in a different state where she can no longer talk to me :( I\u2019ve seen so many different people and poured my heart out to them only for them to switch practices, insurance, or just leave where I can\u2019t talk to them anymore. I\u2019ll have to start from scratch with some of the other counselors there, they\u2019re all nice I bet. I need to have a support system. I\u2019ve also seriously considered medication again, the anxiety is unbearable at times.\n\n2.) I\u2019ve been told this by my own academic advisor but it\u2019d confuse the heck out of my parents if I told them I dropped the minor \u2014 they think I finished all my credits for it as well. I really don\u2019t want to progress past biochem though but we\u2019ll see\n\n3.) I\u2019ve always wanted to maybe write down my explanation in a letter to better sort out my thoughts, so I can try to explain that theough said letter maybe\n\n4.) Yeah Imm currently applying. I\u2019m making decent progress but it\u2019s a lot. I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s nothing wrong with a gap year and I think it\u2019d help so I might bring that up to someone also!\n\n5.) My academic advisor is supposedly a pre-vet advisor and while they\u2019ve helped, sometimes it just sounds a bit..strict? Which is fair considering vet school is hard to get into but it doesn\u2019t help my confidence much.\n\nYour reply and everyone\u2019s response here means so much. I can\u2019t thank you enough for making me feel a bit less worried and alone.",

Maybe it's easier to share that way, but sometimes it just helps you organize and explain things.\n\n\\-If you are applying this cycle, get your application submitted soon. Have people read through your personal statement. It's trite, but remember \"show don't tell\" so use stories and examples, not telling statements.\n\n\\-I'm not sure what you mean by strict for your advisor, some people are too rigid, but some programs are in their pre-reqs too.\n\nYou can do this, remember you are not your anxiety or depression. You've got to deal with them, so that might change how or when you do something - but you can do it.",

Better to make sure you graduate one semester late, than try and push beyond what your mental health can manage. Please be careful. Graduating on time with a crippling breakdown isn\u2019t great prep for grad school. \n\nAlso, consider talking to your parents. This is something they\u2019d like to support you through in 99% of cases. Above all they want you happy and healthy, it sounds like you\u2019re neither, but think it\u2019s what they want.

      "text": "I'm in the same boat, love. Same major, failed the same course (hell, failed it thrice), feeling like I won't get into vet school, in senior year (though I was supposed to graduate this year)-- I would say you could vent to me, but I can be flakey and you may need someone consistent. \n\nI'm here to tell you it's okay though. Uni has been hard for everyone, especially with COVID running amok. Take a deep breathe, and try to face this as head on as you can. Don't overload yourself with plans, decisions, and fuck ups. Take it one day at a time.\n\nMake a plan. O-Chem and physics will be hard together--Promise yourself that:\n- as *SOON* as ou get on campus that you'll make an appointment with counselling services to work on methods to mitigate your anxiety. And that when you feel stressed you'll talk it out with them and give yourself ample breaks\n\n- You'll go to the office hours to ask questions or just go over what you know and what you do and don't know\n\n- You'll attend study sessions and tutoring lessons to keep you on top of things.\n\nDid you already apply for vet school or are you applying for the next cycle? If not, maybe you should consider a gap year your get yourself together--I mean, that's what I'm planning to do, but in the end do you, you know? If you did, do you have a professor that's a veterinarian (or was)? \nMaybe reach out to them and ask for advice or mentorship.\n\nAs for telling people you'll be graduating late?--Truthfully for me it was hard. I cried, I was scared, I thought my parents would convince me to switch, or that they would be mad, or compare me to my friends and family who graduated hs with me.\n\nBut they were much more compassionate that I expected. When I approached them with my issues, and the prospects of graduating late they were disappointed, but they appreciated me being honest. If your parents aren't as compassionate, don't worry about it.\n\nRemember that everyone's journey will be different. Also, you're fellow pre-vet students know the deal. If you're close with some of your major-mates, maybe ask if anyone would be interested in a vent or friendship circle.",
