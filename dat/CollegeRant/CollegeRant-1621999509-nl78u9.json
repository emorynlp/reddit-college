  "text": "This week is finals week, my final project for thermo its about making an abstract of this weird ass article the prof sent us along with a couple questions and diagrams he wants us to explain, it doesnt sounds hard, like it isnt but heres the deal: the original deadline for the project was this friday may 28, today its Tuesday 25, he just changed the deadline date for tomorrow wednesday, this pisses me off because i havent started bc im getting done other projects, THEEEENNNNN i open the assignment pdf to see the instructions and the very first thing i see is that he wants a FIVE PAGE ABSTRACT OF A 4 PAGE ARTICLE (not counting the apendix pages) and all i have to say its how int he fucking world its that congruent???? Why ramble around about something i dont even understand??? it doesnt makes sense to me like i could easily just copy paste the article and i would still have space to fill, isnt it an abstract????? So should i be fucking furious about how stupid this assignment is? like im gonna try to get done but i just thing its ridiculous.",

But like at first I was pretty mad about it but I was keeping it together and i was pretty sure I could get it done tonight so I calmed down but I just saw the instructions pdf a couple hours ago and i just went insanely furious again.",
