  "text": "Every since we moved in to our apartment it\u2019s like we\u2019ve had 1 plus roommate than agreed upon. They haven\u2019t left literally since we moved in and I\u2019m just about fed tf up. A bunch of other crap happened too but I won\u2019t get into that. First of all the rent is fairly expensive so it pisses me off every time I think about how they haven\u2019t left. Like bud, go home. You\u2019re campus is in a whole other town. Im so tempted to snitch but if I do I\u2019d need to break out if the lease for my sanity and that\u2019d be even more money. Ugh. Ever semester it\u2019s something. Whether it\u2019s college, work, or home environment it\u2019s always freaking something.",
