  "text": "I hate my major in animation so much. It takes so much of my time and money and idk how long I can take this bullshit. My card declined today while getting food because I had to spend money getting supplies for these different classes. I started crying while drawing in this required sketchbook (I have no choice, I have to draw 100 pages) I fucking hate art so much and I lost my fucking passion for it years ago when I realized im a terrible artist and this is a terrible career path. And art professors are so stingy, they grade based on talent more than effort. All the competition, the money, the time, all this to graduate with debt and a minimum wage job and a shitty fine arts degree. \n\nI would drop out but I'm almost done anyways like a year or 2 left. Typing this is always therapeutic but after graduation I hope I never draw anything ever again. Some advice from anyone who relates would be nice. I keep crying and I wish I could punch 18 year old me in the face.",

It's not on Reddit but ya I totally relate I wanna drop out so fucking badly, materials are ridiculously expensive with the amount of money we're paying why can't we get a least a subsidy \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

It just makes you feel terrible for even trying because both trying and not trying garner the same bad grade/results. Right now im typing this in my 6 hour 3d design classes and a few times today I thought about just getting up and leaving. My passion is dead for this career path.",

              "text": "100000%. They say being in college is where we have the most artistic freedom but that's fucking bullocks. You HAVE to do things a certain way, you're constantly criticised, and they always can't fucking draw the line between copying and inspiration ie they always tell me to take inspiration from others WHEN I DONT WANT TO, but then say don't copy. How about you just shut the fuck up and mind ur own business fuck sake. I have 0 passion left too. \n\nWhat career paths are you looking at right now? For me it's completely unrelated to my course, I just want that fucking stupid paper since money has already been spent. College the best days of your life? Literally my worst.",

I'm just putting out lazy work so I could become less disappointed.\n\nI plan to use this animation degree to become a production manager in animation. It has no drawing involved so thats the plus side. Luckily my passion died the first semester of college so I managed to add a second major (communication). I completed it within a year lol and now I just have to do the art classes. And 2 weeks in or so or however long I was here and I want nothing to do with this. Like why isn't their an animation production degree. Fuck this major and fuck art class. \n\nI've heard before about never make your passion a career and I never listened now look at me ugh. But it'll be fine. I'll draw for myself, not for some company or professor. But imma need a 5 year break minimum from art after this, maybe longer.",

      "text": "> And art professors are so stingy, they grade based on talent more than effort. \n\nI'd just like to address this point. Every field grades based upon measurable outcomes, and not effort. I teach engineering; I mark based upon whether or not they got the answer right, and communicate their work in a logical straightforward fashion, following the various conventions in the field.\n\nThis is easier for some students than others. Some students really struggle with it. I might commiserate with those students, but that's about all. \n\nThe point of studying, of practicing is to hone your skills and talent. But at the end of the day, it's what you get down on the page that gets assessed, not how you got there. No matter what field you're in.",

          "text": "Well I've looked into production management in animation and theres no drawing in it involved. I did do research and learned some of the people in that position have a degree in communication, buisness, or animation. I decided to take some communication classes and it was so easy and non demanding I managed to get the associates for transfer in a year. So yes I double major but the communication degree isn't demanding and stressful at all. Its just the animation one thats driving me insane. I plan to use the animation degree for this production management career to show i have interest and knowledge in the field but the classes for the degree are the annoying part. If there was a degree called \"animation production\" it would help alot but they don't exist in state school.",
