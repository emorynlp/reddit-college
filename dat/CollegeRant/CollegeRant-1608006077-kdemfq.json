  "text": " I think I'm just here to vent but are any of your Professors assigning you more work for this semester and finals? My SWE professor decided that our Final Exam should be to create a project model similar to the project model that took us an entire semester to make. She's asking for a  minimum of six pages including Gantt Charts,  SDLC model for the system, and multiple functional and non-functional requirements,  etc.  Idk I just think it's too much for a 'final exam' it seems like a  multi-week project at this point. She assigned this to us tonight and it's supposed to be due this Friday. Does it just seem too much or am I just complaining?",

I know a lot of people will give projects like that so that you have the opportunity to still do a major final project but have that guidance and re-use your earlier work.",

Design the system, create the necessary graphs, and code the application. Thankfully we don't have to do anything coding, but the system design itself took around 7 weeks to finish with 4 people. That's partly because we were learning at the same time.",

Not as bad but one of my professors assigned us a 1500 word paper due in less than two days, and a study guide for the exam at the same time as well that I need to prepare for. \n\nWhy can\u2019t they just assign us the work last week so we can budget our time better and actually do good work instead of last minute assignments. I emailed my professor about it and they never responded \ud83d\ude05",

We had two demos for our applications and she didn't post the guideline for each demos until 2 days before we actually had to do them. Idk man you guys to be understanding about professors being busy, but it's honestly fucked that professors are just allowed to drop something like this. If a pre-pandemic final takes 2 hours to do then they should assign us work that be completed in that time period.",

I just can\u2019t deal with the so much work at the same time & dealing with holiday stress, and some of my professors are so great but others are just so not understanding! Anyway good luck with all your finals!",
