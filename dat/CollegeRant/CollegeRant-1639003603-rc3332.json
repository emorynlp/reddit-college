  "text": "It was some dumb number theory course I didn\u2019t even need to take, but my advisor told me it\u2019d be easy to pass for a math credit. This was the hardest class I\u2019ve ever taking in my life. I\u2019m a junior and I\u2019ve never failed an assignment unless I just didn\u2019t turn it in. I constantly failed homework in this class. \n\nI failed our 2 midterm exams and our final. I spent all week prepping for this final. If I wasn\u2019t in class I was at the library studying and practicing. I had like 2 meals in the last 3 days because I was so busy getting ready. I didn\u2019t even study for my other exams because I had As and at worst I go down to Bs.\n\nThis final was the difference between a D (passing for my university) and an F and I got a 51. I have never felt so stupid in my life. I don\u2019t get how I can devote a so much time to studying for this class and still not know what to do on the exam. I\u2019m such a fucking dumbass.",

Now you should take a look at your study habits and figure out what went wrong and make the appropriate adjustments to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. Learn from your mistakes",

There are a number of reasons that advisor may have said that to you, (ranging from ignorance to malicious, with nothing positive in between). \n\nBe sure to copy the next level of administration.\n\nSo sorry you experienced this, and best of luck to you.",

On my very first semester one advisor recommended me to take a geometry class (a class that I found out later I didn't even need nor counted towards my degree). Just remembering the out of station tuition I had to pay for that joke of a class, Jesus... Had I known I could, I would have reported her",
