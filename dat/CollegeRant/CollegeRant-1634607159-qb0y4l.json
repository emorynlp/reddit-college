  "title:": "I really kind of hate college.",
  "text": "I've always hated school as far back as I can remember (kindergarten), and my attitude towards it hasn't really improved since childhood. I just don't like classes or studying or the material, it feels like pointless tedium, and I don't care for college culture much either. I'm also a bit older than most undergrads and feel like I can't relate to them whatsoever. I just want to get the piece of paper that shows employers I'm worth a higher salary and move on with my life.",
