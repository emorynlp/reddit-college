  "text": "tw: ed\n\ni feel horrible/invisible after each interaction and no longer want to be around ppl. My mind\u2019s empty and can\u2019t keep up with ppl\u2019s jokes. I wana smoke, cut my hair, buy a bunch of new clothes, ive stopped eating all my meals idk I\u2019m always happy when I feel and know that I look super pretty and i think tht i\u2019ll be able to survive enough in social situations if i look rly good. it just clicks in place when im all made up and skinny like korean idols.. i like being alone but it hurts when i see ppl dont like talking to me its so weird. I was going to go to a meet up next week but i give up.\n\nTL;DR cant socialize, feels invisible, wants to do self-sabotaging activities",

      "text": "There are people who want to talk to you! You might not think so, but our minds can convince us of a lot when we let it. Try to take better care of yourself, your biggest ally in this world is you & you need to have your back. I\u2019ve been where you are, but taking little steps every now and then to show yourself some genuine love and positivity starts some momentum that can take you to great places. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that people in college seem to be a little anti social, and I\u2019ll often WISH i had more people around to talk to - so sometimes I\u2019ll just give someone a compliment just to have a little conversation. People usually don\u2019t like to be the first one to communicate which leaves us all a little lonely, but we can work on that with little steps. Start by working on the relationship you have with yourself. That can be a beautiful one which gives you a lot of happiness!",
