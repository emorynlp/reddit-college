  "text": "So right now for next quarter I\u2019m planning on having 13 credit hours. I always like adding more because I like keeping myself busy but since I go to a Junior military college there\u2019s a lot of other bullshit that takes up my time. I\u2019m also in ROTC and that can take up a lot of time some days too. Am I better off just not giving myself a big course load?",
