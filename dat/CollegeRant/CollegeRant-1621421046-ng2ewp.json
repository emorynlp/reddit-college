  "title:": "Red flags from a college I am re-admitted to. Advisor signed me up for 17 credits without discussing the workload with me. Bad communication. Stressed. SOS.",
  "text": "Yeah, so...I'm likely not going here anymore because this is the final straw. This college has so many issues. I went there in 2018 as a freshman and had a terrible experience (*left in my dorm room during a fire, told I was \"blaming people\" when my advisor gave me the wrong PIN number, & much more)*. I thought I had decided a few months ago to go back. Since then, I have had maaaany problems. For one, they didn't have me in their system so I couldn't sign up for housing. I had to go through a lot of phone calls to get that sorted. My information has been messed up in their system ever since 2018 and every time they \"fix\" it something else is wrong. \n\nYesterday, I had a very stressful experience trying to sign up for classes. I received an email from the school months ago saying to \"look out for an email from advisors\" because they would sign us up for classes at the end of May. So, I waited until the end of May and no email. I sent one a few days ago and my advisor said that I need to sign myself up. Um...okay....so I spent a long time looking through courses and compiling a schedule. Then I emailed the school and asked if I needed a registration PIN since I was under the credit hours that made you able to register without one. They responded saying that I didn't need to have a PIN because my advisor would sign me up. THEN another faculty member chimed in and said she would sign me up (not sure if my advisor was tired of dealing with me or what). When she asked over email what classes I needed, my advisor responded and was like \"we talked about this yesterday...\" and they emailed back and forth discussing classes without giving me time to suggest ones! My advisor originally said that I could choose last few gen eds to fill in the gaps. She ended up registering me for ALL major classes and 17 credits. Keep in mind my advisor just emailed me yesterday saying she strongly recommends against taking 18 credits. I haven't taken more than 10 in 3 years due to health issues. That's a big jump. I planned to take 14. Also, this is not a major where you can easily take a load of courses and not worry about your GPA. It's speech pathology/communication disorders. You NEED a near perfect GPA to even have a chance at grad school. The classes are content heavy and you cannot get a C or below. Also, not that it's their fault, but I have two night classes. One that goes until 7:40 and the other until 9 PM. NINE PM. \n\nI was so confused why they were emailing over me when I was in the email and didn't ask if that was okay with me. The faculty member just asked my advisor, \"she'll be at 17 credits if I add this. should I?\" and my advisor said \"yep.\" \n\nOh, and THEN I reached out to a girl on social media who posted on a FB page for the school and though that talking to another person who was transferring in that same major would make me feel better. Turns out she isn't going anymore because they denied her financial aid even after she got her GPA way up (she was kicked out for low grades) so she's angry with them, obviously, and wasn't set on speech pathology, anyways. That felt like a huge final sign.  I'm just so tired of college. I'm so tired of being talked over and treated like a robot who can do any amount of work given. I'm so tired of colleges ignoring mental health issues. \n\nTL;DR: This college has bad communication and I keep having problems with them. My advisor signed me up for a huge workload in all core/major classes without speaking with me about it. I think I'm going to stay home another year and go somewhere else even if it means I can't pursue that major.",

If there is a school you know for a fact has better admin and professors then transfer but you are making a big inference Herr on the quality of one thing based on another.\n\nJust because the department wasn't proactive in scheduling and doesn't care about your work load doesn't mean you cant take up the planning yourself.",

This school seems like it\u2019s having a lot of issues on an administrative level.\n\nAs an aside, as a morning person myself I understand the frustration about having night classes. That being said, I am in Graduate school right now and *all* of the classes are at night. This isn\u2019t something exclusive to my school either. It\u2019s something that you will have to get used to physically if you want to go to Graduate school.",
