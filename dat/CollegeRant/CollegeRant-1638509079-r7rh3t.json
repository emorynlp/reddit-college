  "text": "Does anyone think college is just not for them? I have been depressed, angry, and constantly sad since move in. My roommates are fine, but I had a falling out with my one close friend from home and I have no one else to talk to. I also have food allergies that my campus provides limited options for, so my diet is horrendous and as a result I have gained a ton of weight. I can't fit into my nice clothes, and the constant poor choices are making me feel tired and my skin break out. I feel embarrassed to leave the dorm.\n\nI also just found out this week that my advisor who I have been trying to contact since July put me on the wrong program. She has either ignored my emails or sent me back irrelevant information. None of my current classes count towards my planned major. We contacted the dean multiple times and they are refusing to take fault. They also never applied my AP test scores, so I don't have the prerequisites needed to apply for spring classes on my account. By the time I realized this (2 minutes after registration opened) I was locked out of 3/5 classes I needed to take. I have been going in circles with the Dean and registrar for about a week now with no luck.\n\nI also feel as if I can't work on this campus. There is too much noise, too many distractions, and I feel so bad all the time my work quality is getting worse every day.\n\nI am also realizing I don't know what I want to do with my life. I thought I wanted to go to med school, but this experience has been so bad I'm worried I won't make it. I think I will end up having some kind of melt down before I can even sign up for the mcat. Any advice?",

      "text": "if you\u2019re able to, i suggest taking a gap year or even gap semester to really weigh your options and think about what you want to do. i\u2019m going through a similar friend situation except it\u2019s 3 of them because i called one of them out for just treating me like shit. college is a time of transition and self discovery, remember, you are your #1 priority; not school, not work, not friends, you are. also, i dont know what year you\u2019re in, but freshman15 is really common. my roommate freshman year gained 30pounds in the span of 4 months and still looked amazing. you\u2019re gonna be ok, i\u2019m sorry to hear how difficult your school is being; i\u2019ve learned colleges don\u2019t really care if they fuck their students over since it means more money for them.",

      "text": "Totally agree with the gap year suggestion. I\u2019d also say take your gap year/semester away from home. It\u2019s challenging, but worth it. \n\nTo get through the semester, I\u2019d recommend taking regularly scheduled workout classes. It\u2019s not for the weight (though weight loss can be a co-benefit) but this is to have an outlet for aggression and frustration from dealing with illogical, bureaucratic administrators. It will help you feel more control over your body and psychologically more control over your life. Also, try to meet with your advisor in person, on zoom, or on the phone. If she is non responsive, then call the office coordinator/go into that building and say \u201cI need to talk to an administrator\u201d someone who is not your advisor will probably be available. Do not be reluctant to be pushy to get what you need.",
