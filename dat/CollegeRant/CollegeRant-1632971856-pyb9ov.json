  "text": "Why do people just sit in the hallways on the floor and block the entire hallway?? There\u2019s literally a nice sized lounge right above us but no they would rather sit on the dirty floor in front of my door. I have a paper to write I don\u2019t want to hear these fucking idiots screaming outside my door and looking at me like I have three heads when I leave my room to go to the bathroom. I literally have to step over them and when I do they\u2019re all like \u201csorry\u201d. Well if you\u2019re sorry then why do y\u2019all keep doing it?\n\nWhy do people act like they\u2019re still in high school? Seriously grow up.",

There were always three sounds:  people having sex, music, or loud girls talking.   \n\nYour mistake is trying to do homework in the dorm.  You should go to the library or empty classroom.   Be careful with empty classroom, I did that and woke in the middle of a lecture.",

I don\u2019t mean talking loud. I mean shrieking like someone was being beaten. The RA never got on to them. But once my roommate and I were watching a movie and quiet hours had started maybe 20 minutes earlier, we didn\u2019t realize, and we both laughed out loud at the movie. We got a knock on the door and the RA told us to be quiet. That was the only time she ever had to get on to us but it was just like really? We laugh one time and are scolded but the girls down the hall scream and cackle all day every day?",

The more I hear about dorm life from people who have experienced it though, the more I realized I dodged a bullet. The crammed spaces, lack of privacy, RA checks, people hanging out right outside your door... yeah hard pass on all of that.\n\nThat said, being in walking distance of classes, and anything else you might need on or near campus, definitely sounds like a big plus.",
