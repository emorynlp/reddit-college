  "text": "Focusing on studying technique or studying efficiency or whatever is energy and time taken away from actually learning the material itself. It is distracting to focus on efficiency rather than the content of the class itself. If it takes you 10 hours to learn something, it is going to take you 10 hours to learn that. You can't rush learning.",

Imagine you are trying to memorize a set of letters, random letters.\n\nS O M B O D Y O N C E T O L D M E\n\nNow it's obvious you can create memory techniques, like signing the letters, so you remember them more easily. Or you can stick with the hard way of learning letters one by one.\n\nChoose yourself. Studying is like everything else, there's multiple ways of doing it right. But that doesn't mean there's no bad ways of doing it",

But when you have told me that you study your material while watching unrelated youtube videos, and being on reddit at the same time - that's not a good study technique/method/whatever. \n\nPeople are just telling you to stop your internet addiction to focus on your studies - they are trying to help you. Even though it will hurt you because of your addiction.",
