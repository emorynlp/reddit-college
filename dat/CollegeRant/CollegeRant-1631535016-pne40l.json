  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a third year transfer student to a university. This was my dream university so right when I got accepted months ago, I started shopping for my stuff. Doing it slowly over time meant that I found the best prices on everything that I wanted and I wasn't spending a big chunk of money at once. We got out roommate assignments 2 weeks ago. We made a group chat and I'm just..put off. There was a major housing shortage so there are 7 of us in a 3 bedroom apartment. My room is the one with 3 people in it. That's fine, but what's irritating me a bit is how some of my roommates are acting.\n\nA few of them are international students. I 100% understand that these girls can't bring pots and pans with them across the world, but stores like Target and Walmart exist for a reason. They literally have deals for college students. Space in our kitchen is not an issue. We have so many cabinets that even if all 7 of us brought in full kitchen materials, they still wouldn't be full. My roommates keep asking in the group chat if anyone is bringing stuff they think is essential. If you're asking for something, you should probably either buy or bring one with you. I bought pots, pans, knives, cups, bowls, utensils and other necessary kitchen things because I plan on cooking most of my meals. I didn't buy enough to share and quite frankly, I don't want to. I don't know these girls and I don't feel comfortable sharing. Like for cups, plates, and utensils, I only bought 2 of each. I plan on washing my stuff right after I use it. I don't wanna share, then come back and see it unwashed or have to wait to use my own stuff. I don't mind sharing things like a vacuum. One of the girls asked if anyone was bringing something and when no one else said anything, she was like \"oh it's fine I'll bring mine\". Like..if you have it, and you want it, just bring it?? why would you ask others for it? She also asked if I was bringing a car because she can't bring hers and thought it would be nice to have one around. The audacity to ask a stranger that is beyond me.\n\nSorry for the long rant. This is just irritating me since I didn't plan on sharing at all. I expected people to bring the stuff they're gonna use instead of expecting others to just bring it for them. We haven't moved in yet. How can I nicely express that I don't want to share? I don't wanna be mean or rude about it. It also isn't like these girls can't afford it. They're all very wealthy, especially the international ones. I just think it's easier to buy a few utensils, a pot and a pan for yourself instead of going around asking others to share with you or taking turns.",

Yeah I would bring your car for you and not anyone else, because if your roommate were to get in an accident, guess who\u2019s name is on the title? \n\nDo not. Under any circumstances. Let anyone drive your car but you. They\u2019re more than welcome to chip in for gas or take public transportation, but I would never let anyone drive my own vehicle (not even my mom lol).",

That\u2019s what I did to save money for three years and to save on moving since some things couldn\u2019t be brought with me.",

      "text": "I can tell it will be a problem. It's already, \"What's yours is mine\". It's in \"our kitchen\". If it were me, I'd probably use paper plates and plastic utensils. Just keep a stash. If you notice others are using it, ask your roommates to chip in on replacements. It would be much easier than fighting it.\n\nI wouldn't bring the car. It will be trouble. Maybe after you have met them and see how they are in person. You might not want to at all. You already have a bad vibe. If you do, you will have to be the one to set boundaries you feel comfortable with. Will you allow others to drive it? Do you want that pressure?  If that's a \"hell no\" then leave it at home. Or be up front about it before you are asked. Gas money? Only say yes to giving a ride if it doesn't infringe on you and your plans.\n\nTry to be pro-active as much as possible. Good luck!",
