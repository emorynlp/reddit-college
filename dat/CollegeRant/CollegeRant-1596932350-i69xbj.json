  "title:": "Anyone else ever had professors that don't reveal grades till the end of the quarter?",
  "text": "I ain't here to shit-talk my professor...Probably....It's just that he fell behind and the only grades we do know are 2 tests we've taken but not our overall grades as we've progressed through the quarter. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience of not knowing grades throughout quarter for the most part? We don't know our grades for homework or labs and we don't know our attendance grades either. Just stresses me out a little cause all I can do is predict \"what if\" situations on what I've gotten (Though I believe I've done pretty well on homework and labs - Keyword *\"believe\"*). Therefore, I don't know how much I need to get on my last chapter test and final exam to pass the class. Of course that won't and shouldn't stop me from trying to do my absolute best on both, but it is a little annoying. Sorry if this comes off as just bitchin and complaining again :/\n\nTL:DR : Professor hasn't given us most of our grades and it kind of puts me in panic mode",

      "text": "holy shit dude i feel. we have 2 ESSAYS  (1750 words each) due in a class of 14 people that make up 90% of our grade. We turned in the first one 2 weeks ago and were told to rest assured that we would get our grades back on Friday. And now we haven't. We still have a few weeks left in the course but having started on the second essay (which basically builds on top of the first one), it would be nice to know what to improve on or have a sense of what not to do. infuriating.",

I've tried to teach myself but Physics whooping the shit outta me cuz he reviews the material instead of actually teaching it. Just aiming for a 70 on tests are hard for me, such as today :/ \n\n(And ik it's not all on the professor for me to learn but I paid $600 for his class, I'd expect for homeboy to be atleast decent at something..Alas this might just be me continuing to bitch and complain tho lmao)",
