  "title:": "Hot Crying Anxious Mess",
  "text": "Title pretty much says it all, I was set to graduate this summer with my degree, after taking ONE last class over the summer semester. I went to check my progress update for the final grade and saw that instead of having my full 120 credits I was setback to only having 114 out of 120 credits. I completely panicked and after contacting the head adviser in my department, I found out that the one class I took this summer, cancelled out TWO transfer classes from when I attended the local community college. No one told me that was going to be an issue when I registered for this summer course. I verified with my personal advisor that I could take any lower level course and that it would set me on track to graduate. Now I\u2019m waiting for the head advisor to contact the Dean to see if there\u2019s something they could do. I had a full blown anxiety attack yesterday and couldn\u2019t stop crying as I was trying to email everyone to figure out what was happening. I feel like all my work is just thrown out the window and that I was majorly fucked over by the college. The head advisor said he would try to do everything he could to ensure that I\u2019d still graduate, but I\u2019m so anxious. I\u2019ve been crying and panicking, I just want my diploma. I worked so fucking hard for it. I\u2019ll fight tooth and nail for this.\n\nTLDR \nThought I could graduate in the summer, instead 6 transfer credits were removed when I took a summer course at the 4 year university.",

      "text": "This is so damn common. There needs to be a regulatory agency that makes sure colleges can't pull this shit. In my first two years of my degree I went to a community college and the college added three classes to an already full two year program without warning. One of the courses required a pre requisite that they only offered in the winter semester and the course needed was also only offered in the fall semester, which was so incredibly ass backwards I couldn't even wrap my head around it. Some students ended up having to take a whole extra year before finishing the \"two year\" diploma program. I ended up getting off the hook because I rained hell on everyone and anyone going so far as to walk into the Dean's office like \"who the hell approved this shit\" and they waved those courses for me but there were a lot of students who couldn't or wouldn't advocate for themselves and ended up having to come back for two semesters for just four courses. It screwed a lot of lives up.",

Honestly I hope your situation is going to be resolved because that is just so disrespectful!\n\nI'd be mad pissed if I had to take a summer class, only to learn that I wouldn't be able to graduate cause of a fuck up.

What took the OP to do in two classes at the first school were evidently covered by just one class at the second.  \n\nIt's strange that the second school took out both classes; usually in a situation like this, the new class would have replaced only one of the old classes, leaving OP with still needing 3 credits.  Then again, it depends on how the transfer credits were accepted when they were originally submitted.",

              "text": "Yup, you pretty much summed it up. Had I known that the classes would\u2019ve cancelled each other I never would\u2019ve taken it. But the adviser told me that any lower level class would work fine, so I followed through with what he told me. The register system never blocked the class or alerted me that it was an apparent repeat. The class numbers don\u2019t even match between the two schools, so I thought it indicated a different level or requirement. Personally, I think the school screwed me over with that. I asked my questions and when I got the answer, I did what they told me. I also think their system needs to be way more supportive for transfer students, especially when they register for courses. This is an absolute nightmare, and to think at this time I would\u2019ve fully completed my credits and gotten my diploma soon.",
