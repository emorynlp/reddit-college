  "title:": "Switching to in-person classes makes me anxious af",
  "text": "I have been 100% online since March 2020. Depending on my schedule, I may have a few in-person classes this spring. I have a love/hate relationship with online classes. A major struggle I have faced is just feeling *alone* lol. So, going back to in-person wouldn't be all that bad. I mean, I do miss being in class and having the ability to connect with classmates/professors. But recently I have felt super anxious about the possibility of switching to in-person. I worry I won't do as well in the classroom setting considering I've basically learned to work on my own and I've done really well tbh. Also, I'm generally anxious when it comes to classroom settings. The thought of public speaking or being called on during class literally makes me nauseous. I know I'll have to go back at some point but I really wish I felt a little bit better about it.",
