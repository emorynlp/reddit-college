  "text": "So Rate My Professor has this guy at basically a 5 and halfwayt through the semester I can't figure why. I'm in his online class so I get no lecture basically. He used to have a really popular stats youtube channel. I tried reading the book he wrote himself (confusing as hell it's all jumbled up gave up on that after week 1) but he also uses videos and they work better then the book. Issue is that his slides have basically nothing on them so I;m constantly rewinding and relistening as I'm desperately to to keep up with what he's saying. And I'm failing hard at this point in this semsester. I was trying to figure out why I'm having such difficulty when I realize this blasted idiot keeps alternating between multiple symbols. In formulas it's written one way and then in practice and on exams it might be the same it might be something completely different so I'm essentially trying to learn Spanish and this guy just keeps randomly throwing Italian words in replacement and then swaps back to Spanish. And I swear if I did a drinking competetion for the amount of times he's said \"Mean of\" I wouldn't be 78% water I'd be 78% alchohol. \n\nTLDR: High rated teacher that no one else has issues with except for me and he keeps swapping between symbols for formulas",
