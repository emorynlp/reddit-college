  "title:": "I feel so awkward and lonely at college",
  "text": "It's like I'm living in 7th grade again, when I moved schools and sat alone and didn't recognize a single person. Not ONE friend went to the same college as me, and I don't know anybody in this city. I had no issues making friends in the past but here it seems like everybody knows somebody already and doesn't need a new friend.\n\nTruthfully, I don't really... care?, for my roommates. I don't hate them, but they're very... not... my type. They're just not, I don't know how to put it. Obnoxious, rude, except for the one who's sweet but doesn't really like me, I think. I was hoping they could be my friends, but. Yeah. It's hard enough trying to make friends as a socially awkward queer girl without moving to a whole new city.\n\nI'm going to enroll in some clubs, I got a job on campus, and I already joined the school's Discord for socializing. That should help a little I hope. I want to find my group of friends that fits me in like a puzzle piece like I did with my high school friends.",
