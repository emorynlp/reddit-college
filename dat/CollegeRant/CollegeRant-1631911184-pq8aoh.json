  "text": "I've been majoring in Computer Science for the past 4 semesters at my school. I thought that I'd like it because I love working with computers, but I've hated everything I've done in this major so far. The thing that sucks is I don't know what I'd do other than this. I am also starting to do pre-calc this semester and I don't understand any of it at all. It also doesn't help that I haven't been to the past three classes cause I just can't get out of bed.\n\nI am starting to get really burnt out because I'm doing trimesters. I have been taking notes and doing homework for the past week and a half all day long, and I'm getting so tired of doing this. I've tried telling my parents this, but they are saying that life is always going to be like this and I should just suck it up and get through college. They're probably right, but I feel like I should be able to express my feelings without getting yelled at. \n\nI also would love to switch schools because I hate the one that I'm at right now, but I can't do that either until I finish my associates (at least that's what my parents are telling me).\n\nI am in a very unique situation where I am getting my entire school paid for by the DRS. This setup is really nice, but I can't take a semester off or anything because if I do they'll stop funding me.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this post. I guess I just needed to vent to someone who won't yell at me for talking about how much I hate the situation I'm in. I think I've just gotten to the point where I'm just done with everything and I want to drop out, get a mediocre job, and vibe. \n\nI don't know if this is the right place to say this, but I have gotten to the point where I've considered killing myself because at least then I won't have to do anymore of this garbage. I really don't know what is wrong with me, everyone else is posting how great college is and I'm over here crying everyday and wanting to die.",

      "text": "Just breath my dude, you sound young and let me tell you it gets better.\n\nComputer science is hard and math is hard until it's not. But the most important thing is too show up for class, even if you fuck around, show up. Never miss a day.\n\nOn the staying in that major part, I myself am on my senior year of my computer engineering degree and it took me 12 years to get here and I haven't changed my major once. I'm a 30 year old fart that took a while to get in the hang of it of school. So take it from me, once you get past the math and physics part it gets so much easier when you hit the upper division stuff, still challenging. Anyways I get the feeling you're farther down the road I was when I was your age. So be proud of what you've accomplished so far , life is gonna be full of difficulty. I call them stress tests , sometimes you'll be ready for them other times you won't, but no stress test is unbeatable.\n\nMissing 3 classes is gonna hurt but depending on what youre doing it can made up, just show up to class, that's like 70 percent of it.\n\nAnyways it's okay to explore different options when you are getting an associate's that's what those years are for, but o\nIf you're like me and won't change your major then the best thing you can do is make friends with the most serious of students , show up to class, and do the homework.\n\nPre-calc is barely the starting line, so know that it does get increasingly difficult, but you have to believe in yourself.\n\nThe 3 words I've adopted on this long ass journey are focus, Patience, and confidence.\n\nFocus: take some time and decide on what you want to do and decide on how your gonna arrive there, the internet has the world's knowledge, take advantage of it and find a destination and a path stick with it. The path can change but stay focused on the destination\n\nPatience: everything good in this life is going to require time and patience, Rome wasn't built in a day. Little by little the bird makes his nest. Skills take time, math is a skill and requires time and patience.\n\nConfidence: you need to believe in yourself that you will be up for this challenge, and that you can do it and see it through. Believe \n\nEvery.single.semester I had a mental break down where I questioned my life choices and gave myself a day to feel sorry for myself. But you should always try and make the next day a better one. Suicide shouldn't be an answer and if you have been thinking about it talk to someone you're close with, it can be anyone, even someone you don't really know.\n\nStrength and vulnerability are two sides of the same coin. To  show your vulnerability to others, cry, talk about your insecurities and worries is also strength. You'll realize that you aren't alone that there are a lot of people feeling the same things that you are feeling right now. Which to me is comforting, you are not alone with what you're feeling right now. By sharing your vulnerabilities with others will give them permission to share thier vulnerabilities. Talk to someone, anyone.\n\nGood luck my dude , whatever you decide to do.",

          "text": "Thanks man that means a lot. Honestly I think I'm just having a bad week and I do think it'll get better. I am going to go to a counselor tho and see if I can get some therapy going because I am starting to get pretty depressed. I'm also going to get a tutor for my math class so that I actually understand what I'm doing.\n\nI've talked to some friends and I've looked at other majors and I've decided that I'm going to stick with computer science. I don't enjoy some of the work I've been doing, but I don't think I'm going to go to find a single major where I enjoy everything I learn in it. I do like some of the classes I've taken. I like in person classes a lot more, but every class I've taken for the past two semesters has been online only, except for my math class. I think I'm going to get my associates at this college and switch to another one after this.\n\nThanks for the comment it was really helpful. I hope you have a good day!",

      "text": "If you enjoy working with computers but dislike coding, you can get IT certifications in college. Or if you enjoy coding but have trouble with certain math, there are associates degrees for software development that don't require many math courses. Also front end web development is a career path a lot of people take without college degrees at all and is a lot different from C++/Java classes you've probably taken. \n\nComputer careers aren't all the same, and if you enjoy working with computers there is for sure something for you out there outside of the typical CS route.\n\nI'm not an advisor, but I know there are a lot of options out there. You should probably speak to an advisor at your school and figure out a plan that works better for you.",

      "text": "Above all else, you should talk to a guidance counselor at your school about all this, as well as a mental health therapist. And then you should talk to the DRS about your funding, and see if it's possible to switch majors or take a semester off for mental health reasons. Don't even worry about your studies, just make talking to those three people your priority.\n\nIt might seem like your trapped in your current situation and there's no way out, but there are always options and alternatives. Seeking professional help will help you get a better picture of what your options are, and what you can do.\n\nIt definitely sounds like you need a semester off from college to recover mentally and figure out what you really want to major in. Switching majors might seem scary, but it's better to do that now as an undergrad than force yourself to get a Bachelors in something you hate doing. Don't make any rash decisions though, talk to a professional before you do anything else.",
