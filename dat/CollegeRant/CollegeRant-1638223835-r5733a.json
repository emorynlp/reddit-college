  "text": "These last two weeks are going to be the end of me.  All of my professors are scrambling to give us the end of the semester homework, project and final. It is just too much. I have 4 homework assignments due today, a project presentation tomorrow, a midterm and project due thursday and the next week isn't any better. I have a final and a project due wedendsay and two projects and final due next friday. This shit is too much. I can't take it. Nothing is fun anymore. Classes aren't fun and it is so stressful. I didn't get a break during thanksgiving because I was working on everything that is due. These professors don't understand that we need a break and can't possibly do everything in a short amount of time. There has to be a better way of doing college than just giving massive amount of work. I am not even learning because i'm so stressed thinking about everything that is due. I can't do it. I just can't take it anymore.",

      "text": "Mate I hear you. I have three exams left for anatomy, a final for statistics, a final for pre-calculus and two exams for micro-economics. All in the space of fricking 2 weeks! I agree with you that there has to be a better way of measuring a student's understanding of the course material that doesn't involve giving a crazy amount of work. \n\nI can't really offer much by way of advice, but just wanted to let you know someone is in the same boat and we're going to get through this.",
