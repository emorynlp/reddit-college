  "text": "College has made me doubt everything in my life and I hate it \n\nSo I'm currently an environmental engineering major and I instantly hated it. It's made me realize I don't want a math based career so I did some research and decided I wanted to do environmental sciences, which is kinda the same thing but I get to work out in the field more. I'm planning on switching next semester but I'm constantly having this gut feeling of \"but what if?\" I had considered going into psychology or kinesiology because those also seems like interesting job fields but I've started second guessing my second guesses \n\nI feel like if leave the STEM majors, I'll be giving up on a dream and leaving because it's too hard and just constantly going back and forth on \"Will this make me happy?\" Is it normal to feel like this? I feel like I'm going insane. I've always had a plan or an idea of how I'm going to handle things in life but for the first time, I feel uncertain. I honestly just wish someone would tell me what will fulfill my life",
