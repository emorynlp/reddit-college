  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nI'm starting my 3rd year in Computer Science, and I'm regretting taking CS. I don't like this field at all. I'm having a lot of trouble learning CS. However, I'm interested in Biology, and I've self-learned Molecular Biology. There are a lot of Master's involving CS and biology like bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, etc. I've learned python but I'm not interested in coding. I've seen a lot of CS students doing Arts for their Master's. I'd like to know if there are careers in biology and healthcare-related.\n\nThanks a lot!",

I\u2019d been out of school for some time so I picked up my calculus and principles classes one at a time while I worked; some programs may ask you to do a qualifying year, or you can just take some courses at a local community college or four year college if you want to save some money.",
