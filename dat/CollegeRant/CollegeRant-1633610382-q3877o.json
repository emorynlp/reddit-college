  "text": "I just attended college this year, and I\u2019m on my first semester (freshman year), and I\u2019m majoring in Interior Design. I had a bad experience with my professor in technical drawing class. She\u2019d always gave us heaps of assignment without explaining anything. She only explained the general without going deeper on the subject, and it leave us, the students, confused. We\u2019ve tried searching on YouTube or Google but come back empty handed. \n\nBecause she didn\u2019t teach us properly, only about 5 or 6 out of 40 people that actually understand. 10 of us (including me) decided to create a group where we study together and so on.\n\nWhen we submitted our assignments later, she\u2019d gave harsh criticism to us, insult us, and using rather hurtful words. She\u2019s bitching about how this and that wrong, and only then she would explain the more detailed steps on how to fkn draw an orthographic drawing. She even blocked her students on WhatsApp just because she wants her students to contact her on Teams chat. And she\u2019d always use sarcasm when answering students questions, making us all feel dumb.Very AWFUL. \n\nAll of my classmates hates her and call her names behind her back. :/\n\nHow to deal with this type of professor? I need some tips, cause it\u2019s affecting my mental health and my grades.",

      "text": "A lot of your concerns are too generalized to give proper advice. For example a lot of students claim that their professor insulted them when in actuality they just received poor critique of an assignment. The only specific incident I see is blocking students on WhatsApp which is a completely profession thing to do, students need to contact professors through the proper channels. If you want better advice you'd have to give more detailed explanations of the incidents.",

So the other professor use several platforms, which are Teams, Gmail, and Whatsapp, to communicate with us, their students. The other professors allowed us to contact them using WhatsApp, and answers all of our questions nicely using polite words. However, this one professor is the only one that being sensitive and decided to block us all without informing us or explaining anything. She didn\u2019t even say that we couldn\u2019t contact her via WhatsApp beforehand. I don\u2019t understand her :/",

You would have to check with the university's guidelines for contacting professors.\n\nFor example I would only communicate with students through the university E-mail system and only to their university assigned E-mail. This was school policy, not my personal decision. Another professor might respond to a student's Gmail account, but that doesn't mean I had to.",

She could\u2019ve made an announcement before on a discussion board or informing us that she didn\u2019t want to communicate with us using WhatsApp :(",

Inappropriate communication between a student and professor is a legal liability. At my school, professors should only be interacting with students through the official school email (so no WhatsApp, Facebook, etc). For example, if a student emails me through their personal, non-school Gmail, I reply to them using their official school email (which also happens to be a Gmail client). FERPA (a policy here in the US to protect student data) doesn't allow me to discuss school work with students except via official email.",
