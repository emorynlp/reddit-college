  "text": "I have to do a 3-page reflection paper by Thursday. Yeah, it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s a freshman class. Was going to try to start on it today, but guess what, of course Word doesn\u2019t work and says my account isn\u2019t activated. Guess I have to email about that tomorrow along with all of the other shit I have to do. Felt like depressed shit all day (the whole summer, really) and the one time I try to do something to make things easier for myself, (get an early start on an easy assignment) of course it doesn\u2019t work out. Lmao whatever, probably not going to do it when this class should have been the easiest fucking A, but of course my shitty problems get in the way. Of course.\n\nTLDR: oh yeah, it\u2019s all crashing and burning.",

But realistically you can get it done don\u2019t worry just stick to it! You\u2019ll just have to check there is good structuring of the paper if necessary but it\u2019ll be in word and should look the same unless you type elsewhere. Don\u2019t give up!!",
