  "text": "Been in bed all weekend from the worst allergies I\u2019ve had in years, lost my house keys yesterday, found my laptop screen cracked today, and the repairs are going to cost almost half the price of the damn machine, might not be fixed until the weekend, and I have a project due this Monday. It\u2019s really not a lot of things but it\u2019s one thing after the other in such a short period of time when I really do not have the money or time for this. I am one flat tire away from self imposed murder at this point",
