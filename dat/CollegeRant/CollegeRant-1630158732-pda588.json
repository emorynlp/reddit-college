  "text": "ohhhhh booooyyyy\nI will preface this by saying I\u2019m sitting down with her today to really discuss some rules, but I have to get this off my chest. When my roommate and I initially met online and agreed to room in the dorms together, I thought (based on how she presented her lifestyle) that we\u2019d be really compatible together. She\u2019s really sweet, but I was definitely wrong in thinking she\u2019d be good to live with. I was just woken up for the 5th time tonight by her making loud phone calls in the room. I firmly asked her to take them in a common area after the first 2 at 3 am, but apparently she didn\u2019t really take to that. \n\nShe\u2019s international, and now having had the chance to buy what she needs, still none of my belongings feel like my own. I\u2019ve lent her almost everything so far, which I was totally cool with the first couple days, but now she\u2019s making no effort to buy her own things. Simple things like phone chargers she didn\u2019t seem to anticipate needing. \n\nI rode the bus with her for 45 minutes each way to get her SIM card and then later in the night I ended up having to walk back alone from the frat parties she physically dragged me to (I mean really gripping and pulling my arm). I\u2019ve always been taught that, as a girl, you always walk back with someone/make sure they have someone to walk back with when they want to leave. I also turned off all the lights (which she forgot to do) after she came in and flipped them on at 2:30. \n\nI definitely understand that it might be a cultural difference, but I\u2019m so tired of her looking over my shoulder all the time to ask what I\u2019m working on/doing on my phone. It\u2019s a miracle I can write this without her watching and feels like such an invasion of my little privacy to begin with. \n\nI\u2019m so ready to truly talk to her about everything today, but it\u2019s been terrible dreading going back to my dorm every time since moving in. I also feel bad because she seems to think we\u2019re getting along really well and it\u2019s my fault for making it seem that way. (Any tips on firmly putting rules in place are appreciated \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nTL;DR roommate invades my personal space, property, put me in a potentially dangerous situation having to walk back alone, and makes phone calls in the middle of the night next to me",

I had to join them to avoid suspicion of me hating them disturbing me or ruining the fun. But now im back home studying online because of COVID. Soon we will be back to face to face, fuck me....I can only imagine it will make my schedule all fucked up and getting bad grades",
