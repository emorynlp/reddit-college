  "text": "This is so expensive I just cant do this anymore with these extra expenses.. from the gas, to the parking, random school fees such as supplies and shit. I had never had more money staying my ass at home. To the point where I say able to save $4k towards my debt. I'd be lucky if I could save a mere $25 in my current state.\n\nToday I was carrying all my things and because my skirt has no pockets (fun being a girl right) I dropped my phone and now it has led bleed. I cant even proof read this post right now the phone is basically unusable. And I'm broke cause I bought an iPad for my portfolio with klarna. Yeah im an idiot.\n\nBut its like damn if I was just in zoom class my phone wouldn't have hit the concrete. And I know Correlation does not imply causation, but im at my wits end cause even if I broke my phone in my room I'd have some spare cash for a new one.\n\nSo I sit here blaming alot of things like trusting the sprint employee when they said liquid screen protectors work. Or not taking two trips to get all my things in the car. But I always focus on in person class because I just fucking hate how expensive it is indirectly or directly.\n\nSo I ask yall. Should I dip into my savings to get a new phone or wait till I can afford one? I'm not a big fan of the apple UI interface so I want to get my exact Samsung phone again. Thanks for reading imma go kms.",
