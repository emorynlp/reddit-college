  "text": "You seriously believe most students don't know what clubs are? To get into college these days, you have to do clubs in high schools. In most cases, clubs are meaningless for making friends. It ultimately doesn't help you more than taking classes with random people.",

      "text": "The majority of clubs don't require doing a high school equivalent other than like sports ones, most of them are centered around lifestyles, hobbies, or certain majors. You can't expect to make friends if you never put yourself out there, its not like the movies where you just suddenly end up with a solid group of people and a girlfriend by them dropping on your lap.",
