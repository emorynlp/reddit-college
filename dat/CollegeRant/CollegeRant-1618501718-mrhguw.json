So most professors gave out extensions except mine. Our assignment was due the next day and she said there is no excuse and there was so many students complaining. I'm 100% on her side though",

I'm an Education major and if you know anything about my peers is that they love to ask for extensions, or will complain about their course load. I have noticed that most of the students in my program constantly \"have breakdowns\" (they bring it up to the professor like it's a merit badge and not an actual mental issue) and I'm just wondering how they are going to make it as teachers.",

I know it's a good habit to turn things in/finish early, but I think we've all had moments where we ended up waiting til the last minute because of having to do work from other classes or jobs or other activities that make it difficult to do that. Hopefully the professor is understanding. It's one thing when one students power goes out. It's another when the entire campus does",

I often, even if I got an assignment done a few hours early, wouldn\u2019t submit it until around 30-15 minutes before it was due, just in case I thought of something I wanted to add or change before submitting. I hated the finality of it. No more changes. Terrifying. \n\nAs an instructor now, though, my deadlines are more like guidelines and I allow revisions on every assignment and late submissions for no penalty. I hated that feeling as a student and didn\u2019t want anybody else to have to experience it.",
