I\u2019m HS, I was the mid-tier AP try-hard (should have done ccp) and then went to a community college to save money and develop as an adult. Was super depressed my first year and fails a few classes. Long story short, it took me 3 years to graduate a two year program with a 3.6 gpa. Managed to get into my dream school studying material science and engineering but ended up getting dismissed because my work-life balance (I worked, and got super involved on campus) was horrible and I thought I could slide with the same work habits that have gotten me to that point.
