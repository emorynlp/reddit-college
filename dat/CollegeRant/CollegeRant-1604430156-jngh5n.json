  "text": "I absolutely hate being in an online lecture and then my professors say \u201ctime to work in break out rooms\u201d. You then get randomly assigned to people you don\u2019t know, in a small group and have to work on class activities with them for the rest of class. Some classmates don\u2019t ever respond or show their face, and most of the time no one was paying attention to the instructions.  Half the time one of the group mates try to share their screen and it takes like most the time figuring that shit out. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky to find a friend in your room but most of the time it\u2019s just people I don\u2019t know. Once you\u2019re done talking and working, it\u2019s awkward silence and you\u2019re just waiting for the professor to bring you back to the whole class lecture. I\u2019ve had 1 fun break out room and that was it. Breakout rooms are awkward as hell, you don\u2019t learn anything and I would rather do a live class discussion or just more hw at this point.",

We are all f'd up right now. We r all tryin to do our best but what defines 'best' in these f'd times? All I care about is each of my student's well-being. You guys should neither have to suffer through shite online teaching bs nor have to worry about your grades during this time. You guys should all get As because you made it.",

It was great and he\u2019s the only professor who really got the structure right in my experience",
