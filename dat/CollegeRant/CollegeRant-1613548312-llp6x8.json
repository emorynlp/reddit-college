      "text": "I remember going through a tough semester my first semester fundamentals of my program. I had 5 mandatory co-req classes plus a lab plus clinicals and lab hours and study time, plus tutors etc. man, I had to loose sleep in order to keep up- I sounded like a lunatic saying things like \u201cthere\u2019s just not enough time!!\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m running out of time!\u201d To my mom as she tells me to get some sleep at 3 in the morning. That semester was really damaging and I had to take mental heath days after the semester ended because I was way past exhausted. All Tests fell under the same weeks. 5 exams in one week each exam being administered then finals. It\u2019s was like experiencing finals week 4 times over that semester.\n I slept maybe a whole week after that semester ended and it gave me ptsd for school. I dreaded going back that spring, but I did much better with way less stress. This was fall 2019, I\u2019m doing far much more better now.\nBut what I\u2019m really trying to say is - I feel you with what you\u2019re talking about. I remember feeling like wishing that I could freeze the day to study.",
