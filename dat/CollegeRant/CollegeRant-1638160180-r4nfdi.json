  "text": " \n\nHi guys , gals, and non bianary pals\n\nI just need to vent for a moment, and kinda get some advice. So, this is my 5th year in collage as a whole and my third year at the current college I am at. I never have had major problems with housing at the college I am at now, until this year. This is mostly due to the fact that my bff and really only true friend graduated this spring (2021) and kinda left me high and dry with no friends. Until this point, I was fine with the living situation I was in (a mostly freshman dorm) because I had her and a few other friends in the building with me.\n\nThis year has been way diffrent. I dont know if it is because the pandmic effected a lot of them but freshman this year are far diffrent. I feel like more drauma has popped up and ppl are just more catty. I bring this up because I am kinda struggling at the moment. I am far older than the other students (I am around 23 while most are 17-19) and I dont feel respected. The RA's are pretty good but just get a little anoyed. I have to go to the meetings for the floor that go over rules and procedures thhat at this point I know like the back of my hand, and I deal with so many of them asking questions about basic stuff. I get they are new but I just dont feel like i should have to deal with this.\n\nI just feel kinda isolated and alone because even the ra's in the building have been in school less time than me. I am really glad its almost the end of the semester, because home is good. I have more acsses to my friends and socil network there and feel respected.\n\nI just can not afford an appartment rn and most of the upper classmen dorms are just party and weed heveay.\n\nadvice?",
