  "text": "Tw: implied and explicit mental health content\n\nI'm fortunate that my parents can help me pay for college. The thing is that I am going only because they said so. I intended to work after college just so that I can have some time to figure out my life while getting so money. I told them this, but they said I was a failure in life and was a disappointment. They were the first in the family line to complete college, so i understand why I am a disappointment to them. I gave into that pressure.\n\nDoesn't help that I am already a disappointment. I'm not going for a stem degree. Doesn't help that I have poor mental health (i have to work to pay for my own therapy). They don't know that's why I work. I used to have some diagnoses and told my parents. They had a horrible response to it that worsened it. So i lied about getting better to make them happy. I suffered because of it.\n\nNow im paying for my actions. I have to stack up my classes to graduate on time because they saved up enough for \"on time.\" Im failing my classes though because all these GEs are difficult (the specific classes are required for the major program, but are subjects that aren't related to the major subject). I'm also working because I have to pay for therapy. I know I have to because if I don't have therapy, i know I will end up taking my own life. \n\nIm stressed. Im confused. Im lost. I need help.",

If you have to take a semester off cuz of your mental health that\u2019s ok. If they try and take your college money away apply for financial aid or loans.",

Nothing anyone here can say will change that. \n\nBut THERE WILL be a time in your life where you won't worry about what's happening now. No matter how your college story ends, you will move past it, life will go on, and you will find happiness. It sucks now but that is not permanent.",
