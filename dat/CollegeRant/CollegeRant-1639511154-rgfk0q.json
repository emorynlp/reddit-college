  "text": "I work a full time job so I can pay for college and my other bills. Unfortunately, my scheduled time to work conflicted with my final and I explained this to my professor that I need to work to keep paying my bills. He completely didn\u2019t understand and did not allow for me to schedule a different time to take the test.  The class is online so it\u2019s not like it is that hard for him to send it to me for a retake. I just wish professors understood we have more priorities than just their class.",

The Registrar is responsible for booking and managing the exam timetable and unless there are excruciating circumstances, they will not change the exam time. \n\nAlso, it is the University\u2019s assumption that school is a priority over a job, especially during exam time. \n\nYou could contact your department head or your Dean.",

They're not an individual thing: the same exam is being given to everyone at once, and the integrity of the exam relies upon no students being able to communicate to another group of students what is on the exam. You can't just do it a few days early, of you might be able to tell others in the class exactly what's on it, giving them an unfair advantage. Or vice versa, getting information from others giving you an unfair advantage if your exam is after. \n\nUltimately \"you need to be available to take exams as scheduled by the registar's office during the exam period\" is one of those non-negotiable aspects of being a university student.",
