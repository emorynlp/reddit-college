  "text": "I work a full time job so I can pay for college and my other bills. Unfortunately, my scheduled time to work conflicted with my final and I explained this to my professor that I need to work to keep paying my bills. He completely didn\u2019t understand and did not allow for me to schedule a different time to take the test.  The class is online so it\u2019s not like it is that hard for him to send it to me for a retake. I just wish professors understood we have more priorities than just their class.",
