  "text": "I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t allowed, I\u2019ll remove it if it\u2019s not supposed to be here. I just didn\u2019t know where else to post this.\n\nI have a physics exam tomorrow that I know I\u2019m going to fail. I had a pchem exam and an orgo 3 exam a few days ago and after taking them, I just burnt out and didn\u2019t study for physics at all. I\u2019m so tired and I just need a break. This semester is killing me. I\u2019m losing weight from stress and I\u2019m exhausted all the time and I just needed to take a weekend off but now I\u2019m feeling guilty for knowingly not trying. I just hate that college culture is working through burn out at the expense of your health.\n\nWe have four exams in physics, the lowest is dropped, and I\u2019ve gotten over 100 on the first two because of the curves. I know that my grade is going to be okay but I just need someone to tell me that I\u2019m not stupid for burning out and needing a break.\n\nTL;DR I\u2019m a perfectionist and I need someone to tell me it\u2019s okay to mess up.\n\nEDIT: I just really want to thank everyone who commented for the support. Since we\u2019re remote, I don\u2019t get as much support from my friends so this was very needed. It means so much to me and you all really helped feel better about this.  You\u2019ve made it easier to pick myself back up. I have a week off for thanksgiving break before my next exam and I promise all of you that I\u2019ll crush the next one. Thanks guys.",

      "text": "hey, I just want you to know that every student fails an exam at least once in their lifetime. I've failed a number of exams, and I've failed three classes before, all math related. And I ended up at a competitive university that was my dream school and am on track to grad school. that's not to toot my horn or anything (for real,) it's just to show that you can still be successful even though you've failed at something. sometimes, you need to fail multiple times at first to succeed in the end. don't lose hope, and take care of your mental and physical health right now. get yourself a break, a real one. as a student, i'm personally always doing homework, always checking my email, and always organizing pretty much every day of the week. what I started doing is giving myself one full day of the week where I get to intentionally relax and do nothing school related. a day where i don't feel guilty doing so. i do this especially after exam days. you could even do a half day but just know that you are not stupid for burning out, and that it's OKAY to take a break. now go close your laptop and do something you enjoy <3",

I was feeling like absolute garbage, but life must go on and I passed the class on my second try. And now I\u2018m much more relaxed, because I know it\u2019s actually not that bad to fail a class, it does not define you or your worth as a person. And it sounds like your exam isn\u2018t even about passing or failing a class, it\u2018s just about having a good or an excellent grade, so you really shouldn\u2018t worry too much. Or at least try to.",

I thought I did all my work during the week (which I purposely did so that I could finally have a weekend off) but somehow I missed it and didn't know about it til yesterday when I got a text alert reminder. I just needed to get myself together this weekend so I've actively chosen to just not do it and although I feel kinda guilty since I can be a perfectionist when it comes to school as well. I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T study. HOWEVER, if you're burnt out and not gonna retain anything then try to at least get some rest. It happens. Especially this time of year when work is getting cramped in since the end of the semester is approaching (even though it doesn't feel like it)",
