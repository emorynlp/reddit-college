  "text": "My math final was proctored over zoom and the whole time I was trying to take it my zoom kept reconnecting and saying error and I couldn\u2019t get the site we take tests on to load correctly. Literally drove to the library during the exam and by the time I had stable internet it was over - teacher offered me a makeup and i slept through it bc I stayed up writing essays and literally passed out \n\nSECOND my political science teacher assigned a research paper as the final..which was due the next day at noon. Seriously I\u2019m a freshman but that can\u2019t be okay. He didn\u2019t give us a very clear set of directions on how to write it but I think it\u2019s meant to be like at least 5 pages and he gave us less than 24 hours to do it? WHAT\n\nI worked so hard to get my grades up after midterms and was about to pass every class and my entire GPA most likely went to shit in the last 3 days because of this. Pls do not let me fail",

      "text": "A 5 page take-home final with a 24 hour deadline is pretty lax, in my view. \n\nI used to assign a take-home final that was three 6-8 page papers that had to be turned in within 72 hours.  Students would be given five prompts on the final exam and they had to write a 6-8 page paper on three of them.",
