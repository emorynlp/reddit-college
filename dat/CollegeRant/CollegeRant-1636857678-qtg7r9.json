  "text": "I\u2019m taking a criminal justice class right now with the worst workload I\u2019ve ever had. The teacher assigns a chapter of the textbook weekly, which is normal. But on top of that, she\u2019s had us read 3 novels at a super-fast pace. I enjoy reading, even textbooks, and that\u2019s never been my source of frustration in a class before. This last novel we are reading is driving me insane because so far every chapter covers the same things that have been covered by either the textbook or other two novels, and it\u2019s way wordier and hard to focus on. The author keeps repeating herself.\n\nOn top of that, her grading criteria are really confusing. She takes off points for requirements she didn\u2019t specify (I once got points off for not mentioning a character from a novel by name when the question wasn\u2019t even directly about the novel, even though I did reference a character and just didn\u2019t use his name, for example). She takes off extra points from our 4 essays if we make the same \u201cmistake\u201d more than once, but doesn\u2019t give specific information on what our mistakes were. I got extra points docked for not having my reference formatted correctly, and when I sent it to the writing tutors they said it was correct for the formatting. I was docked in one essay for having too much summary and not enough of my opinion, and in the next for the opposite when I tried to lean the other way. \n\nI emailed her earlier in the semester about the unclear rubric for our discussion posts, not in a rude way, I just said something wasn\u2019t clear and suggested making it clearer for future assignments. I didn\u2019t even ask for points back. I\u2019ve never gotten a response to any of my emails or comments. There\u2019s just so much reading and writing in this class compared to every class I\u2019ve taken before (4th year). It\u2019s online which I\u2019m used to, but she doesn\u2019t post lectures or share videos or anything. It\u2019s all just so much reading. I only have 3 more weeks but it feels like so long, and theres still 2 essays left. It isn't a higher credit class or anything, its the same as all of my other courses... it's an elective and its not even required. I wish I'd read the professor's reviews on rate my professor before I took the class because they're awful.\n\nEdit for tl;dr: class has 4 essays and 3 novels, plus textbook, workload and reading amount is insane. Teacher grades inconsistently and only provides reading, no other materials or lectures. I want to rip my hair out because of it.",

      "text": "The class being an elective for you has nothing to do with the workload. For other students in the class, it might be required for their major.\n\nThis actually doesn't sound like that much reading to me. A standard reading load for an upper division literature or history class is usually one monograph or novel each week, and a couple supplemental chapters or articles to frame the text.",

          "text": "It\u2019s in my major as an elective, limited to people in the major but not required. For a literature class I would understand, and I\u2019ve taken classes with a lot of reading including literature courses, but the books are quite long as well. It\u2019s around 200 pages a week, plus all the other class work. The main reason I\u2019m complaining is because the last book, which she is assigning at the same time as the last two essays which are due on the same day, has no new information in it. It was framed slightly differently at points, but overall was the same content.",
