  "title:": "7-10 page research paper draft for English class due in 3 and a half hours and i have written just the introduction :) i also have a presentation to do tomorrow for my communications class",
  "text": "before you tell me that i should be working on my essay rather than posting on reddit: i know :) i\u2019m stupid and procrastinated on this a bit too much and now. im so lost on what to do\n\ni feel really paralyzed. i can\u2019t work on this stupid essay i\u2019ve been desperately looking for research from my school\u2019s library database to cite and mold to my thesis but i just can\u2019t. research is way too hard and frustrating and i feel like giving up and at this point i\u2019m just sitting watching the hours tick away till the deadline. i feel so incredibly paralyzed and hopeless i know it\u2019s just a draft but i need to finish as much as i can for adequate feedback from my prof that i can use for the final draft just god someone please help me i just needed to get my feelings out there i feel like i\u2019m drowning in so much work and i can\u2019t do anything about it i know it\u2019s just a draft but my perfectionism is hurting me to the point where i just can\u2019t write and i feel like what i put out is not going to be good at all\n\nEDIT: okay wow i didn\u2019t expect this post to get the traction it did?? anyway though i feel relieved to hear that many of you are in the same boat!! and for those wondering i did manage to turn in the essay draft. it\u2019s not complete, but more complete than i thought it would be! and i also did my presentation today and managed to do something half decent at least.\n\ni\u2019m pretty sure the final draft isn\u2019t due till next week, but i plan to work on it this week so i won\u2019t panic when it comes time to turn it in. this is the last real assignment that i need to do, so after i\u2019m done with this i\u2019m done with this english class.\n\nthank you all for your support and advice!! and for those of you that are struggling like i was with the draft, we\u2019ll get through this. the semester is almost over; we just need to stay strong and work as hard as we can! \ud83d\udcaa",

Use google scholar. It gives you the widest array of research. However you also should use your library database as well for a more nuanced look at what you're looking for. I noticed that you're searching for something about happiness and family time (?) so type in society AND family time or happiness AND family or something like that, not your entire thesis statement. Look at every article that's title seems to be something about what you're working on!\n2. If you come across an article that you can't access and your school doesn't have access, DO NOT PAY FOR IT!! Read the abstract, see if it has some type of similarity with what you're studying. If it does use this website\n\n[https://sci-hub.se/](https://sci-hub.se/)\n\nIt removes all of the barriers for the article and most likely has the article you need in a full PDF! I've been using it forever and it has not failed me yet. Just make sure to type in the DOI because that usually gives me better results over just the article title.\n\n3) Great you have the article in full but there's no way you can read this many articles in this short amount of time, that's were this website comes in.\n\n[https://www.skimcast.com/](https://www.skimcast.com/)\n\nThis website highlights the most important points of an academic article. IT MAY miss some things so it is not 100% perfect. If you're really trying to be smart and have time, read one article in it's entirety and then read it with a 30% skim and see how much it misses to see how much skim it takes you to \"get\" the gist of the article. I feel comfortable around 35% because some of the tertiary points get missed with just 30%. Read the highlighted stuff and see if the gist of the article makes sense, cite it and BAM! By no time you'll have enough research to feel comfortable talking about it in your paper!\n\nGood luck happy researching !",

Reach out to your professor and express how you\u2019re having a really hard time with research, maybe they can help give you pointers, and turning in a thesis will at least help them know what direction you want go in. As long as you\u2019re putting in effort no one can be mad at you. I believe in you :)",
