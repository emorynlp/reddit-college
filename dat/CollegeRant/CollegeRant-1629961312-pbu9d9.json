  "text": "You see, im a person who prefers to finish tasks fast so i can do my study planning more effectively and efficiently. But most of my group members are lazy and they prefer to finish things last minute. As a group leader(always because no one wants to be one), i need to adjust my time to fit with them. But this always resulting in me not having enough time to study for my exam. Like for example, next week is my exam and why am i still doing this fucking assignment now? I should be studying for the exam.\n\nWorst case scenarios is when they decided to help me but when i checked it, everything is wrong and i had to do amendment for all of it, like if i were to do it solo, i would have finish this shit 2 weeks ago. They literally put zero effort in it and expect me to clean up their mess WHEN they can have the free time to study for the coming exam.\n\nBULLSHIT, FUCK GROUP ASSIGNMENT. I have 5 group assignments across 5 subjects this semester, hopefully i will survive this",

Everyone got full mark too, but last semester i got less workload so im fine with it. Looking not so good this semester, i took 5 subjects, 1 group project each.",

      "text": "Group work in college is fucking awful and does a very poor job of preparing one for group work in a workforce setting. Sometimes that can have it's own share of problems, but even at its worst, it's better than college group work. Most college group projects are one person jobs with forced collaboration. Anyone who thinks group essays in particular are a good idea I'd like to hit with a baseball bat from a moving car.",

In real job, if your team member refuses to do anything or just being extremely lazy, just report them to high up and they will get fired.
