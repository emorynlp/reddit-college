  "text": "I struggled with acne through middle school and the beginning of high school. I was put on medication and it cleared up. Now that I\u2019m in college, it was flared up a again at full force and nothing I am doing is helping. I guess I am going to have to go back on medication which I can\u2019t even do until winter break. It just really sucks I thought I was done with this but I guess not.",

      "text": "I'm sorry :( I also struggle with acne, mostly whiteheads and some cystic as well. I'm not sure how severe your acne is, but I would reccomend cleansers with salicylic acid, a good moisturizer, and sunscreen. This has helped reduce my acne and scars so much. \n\nI'm sure you've already tried but maybe you can try researching the Ordinary products, or Curology as those brands have been recommended to me by peers with more severe acne. I also heard Tretinoin is really good for acne. I hope your breakouts can settle down soon.",

      "text": "i've had severe hormonal cystic acne since 2016 and have tried everything but the one trying that has worked the most is the renee rouleau anti bump solution. I would recommend it to anyone. It is usually $50 but it lasts about 4-5 months. this solution works better than anything i've used because it penetrates deep into the cyst, unlike other treatments. hope this helps :)",

      "text": "I am so sorry. I struggled with acne too all during middle school and when I went on birth control in college it came back, but hormonal. I recommend going to definitely see a dermatologist which it sounds like you already plan on doing. Until then just be kind to yourself. Exercise, feed your body good foods, drink lots of water, lots of sleep, and allow yourself to relax. Acne doesn\u2019t make you any less beautiful despite what anyone may say. It will get better! \u2764\ufe0f",
