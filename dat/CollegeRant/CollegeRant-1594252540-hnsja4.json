  "text": "Ok so Im 21(f) I did terrible in high school. I barely graduated by going to an alternative school at the very last minute. and I had a terrible gpa. Because of this no one ever showed me how to apply for scholarships, or apply for school. I\u2019m completely lost and I just want to go to school. I want to tattoo and have an apprenticeship. I already went and got my hand, head and face tattooed so I don\u2019t even know if teaching is still an option for me. But I want to get a degree for teaching, as well as just some art classes to further my tattooing abilities. I know 2020 is a weird year for colleges in the us but Im determined to start soon. I\u2019m just looking for any advice on how to even get started on my college journey. Thank you.",

      "text": "your tattoos are only going to be a problem if the person hiring you has a problem with them. my principal has a face tattoo, lol, and dresses in this amazing style that i can only describe as chic-goth. i, myself, have several tattoos all over my body, from my calf all the way up to behind my ear - including several on both hands. it\u2019s never been a problem for me, and neither have my one-inch stretched ears. you just have to find an accepting environment, let your credentials speak for themselves, and know your rights. \n\nhigh school gpa doesn\u2019t really factor in once you have an undergrad or graduate degree; they\u2019re going to be looking at your gpa while at university. so if you bust your butt and get a good gpa through undergrad and grad school, that will speak for itself. \n\nlearn from your previous mistakes! you can grow from them. \n\nas for scholarships, any university you apply to has academic advisers that can help you apply for financial aid and scholarships.",
