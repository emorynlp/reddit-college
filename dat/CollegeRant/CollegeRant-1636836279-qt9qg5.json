  "text": "I know it is just fiction, but I really dream of it for some reason. It is just so sad that real life is not like in the movie. The reality is that college is a boring hard time where most people are busy, so it is super hard to make any friends. I never been invited to a single party. Life just sucks overall.",

Best is to make friends at those parties as well.",

      "text": "It's because college is literally adults trying to balance everything. You can fix this, but you actually need to be willing to socialize. One of the best pieces of advice I got in college was this (in regards to social life) \"If you eat at the school cafeteria, find a group of people, ask if you can sit with them, and START TALKING. Even if it's small talk like weather, how classes are going, favorite subjects, etc.\" this way you're engaging other people and might make friends.  \nAnother great way to make friends is join one or two clubs about a subject you really like (most colleges/universities have multiple clubs) and make friends that way. Join facebook groups dedicated to your college and see if you can make friends that way and/or find other social media groups connected to our college that way. A lot of schools also have discords now.  \nAt the end of the day, socializing in college is COMPLETELY ON YOU. Talk to people in class. Go to a club event. Talk to people while walking to class. Talk to people in the cafeteria.  \n**I never went to a party at college and still ended my degree with a nice close group of people because I joined clubs.**",
