  "text": "Hello  there. I'm what in english is call a ''freshman'', I'm at my 2nd  semester of Law and I just wanted to share my experience, or kind of a  rant, if you wish, in terms of my whole experience as a student from a  developing country\n\nEnter a public  university in 2020, during the first few months of the year before the  COVID pandemic struck. Spend, probably, about 4 months total in  face-to-face classes. The experience was somewhat disappointing. I don't  know what it's like at other universities, but if you quickly google  what the experience is like at English-speaking universities, most of  them tend to agree that it's a bit more liberating, full of  responsibilities, but at the same time flexible and allows you to  explore and choose your dreams/interests. That's not what happened to  me. On the contrary, college feels like high school 2.0, but now on  legendary difficulty. Still, I tried my best and even became class  president during my first semester. Fast forward a bit and now we have  COVID, which forced us into one of the worst educational experiences  I've ever had in my life: online classes.\n\nMy  country has a mediocre infrastructure, but its educational system came  to the fore as soon as we were forced to change our teaching method.  Teachers, to this day, have been unable to adapt to this new environment  despite having better resources than the vast majority of students in  public universities. We have daily internet problems, sectors of cities  or towns are without power for hours, and sometimes days at a time.  Teachers don't let you make no excuses for such circumstances and blame  you if you fail to turn in your homework, assignments, exercises, and  even exams. Did your internet fail in the middle of an online test? Too  bad.\n\nOh, and most homework must be  done by hand. Pen and paper. And then we have to scan them somehow and  send it in. In short we do twice the work for half the reward. Well,  that's the annoying thing, but now the worst thing: the teachers are  incredibly mediocre, and this is something that worries and annoys me  seriously. Some teachers make excuses for not teaching ''Oh, my internet  is down, I won't be teaching, so I'll leave you an assignment. However,  we are not allowed to have internet failures. Somehow that is up to us  )? Incidentally, classes have become more conversations and rants about  how lazy, useless and disappointing we students are. Every day, every  class, has become a fight between teacher vs. student. Synergy is  non-existent and some teachers have told us to our faces that they have  no patience for us.\n\nI'm honestly  thinking about dropping out of college. I don't see a future in this.  Considering that my country is incredibly corrupt, bureaucratic and  mediocre, I am beginning to seriously doubt the quality of higher  education, especially after experiencing it in person. The effort on the  part of the teachers to teach us is nil, but at the same time, I must  also place some blame on the students. I have had students begging me  directly for homework, students who never attend classes and then form  groups to pass live copies to each other during exams, or students who  prefer to take advantage of group work and do nothing. It's a horrible  experience, which I absolutely hate. Filled with depression, for the  first time I have begun to have incredibly dark thoughts about myself. I  simply want to quit all this. I don't think it's worth it, and at the  rate we're going, I think it's going to be 3 whole years of classes this  way. The damage is already done.\n\nTL;DR:  University experience in a central american country sucks extremely.  You'll learn crap, you'll pay with your mental health, you'll have time  to do nothing and your future is uncertain unless you have someone else  to help you or offer you a job since day 1.",
