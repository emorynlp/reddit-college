  "title:": "I need financial aid but don\u2019t qualify for it. What?",
  "text": "I\u2019m so frustrated because I spent a lot of time filling out the general scholarship application for my university, specifically focusing on the essay portion of it where you explain why you need scholarship. (Little context my dad owns his own farming business and hasn\u2019t made a penny off of it in 5 years, and my mother is a waitress.) so obviously they\u2019re unable to support me through school. When my application was approved I was so pissed off when I saw I was unable to apply for a single scholarship, because I don\u2019t meet the requirements. Most of these requirements are for specific majors (though I can\u2019t apply for scholarships in my major due to other requirements I don\u2019t meet), genders, race, sexualities, birthplace, year in school, and even randomly specific scholarships like for people from Houston which is NOT even close to my university. So anyways my rant is I can\u2019t apply for scholarships because of requirements I don\u2019t meet. And I actually really need financial aid rip. But fear not I\u2019m getting in contact with the scholarship office so wish me luck. I just kinda feel like at its core scholarships are a resource for people unable to afford school, but I could be wrong.\n\nEdit: for some more context I\u2019ve applied for FAFSA and my hope is by using scholarships I won\u2019t have to take out any loans. That\u2019s exactly what I don\u2019t want and I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.",
