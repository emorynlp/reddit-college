  "text": "This is a really bizarre issue on my campus that I have no idea if any other college goes through this. I\u2019m not even sure how to word my complaint correctly without sounding ignorant/ judgmental.\n\nOn our campus, we have a lot of special needs students. They\u2019re often great and get along with everyone well, and are usually just in a community with themselves. But over the years of being on campus (Junior currently), we have noticed a couple of occurrences with this community.\nFirst off, all of them do NOT have an aid 24/7. This is really great at times since it allows them to be on their own. But it becomes a problem when certain individuals have issues socializing. A couple people have dealt with harassment from this group. In return, they do not know how to tell these people what they\u2019re doing is wrong, or are just untrained in how to talk to these individuals. For instance, we have someone who often hallucinates and will start randomly yelling at people, and will not leave students alone, especially those who are women. Nothing against this person, but when students are left to handle the situation, it can get out of hand.\nI\u2019ve also heard stories of special needs students flashing and touching people without any knowledge of what they\u2019re doing is wrong. This is where I get concerned for both parties safety. I don\u2019t want someone to flash another person, but I also don\u2019t want someone getting hurt or taken advantage of because they\u2019re alone and don\u2019t understand the situation.\nIt even gets to the point of stealing food. For example, we have a food kiosk at one of our study lounges. People pick what they want from the shelves, scan it, pay with their own money, and enjoy their food. It\u2019s great when other dining halls are closed and people just need a quick snack. But when someone who doesn\u2019t understand what a kiosk is and just steals the food without paying (or even worse, eats half of it and puts it back), all of the students get penalized for it. We get nervous that they\u2019ll take the kiosk away and we have a harder time getting food at night (most places close between 8-10 depending on the day).\nEven my freshman year, I have dealt with someone following me around and yelling racial slurs at my friends. It was hard to hold back some of my friends from attacking this person (due to trauma from these sort of words). Even had a person be against \u201cabelists\u201d and was really disrespectful to a lot of people. Since I came back this year, both of those people are gone.\nSo, I\u2019m at a loss on where to take this issue to. We have tried to get staff involved, tried to even get harassment claims on some of them for touching/ flashing. We only have students who are with these people, and they\u2019re only paid to help with their homework and classes. After classes are over, the class aids leave. I don\u2019t want to blame anyone in these types of situations, but what else is there to do? Are we just SOL on this situation? Any advice? \n\nTL;DR Nobody is watching the special needs students on campus and both parties (SN Students and regular students) are getting hurt.",
