  "text": "I\u2019m almost 30 and I re-enrolled in August, after dropping out about 7 years ago. Seemed like a good idea to just complete my associates that I never finished.\n\nNow I\u2019m in my 2nd semester and I\u2019m miserable. I realize why the hell I dropped out in the first place, this shit is not for me. Now I\u2019m like \u201cwhy TF did I think this was a good idea?!\u201d. I can\u2019t think of a single reason why I need to be in college anymore. I have zero motivation to complete this. The semester is over in May, but I just want to close my laptop and never sign on to canvas again. \n\nMy mental health is trash & I feel sad. I just want to sleep or cry. I have zero free time . I work all day, take care of my child and just want to relax. But no I\u2019m sitting here reading about a bunch of dead presidents .\n\nI\u2019m so mad at myself. I don\u2019t want to do this.",

I went back after a four year break last fall and I've been working full time and taking 16-18 credit hours a semester, I can't imagine doing all of that and having a child to care for on top of everything! Some days I am so angry at myself for signing up for all these classes, which are classes I actually like that I'm pretty sure I would enjoy taking if I weren't so damn stressed all the time. \n\nIf your heart isn't in it and you're miserable, I would re-assess your goals and if college is really helping you meet them and is worth it to you in the long run, or if you're going back to tick a checkbox you feel like you missed ticking earlier in life. College is not the only path to success and happiness, especially not at the expense of your mental health and general sanity. I wish you all the best of luck this semester and in your future; only one more month or so and we're free!!!",

If you poll college students around North America, many are inclined to agree. \n\nPre-covid, I used to balance a job with 12 credits per semester and I still had time left over to workout and take care of family commitments. A lot of colleges and universities are out of touch with the amount of stress/workload/personal matters students deal with outside of school and assume that just because we\u2019re glued to a chair, we might as well do 3x the amount of work we would do in a traditional classroom setting. \n\nMaybe take a breather until in person courses start up again and tackle it part-time, while evaluating how you\u2019re managing. \n\nAll the best.",
