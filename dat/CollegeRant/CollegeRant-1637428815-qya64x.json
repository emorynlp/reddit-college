  "text": "My girlfriend and I live on campus. She is never able to spend anytime  on campus because her family makes her go home all the time. She spend  most every weekend and some week days at home to see her family. She  goes back home because her family still expected her to do thing like  take her younger sister to school, entertain her, watch the dog, and  have dinner with her dad some nights among many many other things. All  this seems to be effecting her social life, grades and health.  She is  almost always tired and busy. She skip her morning classes a lot because  she was busy catching up on things the night before that she missed  because she was away with her family. Also for selfish reasons why I  what her on campus more, I kinda want to see my girlfriend more. It make  me sad to see her tired all and busy all the time. It also make me made  that her family seems to guilt her into to doing it. Every time I say  \"you should just say no I can't come home\", she say that \"she would feel  guilty for saying no.\"  My question to you all is. Is it normal to go  home so often even if she does not want too? Am I right for wanting her  to spend more time on campus? If so, what can we do about it?",

      "text": "I think it comes down to their family dynamic. Also if they\u2019re paying for her education she may feel obligated to go home. However, my mom wanted me to continue doing all of the things I did for my younger sibling and other various errands. It wasn\u2019t until I put my foot down and moved abt an hr away that she finally got it. Sometimes you just have to initiate the dynamic change and go from there. Is she really gonna keep coming home like this after she graduates? Starts a career? Has her own family? Most likely not so she should probs start working towards independence away from her family for herself and for her families expectations. \n\nAnother point\u2026 I see why you think it\u2019s selfish to want to see her more but in a relationship everyone has needs and expectations. If you want a more attentive gf you should communicate this to her. However, I wouldn\u2019t take it to heart since she\u2019s also slacking on others things outside of your relationship ex: classes, grades, health",

But, ever-time her parents ask her to do something she just says yes. She say that she does not like confrontation and will feel guilty for saying no.",

Based off of that comment she feels an obligation to her family for whatever reason and therefore most likely won\u2019t change her habits until she wants to, even if that means sacrificing her grades/health/relationships etc",

      "text": "This would infuriate me as the bf. No, it's not normal at all. Maybe once per month, and break, but that's it. This is the time in your girlfriend's life where she gets to be independent and do all of the other things that are involved with college besides just classes (clubs, social life, dating, etc). \n\nI am worried that her family dynamic is starting to affect her school work. You should tell your gf to frame it this way, because I would assume her parents what het to succeed at college. If she makes them aware that they are the reason her academic performance is suffering (or soon to be), then they might be more reasonable.\n\nAt the end of the day she needs to put her foot down. Politely tell your gf that confrontations are a part of life, and if she doesn't learn how to handle conflict (especially a small one like this) then life is going to be a lot harder. It's always the people who can handle conflict that get good jobs, get promotions, have success dating, succeed in business, etc. It's a part of living a good life.\n\nBest of luck.",

I also want to learn how to be more independent in college. Also the kids need to learn how to live without me better because I might not always live so nearby. They need to learn how to watch the dog and entertain themselves and spend time with dad because I can't always do that. I have a lot on my plate now and I would like to be able to focus on myself without worrying about if you need me to do certain things or feeling guilty for not visiting you. I love you and I want to visit you but can I start only going once a month? I will probably have more energy because I won't be worried about all the work I have to make up when I get back to college.\"",

      "text": "I had the same problem with my relationship. Your girlfriend might be the glue holding the family together. I was my parents\u2019 significant other (emotionally) and their best friend. I was my brother\u2019s mom in a way too. I was basically the glue holding us all together. I felt like it was on me to keep us all going. I knew when I wasn\u2019t home and away at school or with my boyfriend the dynamic in the house was off. It put a lot on me. I finally went to therapy for it and was told the dynamic was unhealthy. When I put down boundaries last year and removed myself, my parents got a divorce. The impact mentally from juggling everyone including my boyfriend was exhausting. Also, if you continue to make her feel like it\u2019s you or her family, I don\u2019t see it working out. It\u2019s a difficult time and it will take her time to hopefully back off her family.",
