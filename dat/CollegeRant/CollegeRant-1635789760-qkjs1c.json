  "text": "I\u2019m a college freshman attending my community college. I was initially supposed to be a division one rower at a private college where I met my boyfriend, didn\u2019t work out financially with my parents so I had to end up leaving that all for a last minute community college registration. \n\nI\u2019m simply taking prerequisites right now so I can enter Radiology Technology. I\u2019m currently excelling in my Composition II and General Psychology courses, but absolutely bombing CHEM110 and College Algebra. The thing with algebra, I get the content, I understand it, but the way it\u2019s taught is eating me alive. \n\nWe just had a chapter test today which I majorly bombed with a lot of shock. I did the review last night which does allow re-doing of questions, and landed myself a 91%. Basically, my professor teaches every class as a section of the chapter, then we get homework. So imagine learning eight chapters over a course of a month, including one cancelled class, and having a unit test. It\u2019s impossible for me to memorize anything without looking it up for a refresher. I was so confident I\u2019d do better this time and I absolutely killed it instead. I currently have a 67% according to Pearson Portal, zero grades have been submitted to Blackboard. I emailed the professor after I did terrible on the first test, no response. I emailed him again asking if there\u2019s anything I could do and I\u2019m reluctant that I\u2019ll get anything. I do every homework and understand content during class. Why am I failing to understand during the tests?\n\nAs for Chem, we finish chapters in 1-2 class periods. I just can\u2019t keep up. I spent the whole class writing notes trying to keep up with my professors pace. Our only assignments in that class are Pearson mastering class assignments. They\u2019re given after we finished the chapter and are usually marked as 3+ hours long. They serve little help to me. We are also given worksheets online that we can use to study, I looked at them for this chapter and understand some of the content, but I feel like I\u2019ve been kicked to the curb for the rest.I reached out for help, emailed my school tutoring service, no response from them. I got an answer from my professor but it was simply a \u201cI can help if you have questions, there are many resources\u201d ordeal. I currently have a 68% in that course, my next exam is tomorrow. \n\n\nBasically, I\u2019m in copious amounts of stress. I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me, I am in a program at my CC for graduating top 15% of my high school class. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going wrong. My math course is online, chem in person. I\u2019m trying my best, I am terrified of failing and being kicked out of my scholarship program. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I don\u2019t know what to do, please help. I genuinely feel stupid, none of my mutuals are going through this and are all thriving at college.\n\nTLDR: Terrified of failing 2/4 of my first semester courses as a college freshman. Trying to get outside help but it\u2019s not working. Don\u2019t know what to do, feeling really lost and outcasted.",

      "text": "To answer your question: Yes, you\u2019ll be okay.\n\nPersonally for me, For the subjects that I wasn\u2019t able to grasp in class, I turned to YouTube. The objective for the professor is to just get stuff over with and there\u2019s little to no consideration for individuals that are slow at understanding concepts/ those that need extra help.\nOn YouTube, you\u2019ll find a lot of videos of people that actually teach the content better than it\u2019s taught in class. I\u2019d say start from there. Go over topics individually after learning something new and most importantly, practice, practice, practice.\n\nGood luck!",
