  "text": "I\u2019m so incredibly frustrated with one of my professors assigning piles and piles of classwork and homework that are eating into time I need to sleep and study for other classes. I just took an exam for another class that I have had to neglect and I don\u2019t think I did well because I just don\u2019t have the time to study. I just need to talk to someone because the professor in question won\u2019t hear out my concerns and I need the class",
