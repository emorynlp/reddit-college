  "title:": "How to catch up 2 months of college ?",
  "text": "So I'm in first year of a double-diploma (idk how it's called in eglish) of History/Italian, and before that I repeated first year of \"Economical Management\" (pretty sure it's not the right name) for 2 years in another college.\n\nI live with my parents in France, I'm about to turn 19, have only a couple hours of job experience and I'm a lazy fuck.\n\nI have absolutely NO motivation whatsoever, and I don't know what I would rather do if I dropped out. As the title says, I'm 2 months behind, I did nothing, missed a lot of classes (I'm pretty sure I'll get a 0 in three or four classes that I skipped too much), missed a couple of assignments, didn't read any of the books I have to read.\n\nI went to several psychologists since I was 12, on and off, last one I saw was about a month ago, after I had a bad trip with cannabis (first time this happened to me) ; and I think the core of the issue lies in me ? I overthink a lot and I get frustrated really fast when I'm doing something.\n\nI always swerved through school until college, I even got my high school degree without doing any work at all, and I never knew what I wanted to do with my life, so in college I kinda smashed into a concrete wall.\n\nThing is, I really don't dig the vibe of college as a whole, from the first day I stepped foot on the campus back in 2019 I had this sort of aversion to it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant, english isn't my first language, and I would appreciate advice, comments, or whatever. Have a nice day",

      "text": "I think you should just drop this semester tbh. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to catch up at this point. Take time over the holidays to decide if college is really for you. Look at what opportunities you\u2019ll miss out on if you don\u2019t get a degree. Is there something you really want to do? Do you want to teach, or just work an office job etc. I think you should try talking to a therapist again. Hope this helps a bit",

      "text": "Definitely take some time and figure out if college is for you. Strongly suggest going to therapy if that\u2019s a possibility for you. But also remember that even people who like and enjoy college have trouble with motivation sometimes. \n\nOne thing that I did when I knew I was losing motivation to study was yo take a step back and realize how lucky I am. There are millions of young women around the world who aren\u2019t allowed to pursue higher education, or any education at all for that matter. And I\u2019m trying to sit around and be lazy? With all of the privilege I have I\u2019m choosing not to work because I simply don\u2019t \u2018want\u2019 to? How selfish can I be? Usually after thinking about that I would realize that I, through completing my degree program and getting a job, might be able to contribute something that makes a small difference in the world. \n\nSo really just figure out what motivates you to work and then double down on that.",
