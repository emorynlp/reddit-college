When you fill out the FAFSA, you would indicate that you have a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d. You would fill out the FAFSA as normal and just not enter any of your parents information, only enter yours. Then you would contact your finaid office and they would advise you about their policy for special circumstances. Hope that helps. But they\u2019re really strict on it and if your parent is alive usually they\u2019ll want you to get their information.",

And they also declared bankruptcy, so that doesn't bode well either. As for my mom claiming me, she's really too lazy to care and we don't talk so I have no information to get from her.\n\nSupposedly there's a way you can get around the \"24 or married or have kids\" independent thing by showing those who would've claimed you were garbage human beings, and that's what I was going for and we discussed.",
