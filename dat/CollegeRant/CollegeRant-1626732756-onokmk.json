  "text": "I'm a year into college and still getting a deluge of emails from shitty universities because my dumbass 10th-grade self filled in a misleadingly advertised bubble while taking the PSAT. This decision was made by a minor, in a setting of strict isolation from society, while expressly prohibited from consulting with peers, and while being pressured by society to \"connect\" with colleges, and without any opportunity for parental oversight. They essentially had me sign a contract to which, as a minor, I was incapable of giving informed consent, all for the purpose of selling my personal information to third parties and turning a profit on the exploitation of students.",
