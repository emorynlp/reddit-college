  "text": " I recently took an ethics test online and have found out it to be difficult and completely complex. Your telling me I have to do 3 short essays and 18 multiple choice questions in a single hour ? Seriously, how is anyone supposed to accomplish this in such a short amount of time ? I don't understand why professors have to make tests into some sort of race. Not to mention, there was no timer telling me how much time I had left in the test. So I went 9 minutes overboard and lost quite a few points because of the penalty. Should i email my professor on how unfair the test ?",

It was nerve wracking.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you had enough time otherwise, but I understand that timer stress. It really wrecked me.",

      "text": "An hour sounds like plenty of time for 21 questions if you studied and prepared adequately (unless you need accommodations, in which case that should have been documented and discussed ahead of time).  Even with 10 minutes per short essay (plenty of time), that would mean you had well over a minute per multiple choice question, which is also plenty of time. You also are capable of looking at the clock or a watch to keep track of your time to avoid going over. Nothing about this complaint is really unfair or warrants a complaint to the professor.",
