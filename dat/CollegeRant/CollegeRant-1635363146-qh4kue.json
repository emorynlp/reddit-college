  "title:": "College professors ignore me at my lowest point",
  "text": " \n\nAround 6:00 pm last May, exactly 16 hours before my first final, my father passed away after a two year struggle with prostate cancer just a few rooms away from where my mom and I were watching Breaking Bad. Unfortunately, one of my highest priorities at that moment were my finals. I knew that I would not be mentally salient enough the next day to take my two multiple choice exams and one in-class written exam. I emailed all six of my professors asking for a few days to mourn/celebrate his life. Out of the six of them, only two felt the need to respond and one of them decided I didn\u2019t deserve an extension because of my 79 in the class.  I cheated on four of the multiple choice tests, as they were take-at-home tests, and didn't even attempt the two papers\n\nI am only now, a few months into my second year, really processing how fucked this is. Now that my father\u2019s passing is more of a scar than a gushing wound, I'm finally seeing what these professors did to me. But I feel like I'm more in denial than actually angry, so that's why i'm posting here. Is this really how college professors are? Are they actually this cold and unsympathetic towards their students? If I continue for another two and a half years, will I be seeing this same sort of childish and vindictive behavior from people who are decades older than me? I'm genuinely split here, because I want to get a higher degree and pursue a better future for myself, but if the people leading me there are at this level of scummy then I'm not sure if that will be possible for me.\n\nAlso, if youve had a similar experience please write something!\n\nTLDR: parent dies and professors didnt seem to give a shit",

My grandmother died during my finals in my final year.  It does happen.\n\nI refer my students to the Dean.  A number of them sit the original exam.  The others are provided alternatives.",

      "text": "I had something similar happen but not with the grief attached, I was a freshman/sophmore who recently transferred I was working my first job at 7.25/hr 39 hours a week, and a second one 7.30/hr working 16 hours a week. I also was doing full-time at school so my day consisted of waking up at 4:30am-5am and I didn't get home until 11 pm and I still had homework to do so I didn't get in the bed until like 1 am. I did it for a few months and it began to drain on me because I started falling asleep in my history class a few times and even fell asleep on my drive to school. I made a 69 in the class and of course, was worried so I emailed him to see if he could give me a 70 because I didn't wanna fail the class. He basically told me about my sleeping in his class saying I didn't deserve it and I still would pass with a D which was the only good thing that I got out of it. I had my Chemistry professor at the time when I was still in my Bio major struggling with the work he stopped me while I was doing homework and told me that I should just get another degree because he didn't think I would make it.\n\nSince I was the only one struggling and he didn't wanna assist me properly without getting upset. I also recently withdrew from a professor's class because of his shitty ego and I am still trying to figure out how to get credit for this class without taking this particular professor since he seems to be the only one teaching it which is highly annoying. He wouldn't answer any questions and when it came to technical difficulties especially with trying to take tests online he would blame it on you. Even if you emailed him the day before, there was a girl whose mic didn't work and he would basically pretend to hear her and push on. He would gloat about all of his accomplishments and books he had written while also giving terrible feedback on written assignments and would give an estimate of how many words a paper should be like for instance he'd want a paper AROUND 500, I wrote a 508-word paper and I got docked for it, it really just depends on the professor because you never know.\n\nLiterally, I transferred degrees near the end of the semester after my Chem professor said what he said to Criminal justice and I was extremely late applying for classes and I never got any emails so of course, I took it upon myself to set a mentoring session with my advisor and when I got there he was yelling at me for not bringing some paper that I was never told to bring nor ever got the memo but he reeled it back when I got an attitude on his behavior. Ive now found a degree I like and I'm senior finally after being in school for 6 years and I even took a two year break from college to really decide if this was what I wanted and I was about to get kicked out because of my low GPA and ever since I came back Ive really improved  and have been on the deans list every semester but of course there's always one professor. Ratemyprofessor has been a savior to me when picking professors now because there are some good professors but there are assholes too it's a game of chance essentially.\n\nTLDR; There are some gruuby professors out there at every college but I find the good outweighs the bad it really depends on your tolerance and what you wanna put up with.",

Asking to not completely fail a class by one point is reasonable and very appropriate as many professors can curve a grade if you've at least tried and I did. It wasn't like I was on my phone ignoring the professor, It's very hard to stay awake when you have 3-4 hours of sleep a day and it wasn't a daily thing either some days were just harder than others. So please don't give me that.",
