  "text": "I just need to vent a little. I was hoping this past semester would be the one where I improve my GPA enough to get back in good standing. I tried my hardest in the end, but it just wasn't enough.\n\nThis means I need to take more classes and get even better grades this coming semester. I know I can do it as long as I stay focused, but it's just quite disheartening to find that out. My anxiety has increased significantly.",

However, I've improved and matured a lot this year. I passed the class I needed to retake at my university and even took classes at my former college (a community college) to improve my GPA there. I felt like online education was a great opportunity to redeem.\n\nHappy Holidays! I wish the best for you.",
