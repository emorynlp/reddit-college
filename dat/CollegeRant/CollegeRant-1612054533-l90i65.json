  "title:": "Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me I\u2019d pay taxes on my scholarships?!",
  "text": "Okay I know this is super first world problems but I\u2019m super frustrated. This is the first year that I received significant scholarship and grant money. I don\u2019t know if the amount is significant for this rant but I can say my scholarship money was more than my tuition. \n\nI went to file my taxes today and everything was going well, my expected return was what I thought it should be (almost $1000 dollars). Then I go to put in my school return and my entire expected return disappears. \n\nI\u2019m just so annoyed. Like, a big chunk of the money I got was from the pell grant. How do I have to pay taxes on a federal grant?! And why wouldn\u2019t they give me the option to deduct taxes when I got them like income from work? I\u2019m thankful that for the money and that I didn\u2019t have to take out loans but I just feel like I didn\u2019t get all the facts to plan accordingly and now I\u2019m sad.\n\nTL;DR: I just learned i won\u2019t be getting the tax refund I expected because I got too much in scholarship money that wasn\u2019t taxed. Annoyed.",
