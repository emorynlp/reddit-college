I cried every day, i stressed so hard and took substances to stay up for 5 days straight just to do homework and try to study. I can\u2019t give advice because I still feel hopeless, but I say this to let you know that it\u2019s very common and you aren\u2019t alone.\nI fucking hate college lol",

      "text": "So, my initial piece of advice is that biology a lot of the time is ALL about asking questions, GOOD questions. Good questions helped me learn. I took a biotechnology trade program and I have NEVER been a STEM person. I got frustrated a lot because I didn\u2019t understand a lot of things, but the more I asked good questions and got good answers, the more i resonated. Going to office hours with the professor and just making a list of questions and discussing can really help. From what I have read in your responses, it sounds like the exams and studying for them can be very difficult. Go to office hours and ask what they are looking  for, if they are willing to tell you. Make yourself a good study guide based off your notes.",

Try not to use chegg or look up any answers. \nWhen you have concepts that you just can't understand go to office hours!! \nAlso, do your homework in advance so that you can ask your prof for help when you need it\n\nThese are the changes that I made during my sophomore year which drastically changed my grades. \n\nFor reference I got a 92 in biology and a 98 in microbiology",
