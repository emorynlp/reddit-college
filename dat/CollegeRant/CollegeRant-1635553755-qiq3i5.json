  "text": "For some context, I'm 3.5 years into college/my program. I had a professor tell me I'd be better off in a different major because I failed an 8 week course. This professor is tough and there's no other professor that teaches the class. What should I do?",

      "text": "It's not your instructor's place to opine on your degree program, how you're doing in terms of fulfilling degree requirements is between you and your academic advisor. And if you're 3.5 years into your degree, I don't think you should change majors because of one failed course. Of course, you should retake the class if possible, and if your prof keeps singling you out when making these comments, follow the appropriate channels to complain.",

I've had another professor (non program) single me out like this and I tried to bring it up to admin, but they ignored it.",
