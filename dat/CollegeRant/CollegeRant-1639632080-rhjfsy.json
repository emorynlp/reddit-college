  "text": "Minimum passing grade is a C.\n\nAnd I'm pissed too because it's my own fault for missing too many assignments. It's stupid too because it was actually my easiest class of the semester.\n\nIntro to Programming. INTRO!! The professor was nice, the assignments weren't too demanding, lax attendance policy because he knew we could teach ourselves most of the stuff on YouTube, even threw in a bonus 10% to our grades for just following the COVID protocols.\n\nAnd yet I finished with a 63% even though I was at a B+ after midterms. Because I was failing my two other classes because I've been in a depressive episode most of the semester and pulled out all the stops to pull my grades up. So I started to ignore IoP, it was fine I could just do those assignments later.\n\nThose classes finished with a B- and a C, I actually figured I had managed to scrap by this semester until the bomb dropped yesterday when he released the course grades.\n\nThankfully my GPA was all As before this semester so I only dropped down to 3.3 and it should go back up after I retake the class next semester but it still feel horrible.\n\nMostly because now I'm going to have to fix my schedule *again* because I already had to drop Physics and I still need to look to see what classes will be effected by me not meeting this prerequisite.\n\nThis was a very hard semester and it just feels bad to know that I couldn't get out of it completely unscathed",
