  "text": "My prof just announced that we have our first exam coming up this week so I took that announcement as my call to start studying.  But as soon as I sat down at the library to study I have no clue what I'm doing. I have no clue how to study. It's my first year in college and I just realized now I don't know how to study because I never did in High School! Like I have notes...do I just re-read them? like what am I supposed to do?",

      "text": "Reorganize and rewrite your notes in a graphic way, with different highlight colors for specific types of info. Different people study different ways, but that works great for me. Handwriting the info is good for memory, and spatially organizing it helped me so I could later visualize where certain info was on the study page. \n\nQuiz yourself. From your notes, make a separate list of terms/concepts. Go down that list and mentally explain what one means, then re-read your notes or the book section to see what you missed. You'll remember it a lot better from the little bit of pressure you're under when you quiz yourself. \n\nBasically the key is being actively engaged. Passive activity like re-reading notes does very little to help you remember. Any method where you're writing, speaking, or trying to remember the info is better.",

          "text": "I'm a PhD student in biology and this is exactly how I have studied for just about every biology exam I've ever taken. One thing on top of all of this that helps me is that several days before the exam I go over my notes/the PowerPoint slides from class and write my own exam. I look at the PowerPoint slides or the sections of my notes and ask \"if I was writing an exam what would I ask about?\" I generate my own questions from the information, and then a day or two before the real exam, I take my exam. If there are any questions I can't answer, that's what I spend my time going over. I have also found that taking a \"practice\" test of the material beforehand helps relieve test anxiety a little bit,, too.",

I like to do my studying in advance so I do little by little every day. I\u2019ll make up quizes and test myself. I even record myself studying via voice notes so I can go back and listen to it. that is what works best for me.",

At the end of the chapter, there should be practice exercises or questions. \n\nWhen you can answer those practice exercises without using your book, you should be good.",
