  "text": "Possible TW: SA, mentions of weight and eating habits\n\nHi there!\n\nI've heard the saying, \"the first year is always the hardest\" before, and I didn't believe it until now. Here's a sum of the last four months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**High School (for Context):**\n\nIn high school, I was a terrible, terrible procrastinator who never really needed to study for anything, or would do it last minute if I needed to. I finished fourth in my class with a 4.21 GPA. I was really good at what I called \"doing the bare minimum for an A.\" I was heavily involved in a lot of extracurriculars and **extremely** stressed out to the point where I would make myself sick. I even had a teacher tell me to give her the homework by next class and to just rest that night once because I looked so ill. I really cared about going to UMich or getting a full-ride/tuition somewhere, so I really cared about doing well. I did end up both getting into UMich and getting a full-tuition scholarship somewhere, and took the full-ride to a smaller college close to home.\n\nMy senior year I was fully online. I had no physical contact with anybody my age until I graduated and my teachers were just pre-recorded videos and people on the other end of an email. My life beforehand was so busy that I never really thought about anything else than what I needed to do, and everything was always taken care of for me in terms of meals and shelter. Then, all I was doing was school, but it was honestly more like all I wasn't doing. My school's counselor called it \"workload paralysis.\" Both semesters I ended up with 300+ missing assignments then having to hyperfocus for the last two months to finish them all. Needless to say, I didn't earn any of my AP credits. Fair enough, though. I had scholarships to do and I ended up creating and running a coding club which took up a lot of time, too. I gained so much weight and was tired all the time.\n\nI was really excited because I loved the college I chose, everything just worked out so well. I was determined that this year would be different, but it presented more challenges than I had expected. Thankfully, I have a new counselor who has helped a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Roommate/Housing Situation**\n\nMy roommates and I became friends over the summer, but I quickly realized that living with someone is a very different relationship than just being friends with them. They always wanted me to do everything with them, and didn't like when I couldn't. I have a sometimes stressful IT job on-campus and as someone who values rest and is easily overwhelmed/overstimulated, I wanted to come home and shut my door for a bit in a dark room to recharge. They thought that was rude, even though I'd always peek out to say hi every once in awhile when I wasn't doing homework and let them know it wasn't because I didn't want to talk to them but just that I was busy. I also liked to sing and I let them know to just knock if I annoyed them  or was too loud and I'd shut up, which is my system at home too, though I usually only did it when they weren't home or when I thought there wasn't anyone home (and they never used the system).\n\nAt the end of August they started ganging up on me for stupid things though like the \"you never spend any time with us and you're never home\" thing, for my laundry basket being too loud?, and for slamming doors (which maybe happened once unintentionally). They made a quiet sign for when they wanted me to shut up. The first WEEK they set quiet hours that they left me out of determining when I was the only one who even had to get myself together earlier than 8am. During the middle of September, the one I was closest to told me the other two who were best friends before college were talking about me behind my back to her and she thought I should know. I was maybe confronted about things by all of them a total of 4 times the whole semester.\n\nBefore long, they started having these \"roommate meetings\" where they would sit down and just dish out all of their grievances related only to things about me and nobody else. Most of the things could've been solved if they would have just communicated with me more. They'd overreact about it too. One of them said they cried because I was showering and they needed to use the sink to get in (she literally could have just knocked and the bathroom door doesn't lock). I got really nervous about being in the place I lived. I did my best to fix things they wanted me to fix, but they just kept finding petty things to complain about. I no longer sang in my dorm at all, I would stress-clean constantly to avoid being yelled at. I was always so nice to them despite it all. I would bring them treats. I would uncomfortably spend time with them when I needed to be alone and should have been doing schoolwork. I would go on walks alone around the tiny campus just for an excuse to not be home. I was maybe in the dorm awake for a total of 5 hours or less a day. They got mad at me for never being home.\n\nI reached my breaking point when I overslept one day and missed work because they were all up late being loud the night before when I needed to work at 8:30 the next morning. I woke up and texted the groupchat since I didn't know who was home about maybe halfing the volume on the TV past midnight and they threw the biggest hissy fit about it and complained about me loudly in the next room before they left for class because they thought I wasn't home. I was so shaken up that I bawled, got it together, lasted maybe half my next class (the one I'm failing), then left. I didn't know where to go. I felt like a failure somehow for being a terrible roommate.\n\nI had a meeting with my RA about it that night because I wanted to move out so I would no longer be a problem for these girls, and he reassured me that most of this wasn't even my fault and that my roommates are treating me like garbage. There was maybe one thing I discussed with him that would be remotely considered something to complain about. When we had our collective meeting, they still tried to demonize me and even claimed that they never said what they did about me beforehand, suggesting it was the upstairs neighbors. We live below the RA. They all pretended to be nice to me and told me they wanted me around and consistently still did not show that.\n\n4 meetings with the Residence Director later, I was matched with a new set of girls. However, they had a party lifestyle, kept things in the room that could get them in serious trouble, and were quick to turn on me. I told the RD that I felt these girls would be a worse fit and she cancelled the room change. She told me there is nowhere for me to go until next semester.\n\nAfter another bs \"roommate meeting,\" which they blatantly asked when I was moving out as the first question, I decided the answer was that night, and packed enough clothes for the next week plus other necessities. I totally cut off communication with my roommates because I didn't want to say things I didn't mean. They were nice at first but wouldn't leave me alone, trying to apologize and ask if I was okay and then on Wednesday one of them posted a pic of them giving the middle finger to the camera with the caption \"you know who you are b\\*tch.\" I screenshotted it and blocked her. Thought, \"Yep. That checks out.\" It's pretty on-brand behavior for them.\n\nI moved everything out that I owned on Thanksgiving and I am now living at home again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Relationships/Social Life**\n\nAnother thing they got me into were dating apps. I had an overwhelming crush on someone at the start of the year who did not like me back. We decided to stay friends, then I was glad I didn't date him. Since I hadn't had any luck, I decided what the heck? I'll give it a try! I met a guy who was graduating after next semester who I really liked. I almost lost my virginity to him, but I'm glad I decided not to, because he was looking for something casual, while I was looking for something more serious. He would tell me \"I don't want to hurt you,\" all the time when I would spend time with him. I didn't know what that meant until he slowly broke away from me.\n\nTo complicate things further, I opened up to my counselor about how I felt I could be attracted to pretty much anyone, and how I also didn't feel like a girl, I am not a fan of my feminine body, and how I felt more comfortable in androgynous clothing. I am still trying to get comfortable with both. I am not out yet, but she suggested going to the out-group on campus which is the LGBTQ+ alliance to meet more people like me, but I was kind of nervous and also didn't have the time, so I never went.\n\nThe friend I was previously referring to was pretty overwhelming. We connected over our ADHD (well mine at the time was only suspected).  After I found out he didn't like me back, I connected with the other girl he led on. She was great, but was never there when you needed her, always with her boyfriend. She made really poor decisions and one of them cost me a possible good grade on the class I needed to do better in (calculus I) and a day of work. I feared for her safety and wouldn't sleep until I knew she was okay. The issue was resolved by the morning.\n\nWith the guy, I finally found like someone understood my life experience. We would talk constantly and formed a codependent relationship with one another. There was never a time when he wasn't on his phone either, so I just got stuck in this texting black hole with him all the time. It was like we were both addicted to talking to each other and leaning on one another for the mini-crises we were experiencing. I decided to cut him off last week after he laughed about putting a girl that liked him back in a tough situation by forcing himself upon her. I always thought maybe he was a bit of a hypersexual creep. We had an argument over whether or not it was okay to show emotions and him thinking he didn't need counseling I friendly suggested to him to possibly help with his paranoia, never feeling like he deserved to be happy, and impulsive decisions that hurt others. He said that my way of processing things, crying to feel the emotion and then moving on with a course of action, was \"f\\*cking pitiful\" and that it made me a \"headcase\" and a \"mess.\" I would try to break away from him all the time but always ended up coming back for reasons I couldn't figure out. I thanked him for finally giving me a good reason to leave and he said some garbage about how he will see my face in his dreams and weep in his sleep or some weird sh\\*t like that. I didn't look back after that. Now I am really lonely and so behind in homework that I couldn't join any clubs so I don't socialize with anybody anymore.\n\nOn top of all of this, my family was having a hard time dealing with the fact that I wanted to stay an entire week at school without coming home, that I couldn't help them with homework anymore, and that I was making decisions they could no longer control. Thankfully, as always, ended up being supportive in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Academics**\n\nMy academics are a mess and it first started because I thought I could handle two jobs and a full course load. Thankfully, my school gave out enough need-based grant money to where I could quit the other. As if everything else in my life wasn't awesome enough(/s), I started to really struggle with executive functioning. My laundry and homework weren't getting done and I barely remembered to eat. Sometimes I would doom scroll on my phone so much that I would end up finally freeing myself to shower that the inconvenient time of 3am. I felt like I was putting as much energy into surviving as I did into extracurriculars. I am now in the same position as last year where I am scrambling to save everything last minute, going to the tutoring center constantly, but it still doesn't feel like enough. I have deleted social media and I'm trying to really crack down on my stuff now that I'm medicated. I was given antidepressants though because I have anxiety and I was also anxious about going on stimulants because even a little bit of coffee makes my body just go absolutely nuts. They help me get out of bed, but I still have a terrible time concentrating on what I need to do, but I have a great time concentrating on what I want to do!\n\nI have talked to my other professors in the other classes I was struggling in to help get me to where I need to be, but haven't yet to my calculus professor whose class I am terribly failing and honestly haven't done much to help myself. I have been trying to put out so many fires all year that I barely had time to do the 40 homework problems assigned to us every class. I don't think I finished any of the assignments. Thankfully, yet also unfortunately, those aren't graded at all. My friends and family were so dependent on me that I was on my phone most of the class because I hadn't learned the value of boundaries yet (that I know now), so all of my notes looked like scribbled, incomprehensible nonsense. I have been to the tutoring center four times total, mostly right before exams, and it was helpful in understanding the topic, but not for doing super well on the exam itself since it's all pulled from the homework. It was difficult being in writing-intensive, homework-intensive, and project-intensive classes all at the same time my life decided to crash into me like a semi. I didn't know that I should have scheduled the first semester a little easier for myself, but to be fair, I didn't have a clue what these classes would be like. I guess I don't know how to approach asking this professor for help at the end of the semester, knowing I have not done much to help myself.\n\nI have a scholarship where I have to maintain a 3.25 GPA per semester to keep it that I am worried I will lose since it seems I have to pass all of my classes this semester for that to happen and I am currently failing one and severely behind in another. I am still confused about the terms of the scholarship because I already paid my school bill for the next semester. Will they not renew it next year because of this fall semester? I am so lost with it. Financial aid hasn't really given me a great explanation about it. I am wondering if I can petition to keep it, especially since I found out that I have ADHD, which played a part in the reason why I was struggling in my classes and honestly just in general. I am working on getting accommodations for it anyway so they'll have the paperwork to know I'm not fibbing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Major Change**\n\nI am also changing my major because I was interested in computer science in high school because I was young, stupid, and wanted to impress a senior. That senior ended up grooming me throughout the entirety of the time I was in high school and said he didn't want to be in a relationship with me once I finally got to be of legal age. I was taken advantage of during high school (I'll spare you the details) and didn't even know it. I didn't realize that wanting to impress him was the driving force behind my interest and that it was even grooming at all until a few weeks ago when I was sitting around wondering why I was even majoring in CS if I didn't like programming in the first place, despite all the awards I won for it in high school. I got really emotional about it, so I wrote a poem (like I do to process most of my emotions) and realized what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love genetics, so I am changing my major to molecular biology/biomedical sciences. I was interested in the genetic counseling career because I obviously have a knack for supporting people through heavy subjects as the therapist friend, I liked the fact that I could also educate people since I originally wanted to change to an education major, and that I could take a TON of science courses, which I love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Friend Suggestion:**\n\nMy friend recommended dropping out of the school I love to go to community college. Even though I don't see any shame in it in general, I feel like I worked so hard to be at the school I'm at right now on the terms I am there. Everyone was so proud of me for getting my school paid for/escaping massive debt and I feel like I would just be letting those people down by leaving that. Not to mention, I like having my own space and simply cannot afford an apartment right now. The CC near me does not have housing. I really want to make my situation work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI had roommate issues so bad that I had to move out of my space I pay for on-campus two days ago, thought I could balance 32 hours of work but could not so I had to quit one of my jobs, toxic friendships keeping me from meeting anyone new, discovered Tinder (didn't go super well), identity and trauma revelations leading me to a major change from cs to biology in hopes of maybe becoming a genetic counselor, issues related to being the first child to \"leave the nest\" and my family having a hard time with it, a VERY RECENT ADHD diagnosis, failing two classes and don't know how to approach a professor whose class I have done little to help myself in but need to simply just pass, and nervous about losing the full-tuition scholarship that is keeping me here for a little over $1k a semester (evaluated by semester), and my friend recommended community college (but even though I don't see any shame in it I feel like I worked so hard and would just be letting people down, not to mention I liked having my own space and simply cannot afford an apartment right now). I'm just wondering what suggestions you guys have for me, especially with the one class I was talking about and aspirations for grad school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything is falling apart but also slowly falling into place? I guess I am just super lost in general and looking for a little commiseration/advice. I really want to continue do better, I just don't know what else to do.",

      "text": "Ok I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t read your entire post, but I feel like as a third-year whose dealt with lots of sloppy habits concerning school and general living, I can at least offer some advice as to that executive functioning stuff you mentioned. Your experience of finding school really easy in high school and thus getting away with not studying and procrastinating, then suddenly getting overwhelmed by college, is a very common phenomenon and happened to me as well.\n\nOne of the most difficult things about growing up and entering college is self-discipline, and you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of not being perfect at it yet, but in order to do well in college and life you will need to get better.\n\nRemember Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, and try to fulfill those for yourself through everything you do. Eating well, sleeping well, hygiene, are essential. Once those are fulfilled, getting outside, socializing, and other mental health factors need to be fulfilled. After that, schoolwork, and whatever steps you need to take to achieve the career and future you want. These are no longer just things that your parents or teachers or whoever tell you to do; they are absolutely necessary for your survival. Letting these things go neglected is a threat to your very existence. Only once I realized that is when I started to clean up my habits and become a more functional human being.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not easy keeping all that up, and I still struggle with motivation and organization, but it gets easier the more you do it because you start to remember how much happier you feel when those needs are fulfilled. It\u2019s important to focus on the progress you\u2019ve made and not fixate on every time you fail. I\u2019ve learned to cook for myself and to go to the library to study instead of doing it in my room where I get distracted. I still have trouble getting to sleep at a good time some nights but I\u2019m working on that, so it\u2019s okay.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m sorry it seems like you\u2019ve had a rough first year but you\u2019re not alone and I wish you luck with figuring it out.\n\n*EDIT: additionally I know from a friend with ADHD that studying with peers is supposedly helpful to improve focus for a lot of people with ADHD, so if you\u2019ve got friends at college maybe ask to meet up and do homework together.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply and the well-wishes!\n\nI do not have any friends here yet and it's difficult to make any as a (now) commuter with little extra time to spend on campus, especially in a major full of people who don't usually like to interact socially anyway. All of mine from high school either dropped out or can't meet up do to their own stuff. However, making new friends is one of my top priorities for next semester. I do well studying with friends! Sometimes I call one of my friends that doesn't do much else than school and work to stare at me until I finish my essays lol.\n\nI did find that I had a hard time meeting my needs, and like I mentioned in my post, I worked so hard to get a schedule down to take care of myself before I could get anything done, and I still had a difficult time concentrating on things anyway. I kept wanting to be better and continuously tripping on myself. On my meds, though, it's easier for me to get up to do things than it used to be. Thankfully, taking care of my needs is no longer anywhere near as difficult either.  Still working on sustaining attention somehow/working with my brain.\n\nMostly just looking to turn things around now that I have some driving force of motivation for a career that I am excited to work towards rather than one I couldn't care less about with awful memories attached to it. I think I have things figured out a bit better, and I'm looking forward to starting anew next semester and just have to finish this one strong.",
