  "title:": "Career Fair Made Me Feel Like College Was A Waste Of My Time",
  "text": "So I just went to a virtual career fair as a senior and I\u2019m honestly starting to feel like I wasted my time doing internships and being involved on student orgs. I\u2019ve done three internships and I\u2019m also an officer in two student orgs and a senator for student government. I was hoping these experiences would make me more marketable but it seems like I\u2019m only able to compete for more internships(often unpaid) or jobs that only require a high school degree. I\u2019ll admit as a non STEM major, my job prospects were never going to be great and obviously COVID-19 is making things worse but I\u2019m tired of competing for jobs with joke salaries or no pay at all. Half of the post grad jobs I was told companies and non profits were offering were $30k in large cities. This is literally not only low, but arguably unlivable without extra support in a large city. The others were offering unpaid internships. One even had the audacity to suggest I do a year long unpaid internship after graduation. I could literally make more working at Starbucks. \n\nIdk man I get that businesses and especially nonprofits are suffering but it honestly is starting to infuriate me how many companies go to college fairs and demand that college students have years of experience. The amount of ones who also seemed to not count internship experience as relevant but suggested interning to get a foot in the door was also hilarious. Honestly I\u2019d be happy starting at $40k. It would be still be shitty but at least I\u2019d be able to survive in the city. \n\nIt just makes me feel like not only college was a waste of time, but also the internships I did. I was already seriously considering doing a gap year and going to grad school after but this just solidified my decision that that\u2019s the right choice. Idk maybe this whining makes me entitled but it honestly just feels like a non STEM bachelors won\u2019t get you very far these days, even if you try to network and do everything right.",

      "text": "This is my exact experience. Except I do have one of those STEM majors you speak of. I seemingly did everything right: I did well in college, graduated with honors, took up an extra minor to make myself even more marketable, had a good internship and so on. I\u2019ve now been applying to jobs for about a year and a half, without any luck. Except for the occasional insulting job offers like unpaid internships, and unbearably low compensation packages ($12-$14/hr). I made more money before going to college than my current prospects. To add insult to injury, if I had continued doing what I was doing (construction) and not gone to college, I would be a superintendent by now making at least 60k/yr.",

          "text": "International Studies lol rip. I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst major IF you plan on going to grad school. But with a bachelors, it\u2019s really not that great for jobs. I stupidly thought I would be able to get a decent paying job after graduation. I definitely regret not planning through because grad school was definitely not my plan originally and because of that my GPA isn\u2019t great. I was actually a CS major for a short stint. Unfortunately though I pretty much was on the verge of failing my CS classes and I also hated it. Tbh it sucks because political science and international studies is what I\u2019m passionate about and also good at, but obviously it\u2019s not a great field for job growth. I\u2019ve been getting luck with political campaigns and organizing jobs but how they treat new employees and interns is horrible. \n\nTbh, I still think even if the demand isn\u2019t high tho the way people in politics and similar fields treat interns and entry level workers is trash. The amount of high funded political campaigns I\u2019ve seen hiring unpaid interns and paying field organizers in pennies yet advocating for a $15 min wage is disturbing. I get that campaigns can\u2019t pay like a tech company can, but is a basic stipend for interns driving around to events on their own gas money really to much to ask? \n\nI\u2019d definitely recommend people either choose to pair it with a recession proof degree or plan from the start to go to grad school. And if you go the grad school route you need to go in serious about school and grades.  I used to have the \u201cCs get degrees\u201d mentality freshman year and it destroyed my gpa. My gpa is good enough now for grad school but I could\u2019ve had so many more options and likely better funding if I had taken school seriously from the beginning. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the ramble. I know this is long but I just wanted to give my insight on my experience so far. I feel like sometimes Reddit tends to be very STEM or bust which I definitely get, but I did also want to offer people my perspective since not everyone is cut out for or will enjoy a STEM major. Tbh if I could go back and do it again I would\u2019ve majored in business or marketing. It\u2019s not the best degree out there but I think I could\u2019ve done a lot more with it than IS lol.",

I get it that you guys love what you do but when reality sets in it sucks. The problem with college is that everything you learn can literally be found on the internet.
