  "text": "i'm a international and i'm studying really hard to get into a college in USA. i still have to take SAT, ACT and TOEFL, and of course, i still have to do essays and letters. i don't really have any extracurricular activities to add in my \"curriculum\", and i was working on it these days, but i failed so bad and i didn't expect for it. in addiction, i'm studying really hard and non-stopping everyday, and i'm afraid, really afraid. \n\ni'm a senior and i'm freaking out so bad, and to make my life even worse, i have to hear my parents everyday doubting me and not giving any kind of help at it. so, i'm poor, and i will have to work to keep my stay and other spendings, even that i know i can't really do it in the moment i get there, at least not legally. \n\nit's so damn terrible to have to hear people telling me things that don't really help me and make me doubt about my capacity. god, they think that not giving me any kind of practical help and only making me sad and anxious will REALLY help me? why people do that? am i not currently suffering enough? i feel so invalidated, so lost. \n\ni already suffer from anxiety, depression and ED. i feel the burnout coming back again.\n\nTL;DR: i'm alone in this path, i'm anxious about everything i have to do and i'm afraid of burning out. just venting i guess.",

      "text": "i typed out a long answer and accidentally deleted it so i\u2019m gonna quickly rewrite my points:\n\n1. i remember how stressful this time is but once you submit all the applications and everything is locked in you\u2019ll feel so satisfied!\n2. i didn\u2019t do extracurriculars either (didn\u2019t play sports or join any big clubs) so i got a small internship senior year (which i also got paid at) and i also added literally any small volunteer work that i did. any simple jobs like a cashier or organizing for an event can sound impressive right the right words. i recommend googling websites that give job descriptions for simpler jobs, it makes you sound more professional \n3. for the SAT i recommend khan academy, i used it the night before every SAT and it boosted my score every time. if you\u2019re good at science you should stick to the ACT bc the other subjects are easier than the SAT, with the addition of science. i recommend taking both tests once and then picking only one to focus and study for because colleges only want your test scores from one or the other \n4. my teacher always said student loan debt is a \u201cgood\u201d debt to have, meaning it\u2019s manageable and actually it sounds like biden is trying to erase student debt so don\u2019t worry about it too much. state schools are always a great option because they\u2019re affordable and close by, even community college for 2 years is even cheaper!\n\nif you have any questions lmk i remember how stressful the application process was!\n\nedit: i see you\u2019re international which could be even better for you! many colleges have international scholarships and i see you want to go into IT which is a booming industry! also i\u2019m not sure if you  plan to go home during the summer but if you live in the states when you\u2019re not in college, i think after a year or two you\u2019ll be eligible for in state tuition (depending on the state you\u2019re in). i know in new york that\u2019s how it works!",

      "text": "Hey! I've been checking your recent posts. Have you ever thought about studying in Lithuania, Poland or Hungary? I've heard from international students that they make things pretty easy and affordable for international students, and they offer English taught programs\n\nIt's normal to be completely burned in this situation. I'm a soon-to-be international student in your country (in a double international degree) and a few months ago I made a list of the things that I was supposed to do and the papers I'll need, and so far it has helped me a lot to not get lost in the process and have all my papers in time.\n\nIf you happen to live near S\u00e3o Paulo (or you can afford to travel there for your exams) you could also consider applying to study in the UNED (an online public spanish university) and moving to study in Spain the following year (or that same year... Whatever fits you).\n\nThe choice is yours, the world is huge and there are plenty of opportunities everywhere (and easier and cheaper than getting into the US). Good luck with your journey!",

If you start your degree in the UNED you could transfer to another university more easily I think. You can ask the UNED representatives in Brazil for more information.\n\nAbout Lithuania, Poland or Hungary I can't provide you with further information.\n\n Qualquer d\u00favida n\u00e3o hesite em perguntar!",

It will be okay and will be all worth it, you are right!\n\nEdit: I didn't speak English for a long time so as unsolicited as it sounds, this is coming from a place of love. I lost a lot of points for punctuations and sentence structure on my SATs and O/A Level Exams. Just something you can keep an eye out for when prepping so you don't repeat my mistakes :) Best of luck fam you got this.",
