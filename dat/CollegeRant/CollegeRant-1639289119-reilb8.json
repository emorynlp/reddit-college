  "text": "Just a little vent so I don\u2019t spiral:   \n\nI maintained a 4.0 all throughout freshman year with minimal effort.   \n\nNow as a sophomore (before my final exams are graded) I will be ending with a mix of A\u2019s, B\u2019s and C\u2019s. I feel like I worked significantly harder this semester and yet still didn\u2019t get the results I wanted. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nMy predicted GPA after this semester will be close to a 3.6 which is barely enough to keep me in good academic standing for my colleges honors program.   \n\nI\u2019m premed so that\u2019s also a concern and I just feel so hopeless and stressed.\n\nI cannot afford to have another bad semester.   \n\nI just feel like all my life I was told I was \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cgifted\u201d and I had the grades to back those statements up but this is the first year in which I\u2019ve felt painfully mediocre and I don\u2019t know how to deal with that.",

      "text": "Ugh, I feel your pain. First of all though, you're not a failure. Just look around Reddit, your school's groupchats, etc. This semester absolutely wrecked most people. I don't know one person who's truly \"doing okay.\" You're doing well :)\n\nSecond, if I can offer any advice as someone who also panics over my GPA for my school's honours program, don't worry too hard about the GPA to the point that it's stressing you out or you can't focus. You're still a semester away from applying for the honours program (assuming you guys apply for honours in the spring of second year like we do) the more classes you take, the more your GPA will likely even out. Don't stress, just set yourself up for success next semester",
