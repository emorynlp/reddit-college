  "text": "I didn\u2019t think I would ever be unsupported by the same people who literally said that if I didn\u2019t go to school, I would be nothing. I started my bachelors late because I changed minor\u2019s half way through after realizing I didn\u2019t give a shit about art history, and an AA in associates knocked out most courses for a BA in Criminology. (Plus I have a passion for it.) but when my mother found out I had only earned my bachelors she would not shut up about how I should have been done by 21. I don\u2019t usually let that crap get to me but I\u2019ve worked so /hard/. Straight A student, STEM awards, Highest Honors, I self study, I know 2 fucking languages for Christ sake and she\u2019s more worried about how I\u2019m 25 and starting my bachelors. I just grew up thinking someone would be proud of me. I don\u2019t do this for her or anyone besides myself but damn\u2014 I just thought I would be able to say that my parents were proud of me for going to school. I get more appreciation from random people online than I do the closest people to me. \n\nTL;DR\n\nMother thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit failure for being 25 and starting my bachelors.",

      "text": "I\u2019m proud of you! And I\u2019m in the same position. I had mental health problems during my late teens and early 20s that made it a struggle to even go to school, let alone perform well. I started my AA in high school and finished at 25 because I had long stretches of time between terms where I had to take care of myself. I just now finished my bachelors degree and I\u2019m 27. The day after tomorrow, I start my masters. Is the the traditional route? No, but not everyone has the same circumstances, everyone is different and our lives play out at different paces. What matters is you are working hard to achieve your goals and even if it takes a little longer, you\u2019re doing it. Lots of people give up on their dreams and you\u2019re not. Your mom sounds like some of my family who feel the need to create \u201cthe perfect plan\u201d and they have tunnel vision because they\u2019re not looking outside of their own experience. Whether it\u2019s coming from concern or just plain being judgemental, put what she says aside and focus on your accomplishments which have been and will be fantastic :)",

I obviously ended up finishing multiple degrees and now I teach, but the whole time I was doing post grad I was shit upon and they didn\u2019t even come to my graduation. Now they all want to brag about how I\u2019m a professor but shit on my field because it\u2019s not \u201chard\u201d science and even if it were I\u2019m sure they\u2019d find a way to complain about it. Do you and love what you do. I finished my 3rd degree which led to my passion job at 35. You\u2019re good, dude. Keep it up.",

Mine spent 22 years hyping up me going to : through college. And as of a few years ago I\u2019m now a disappointment for getting a bachelors and a masters. \ud83e\udd2f \n\nYou do you and on your own timeline that works for you. You aren\u2019t a failure at anything. Things just happened in their own time for people. \u201cOn time\u201d is just a pressure construct.",

          "text": "The anti-intellectual movement that has picked up major steam in recent years is so toxic. \n\nI believe it began in earnest, because in America at least, college was seen as the route that *everyone* must take, when that\u2019s realistically not the case. So what started as a movement to try and push alternate routes for people who aren\u2019t suited for college turned into a belief that *no one* should go to college, because it\u2019s just a brainwashing factory. People send their good hearted Christian boys and girls to college, who then return home believing in nonsense like climate change, vaccine efficacy, and evolution. \n\nThe only thing you can really do is let it go. I\u2019m not about to end relationships with my parents over this stuff. I\u2019ll let them think I\u2019m a know-it-all or whatever because it\u2019s not worth it to me to cause a rift in that relationship over something like climate change, which none of us really has any control over anyways.",
