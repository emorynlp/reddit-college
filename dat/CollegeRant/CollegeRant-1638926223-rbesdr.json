  "text": "November 18, we took the final exam for the lab and our final lab report was also due that same day right before class. TA said he would get both of those grades back to us right after thanksgiving weekend and the absolute deadline to get them back to us is December 6. Well it\u2019s December 7 today and there\u2019s still no grade for either of them. This is complete and utter bullshit. How can you give me a hard deadline for an assignment and then take weeks to give me my grade for said assignment?",
