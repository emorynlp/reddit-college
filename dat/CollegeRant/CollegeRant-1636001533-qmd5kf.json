  "text": "The apartment below me is so loud, it\u2019s 1am on a weekday and they are blasting music and basically yelling. This happens until 2am every night, even though quiet hours starts at 10am and I get barely any sleep through the night and have to take naps every day.\nMy friends keep telling me to confront them or file a noise complaint but I\u2019m a very passive guy, I don\u2019t like  confronting anyone and normally just suffer the consequences of anything rather than asking.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this.\n\nTL;DR: apartment below me is constantly loud until 2am every night",
