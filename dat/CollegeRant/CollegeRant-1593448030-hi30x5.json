  "title:": "College math classes are a bigger scam than textbook prices",
  "text": "99% of material covered in college math classes is worthless and will never be applied in the real world for those seeking careers as non-math majors. It\u2019s akin to forcing a nutrition/wellness major into studying theoretical physics, or making a dance major study engineering. The only reason I can think colleges force these bogus classes on students is to put as many roadblocks in the way of graduation as possible so they can make more money. Perhaps this is why most math instructors just lazily read off screens and rush through everything without explaining it for those who are confused, because they are aware this information is pointless too. Hell, I\u2019ve gotten more help from other students than the instructor during my summer class this year. Are universities this scummy about taking useless classes outside the United States too?\n\nTL;DR: college math classes are nothing more than a tool for universities to arbitrarily keep you from graduating.",

Think of the covid stuff going on right now, I saw a kid post that, because deaths are relatively stable, the sharp increase in total cases is irrelevant. \n\nIf that same kid had taken a calculus class, he would understand the relationship between first and second derivatives and know that the relatively stable number of deaths is not necessarily going to stay that way. \n\nNo, you don\u2019t need to know trigonometric integration. But, you should know how statistics are calculated, why rate of change is so important, and you most definitely should never hate on something just because you won\u2019t directly need it for your major.",

No one in my group understood anything but me, she wouldn't answer questions, so I ended up teaching my group and the groups next to us. It was a huge waste of time and $900.00. I haven't taken a math course since, I study on my own and take a CLEP test. F that.",

I remember reading a post that said that the point of book analysis isn't to see what isn't there, but to see what could potentially be there and read between the lines and whatnot. Likewise I do think some math in college is good to have (trust me I HATE math) because it can genuinely help sometimes. Gen eds suck but sometimes they actually do have a use. As for your argument with the lit student and java honestly in this day and age it might be a decent skill to have (that being said, I have yet to take a compsci class, but will be taking one this year)",
