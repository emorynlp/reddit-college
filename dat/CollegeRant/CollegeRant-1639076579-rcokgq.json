  "title:": "I'm losing my job because of my class schedule",
  "text": "I'm losing my job at the end of December. I have been at the same company for 6ish years, and during that time, I re-enrolled in college. For a while, I was able to schedule my classes so they wouldn't interfere with work, but this upcoming semester requires that I attend classes full-time. My boss let me know that it wasn't going to work out; since I have morning classes two days a week. I'm not bitter about losing my job...I understand the whole thing of needing someone there full-time. If anything, I'm anxious about this new chapter in my life. Since I have a full-time class schedule, and the program I am in is very competitive, my partner and I agreed that I should solely focus on school for the time being. The feeling of not having a steady income of my own is honestly kind of terrifying. I've always been self-sufficient, so it's hard for me to come to peace with this change. Also, my classes are 100% online, which means I'll be home all day. I worry about being isolated and not having much social interaction. It's a lot to take on at once, and I'm trying to focus on the positives, like being able to put all my energy and attention into my studies. But it's still hard. Change is hard. Stepping into the unknown is hard.",

      "text": "Hey you will be okay!! I also hate change lol. But it will feel so good to look back and realize that you did something you were completely scared of and that it worked out better than you ever could\u2019ve thought. I understand concerns about isolation especially with all online classes. If you can, try to visit a coffee shop/library a couple times a week to work on your classes, that\u2019s how I study and it makes it feel way less lonely AND more motivating cause I\u2019m around other people doing the same thing \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f wishing you the best!",

      "text": "Aw, try to look on the bright side. A ton of people would kill to \"only\" be a full time student and not have to worry about work. You probably will be less stressed in general once you get into a routine. If youre worried about being isolated then just make an effort to regularly see friends or go to campus events if there are any",

      "text": "Hey, I'm happy for you!  It's a new chapter.  Scary, but you can make it work, and be an even better student than before = )\n\nAs for the isolation, during COVID, I would set up a GroupMe for the class, and send out a blind, general Canvas message to all of my classmates to invite them to join, and send the link.  It was a way to get connected, and also to identify other driven students.  Before exams, I would send out an invitation and a link to classmates (either through Canvas or in the GroupMe or both) to a Zoom study session, which I would host.  Usually only last 1-2 hours, but were generally very productive.\n\nIt helped to keep me motivated to study, and also I made actual friends!  And having a GroupMe made it so I didn't feel as dumb when I was stuck on a concept or had a question that I was too wussy to ask the professor.",
