  "text": "So far I've been in college for 2 years, I have 2 majors and finished both undergrauates within the 2 years. I've done all sorts of crazy things to finish like taking 5 summer classes and going to 2 other community colleges just to finish quicker. I have highest honors but im severely burnt out\n\nI have about 2\u00bd years left. I pay for my own books and tuition from community College out of pocket with my minimum wage job. I work 2 days nightshifts for 8 hours and save my money. But I go to school 5 days a week. I avoid moving out because I don't want debt.\n\nI make around $177 weekly. I used to save $150 a week but now im starting to save only a $50 a week because of my parents.\n\nMy dad complains that Its shameful i cant cover a $40 emergency cost if needed. My mom states that I leech off her too much for other costs like gas. (Which i know is bad but I dont make enough for California's gas prices.) My dad understands the economy is bad but never worked minimum wage, my mom doesn't understand the economy and goes on with \"wHeN i wAs yOuR aGe\" tangents. They both make six figures in the medical fields without a single bachelors. \n\nTo stop the nagging and harassment I'm getting a second job as an embedded tutor. Throwing my mental health even more down the drain. Yes i think of suic!de daily and when I tell my mom she thinks I'm trying to manipulate and scare her.  I dont want to leech off my mom for gas anymore I want to be able to cover any emergency costs. I have to choose between dumping my already declining mental health down the drain or keep being a nuisance burden to my parents. I'm gonna take the second job anyways cause I dont want to be a brat, just nothing feels good man.",

If you're doing two majors *and* a job, I don't think it's crazy to rely on your parents a little. I'm sorry your parents don't see it that way.",

      "text": ">So far I've been in college for 2 years, I have 2 majors and finished both undergrauates within the 2 years.\n\nI would take a break from college and get any job, but then upgrade then from there to a full time job.  Look for government jobs.  The reason for this is because government beaurocrats can be some of the most overpaid people out there for what little work they do.  This applies to all government levels.  Now obviously, there are those stiff, legal eagle types who work hard, but if you are mid or entry level, you should have plenty of room to slack because they won't want to hire someone to make sure you are working without hiring someone to make sure THAT person is working because they tried that sort of thing already and thats why we have too many government employees.  This is also a way to sort of sidestep the economy.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my mom doesn't understand the economy and goes on with \"wHeN i wAs yOuR aGe\" tangents.\n\nIf you're a man, she treats men like that in general if they are her family members.  It's just like men that treat their women a certain way.  She also thinks she can because she is paying you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They both make six figures in the medical fields without a single bachelors.\n\nYes, but they didn't start out that way, I reckon.  You won't likely either. If you do start off making 100k, it just means 100k is the new 50k.  It's unfortunate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have to choose between dumping my already declining mental health down the drain or keep being a nuisance burden to my parents.\n\nI don't understand how you will dump your mental health. The reason that I don't understand is because it seems like the problem, according to you, is that you are tired of borrowing from your parents and being nagged about it, yes?  So that means if you get a job, your mental health should likely improve.  It probably will for very practical reasons as well.  So, you will be up and moving, which means you will get a bit of exercise and a chance to meet new people, which are all good for mental health.  You can try to work or tutor the person outside, or try it maybe, which will probably keep your student awake and engaged.  That will give you vitamin D, which most North Americans are deficient in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, try to conceptualize what a proper gentleman and/or lady is and then try to conceptualize why that person isn't a brat/nuisance.  Then think about what a brat/nuisance is and move away from that and toward what the idealized lady/gentlman version of yourself is.",
