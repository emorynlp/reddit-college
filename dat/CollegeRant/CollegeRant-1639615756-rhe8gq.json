  "text": "I just finished my fucking bachelors and I\u2019m not even happy about it. I wanted to apply for a master at my same university and I filled a form mid semester. They called me, told me I couldn\u2019t do much cause I was still in the processes of getting my degree but the most I could do was send my resume and a little essay, like a purpose declaration or whatever the fuck. I decided to work on that after finishing the semester because I had a big work load. And yet, I keep getting automatic messages about how I haven\u2019t registered for classes and shit, even tho I was told I couldn\u2019t until I finished my bachelors and did the masters process. I just finished my bachelors YESTERDAY. Maybe I\u2019m just dumb and don\u2019t understand how this process works. Worst is is that the advisors at my fucking school never answer emails. I emailed my advisor about a simple question about the word count in declaration essay and they never got back to me. This whole fucking process is shit and it hasn\u2019t even really started. I\u2019m sick of this\u2026",

      "text": "Damn. Sorry to hear that your advisors aren't being helpful. My only suggestion would to keep calling the advising office until somone picks up. My only other suggestion would maybe looking into another graduate school program hopefully one that cares about their students. Good Luck!",
