  "title:": "why do you guys not contribute to semester long group projects?",
  "text": "seriously if you leave me to do 80% of the work and another guy to do the other 20% and you and another person just fuck off the whole semester, why should you be included on the project? Instead of sending me private messages of bullshit excuses and thanking me for my hardwork how about fucking helping they also do not contribute to our public group chat mind you our professor is in it and reads it sees only me sending 90% of the messages. Like what the fuck dude I hope we get fucking 30/150 on this project at least i will still finish with a fucking A. Shit was so fucking stupid if i ask you to provide feedback and all you do is fucking just read the damn message like wtf bro i am asking you to do the bare fucking minimum. Our project is fucking due today and nobody has the courtesy to see where we are at so i fucking just submitted as is if yall dont give a fuck about it then neither do I.",
