  "text": "I was doing really well this semester too and I turned it on my assignments and did good on my final too. I thought that I was going to get a good grade for this class at the end of semester. However, there was this group project that I did and I thought that only one person had to turn it in the group, but I was wrong and got a zero. I feel so numb and disappointed in myself. I emailed the teacher about this and he said, \"The team member who does not submit the documents by the due date will receive a ZERO grade.\" My school this semester is doing a pass/fail this semester (thankfully). Meaning that my credit will be counted, but my GPA will not be affected. I think what got me is that the hard work I just put in and this one assignment just duked it. I just needed to rant. That's for hearing my story.",
