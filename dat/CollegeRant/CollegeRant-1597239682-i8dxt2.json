  "title:": "Who in the hell makes final and midterm projects due in the middle of the day in summer?",
  "text": "Like, I get making finals due at a certain time during a proper designated finals week with a designated time. I get making midterms due in the middle of the day if you\u2019re in person or synchronous online. But who in the fuck makes a final essay \u2013 which is supposed to be a minimum of 8 fucking pages \u2013 due in the middle of the day in *summer*???? People are still traveling because it\u2019s summer and they can\u2019t control what their family wants!!! People have jobs so that they can\u2019t work on essays during the day, and by night, they\u2019re too exhausted to do both our *normal* assignment *and* our final essay. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep up because he wants so much and it\u2019s like, dude, just fucking make it due at midnight, and you\u2019ll get papers that reflect what we\u2019ve learned, not something that we haphazardly threw together because of your fucking demands. Like, seriously!!! It\u2019s one thing to make it due at midnight, I don\u2019t care about that, and it\u2019s one thing to make a test due at class time when there *is* a set class time, but when it\u2019s a work at your own pace???? The fuck???? Why can\u2019t it be due at midnight, or 11 pm, or hell, **9** pm????\n\nAnd what makes it even more infuriating is I have two professors this summer semester, and one of them is doing great. In fact, I\u2019d almost say his assignments are harder, and they certainly are time-wise, but far more manageable. Our final and midterm essays were clearly outlined by him, and he said that he only wanted 5-6 paragraphs and made the papers be due at midnight. It\u2019s workable. But this other prof, who has the *audacity* to request a minimum of *8 pages* gives us less than enough time to actually write it and makes it due in the middle of the day!!!! It\u2019s not even a class for majors only, so idk what the hell he\u2019s trying to do, make people not want to major in this subject????\n\nAND besides that, he either never responds to emails or he takes ten years to respond and by the time he\u2019s responded to your time-sensitive email, you\u2019ve already worked around it and threw something haphazard together. What a fucking asshole, and I have to take him again in the fall (I didn\u2019t fail this class, I just have to take another major requirement which he teaches). And!!!! It\u2019s the same situation!!!! Online, work at your own pace, finals and midterms due at 2 fucking pm",

      "text": "Some professors have weird deadlines. I understand that professors can set deadlines for whenever they want, as long as the deadline is after the class starts and before the class ends. For example, if I took a fall semester class (August-December), a March deadline for an assignment would make no sense.   \nI have a bachelor\u2019s degree. In college, I had a professor with some strange deadlines, and I had to plan for her deadlines. The class was an education class on Tuesdays/Thursdays from 9:30-10:45. Some of her assignments were due on Wednesdays at 9:30 AM, even though we didn\u2019t have class on Wednesdays. Some other assignments were due at 9:30 AM on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but she wouldn\u2019t grade them before they were due (regardless of how early we submitted them), and we never used any of the assignments in class activities or class discussions. I never understood what the point was of having assignments due before class if she wasn\u2019t going to read the assignments before class or incorporate the assignments into her instructional materials for the day.",

          "text": "Thank you. I\u2019m not bad with most essays that I\u2019ve had (before I changed my major, I was an English major so I had a lot of essays to write) and it was easy to keep up with and easy for me to turn in, and for all but one of my essay professors before this guy, they kept up with their grading with ease and got our grades back to us at a reasonable time. His was just really hard to plan for because it sounded like he wanted everything we covered, and he didn\u2019t want an outline or anything, just 8-12 pages. I got it done and I did well, I was just very frustrated because it seemed so weird to me to have a 2 pm deadline which caused some students to receive incompletes instead of just making the deadline a little later in the day",

It\u2019s not a reasonable assignment if he can\u2019t keep up with grading his class\u2019s normal assignments that don\u2019t have a time limit for him to turn in. It\u2019s a reasonable assignment for a professor who grades the assignments immediately and has shown themselves to be on top of their job, not for a professor who lets all the grading pile up. Completely reasonable for that kind of professor is not an 8 page essay, it\u2019s a short essay or a multiple choice exam",

Just because I rant doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t do the thing, it means that I\u2019m tired and annoyed and stressed so I\u2019m complaining because I have a right to complain. I would gladly have taken a different prof but he\u2019s the only one, and he sucks. Other people with my major say so. I had someone recommend someone other than him but there is no one else. He sucks. He has worse time management than all of us. And did you not see the part where he has to issue more than one incomplete grade because he didn\u2019t make a manageable due date time.\n\nOh also, forgot to mention the part where, even if someone had finished their assignment early and wanted to turn it in to help him get ahead in grading, he made the due date last year until he changed it last night. It\u2019s on him, I don\u2019t want lectures, I just want to rant",

Have a full time job and so full time schooling. Yea it\u2019s a bitch but you signed up for college so it is what it is. It can be done you just have to put in the time and have good time management. Second of all nobody said you couldn\u2019t rant but we\u2019re allowed to put our opinions and experience to because it may help someone. Now because you don\u2019t wanna hear what we have to say that\u2019s on you. Third of all if you had good time management you wouldn\u2019t have made the post for an 8 page essay bruh. This is coming from someone whose written 45+ pages in one semester and doesn\u2019t have great time management skills but made it through my freshman year of college.",
