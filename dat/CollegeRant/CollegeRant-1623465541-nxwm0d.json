  "text": "Hey, as you can tell, I'm not graduating college \"on time\". I switched majors because I wasn't happy or felt supported in my original major but fell in love with my new major but it will take me an extra 2 years. I've had people doubt me for this change. It seems like everyone else has a support system but I lost my family's and my (ex) boyfriends along with everyone else's support because of this and I feel alone. How do you combat this? How do you find a support system?",

Today she\u2019s working in her major field and financially solvent, no different from anyone who graduated in 4 years. Don\u2019t listen to anyone who tells you this will ruin your future or anything.\n\nIn terms of your support system: If the people in your life would abandon you over this, that\u2019s a problem with them, not with you. Stuff like this always hurts to go through, but know that not everyone is like that! You can 100% find a supportive community of friends who won\u2019t judge you by your perceived professional potential. Maybe start with other people in your new major?\n\nAlso definitely agree about talking to a counselor at your school.",

Honestly life is too short to be around unsupportive people. If anything they did you a favor by showing you their true colors. Find a more supportive circle, (perhaps classmates in your major, professors, etc) and finish your degree. You got this!",

      "text": "Many (in fact most) people that are close to you might see this as a fallback in your career as you stated, but you are the only one that needs to be fully satisfied and happy with what you're doing. Switching majors is one of the most important things one should do in case their not happy with their previous one as it is better to take your time and complete something that you are most likely good at (giving you a higher rate of success) than taking the usual 4 years and finishing \"on time\" and then moving on to live unsatisfied for the rest of your life (at that point you would be lying to yourself every day). Don't let outside noise bother you. I know this might be an opinionated example, but Elon Musk (one of the most successful entrepreneurs currently) took 7 years while facing multiple challenges to finish his undergraduate degree.\n\nAs a suggestion, I would say maybe try to pile on experience and maybe multiple degrees while you aim at completing your undergraduate degree, You have made it this far so might as well push through and finish strong. Good luck!",
