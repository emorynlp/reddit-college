  "text": "Me and my mom recently contracted the coronavirus, so naturally I feel like complete garbage. My body aches, I\u2019m fatigued, I have headaches and sore eyes. The list goes on and on.\n\nI\u2019m trying to do whatever work I can, but it\u2019s so difficult in my current condition. I\u2019m suppose to be resting and getting sleep, also getting my vitamins but I haven\u2019t done that either. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to make it through these last two weeks or get any work done. I emailed my professors to notify them of my illness but I\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t care less. I wish colleges would actually prioritize the students health and well-being over some research papers.",
