  "title:": "I hate it when a submission is at the end of the semester, yet we have to constantly update and show our work.",
  "text": "Like it's just so fucking stressful because it's multiple things I have to churn out every week, everyday. Since the fucking submission is at the end of the sem how bout u just chill and wait till the actual day. I genuinely can't be doing a little bit of this and that every week can't I just focus on one thing at a fucking time and finish it. So yeah I ended up skipping classes cuz it's just way too stressful and I probably lost 40% of my grade lol wish me luck. But at least when I'm doing things at my pace I get shit done???? Like stop fucking expecting so much from me every week please. Please just give me a break. I CAN submit on time but I can't follow people's timetables and so I end up behind time.",

                  "text": "Actually, what the OP described is exactly us \"babying\" our students. We can certainly not provide any structured guidance/feedback and have a huge final project that determines 50% of your grade due by the end of the semester. But the end result is, most of our students would fail. The baby-steps were meant to help guide student along the way. What's the point of having you complete something you already know how to do?\n\nTrust me, most of us absolutely hate providing unappreciated revision feedback to our students. But we have to as it's our job. You can call us assholes for wanting you to correct a mistake, it's OK.",
