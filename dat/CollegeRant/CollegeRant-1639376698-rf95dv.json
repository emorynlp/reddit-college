  "text": "\nI am going to lay everything on the table here; sorry if it is long.\n\nSo, long story short, I went to grad school out of my need for housing. My undergrad lease was up the month I graduated and I was very fortunate to obtain a graduate assistantship that included housing in the contract. To be completely honest, I did not want to go to grad school but I took the position for the housing as I had no where else to go and not enough money to start a new lease elsewhere and also could not renew my old lease.\n\nAnywho, I ended up going to grad school in a field that I majored in during undergrad. However, I found the coursework far too hard and I transferred to an \u2018easier\u2019 program. I transferred to the new program as I 1) explored several programs but found I was unqualified or would be forced to graduate after my assistantship contract ended, which I could not afford. I ended up choosing my current program because it deals with the same industry as my assistantship. Since being in the program, I have discovered I have no interest in continuing in the field after graduation (primarily because it caused so much stress on my body and mental state).\n\nI am set to graduate in one semester\u2019s time. No idea what to do after college. Worry I will be on the beginning of a career path I hate. I\u2019e spoken to a career counselor and she asked me to research jobs I may enjoy; I have done so but none require a masters\u2019 degree, and most are for high schoolers. I don\u2019t think I want an actual career after I graduate, if that makes any sense. I just want a 9-5 job where I don\u2019t have to take home work. Yet, I also worry about my financial situation. I now have 5 or so month to figure out a new place to live and what I want to do with my life. I hated renting previously because I just threw money at the wind but I can\u2019t buy a house in my area right now. It all feels like its going to suck from here on out.\n\nAnyone else go into grad school but find they do not care at all about their industry and want to get out? Or, anyone else struggle with balancing happiness and finances? How did you all pull through?",
