  "text": "Man I\u2019m so disappointed, I tried going to a couple clubs recently to find people to click with but nothing really worked. I\u2019m going to hang out with some high school friends over thanksgiving break and it sounds like he\u2019s having a way better time compared to me. I just want to do SOMETHING valuable before the semester at least ends but I literally can\u2019t find friends to do so. I have a ton of physical classes next semester, so I have a really good chance of making friends, but I just wish I can make some now or soon or whatever. Just sucks. I\u2019ve spent this whole semester basically struggling by myself, and I just don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s so weird, I thought I would have friends by now.",

Either way, having no one to talk to sucks.

I use the Spring semester as a good example because people only want to hang around other people who have friends they made in the Fall semester. If you manage to fool people into thinking you have friends, they will allow you into their friend group, but eventually they will find out you have nobody outside of that group and they will slowly distance themselves from you and treat you as lesser. And people say this is the most accepting generation...haha.",

So, socialization is super awkward from my experience living on campus pre-covid.\n\nAlso, there's time to make friends with people all the time everywhere. You're in school to obtain an expensive credential in hopes of going into a career. It's work. You can make friends later too. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pick up a hobby.",
