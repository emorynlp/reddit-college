  "text": "\ud83d\udc4b Hi hi! I am a current Communication major working on an independent project in extension to a previous project I had during the school year, and was wondering if possible you could fill out the following survey if you happen to be a college alumni! This survey is about friendships and meeting new people after graduating, how you feel about your current friendships and if you plan to maintain them in the future. If you could please answer this survey, this would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!\n\nGoogle Form Survey: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpzN8D2iorIzQ-CssQbGPyom0k6LNb4q5h9_Vm7jIYP6l0yg/viewform",
