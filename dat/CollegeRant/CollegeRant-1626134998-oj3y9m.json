  "text": "Just needed to vent. I tried taking a summer University Physics 2 class ( 5 weeks) at a Community College (not my 4 year University). On the first day (today) I dropped. Ik myself and the level of stress I can handle and it was just too much. The speed is 3x as fast as the normal class (from my professor) and I spent 5hrs trying to understand two practice problems from the hmwk (watching videos,reading textbook). So I decided to take it in the fall at a slower pace. I'm still on track to graduate in 4 years since I was able to enroll in a class for the fall (at my Uni.). So realistically I don't have any consequences from doing this (my class load is the same since I just swapped another class for Physics). But it's making me second guess if engineering is for me. I feel like I made the right choice logically but it makes me feel unworthy of my major. Feeling low all around. \n\nTldr: Took and dropped a Physics 2 summer class and it hit my self esteem pretty bad.",
