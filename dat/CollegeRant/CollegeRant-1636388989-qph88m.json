  "text": "I just had an all-nighter with my group for this project, I was about to attend a 10 am class but then I decided it was best to join the lecture on zoom since I\u2019m so tired (I commute)\n\nBut then I went to my room to smell complete HORROR. The entire night this pup I\u2019m taking care of was just shitting everywhere. I thought her little poops were the reason for the stench but I\u2019ve cleaned them all up while the night went on but the smell was still so STRONG!!!\n\nWell I peek under the bed to see two piles of\u2026 not even piles\u2026 puddles, of rancid whatever I won\u2019t get descriptive but you get it\n\nI decided I wasn\u2019t going to even attend the zoom meeting. Partially because I had to clean this up ASAP, partially because I just had an all-nighter and I\u2019m very tired, and also partially because our professor said that he would be answering our final project questions today. My groupmate is the one that turned in the report for the outline of our project last night, so I don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\nMy groupmate also can\u2019t make it to class today, so if I did go to this class I wouldn\u2019t even know what to talk about. I didn\u2019t even know that we had that report due yesterday\u2026 last night\u2026. Ugh a while ago, I fucking hate all-nighters I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s supposed to feel like morning right now.",
