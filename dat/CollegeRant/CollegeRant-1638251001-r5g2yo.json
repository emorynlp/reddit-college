  "text": "I wasn\u2019t even really struggling academically this semester, more mentally and emotionally. I\u2019m just a mess. I think I had this unrealistic expectation that all of my mental issues would just vanish when I started college and, obviously, they haven\u2019t. I\u2019m a mess and I\u2019m ashamed of myself.\n\nMy social anxiety has completely destroyed my social life. I pretty much have no friends. I didn\u2019t talk to a single person for about a month. This then snowballs into loneliness which then sets off my depression and subsequently every self-destructive tendency I have (using Reddit is one of them lol). \n\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad that I feel like every little thing sets me off. My laptop charger stopped working and I almost had a mental breakdown. My dorm room is infested with spiders and today I had a real mental breakdown. I feel like my RA now hates me bc of how much I\u2019m bothering her with my bs. I feel like a failure. I know I\u2019m going to end the semester with decent grades (As and Bs), but I still feel like a failure. I feel like I\u2019m an emotional failure. A mental catastrophe. What if I\u2019m not mentally fit for college? What if I\u2019m not mentally fit for the world? What if I forever fail in life bc I\u2019m a mental and emotional disaster? Why can\u2019t I just be normal?",

      "text": "This is how I am currently feeling. It seems that the stress had overtaken you and from experience it is going to snowball. Have you tried talking to friend or possibly a therapist? Please don't think you are \"crazy\", all you're feeling is completely valid. To be quite honest, there is no such thing as normal, just you being you. If you seem like you aren't fit for college, its okay. Please explore your options. Maybe you don't know what you actually want to do and just following the crowd or your parents path. Make sure you are the one making the choices and no one else. You are not a failure, on the contrary you are trying your hardest. It is okay to cry, be mad and be raging mad. Make sure you aren't hurting anyone on the way. Be mindful as well. Take a year gap and find yourself, of course it is up to you. Its never too late.  I hope this helps. Also, if you need someone to talk to, I am here to listen.",
