  "text": "i took a proctored exam on thursday for a class required for my major. when reading the syllabus prior to class starting, i noticed how extreme(?) the rules were for the exams. here they are stated in the syllabus (brief):\n- webcam/mic required\n- show photo id\n- thorough environment check, 360\u00b0 view, must show workspace\n- must always have both hands on face during entirety of exam, exception would be moving one hand to select an answer or scroll\n\ni received an email today saying i made a 0 on the exam because i didn\u2019t follow the rules above. the only thing i can think of that i didn\u2019t follow directly was that i didn\u2019t always have both hands on my face during the exam. i kept my right hand on my mouse for most of it because i wasn\u2019t thinking of putting it to my face in the middle of scrolling. i have to meet with the professor on zoom to discuss why they gave me a 0. it feels invasive to me that they actually watch the videos of us taking the exam. i wasn\u2019t flagged; they watch ALL of the videos of the students taking the exam. this has been bothering me, and i\u2019m thinking of dropping the course after the meeting and taking it with a different professor next semester where it will most likely be in-person by then. i\u2019m upset that i was given a 0 instead of just having points taken off, and it makes me nervous about the rest of the semester.\n\nTLDR; failed a proctored exam because i didn\u2019t \u201cfollow the directions\u201d after professor watched my recorded video",

              "text": "I've never heard of that hands rule either. That's literally just your professor being WAY too paranoid. Plus in the middle of a pandemic and even flu season in general where you're really not supposed to be touching your face since it can allow germs to get into your system, it's literally dangerous. If you're gonna get a 0 for accidentally NOT touching your face even when they can see that the room and desk space is clear, then fuck that. Drop now while you can still get a decent refund for the class. Then use that money to pay to take the class in the summer with a well rated teacher instead",
