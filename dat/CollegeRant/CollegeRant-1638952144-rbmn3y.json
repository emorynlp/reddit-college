And I\u2019m not one of those people who can only sleep for 2 hrs a night or pull all nighters like it\u2019s nothing, though I wish I was :/ \nTrying to finish an essay right now, 1:30 am. Not super late but I\u2019m trying to finish this before I go to sleep so I can have some peace lol. I\u2019m just tired, that\u2019s all.",
