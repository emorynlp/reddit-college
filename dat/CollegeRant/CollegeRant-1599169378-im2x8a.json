  "text": "Originally posted in r/college now know this is the place for rants lol\n\nI still don't have the belongings that I left at school six months ago for my spring break. The college had a moving company pack everything up, and my stuff is just hopefully sitting on campus. They let in-state students get their stuff months ago. I live only four hours away from my school, and most of my friends from home were able to get their stuff back from their respective schools. My school is online again this semester and we all thought we were going to get our stuff by this time since we thought we would be back on campus. It's just so frustrating because I'm getting emails from classmates who live off-campus planning to play games of ultimate probably not approved by the school, and I still can't get student services to email me back. I know it's small, and it's just stuff in the crisis of a pandemic, but my school's inaction is maddening.\n\ntldr: I should have been able to get my stuff by now\n\n**UPDATE!!** I contacted the assistant dean and they told me that I need to contact campus security with what day and time I want to get my stuff and then I will be good to go! I hope that those of you who are still apart from your belongings will get them again soon. Thanks for listening to my rant!",

You should probably skip writing to the generic student services email if you haven't gotten a response. Go to either the head of your residence hall department or your local police station to ask for guidance. I would be firm if you contact the residence hall director and give them a specific date (say, by the end of next week) that you want access to your property by. You shouldn't accept any excuses and should ask for a stipend to purchase items like clothing and toiletries if they cannot provide you access to your stuff in a reasonable amount of time. Showing your effort to contact them if you end up going to the police will help so save all your emails.\n2. The school doesn't have the capacity to get involved with what all 10,000+ of their students do in their personal time off-campus, regardless of what that may be (both legally and practically). They do, however, have the capacity to give you your property back.",

I was told my uni sent my stuff to a storage facility but they haven't given me a way to contact them..",

They've been ignoring you so you don't know what they've done with your things. I think it'd be fair if you called the nonemergency line for the town the campus is in as it would get things moving pretty quick. Good luck.",

Originally I had a date to pick up everything in June, lol. \n\nLuckily I was able to make it up and grab my stuff, I couldn\u2019t imagine dealing with the headache. Good luck",
