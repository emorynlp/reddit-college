  "text": "I've made a few class \"friends\" where we talk in class but never outside. Most of my friends are my high school friends, but ever since the pandemic, they never invite me to anything. I have to initiate every interaction with them, and it's really wearing down on me. I was invited to ONE gathering this year. This whole year. And I don't know how to make friends with new people, everybody seems to stick to themselves in college. I wasn't able to join any clubs this semester because I work 20 hrs a week but I'm reducing my work next semester and joining some engineering clubs. I still don't know how much I'll be able to make friends there. It just sucks that I'm now two years into college and my only friends don't actually want to initiate any sort of hanging out.",

      "text": "I think this is more common than people really think. I\u2019m in community college and it\u2019s so difficult to make friends. Everyone is very busy and rushed out as soon as class ends. But when I was at a four-year, I didn\u2019t make friends in classes or clubs. I actually met all of my friends during orientation & one of them I knew from high school. People always say to just join clubs but even that isn\u2019t a guarantee. What I\u2019m thinking of doing is messaging people on Canvas to ask about classwork and maybe make group chats. Hopefully you meet people in engineering club, though. Maybe you can follow your school\u2019s social media pages and follow people who are interacting with the pages. If they accept your follow, maybe you can DM them and ask if they\u2019d like to study sometime. You could even ask people in the engineering club if there are any groupchats. Also, it\u2019s okay to be honest with people and say that you\u2019re looking for friends and are having a hard time making them. I also made friends at the four-year by posting on the facebook group & asked people to drop their snapchats. We all admitted in the chat that we really wanted to make friends, and although I left the school, a lot of the ppl that were in the groupchat are super close today.\n\n& honestly if your friends aren\u2019t initiating anything, I would bring it up to them. Are they busy? Or do they genuinely not like hanging out? You won\u2019t know until you ask. I wouldn\u2019t waste my time with ppl who don\u2019t make the effort.",

      "text": "I didn't start making good friends that I could work with until I started conversations with people. if the professor isn't in yet I'll start a conversation with someone next to me by asking about homework or how they think class will go. This is given that they're not in headphones or clearly doing something important like HW (this will generally annoy them)",

I feel like a fish out of water. i feel like i never had a chance to make genuine friends or know how to.",

      "text": "Im struggling as well. I have made maybe on friend, I am a transfer student, left my last university because the opportunity to make friends was crushed by covid and other reasons. Transferred to a new school, I tried joining a club just to not get a seat after 3 nights of tryouts, I tried getting a couple of people together to go lap swim throughout the week, but they all stopped contacting me immediately after I made a gc. My high school friends have been decent with responding to texts, except of course the one I am closest to. It sucks hopefully the second half of sophomore years turns around. I hope things get better for you.",
