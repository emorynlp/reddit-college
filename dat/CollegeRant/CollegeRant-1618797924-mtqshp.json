  "text": "Just had one of my last finals and I ended the course with a 16%. I\u2019m about to fail another by getting a 40-60%. I will literally have Fs on my transcript after this semester. I have been struggling all throughout college and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Previously I\u2019ve just dropped or BSed courses I wasn\u2019t doing well in but now I\u2019m out of drops and I couldn\u2019t BS them. I have no motivation to succeed and honestly don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in college, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without college either. I can\u2019t bring myself to do anything and I don\u2019t know WHY. Even if I knew why I don\u2019t know if it would change anything. I can never bring myself to actually study and find a million other things to do except study. I simply have not studied for any of my finals (like... at all). I don\u2019t have any excuses either, I just feel so overwhelmed all the time and I end up not doing anything. I don\u2019t even watch shows or read. I really don\u2019t know how I made it this far as a junior. I always tell myself this semester will be different and it\u2019s never different. On top of that finding an internship has been so stressful and I ended up cancelling my interviews due to anxiety I guess. So now I\u2019m failing my classes and have no internship. It sucks. \n\nAnyways just wanted to vent, thanks for reading.",

      "text": "Same problem I\u2019m having and it\u2019s only been 3 months into college for bachelors. I just don\u2019t really like online but I have no other choice because this the rest of my FAFSA. Just take breaks from assignments when you can, do them when you feel you\u2019re in good spirits. I\u2019ve managed to finished two tasks and I had no desire to any of them, I just know they have to be done. I quit work to dedicate time solely for college and I hate, at home all day reading trying to complete the coursework and tasks. The pressure of \u201cit should already be done \u201c just takes out any motivation I have most days so you\u2019re not alone, just take some days away from it when you can.",

It doesn\u2019t make sense to pay thousands and not want to be there. There\u2019s other options beside a four-year university you could always do a trade school or a career that doesn\u2019t require a degree",
