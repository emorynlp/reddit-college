  "text": "I'm a graduate student and I'm about three months into my two year programme. I like most of my classes, but I hate most other things about being here. I miss my family and friends, the few friends I have made are mostly final years so I won't have many people at all to speak to or hang out with unless I miraculously make a lot more friends next year. I don't have a car and my university is in the middle of nowhere, and I'm so busy with classes that I don't even have enough time to do other stuff apart from game and chat to my home friends.\n\nThere is a small possibility that I could study remotely for the second year of the course, but I'd lose all funding and my TA-ship. At this point, I'm genuinely considering doing that and getting a job at home and studying from there. However, I'd feel immensely guilty as I was picked because I can teach a very niche subject that not a lot of people can, and my advisor is counting on me for that. I'm on track to graduate in three semesters, so I suppose this is another potential option.\n\nAny advice? I have booked an appointment with the counselling service but they can't see me for a few more weeks. My advisor knows I'm unhappy but I don't think he knows it's gotten this bad. Any advice? Would I be a failure if I dropped out because of homesickness?",

You\u2019re the one you have to live with.\n\nWhat does success to you look like?  What can you tolerate?  That\u2019s the overlap of that Venn Diagram?  If they don\u2019t overlap, what\u2019s the shortest way to find a spot that overlaps?",
