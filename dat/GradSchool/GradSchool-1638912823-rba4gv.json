  "text": "I'm doing my first departmental seminar tomorrow in front of the entire department. The presentation part doesn't seem so bad but I'm pretty anxious over the questions. Every professor in the department will be there. I've prepared quite a bit, but I'm only a second year student so there's obviously still so much I don't know and I can feel it.. I'd be grateful for any advice or words of encouragement lol.",

Have friends or peers or family listen so you have an audience if you can, but mostly make sure you know the material and the segues.",

Most people don't expect that you'll give a flawless delivery and Q&A since you're a second year student. \n\nHowever, know the professors might ask you some tough questions. Not to try to put you on the spot to make you feel bad. But to challenge you, to give you the experience. If you have difficulty answering them, that's okay.",
