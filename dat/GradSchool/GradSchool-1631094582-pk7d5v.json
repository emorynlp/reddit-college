  "text": "So just wondering if this is normal or if I am overreacting like I always do.\n\nI started my PhD and a few weeks later the pandemic hit so I have been working from home - was told that I would work from home for 4-6 weeks which in hindsight was clearly way off - 18 months or so now.\n\nI suspended my studies for 4 months because I really struggle to focus at home - I have been to counselling for it through the university and for the most part I was told to make a schedule - which I don't stick to anyway because I don't have any form of meeting or seminars or anything to attend even remotely, I just sit in my room every day and study with no interaction because I haven't ever met anyone and the only source of communication was a slack channel that nobody uses.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the end of my suspension I e-mail my supervisor since 4 months had passed asking for the date I should return and was told that my suspension was up a month ago... I never received any email, no message, nothing then when I asked about it I was gave a shrug which pretty much always happens.\n\nThen I sent another email to re-arrange a meeting and wasn't responded to for about 3-4 weeks - so if I wasn't already demotivated before my suspension in studies I sure am now.\n\nI got covid so was ill for 2 weeks - came back and was met with emails that my 6 monthly review was in 2 weeks which I have to prepare a large report for that is nowhere remotely near finished.\n\nIs this unusual? Am i overreacting?",

      "text": "There are definitely some unusual things about this, but, overall, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything substantial to worry about. \n\nMy program doesn\u2019t call them \u201csuspensions,\u201d but it seems like what you\u2019re talking about is akin to taking a leave of absence, which students in my program are allowed to do for any number of reasons. In my program, it would be highly unusual for a student to take a leave of absence but never receive a definitive end date for it. The fact that you didn\u2019t know your suspension was over a month prior is odd, but this simply might be due to the breakdown in communication that the pandemic has caused for many in academia. It is possible, though, that you were told the end date of your suspension... perhaps in an e-mail somewhere or mentioned verbally in a meeting? \n\nWhat is absolutely not unusual (and therefore probably nothing to worry about) is having a review. Most programs have things like biyearly or end-of-year reviews for each graduate student in the program. But the review is exactly that \u2014 a review. Faculty in your program should take note of the fact you had a 4-month suspension, so it\u2019s not like they would be expecting you to do a ton of work during that time. You should also let them know you fell ill, too. Reviews in my program allow students to let faculty know if anything personal or serious happened that may have impacted their progress, so I\u2019m working on the assumption that your program does something similar.",
