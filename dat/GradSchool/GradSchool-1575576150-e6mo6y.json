  "text": "(CW: suicide) \n\nI\u2019m... at a loss. I\u2019m a first year PhD student at a prestigious program, in anthropology. She was in my roommates cohort (2nd year) but was essentially in mine since she had had to take time off last year. She was in two of my three classes. She had a desk three feet away from me. She and I were in a three person project together. We found out yesterday. I drank with my friends in the program until I Irish-goodbyed at my own apartment. \n\nGrad school is hard. We all cared about her, we believed in her ability to succeed, she was a brilliant young woman. She was doing things to get better, going to therapy, taking medication, communicating her needs to her advisors. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nWe all struggle, but please, if you feel like this, tell someone. We all are going to feel the loss. No one wants to say goodbye like this. I don\u2019t really have the words, but it needs to be talked about. \n\nI\u2019m thankful that I took the advice of many other grad students and found a therapist early. And that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve put on my to-do list for today.",

Sending you healing vibes and hoping for peace for you and everyone who knew and loved your cohort member. \n\nIt\u2019s so sad and frustrating this keeps happening. There should definitely be a greater effort on behalf of educational institutions to provide free mental health resources and therapists to grad students. It is so easy to feel alone and consumed...just due to the very nature of what grad school is (lack of structure, lack of support, distance from friends and relatives, extreme stress, fear of failure, and the list goes on...). It\u2019s definitely a broken system that promotes or exacerbates previous mental health issues, However there is no incentive for those in power to change things because they directly benefit from our productivity and labor.\n\nOn a personal note, I have also started going to therapy and really wish I had gone sooner.",

      "text": "While I was working on my Ph.D., I lost a lab mate. He started in January and he died in April. He had just started field work, which he was loving. Then he was dead. I have no idea what happened, just that his roommate found him in their shared apartment. He was 23. I went to his funeral and met his family for the first time. They were lovely people and shared all these stories about what a fun-loving guy he was. I didn't really know him very well because he had only been in the lab for a few months and I was so wrapped up in my own work. All I knew was that he got his caffeine from Pepsi, rather than coffee. \n\nI found out after his death that he was on antidepressants and medication for ADHD. To this day, I don't know if his death was accidental or on purpose. My advisor seemed to think it was a drug overdose - I don't know why he thinks this and maybe he had more information that I did about the situation, but I think it has more to do with him not wanting to feel any responsibility for it.\n\nI will always wonder if being more inclusive to him when he joined the lab would have changed things. I don't know that I actively excluded him, but again, I was busy and not particularly interested in helping out another new student at that point. However, had he reached out to me, I absolutely would have engaged. \n\nI think a lot of established students are wary of incoming students and burnt out on teaching techniques and sharing lab space, but that doesn't mean anyone wants you to die. If you need help, reach out. Engage. Please.",

          "text": "This strikes a deep chord with me. I got into a prestigious program under an Asian advisor with a FULL lab (I shit you not, one email to the lab sent to 30 recipients) of Asian students. I'm Asian American, but I'll never speak something other than English unless it's a private conversation (also, my languages are limited).\n\nFor this lab... It had hive mentality and complete exclusivity. They only scheduled trainings with others who spoke their language and no English in the lab even when it was enforced. They might talk smack on me and then I'd respond and they'd be extremely surprised that I understood, and then do a bashful dance as if that does an apology at all. My advisor was a psychopath and expected me to neglect paying my bills to produce work for him over the summer. Similar words were spoken in his office lol. I switched out.\n\nI'm not any happier in my new lab, but I've been at the school for too long without much progress. It's been a shit storm since my landing and it took me getting pretty sick (yet the department asking where my progress was for the duration) to realizing that it wasn't gonna be good for me to stay. Going to master out and find a healthier department to join. Give a better team the work they'll be supporting me for. \n\nHopefully you figure something out that works for you. You can PM me if you ever want to talk to someone who *understands*!",

For some, suicidal thoughts decrease because their mental energy is so exhausted that they can do little but do their day to day routine. If the energy returns, that agency can come back.\n\nFor most, anti-depressants are very useful when prescribed correctly and used appropriately. When starting any medication, people should monitor their physical and mental well-being until the medication has reached the full level of concentration in their bodies. Some physiologies are weird and don't react as well as others, but for most, medications will have the desired effect.",

          "text": "Your comment is testament to why colleges/universities need to spend a lot more money on mental health resources.  Medications can have scary side effects, but are also extremely helpful to people (hence people downvoting you).  Many people respond well to some drugs and not others. However, without a good attentive doctor and regular appointments, it's not possible to figure out what works for people. \n\nMy university's student health center is extremely overwhelmed and doesn't have the resources to serve the student body's mental health needs.  Luckily, our student health insurance is amazing, and the university has spent time making connections with providers in the community, who take our insurance.  I have had a string of mediocre psychiatrists as a young adult, including ones from my undergraduate mental health system.  Most of them are over-worked and never seemed to make the time to get to know me as a client.  I never got on a cocktail of meds that worked properly for me.  I got extremely lucky and was referred to an amazing psychiatrist when I needed help with medications in grad school.  She played around a lot with my meds before we found a combination that worked for me.  However, when we were figuring it out, one of the SSRIs I was put on (Prozac) made me extremely depressed and suicidal.  Thankfully, I had friends who noticed a personality change and a doctor who made herself available to see me.  I called her about the side effect and she immediately took me off it and rearranged her schedule so I could come in asap.  As soon as I went off the meds the thoughts stopped.  But if I hadn't had a good psychiatrist, I shudder to think about what could have happened.  Had this happened to me in undergrad, where my student health center was mediocre at best and there were limited outside options in the area, the results could have been much darker.",
