  "title:": "Dropping a course before deadline, do I let the professor know?",
  "text": "Like the title says, I enrolled in a course outside of my department, but I feel like its too much work, so I wanted to drop it before the deadline. \n\nI emailed the professor to see if I could sit in his class on a trial basis, he told me to enroll so that I have access to the course readings. \n\nWill it be improper to just drop the course in the university system and be done with it? \n\nThing is, I'm a bit intimidated by him, he seemed annoyed by my initial request to try out his class, especially since I'm in a different department and I had already missed the first week. So I just want to sneak out as quietly as possible without ruffling any more feathers and hope he won't notice that there's one person missing from the 19. But I'd send an email if I absolutely have to. \n\nThe deadline to drop without any consequences is day after tomorrow.",
