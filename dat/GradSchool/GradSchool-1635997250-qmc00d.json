  "text": "November seems like that time in the semester where every thing seems to be due everyday or there is some exam. I know I will get through it but I just get stuck feeling overwhelmed and essentially get nothing done that day. What do you guys do to get over that feeling of being overwhelmed/stressed out and get back on track?",

      "text": "First I try to prioritize small, achievable goals for each day. I emphasize small. Small is better than nothing. Maybe it\u2019s \u201cstudy for 1 hour total\u201d or \u201cwrite a bare bones outline for the essay\u201d. \n\nThen, I break up that goal into the smallest possible steps. Literally the smallest steps. For example, if the goal is writing then Step 1 is turning on the computer. Step 2 is opening a new document. Step 3 is naming and saving it. Step 4 is opening any instructions or resources I already have and know I need (or going to download them). Between every single step, I take a mini-breather. So maybe turn on the computer, walk out of the room and get a cup of water. Then go back and log in/open Word, step away and pet my dog. Name the doc and save it; tab over to Reddit for one minute. Get my resources or instructions open; let my dog out to potty. \n\nEventually you find yourself in a position to make progress and it\u2019s less overwhelming to start because you\u2019ve eliminated the first barriers. Often, by making yourself do these easy and approachable first steps, you\u2019ve reduced the overall intimidation of it in the moment and it\u2019s easier to settle in. You may find yourself not needing so many mini-breaks. Over days, you may find it easier and easier to initiate the activity and settle in faster.\n\nI know it sounds like \u201cwow but you barely get anything done and it must take up so much time.\u201d Maybe sometimes that\u2019s true, but guess what: it\u2019s more progress than I\u2019d make being too paralyzed by anxiety to start. Even just 1% per day is better than 0%.",
