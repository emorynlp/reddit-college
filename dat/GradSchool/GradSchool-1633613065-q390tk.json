  "text": "I have been offered an amazing, prestigious post-doc that, career-wise, is more that I could have ever hoped. However, the catch is that this position requires me to live abroad for a year in a megacity in a developing country. I've lived in developing countries before for 3-4 months at a time, but this is one that I'm particularly not excited about, and the city has a reputation for uniquely terrible quality of life.\n\nFurthermore, were I to take the position, my spouse would not move with me. We've done long distance before for about 4 months, but never this long. Our relationship is strong, and we would get through it, but I'm really not looking forward to a crappy year. I'm leaning towards taking the job, because afterwards, it puts me in a really competitive position to pursue the career I've always wanted, in an area my spouse and I have always really wanted to live.\n\nConvince me this is a good idea? I'd love to hear from folks that took a short-term position they assumed they would really hate and came out the other side okay. Or didn't, I suppose. My anxiety is really creeping in on this one...",

      "text": "Long distance is super hard. However, this is a \u201conce in a lifetime chance\u201d by the way you described it. If this helps your career and thus would probably help your relationship because you\u2019d have a better job and pay, then I say do it. A big thing to do though is to sit down with your spouse and set certain times or things you both should do to keep your relationship in good standing. Check in with each other once a week. Do either of you need more communication? Less communication? How often will you visit one another? You might already have a plan in place for your relationship which is great!! \n\nAs another commentator said, a year can go by super quick. This sets you up for what sounds like a great life afterwards. And it sounds like you have a supportive spouse too or you wouldn\u2019t even be considering leaving! If this is the only opportunity you see yourself receiving to have what you want after the trip, take it!",

      "text": "I suppose it depends on what field you're in, but my question is what exactly you hope to concretely accomplish in a position for a single year.  Will you be able to do enough work in one year to generate a first-author publication that will help your career?  Will you learn some critical new skill that you plan to use for the rest of your career?  And so forth.  If the answer to one or more of those questions is yes, then it might be worth it.\n\nBut one year isn't very much time to do a substantial amount of work on a project you haven't worked on before.  That, combined with the undesirability of the location, would make me extremely skeptical about taking the position.  But only you can answer for yourself whether you think it will be worth it for your career and/or marriage.\n\nGood luck.",
