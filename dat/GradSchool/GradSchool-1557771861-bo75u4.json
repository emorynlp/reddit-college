  "title:": "My wife and I just walked for our PhDs. My thoughts on starting a family during graduate school.",
  "text": "Hey guys, like the title states, my wife and I both defended last June (Molecular Microbiology), and walked on Saturday. We met a half a year before our programs began, and we married and had a kid 2 years in.\n\nStarting a family in grad school is definitely doable, depending on your lab situation. We had zero proximal family support, so we had our son in daycare during the weekdays, and we took turns watching the little guy on the weekends and weeknights when one or the other of us had to put in a lot of work. Not trying to violate rule 9 here, but we collectively published 12 times (4 first author, 5 co-author, three reviews) as PhD students, so I would dare to say that we didn't half-ass it because of the kid.\n\nVarious (usually older) faculty told us that we were making a mistake when my wife got pregnant (on purpose), and our school offered zero support for graduate student mothers apart from the mandatory, unpaid FMLA weeks (my wife took 6 weeks plus her two weeks of vacation). Luckily, our mentor was extremely supportive and absolutely thrilled to have a lab baby (she even babysat for us a couple of times).\n\nSo, if you are considering getting married and/or having a kid in grad school, never let anybody tell you that you ***have*** to put your life on hold, especially if raising a family is a high priority for you; those mid 30s come up real fast. Talk to your mentor, look at what resources your school/state/country offers, get advice from others who have gone through the same thing, and do your research about the child care options in your area. Most importantly, find a work/life balance that works for both of you, and be sure to create some quality family time (weekend \"daycations\" and babysitter-allowed date-nights kept us sane).",

My dissertation project picked up steam towards the middle of my 3rd year, and I got one decent pub in year three, and a middle to high impact paper out right before my defense. Her project took a while to really get going because of how multifaceted and frustratingly inconsistent the data was at the beginning. Nobody in our lab had ever done what she was doing, and the learning curve was steep. That being said, she got a good review out early, and her dissertation first-author came out shortly after her defense. I won't say that the baby definitely didn't impede her progress any, but she by no means was at the back of the pack. So, if anything, I only got more productive with my own project, and she stayed relatively consistent.",

She breast-fed for a year, and you can't fully understand how demanding and time-consuming that is, especially having to pump 3-4 times a day at work, until you go through it. That's why I tell other Dads to change the damn diapers, it is the least we can do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer degree progress: Our institution has a mock-RO1 qualification exam requirement, and she wrote the majority of that in her time off. So she was still able to be productive during those 8 weeks. We were both able to defend in less than the average time for our school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnsupportive comments and criticism: We took them in stride, and just made it our goal to prove them wrong. And obviously, we tried really hard to keep those kinds of people out of our ears as much as possible once they made their positions known. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinances: You have to make a strict budget and keep to it. Daycare, and other baby-associated costs, ate up more than a fourth of our combined salaries, and housing costs another fourth-to a third. The rest of the cash was tightly budgeted, and we even managed to save some money each month and start a retirement fund. We did go to school in a city with a relatively low cost of living.",

Congratulations!!! \n\nWith respect to finances, I had a different experience living on one of the coasts where housing gets expensive. Combined, daycare and rent were more than my entire monthly paycheck. And I attended one of the higher stipend programs (at the time). My wife was a new teacher when we became parents, also only had 8 weeks maternity leave which is way too short. She made little more than me in my first year as a grad student and worked similar hours.",

We have a friend that had a baby in her last year of grad school, and she is doing well with a good job now. There really is never a perfect time for a working couple to have a kid. \n\nAs far as pubs go, it is really just about sticking your fingers in as many side projects as you can and hoping you get lucky with the results. For those and your main project, hand your PI manuscript outlines before they even ask for them. Make them start thinking about what else is needed to turn it into a complete paper.",

I'm a MD/PhD student, so I get a little more than a year after the PhD to wrap things up a bit too. The 8 wks off didn't affect my research as much as the entire year afterwards (sick baby, night feedings, pumping....), but everything worked out great! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnsupportive comments -I've only ever heard them from older women in science who could not have family and career, so I just took those comments as a product of their generation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinances - Living in a low cost city definitely helped.
