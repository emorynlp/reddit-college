  "title:": "My academic buddy is a calm genius who helped me see that my research being delayed due to the pandemic isn't my fault",
  "text": "My research is at a standstill. The animal ethics course I need to complete before executing a large section of my project keeps being postponed due to the pandemic. Last week, I discovered that it'd been postponed once again to early next year, thereby pushing back my schedule another couple of months.\n\nA good friend of mine is in a different master's program and suggested a while back that we be one another's academic buddies. We check in once a week to see how we're doing and to set manageable goals or share frustrations. It's a healthy space where there's no pressure, only support. \n\nWhen I found out that my research was going to be postponed further because of the animal ethics course being pushed back, I had a bit of an anxiety spiral. I contacted the university to find out about alternatives, but there were none, according to the head of the course. I knew I needed to tell my supervisor, and my mind went into overdrive with irrational fear and the implications of this new delay. I called my friend and explained the situation to her. She calmly listened and eventually cut in to tell me that my research being postponed isn't my fault, and I stopped dead because I realized she was right.\n\nI'm still discovering unhealthy habits and mindsets instilled into me by my previous supervisor, and one of those things was that everything was somehow my fault either directly or indirectly and was therefore my responsibility to fix. I went to therapy, changed supervisors, and thought I'd worked through most of my academic issues, but this one incident sent me into a panic, and my old habit of believing it was my fault crept back in. \n\nMy friend continued our conversation by reassuring me that there was no way at all that this institutional decision due to the pandemic was my fault and talked me through what I can do going forward. After much laughter and a few thank yous, we ended the call, and I felt ten times better. Yay for supportive friends in academia!",

      "text": "Just wanted to say you're aren't alone with your research being severely disrupted by covid. I'm doing my PhD and a huge part of it involves me doing field research for 4 months a year in a country on the other side of the world. My first field season last year went quite well but my sample sizes weren't enough to do anything with on their own, so I was relying on a second season this year to get adequate sample sizes. Well, a month into this years field season the national parks all closed due to covid, and we were kicked out of our field site for 1.5 months in the middle of the field season, completely ruining my chances of getting adequate sample sizes for this project. So I've basically had to completely throw out a huge part of my thesis that I had invested 5 months of fieldwork into (not to mention all of the money that went into international field work).",

The only solace I can offer (and it isn't much) is the solidarity of a fellow postgrad just trying to make it through to the end of their damn degree. I truly hope it gets better for you. Good luck :)",

My friend helped me get back into reading papers and working on my thesis again, but it's still tough and I'm nowhere near where I've convinced myself I need to be. This really is a stressful time for everyone. I wish you all the best with the rest of the steps you take (big and small) towards the end of your degree.",

Sometimes it's ok if you're not productive and sometimes productive is taking a shower and making a cup of coffee instead of staying in bed (that's what I tell myself anyway). My supervisor checks in with me once a month and has told me to focus on my family and myself first and then to focus on my degree second because the world is bigger than my research. You haven't quit, you're just taking a scenic route to the end of your degree and that's alright.",
