  "text": "You know, it's in the wee hours of night, after a 12-hour day of scrambling to catch up on research, tirelessly editing, grading final papers that remind you that only two of your students listened to you all semester, and you sit down to a bowl of Ramen (only half the flavor pack since you skipped your workout) and a can of Busch (light-- you're eating Ramen after all) because it's one of those ever-so-neccessary quick-n'-affordable meals, and you ponder the bright, promising future post-grad, post-10 to 12 years of post-secondary education, adjunct position, hoping to get by. Most the time you wonder, \"am I out of my mind?\"\n\nBut sometimes, not always, but on occasion, you remember:\n\nYour research IS valuable. \nYou DID impact those two students this semester. \nIdeas, beleifs, education, thinking DO matter. \nYou DON'T want to sell out to corporate misery. \n\nSo you go grab five hours of sleep, and do it again the next day, and the college system, in its good, its bad and its ugly, keeps chugging along, and in the morning, your remind yourself that you ARE contributing to the good of it, cause it's a new day and there is good. \n\nAnd, besides, Ramen ain't THAT bad!",

Neither is inherently worse or better, and humans *need* to process (cook) some foods to be able to eat them. Raw milk and raw potatoes are both worse for you than highly processed Quest bars (the sugar-free protein bars), frozen veg, and yogurt.\n\nWe can argue about this all you want, but broccoli is better for you than pork belly, point blank.
