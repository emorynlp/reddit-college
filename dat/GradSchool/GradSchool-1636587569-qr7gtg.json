  "text": "I'm trying to apply for an internship and am realizing I have no idea how to spin my research/supervision/knowledge from classes and working on projects into actual marketable skills. Which isn't a great thing but partially it's because I haven't made a resume in years and I'm not sure how to shift my CV into one. Does anyone know if there are any guides (even better if they're for grad students doing this) on how to take a CV and make it more resume-like? Thanks!",

A resume is a short summary showcasing some highlights.  \n\nTo get an idea of how resumes are typically formatted, I ended up talking to people in my field or related fields. There are lots of templates out there, but the norm in your industry can vary wildly. It\u2019s worth doing the legwork to figure out how to do it \u201cright.\u201d",
