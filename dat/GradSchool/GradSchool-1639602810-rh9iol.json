  "title:": "I almost failed out of graduate school after finding the right medication for my ADD symptoms",
  "text": "I was diagnosed with ADD in my junior year of college, along with a generalized anxiety disorder, and recently found that Strattera was very helpful in combating my symptoms. When I started taking it during my first year of graduate school, I found that I was able to keep up with more basic tasks and felt generally more fulfilled, but I was also less interested in my studies. For a long time, physics made me feel as though I could actually achieve something in my life despite my ineptitude in everything else. Now that I'm taking Strattera, I suddenly can do all these things that I couldn't do before, and suddenly physics doesn't hold as much interest for me anymore. But, I am currently in a prestigious program to study physics, and if I leave I will feel like a failure. If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it.",
