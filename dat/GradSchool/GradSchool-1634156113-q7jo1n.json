  "title:": "What is a normal number of hours for a grad student to work?",
  "text": "I am working on my PhD in physics. I work a minimum of 50 hours a week in the lab, usually closer to 60. I am only taking two courses each semester but I barely have time to do the homework, much less do anything fun outside of work/school. I talked to my advisor about working fewer hours and he basically said if I was being a wimp and if I want to get anywhere in academia I need to be working that much. Before I started this program I definitely wanted to get my PhD and do research in the field I am currently working in, but if this is the reality of that I am not sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow many hours do y'all work in the lab? Am I just being a wimp about it or is too much being asked of me?",

      "text": "i\u2019m in psychology. my advisor expects me to spend 40hours/week on classes and research (that includes designing studies, collecting data, writing, etc). like you, i\u2019m taking two courses each semester. i usually spend two days on classes/class work (readings, writing, etc.) and the other three days on my own specific research. of course when there are strict external deadlines (grants, conferences) i work more and may work weekends. \n\non the other hand one of my cohortmates works from 10am to 2am daily, six days a week. i would not encourage that and tbh i think he just isn\u2019t managing his time well. i also don\u2019t know how much of that 10am\u20132am of his is *actually* spent working.",

      "text": "i think on average 60 is how many hours an organic chemist phd puts in. personally i was on the low end, as i did not work or do \"homework\" on weekends. I probably worked 40-60, with 50 likely being the average. You really need to figure out what is important. Why are you so worried about doing homework for classes? research should really be your focus, and homework should be included in your work hours for the week. I assume next year you will not have homework. For example, if you are used to class all day and homework all night, you need to change that attitude. adjust down your research hours and do homework during that time during the day. Ideally you should not have to spend much time on homework, because you just need to pass the classes. It will be your research that moves you into the next stage of your career, not some foolish grades. grad students are adults and humans too and they deserve good things and time to themselves. you are not just punching a clock, be successful and efficient rather than just an hour-counter. make your phd your own.",

      "text": "I suppose there is a large difference between what is normally expected and what SHOULD be the standard. I've heard the 50-60 expectation from many. I've also heard of those extreme cases where a chem professor makes his students sign contracts for 12 hour days, 6-7 days a week. I would quit and file labor violations personally. \n\nAll too often the over 40 hr work week comes at the expense of oneself. To be frank it isn't worth while killing yourself for some asshole sociopathic professor, metaphorically or sadly literally. Hell, the 40hr week is not sustainable, originally intended for those 50s Era nuclear households with one working member and one full time at home member. \n\nThough I suppose I'm spoiled due to having the rare nice professor. Had some mental health issues and couldn't gather the energy to do more than 30 hrs at times. I'm also on my 8th year so... I suppose they've gotten a lot of cheap labor from me. The main aspect I would advise is that the sooner you get the degree the sooner you can get a better job and pay. Just don't overburden yourself to the point of breakdown. Pace yourself accordingly, if the professor refuses to allow any mental health allowances, they're a sociopath and I would advise to gtfo.",

In my experience, 50 hrs/wk is the minimum if you work in a highly competitive field and are aiming for a highly competitive position. I don't think working more > 60 hrs/wk is productive. I've met people who have been successful working 40 hrs/wk, but they are very rare. I wish I knew their secret!",

      "text": "I think this number wildly depends on what you\u2019re doing, and can fluctuate a lot. This is one of those things where it doesn\u2019t really make sense to compare yourself to others because different projects require different things. I think it\u2019s dumb that your PI is more focused on hours than results, but I know that\u2019s more typical in straight lab sciences. I might have crunch times or big pushes of fieldwork or lab work where I\u2019m pulling crazy hours, but when I\u2019m doing computational work I might only be putting in 20-30hrs a week. It\u2019s a lot easier to have work-life balance doing quantitative work than lab work so coming up with average hours for a grad student to work in general isnt that useful of a comparison. I also can\u2019t be quantitatively creative or write well for more time than that- my mental bandwidth is limited more than my ability to physically grind doing experiments. I have a real ebb and flow to what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019ve learned to take advantage of the easier times so I don\u2019t burn out. I also have a nice advisor who gets mad at me for being in the lab over the weekends (she sees it as a sign of poor time management or prioritization) and a departmental culture where everyone leaves at 5:00pm sharp everyday (they exist!). I don\u2019t know if this is helpful, but I hope it gives some perspective.",
