  "title:": "Is it normal for my advisor, in my first semester, to expect me to be submitting grant proposals/fellowships?",
  "text": "I know both of these things are expected parts of academia, but I\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed having to submit to fellowships that require 2-3 essays (personal statement that relates to promoting diversity, statement of past research, and statement of planned research goals) with 3-5 letters of rec, etc. in addition to my coursework, GA duties, and research. I am a first semester student who moved across the country (first time in my life away from home) and it just feels like a lot with just beginning my courses and settling into a totally new life in what feels like a strange place. Is this an indication that I may not be able to handle a PhD, or is my advisor just a bit overexcited about providing me with as many opportunities as possible? For context, I am fully funded right now but will likely need funds once I start my first project.\n\nEdit to add: I messed up the deadline to one that I started way too late and am feeling really awful about having to tell her I won\u2019t have materials ready in time. I\u2019m feeling really stressed about this but I was told about the scholarship in early November when things were just starting to get crazy with final papers/exams/etc. I have no idea if this means I f\u2019ed up big time or my advisor is just being overly ambitious with me.",

I have many more years to fund my research since I\u2019m doctoral track and am expected to take all of my core/required classes my first year and then I have to pass quals before I really sink my teeth into research. I guess I\u2019m just struggling to find a balance. I really don\u2019t like working all day, coming home at 7pm, and then having to sit down and write/fill out apps. I\u2019m older and definitely past the age where I can just stay up all night and go to work in the morning like it\u2019s fine\u2026 I\u2019m so afraid of burn out.",

But I imagine it's gonna be pretty hell for a couple weeks coming up. But I'm hoping that once I write a few grants I'll be able to just edit them to match other grants and it'll be less work.",

              "text": "Unfortunately you may just need to find a way to work more efficiently if possible. When I was a first year it was pretty much the same. Taking coursework, active research (though kind of prelim), TA for a lab course, and lots of grants fellowship applications.\n\nBut once I got a training grant I applied for, at least I was good for 2 years and didn't have to teach anymore. So it is an investment of time early on which hopefully pays off.",
