  "text": "It's 2:00 am and I'm correcting a late assignment and this kid just really got under my skin. So I'm here to rant.\n\nI TA for a language class, and host discussion sessions for them to use and practice their oral skills, most of my students never miss one, but the kid never bothers to show up and literally asked me to make all the content up in ONE 15-minute session, or more like give her the credits associate with them. She also asked me to meet her to give her make-up quizzes at the hour of her choice when she knew it's not my work time. All these absurd wishes were granted because the professor told me that she is trying her best while fighting her mental health issues ( she doesn't know I have it too).\n\nAnd today, she literally sent a google translated speech draft to me and hoping that I'll edit it for her, so she can present the final product in a video to impress the professor. I'm 90 minutes into correcting it and still have two fat paragraphs to go. Her video is due by the end of today, so I have to edit it for her like NOW. She sent it about two hours ago. Seriously? She is two weeks past due for this draft writing assignment and expecting me to fix her draft overnight?\n\nI hate when students use their mental health issues as excuses. I suffer from the same condition and I was never late for any assignments. As TA,  I've also seen students contacting me asking for permission for late work or at least apologize for submitting late work. All these are fine with me and I don't even take out late assignment points because I know how hectic studying online can be. But this student did none of these, just kept demanding me because she is not supposed to be pressured. I had to get up before 5:30 am on Friday for her make-up quizzes because she needs to spend evenings with family (her boyfriend). So frustrated at this moment.\n\nAnyway, rant over! Thank you good people on Reddit! Have a good night:)\n\n\\-----------------I'm not sure if this is how to do it, but beblow are some updates-----------------\n\nThank you all for your comments! I learned a lot from your experience, suggestions, and criticisms. I appreciate them all! I've talked with my professor and she told me to cut her some slack because she is graduating and has a nice job lined up. Well, the final exam is next week, so I guess this is it. I'm also leaving this school for Ph.D. studies elsewhere, so I don't what to put much energy into this anymore. But I learned my lessons and I'll do better with my boundary issues when I TA at my new school!\n\nAbout doing student's work: The draft she handed in is indeed an assignment, I have to edit drafts for all students (grammar mistakes and beyond), that's what the professor assigned me to do. But the professor only sees the final video, so no matter how bad their \"first drafts\" are, the prof will not know.\n\nAbout comment on mental health issues used as excuses: mental health issues are real, many people struggle to survive, myself included, but that's exactly why I don't like people to use them as excuses. We live with these issues, we fight these issues, we do our best not to let them affect our study and work. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes we fail. But when people \"under stress\" start to use this as an excuse, what happens is these people gain special accommodations, and honest people with actual issues suffer the loss. They bring bad names to \"mental health issues\" and now some will just see them as an excuse.\n\nThank you all again, good people on Reddit. You are the best!!!\n\n\\---------------------------------update-------------------------------\n\nShe didn't show up to the 5:30 am appointment and emailed me around 5:40 to ask my availability for the rest of the daytime, I'm done with it.",

Mental illness is not consistent and some people struggle more with certain things, or maybe she is simply having a really tough time at the moment. I think it\u2019s fair that she cares about her grades, she just doesn\u2019t know how to be professional about it and help herself. I would let her know I can\u2019t give detailed editing, but I will read it and give general comments on how she can improve. Offer her an extension maybe, but don\u2019t do the work for her. I feel bad for both of you, it\u2019s not an easy situation to be in. Hope you can take some time off later on to recover!",

      "text": "You need to set boundaries.\n\n1. You tell her you understand she's going through some difficulties, but realistically to be fair, you cannot give her the same credit for one, 15-minute session as entire discussion sections.\n2. She does not get to choose when to take her make-up quizzes. It's your office hours or nothing. If her mental health issues are so severe that she cannot commit to the small time slot required to take a quiz, then frankly she should be registered with your school's disability program and be making accommodations ahead of time, not on-the-fly requests at your expense.\n3. I'm confused why you are editing her speech draft. Is your professor pressuring you to do that? Is that part of your role, to do their work for them or edit every draft before final submission? It's unrealistic for anyone to expect you to be spending 90 minutes on every student who has a problem. You give a few general corrections, and when it's clear it's low effort on her part, you simply send it back and say there are several similar mistakes, go back and review it based on what we've already learned in class, with the few corrections you gave as guidelines.\n4. I appreciate that mental health has become somewhat more normal to talk about. But one of the huge downsides is normal people thinking they're experts in it, or straight-up abusing it, or intentionally or unintentionally exaggerating their own problems by labeling something they're not.  If she's able to commit to time with her boyfriend, she's able to commit to time for this class. She is literally telling you she is capable of committing time to someone else but not you. Spending time with your boyfriend is good self-care, but self-care is also getting your shit together in life. She is telling you she is mentally capable of taking a quiz only at certain times. It doesn't make any sense, unless she has something like anxiety so bad that she cannot leave her home reliably (like legitimate agoraphobia), which again, she should be registered for disability so a plan can be put in place.\n5. I have struggled with mental health issues my entire life. I do want to point out, that just because you've struggled with mental health issues and never had an issue with late assignments, doesn't mean other people with mental health issues should not. Severity levels differ, ability to cope differs. However, it does sound like this student is abusing \"mental health\" to gain immunity and act totally devoid of any responsibility.\n6. You should talk with your professor, the extent of the troubles this student is giving you. I appreciate your professor having empathy, but too much lenience is honestly doing the student more harm than good. It allows her to develop coping mechanisms based on taking advantage of others, rather than confronting her responsibilities herself. I discussed accommodations with my professors ahead of time. They gave me some buffer on certain assignments, gave me some credit back for missed classes, saw that I was trying hard when I was able to try, but ultimately I was still docked some points, and I thought that was totally fair.  It sounds like your professor is wanting to smother her with hands-off empathy and let her off scot-free. Or maybe your professor knows something you don't; either way, if your professor is willing to be so kind to this student, s/he should be willing to be kind to you too.",

All my students have access to this piece of information as it is announced clearly on their syllabus, online, and in my emails to them. So its up to them to utilize that info wisely or not.\n\nUndergrads are often super young and immature (and yes, entitled). You're not going to be able to control that.

Complying with every demand that comes your way and then getting upset about it does nothing for you or anyone else.\n\nFrankly, the same goes for your professor.

But of course that\u2019s just a fallacy. Just because it is similar doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same. (Even for one person it can vary a lot... the only semester I struggled with deadlines was not the one where I was in the worst health, but it still very much a problem caused by a health issue). I don\u2019t want to be a person who loses empathy just because of my experiences and I don\u2019t think you want to either.\n\nThat being said...

HOWEVER, she also constantly blasted on social media that she was doing lil get away trips or watching ru paul or whatever show.
