  "title:": "Has anyone switched from 1 PhD program to another in a completely unrelated field?",
  "text": "I\u2019m considering dropping out of my mechanical engineering PhD program to , later in life, do a PhD in neuroscience.  I\u2019d do both but I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s dumb, so picking the topic I\u2019m actually interested in/been interested in since I was young.\n\nI started a PhD in mechanical engineering only because I wanted to do grad school/research/fellowships. I have zero interest in working in the mechanical engineering field after grad school. Luckily, my research is mostly machine learning- which I do enjoy. However, I\u2019ve always thought if I could study one thing in life for fun it\u2019d be neuroscience (that was my 2nd choice for my undergrad but I chose ME 1st bc back then I felt an urgency to get a job right out of grad school for some reason \u2026but then the years passed and I stopped caring about that). \n\nAnyway, I always think that at one point in my life I\u2019ll study neuroscience (masters or PhD) and now that I think about it, it\u2019s silly that I\u2019m continuing this ME PhD (even tho i enjoy my advisor and research). \n\nBut I feel stuck. I\u2019m 1.5 years in, already published a paper. Good advisor, good research, I enjoy machine learning.\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking- should I just continue this PhD, drop out and get a machine learning job for a few years and then do neuroscience masters or PhD?\n\nI just feel very stuck and would love to hear if anyone else was in a similar position once.",

      "text": "What are your career goals if you successfully pivot to neuroscience?\n\nFor PhD and beyond, people care about your experience, not the label on your degree. So, are you able to pivot to more neuroscience-related projects in your current position? For example, while sticking with ML, you could explore methods development for neuroimaging interpretation. This could set you up to start working in, say, computational neuroscience for good.",

      "text": "i think if you enjoy your PhD it would be a waste to switch tbh, given that there are no guarantees on how the new program will go (not to mention having to start from scratch with a master's) and i'd say in terms of career opportunities engineering seems a much better deal (i'm in neuroscience and uhh it's not great lol).\n\nyou can try mentioning this to your advisor, it's possible that they might know someone who does neuroscience-related work and you can collaborate (half of my computational neuroscience lab is engineers/CS people anyway) or you can just gain a lot of ML skills and do a post-doc in neuroscience. it would maybe be harder to pivot if your passion is something like molecular neuroscience, but a lot of fields use ML methods now.\n\nin the meantime, if you want to start indulging in your passion, Kandel's \"principles of neural science\" is a classic textbook as well as Dayan and Abbott's \"theoretical neuroscience\" if you want to get into the math-y stuff. i don't know how much of a life sciences background you have, but it would never hurt to read up on biology basics (molecular/cellular biology, human biology/anatomy) and refresh physics (E&M is especially important). good luck in any case :)",
