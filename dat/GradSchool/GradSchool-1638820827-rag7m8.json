  "text": "So my brother went to the Carnegie Mellon ETC and he really enjoyed it and, through him, I got to see the kinds of work they did with interactive technology and its applications in games, theme parks, education, etc. I really appreciate that it's not a \"game development\" program, but something broader in scope and application. I could see myself really loving a career in that field.   \n\n\nProblem is it's super expensive. All in all it's like $80,000/year, and...yeah, I can't. **Are there other** ***similar*** **types of programs that maybe aren't quite so pricey?**",
