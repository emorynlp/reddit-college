      "text": "I know you\u2019re just venting and didn\u2019t actually want an answer, but I never actually get to talk about things like this outside of school. \n\nAs someone who studies nonprofits (American ones specifically, so some of this might not apply to foreign/international organizations),this is a bit like asking why public universities still charge tuition. The short answer is because they can, and also they kind of need to. Fees for services are a relatively small but still significant part of any NPO/NGO\u2019s funding. They\u2019re subject to the same market conditions as anyone else, and their mission \u201cto advance knowledge\u201d only compels them to do the research, not to give it away. This is a big difference between the specific term \u201ccharity\u201d and the more general \u201cnonprofit.\u201d If we on Reddit wanted to create an organization that raised money to purchase the reports and distribute them for free, that would be a different story, while still probably falling under the 501(c)(3) categories of \u201cadvancement of science,\u201d \u201cadvancement of education,\u201d and maybe even \u201calleviation of poverty\u201d among others depending on how we used that data. \n\nAnother thing to remember is that, just like in academia, government grants are among the most restrictive forms of funding available to nonprofits in terms of how that money can be used. It might cover the costs of studies, and even part of the salary for the people creating them, but they rarely deal in unrestricted, flexible assets. They have to pay administrators and buy office supplies too. ",
