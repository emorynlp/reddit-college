  "text": "Hi reddit. I'm pursuing a PhD in Chemistry and am currently in my first semester. So, I learned today that my research group advisor doesn't pay a stipend to any of his students. I made the mistake of not asking outright before I joined the group. I'm on a fellowship for the first year that pays be 10k a semester plus tuition. As far as I know (I'm thinking I should double check now), the tuition coverage will continue throughout my education, but the stipend will not. My option for future income is being a TA which will pay 7k a semester before taxes. \n\nMy issue is this, I'm engaged and both me and my fiance are going to school. She, however, is paying for school and not getting any income. I'm still living with my parents, but I very much want to move in with her at maximum a year and a half from now so we can get married. This revelation makes that seem impossible so long as I'm in school. \n\nI haven't brought this up to my advisor yet, and I'm thinking I shouldn't until I'm more sure what my thoughts are on it. Has anyone been through this? If so, what did you do? \n\nTLDR: I feel as if I'm being asked to choose between a life I want and continuing school because of financial stuff.",

      "text": "I am not sure you can do anything about the stipend except try to apply for fellowships that may increase your income. If it\u2019s available, you could also look for graduate assistantships at your university that pay more than the TA. If your advisor doesn\u2019t do RA\u2019s, they maybe cannot afford it or would give you the same stipend anyways. In my experience, professors don\u2019t pay more than they have to because supply (grad students) is high enough they can find someone to take the TA and lower stipend. \n\nWhen will your fianc\u00e9 graduate from her program? Will she be getting a job afterwards? Once she has an income, you might be able to make it work. I realize that may take a little longer than you would like, but you wouldn\u2019t have to wait until you graduate in 5 years (assuming she gets a job before then).\n\nAt my university, it\u2019s also incredibly easy for graduate students to obtain loans for 20k/year. As a personal finance nerd, I REALLY DON\u2019T RECOMMEND THIS OPTION.  The interest is high and it starts accruing immediately. If you go this route, only take out enough to cover the necessities (maybe up to the 3k/semester to get you to 10k total).",

They will be pissed if they find out that your advisor gets grants and doesn't pay his students.\n\nI am absolutely not joking, but this can lead to jail time for your advisor.\n\nOr the bottom line is that he has no money, and his students TA every semester.

In addition, students on TA or RA make the same amount, the difference is RA is paid from a grant your PI has and TA is paid from the department to teach. This sounds crazy....",
