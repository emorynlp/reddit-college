  "title:": "Have you unloaded your frustrations on a professor? How did it go?",
  "text": "I got some pretty bad feedback on the first few pages of my seminar paper rough draft. I knew that I had problems with an incoherent argument, but my professor called my work a mess, very rough, and nearly hopeless. \n\nHe knows I\u2019ve changed my paper argument a few times already that he requested me to do, and each time he changes his mind about what he told me before. First he told me not to make an institutional argument and focus on one specific book, then he told me to make an institutional argument and use the book as proof of the problem, and now he\u2019s telling me not to make an institutional statement again BUT THATS WHAT HE WANTS FOR THE PAPER. His class has been a mess, two students have had panic attacks over his class and paper, and other students with a few years of grad experience basically think he\u2019s a major ass. It\u2019s worth saying we didn\u2019t know anything about a paper until week 7 and he changed his expectations twice on us, then forced a bogus workshop week 10 that didn\u2019t help. \n\nWhen I submitted the draft, I wrote that I knew my grammar was wanting (I write my ideas down and then revise for mechanics at the end) and he nitpicked on the damn grammar anyways. He had 0 good things to say about my draft. \n\nEither way, the whiplash I\u2019m getting has been crazy so I unloaded my frustrations in an email to him and told him I don\u2019t know what to write and every argument I make makes me feel stupid and honestly is stupid because I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t write for crap. I requested a meeting with him and an extension so we will see where it goes. \n\nDo you think this was stupid on my part? Should I have just sucked it up? It\u2019s my first semester ever as a PhD student with no MA and his class has been so bad for everyone even other professors heard about it because the students kept complaining about him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s malicious at all. But in a moment of panic while being drowned in imposter syndrome I sent the email about my mental state. \n\nI don\u2019t regret doing it. I don\u2019t believe in the nonsense that grad students can\u2019t tell their professors their concerns. Have you guys ever done this and regretted it though? Or did it make things better?",

Honestly I\u2019m at the point of making the changes he asked of me and then going based on what my peer mentor said: a good paper is a turned in paper. Since it\u2019s only my first quarter, I\u2019m willing to turn in crap papers and then next quarter use them to learn my own behaviors and writing skills to do better.",

              "text": "I feel your pain.\nIf it helps, I recently had drinks with a couple of girlfriends who are also grad students. One of them has a professor just like you describe. She had us in stitches reading out their email exchanges and comments he had made in her documents. It was absolutely crazy.\nThen he walks around campus with his nose in the clouds, like he personally invented science. So. Arrogant.\nI wish he knew that  3 - dare I say it - intelligent, high achieving students who are also grown women who are all successful in their professional careers LAUGH at him and find him an utter bloody moron. Omg I wish he knew.",
