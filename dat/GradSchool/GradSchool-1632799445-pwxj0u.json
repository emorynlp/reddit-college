      "text": "I can\u2019t stress enough how much music can help with focus. You can find premade playlists on Spotify and YouTube specifically for studying. I started with those and now I have my own classical playlist for homework. I also find making my work feel like self-care keeps me motivated to keep going. i.e I treat myself to my favorite fountain drink before buckling down, light a fall candle and listen to Christmas music (no matter the time of year) and turn on my Christmas lights to set a calmer tone. \n\nI also notice I\u2019m less motivated to stay on track when I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I find breaking down the task into smaller steps helps me stay on track when I\u2019m down. I think it\u2019s easy to miss the steps you can take by focusing on distance you can\u2019t jump. \u201cAim small, miss small\u201d so to speak. If it\u2019s an annotated Ill focus on outlining which resources to acquire before actually searching them. Or if it\u2019s a paper if I say okay first I do the outline, then I write my thoughts, then I go in to find my references, then I go in to cite I\u2019m able to get things done better than writing the paper, finding the references, and citing them all at the same time.\n\nLastly, I echo a lot of the comments here and say that I work in chunks and reward myself for the time spent. So I\u2019ll work 45 minutes and give the last 15 to tik tok or YouTube and pick back up. Boredom / play is scientifically proven to aid in creativity and thus productivity (you can imagine resolutions to your roadblocks) so it\u2019s important to still allow that time.\n\nPsychology is your friend. Condition yourself with task and reward.",

      "text": "Positive reinforcement, proven to work by Pavlov! Every day, without fail, at 1 PM, I give myself an iced matcha. It gives me drive now, as if I\u2019m addictive. My brain feels like it won\u2019t function without it now. \n\nAlternatively, give yourself a 5-10 minute phone break every hour or so. Any type of reward will work. It\u2019s about expectations and receiving\u2014 your brain will work if it trusts you to give it what it always gets for doing things right. Like a puppy.\n\nSometimes you have bad days where you just can\u2019t focus. Don\u2019t force it. Take a nap or watch a show. Then try again\n\nSomething that seems silly and elementary but actually works\u2014 phone out of sight and on silent. Or else I find an excuse to check it, or check it on autopilot, and hate myself :)",

Not sure why but it just works better for me) so now, I take it pretty easy during the daytime - that\u2019s when I do my TA work and go to classes, and with my break time I\u2019ll usually do easy stuff that doesn\u2019t necessitate a ton of focus like digitizing and summarizing my notes, or like browsing for sources for my research.  Then when I get home at night, that\u2019s when I do more intense stuff like readings. I guess that doesn\u2019t make it sound like I do have free time but I try to give myself at least one full day off each week and take like decently long meal breaks during normal days.",
