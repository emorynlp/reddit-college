  "text": "Hey everyone! \n\nCurrently I'm preparing my applications for gradschool (Physics PhD), in almost all school they ask for 3 letters of recomendation, I already have 2, for the third I'm in a dilemma. \n\nI have worked in a very recognized researcher's  laboratory but I didn't made any research, just some programming  stuff and I don't know if he can give me a strong LOR. On the other side, I'm  working with a Phd Student very closely and I'm sure she can give me a strong LOR but she isn't recognized. \n\nSo there's my dilemma, Strong LOR by a not recognized researcher or an average LOR by a recognized reseacher?",
