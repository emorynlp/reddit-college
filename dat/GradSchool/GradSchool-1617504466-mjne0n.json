  "title:": "Does anyone else experience days where they just can\u2019t do anything school related?",
  "text": "Sometimes I get in these moods where I can\u2019t do any work for 2-3 days at a time. I won\u2019t even crack open a book, watch a lecture, or write a single line of code. It takes all the energy in the world for me to even respond to emails. I\u2019m not always like this, I love programming. I love problem solving, algorithms...all of it. I even love going down a rabbit hole of stackoverflow searches trying to configure my environment for hours before I even start development. I seriously fucking love it. I literally get excited thinking about projects I\u2019m working on.\n\n....but every once in a while I get in these moods where I can\u2019t get in the right headspace to work on my projects. I\u2019ll have so much anxiety, yet I keep procrastinating. I\u2019ll go for walks, watch Netflix, work out, do my hair and makeup, literally ANYTHING. I keep telling myself \u201cI\u2019ll\nDo it this afternoon\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll get to it this evening\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll work late\u201d, \u201cmight as well start tomorrow\u201d.....\n\nIs this just a grad school thing? Or will I be like this at work? Sometimes the imposter syndrome is strong, and I feel like if I keep getting into these moods I\u2019ll get fired. It usually happens after a big development effort is completed, right before I start the next project. Around every 2 weeks or so I\u2019ll have a couple days of a lull. I just can\u2019t be bothered. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m a bad programmer because of this \ud83d\ude1e\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank everyone for giving me the strength to get back to my studies. Reading all your comments motivated me to have a productive day today, and I hope to have a productive week as well. Thanks!",

      "text": "Research (and knowledge work in general) is strange because you can exert a tremendous amount of effort without realizing it. ESPECIALLY, during a pandemic when many normal activities are no longer common. It's normal to take time off, especially after a crunch such as a project deadline. In our research lab, it is common to spend the post-deadline week doing non-research work such as learning a new skill.\n\nEveryone experiences different things when they become tired/anxious/overwhelmed. Learning what this looks like and figuring out the next step is as much a part of grad school as it is a part of discovering how to sustainably do high quality work. For myself, a telltale sign for exhaustion was leaving the key in my apartment door when I went home for the day. \n\nYou're probably going to crush it as a programmer or researcher for many years to come - in part because you're a smart and passionate individual. It's a worthwhile endeavor to figure out what the maintenance schedule looks like and what strategies work to make you feel better, both while doing work and otherwise.",

So I just had to realize that none of my future supervisors or coworkers, and most importantly none of my future clients are going to give a fuck about what grade I got on this big essay, or how I did on this one quiz, or even my GPA at the end of grad school, as long as I pass. School is just a means to an end so I can help people. Helping people is the goal, not being perfect at school. It was hard to make that mental shift, but it kind of changed everything.",

      "text": "First of all, you are not a bad programmer because of this! Things are especially difficult right now and it\u2019s very hard to keep ourselves in prime condition all the time even when conditions are normal. I get the same anxiety about my work, especially starting it. I also know that I\u2019m extremely prone to being distracted and following whatever thought comes into my mind whenever I\u2019m trying to work. I\u2019ve recently started seeing a therapist about this and have come up with a few things that help me. \n\nThe first is a strict imposed schedule that I make using my planner (I use Panda Planner and I think it\u2019s great for someone like me). Without this I really have little direction during the day. The second is having a set of things I complete every day (I use Habitica to help with this). Mine includes things like shaving, meeting some minimal level of physical activity, mindfulness meditation, and working on research or coursework. This helps me with adding structure to my day as well.\n\nThe last one is the most important to me I think. When I sit down to work, I try extremely hard to eliminate distractions and agree to work for a specific length of time (e.g, 30 mins.) I use the Forest app to remove the temptation of using my phone, and I try to maintain a clean desk. Or during class I will leave my phone in a place I cannot reach it. Honestly I was shocked how often I found myself reaching for my phone, remembering it was somewhere else _for a reason_ and hopefully pulling myself back to the class. \n\nNothing is perfect, I still struggle with organization and focus, but I\u2019m still working on it and these things have helped _me_ to make some improvements over the past few months. I hope you can find some things which will help you too! Remember even a tiny improvement is an improvement, and they add up over time! Remember also that you are not alone!",

Looks like if you don't want to do something, you physically can't make yourself do it, and you ignore that you're lying to yourself when you say you'll do it later.\n\nStrangely it's come back for me this semester, exactly as you describe it. I want to attribute a bit to covid-19, but I didn't have that issue last semester so I'm not sure why. \nI think for me it might be my classes aren't as interesting as last semester too, and one that's also too difficult (which often makes me delay assignments for that specific class). I really don't have the slightest idea otherwise.\n\nAnyways, I'd say do some introspection of why you're acting this way, even though you're in grad school and likely want (?) to be there for your goals.

While it's possible, there are a few reasons why work can be different based on my experience working during grad school and having these difficult times when doing schoolwork:\n\n- academic work can be really isolating, whereas I've found most workplaces are collaborative and you're allowed to work on things together/get people to help you\n\n- the academic tasks we work on are very long-term and not easily broken down into pieces, whereas I've found that even knowledge work in industry is shorter and quicker\n\n- we usually feel like our research has to be at a 100% level before showing anyone, while this is not compatible with most workplaces. This is actually a criticism of PhD folks in industry, if they can't let go of needing things to be perfect. In my work experiences, making a rough sketch or sharing a first draft is the goal, so there's less time sitting there trying to make the first version perfect\n\n- if you are writing, it's usually gonna be a lot shorter than what we're trying to write! And if it's a very long document, it's probably a collaborative effort (see above).\n\nBurnout and attention issues could be the issue here. But these demotivating moments can happen to anyone in any situation, even without burnout, and is also a product of the way our work is designed. I don't have either of those diagnoses/situations and I still get this.",

      "text": "Sounds like burnout (and possibly ADHD, as some people have mentioned). Many of my classmates and I felt this way when we were going through our program. Anecdotally, most people find it easier to balance work/life in industry, where you have greater external enforcement of working hours; without that structure in grad school, you subconsciously know you could always be studying or working on something and are thus more likely to burn out.\nIn the meantime, I have found that the following combination of preventative measures make it less likely for me to go down anxiety spirals or burn out after big projects/exams: \n\n * (1) **Exercising** (esp. cardio) for 30 min in the morning: I highly encourage cardio since it forces \nyou to take a break from worrying about things other than the need to keep moving until the end of the workout. The endorphin boost will also give you the energy to finish your administrative tasks and think more clearly.\n * (2) **Pomodoro** (25 min work, 5 min rest): Bonus if you can switch your tasks after 25 min. The key here is to ONLY do work for those 25 min, and ONLY rest for the 5. I'm often intimidated by the thought of having to work continuously for x number of hours, so establishing strict rest periods makes it easier to focus on the work.\n\nI've also found /r/getdisciplined helpful for productivity tips. From someone who has been there before, I hope you can find something that works for you!",

By realizing this and not feeling guilty about your stretches of rest you can actually relax and enjoy the breaks! The end result is that the breaks are more effective and you end up needing less/shorter breaks! Just my 2 cents.",
