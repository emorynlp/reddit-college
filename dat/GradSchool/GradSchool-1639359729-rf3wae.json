  "title:": "Considering of doing a PhD with an entry level casual job for work experience.",
  "text": "So I have finished honours in my bachelor degree (Australia) and have plans to do a PhD. But my experience in working for the environment sector is lacking and though it is tempting to apply for work the problem is many workplaces prefer to hire local applicants and rarely those who have working visas. As an international student, I\u2019ll have to apply for a working visa, get hired by an organisation where I can work for 2 to 5 years (depending on the location) and extend my working visa until I can accrue enough points to apply my permanent residency. I prefer to do my PhD and get my permanent residency eventually after completion. I\u2019m damn sure this would mean if I have to go through the academic hell hole (I have read most stories in this subreddit how doing a PhD is a hellish experience). \n\nI\u2019m aware that I can\u2019t break up my PhD to a part-time study as per the overseas students guidelines set by the Australian government. So I would like to ask those who finished their PhD full time with a part time job or a casual job, how was the experience? What did you learn out of it? Was it worth it? Would you recommend others to pursue their graduate studies (PhD) full time while being employed?",
