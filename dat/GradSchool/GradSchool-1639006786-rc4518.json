Why wouldn\u2019t they? You are free labor. As much as they may make you feel like your obligation is to be their work slave- it is not. And make it a point to not let them take advantage of you. \n\nYou have your time and work boundaries, they are healthy. You are productive WHILE having good work habits. If you allow your advisor to force you to working more, they will ask more and more of you until you have nothing left to give. \n\nSo man, leave lab at 5:00 or 4:00 or whatever. You\u2019re doing fine",

          "text": ">But your adviser will take advantage of you if you let them. Why wouldn\u2019t they? You are free labor.\n\nThat implies a certain intention that I don't think is correct.\n\nMany such supervisors likely experienced the same thing as grad students and as postdocs. And many professors bury themselves in their work for an equal number of hours a week in the pursuit of tenure and recognition in their discipline.\n\nSo it's less of a \"I'll just take advantage of students\" as free labor and more of a normalized behavior within academia which is believed to be part of the pursuit of knowledge and necessary for gaining recognition.\n\nHeck, I am in a discipline where we don't work in labs. And most of the successful grad students I know did the same thing to ourselves on our own of spending almost all of our waking hours in work.\n\nNote that I'm not interested in debating whether this is right or wrong. Just pointing out that such an oversimplification of grad students being \"free labor\" probably doesn't represent what's going on.  I think it also can setup a bad adversarial dynamic.",

I can run the participants in my sleep. The time I spend running my advisors participants takes away from time I could be spending working on my dissertation, writing papers or learning new skills. \n\nI don\u2019t get paid for running my advisors participants, I am only taking dissertation hours so every time I go in, it is on my dime. After you spend 30 hours a week just running participants you could see how you could feel a bit used.",

Their lab is crazy\" .You will lie, but you can say in this way that it is not normal for you and your attitude towards that. To succeed we need to work smart not hard :) Good luck!",
