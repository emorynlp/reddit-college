  "text": "Username checks out...\n\nFor some context, I used to think I was above average. Been super passionate about my research up until the end of my master's.\n\nThen the beginning of my PhD was a disaster for many reasons including COVID, and I felt stalled. Then I applied to and won a pretty big grant to study abroad, which I thought will give me a boost. Oh boy, how wrong I was.\n\nNow I'm here, feeling dumber than ever. I could describe many reasons why but I feel some of it has to do with me not vibing with the group, and some of it with academia culture in general. They work 10-12 a day 6 days a week (50-60 hours a week is expected and 9 to 5 is considered the extreme minimum that is advised to be avoided). I feel I can't communicate properly with anyone. I'm assigned tasks with I feel not enough guidance on how to complete, if I am assigned one at all because I'm expected to be asking for it. When I do ask I always feel I'm bothering them while busy. I also never felt so stupid with interpreting results. I used to never have issues with it, but now I feel whatever I say gets shut down as unrealistic or trivial, but then they act surprised I'm not eager to share more. For example, I was so excited to show that my results reinforced their older findings they had with different methods, only to be told \"yeah, we already know this\"... Like, if that's what it shows then that's what it shows, what else am I supposed to do?\n\nIt could be that I'm wrong. I always was a procrastinator and I'm also a very simple person who needs clearly outlined tasks given. Me having to outline my own tasks to complete had been sucking away a lot of my energy from the actual task. I keep being told that's the point of grad school, to make you more independent, but I don't yet feel capable of this. Will I ever be capable? \n\nIs this normal grad school culture in the US? Am I really unfit or am I in a wrong place?",

It is not entirely clear to me how long you have been in such an environment, and perhaps this is just a period of adaptation to new conditions, although honestly your schedule is rather complicated. Try to find the most communicative colleague and ask for help with your tasks. It will also relieve the psychological stress. I have a subreddit where you can ask a question or tell your story.
