      "text": "I\u2019m currently in an MS statistics program and my undergrad was not in math or stats. Look up the prerequisites for the schools you are applying to. You most likely can\u2019t take at least a few of them at CC since upper div courses are only taught at 4 years, at least as far as Ik. If you\u2019re lacking any lower div, like calculus or linear, you can take those at CC. The rest of the upper div courses you can look for (or equivalent courses) at your current school",

                      "text": "Ok. If you got good grades and you feel comfortable with taking integrals, derivatives, matrix multiplication and using series, I don\u2019t think I would retake those classes. I would double check with the schools you are applying to but I think what matters is that you have a bachelors and you took them at some point. Do u have any schools in mind (You don\u2019t have to answer that if you don\u2019t want to)? \n\nIf you have the option/requirement for a personal statement, I would take full advantage of that and up play any and all math and computer programming related experiences you have. If you\u2019ve had a job where you use any math/programming concepts, even just a little I would write about that and use those experiences as to why you want to purse statistics. I hope this helps",
