  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m in my third year studying Kinesiology and Health science. I was interested in becoming a physiotherapist but quite a few of my compsci friends peaked my interest in regards to the tech field. I want to explore my options now since the tech seems a lot more lucrative then any health care job I can think of pursuing. \n\nWhat are some health-tech jobs that I can possibly transition to or take a master\u2019s program in so I can make some good money in the future",

So there's been a transformation in our society where there's a stronger recognized need for physical therapy, it's getting prescribed more by GPs, and it's getting paid for.\n\nPlus over the next 10 to 20 years, you're going to see a dramatic increase in physical therapy needs related to poor posture from bending over looking at laptops and phones for tens of hours a week for decades.\n\nSo I don't want to discourage you from looking at tech and healthcare if you're really interested in that. But I wouldn't assume that you're going to make more money at it, as opposed to if you're a very good physical therapist.\n\nAnd if you haven't learned about it yet, I would look into needling. My physical therapist has used it on me and it's a fantastic treatment method that can provide results faster for some problems.",
