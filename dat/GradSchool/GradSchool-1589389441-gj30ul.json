  "title:": "Note for PhD job hunters: Cheeky Scientist is a borderline fraudulent career coaching service",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a member of an organization called the Cheeky Scientist Association (CSA). I want to report out my story of feeling disrespected and misled by this group's job hunt assistance program. I feel they\u00a0prey on scared PhD holders who are worried about their job outlook, then do not deliver on services promised.\u00a0\n\nI would highly encourage Master's or PhD level job seekers to stay away from this organization.\n\nThe CSA program advertises career advice for PhD holders interested in transitioning into industry careers. They claim that all PhD holders are \"highly in demand\".\u00a0I have been with the group for several months and paid over $400 for an initial membership.\n\nThe following is a list of inappropriate and borderline fraudulent behavior I experienced during my time with this organization.\n\n1. CSA offered me a \"pay only once\" lifetime membership. Once enrolled in the main program, I was told that numerous specialized modules on offer are \"pay to access\", at a price tag of several hundred\u00a0dollars per module.\n2. CSA repeatedly and consistently claims that all PhD skills are \"highly in demand\". They claim\u00a0that companies are eagerly looking to hire candidates such as yourself. I believe this claim to be objectively false. I do believe there is a small, select subset of in-demand skills that are desired in industry. This is a vastly different reality than CSA's claim that employers are rushing to hire any and all PhD holders.\n3. CSA consistently promotes a narrative that if you're not getting hired, it's your own fault for not trying hard enough. That message is emotionally abusive. It pushes all accountability\u00a0away from CSA and onto\u00a0the paying\u00a0client. They consistently blame you, the client, for any job hunt failures you are experiencing.\n4. When I began raising questions about the program's methodology, I was passive aggressively threatened. My most recent post to the group's private Facebook page was a note expressing that a \"think positive\" mentality didn't work for me personally. That post was deleted in less than three hours and my account was immediately suspended. I was told the reason for the suspension was unrelated to the post I've referenced here.\n\nI feel motivated to report my story to a larger audience because I am not alone in my criticism.\n\nDozens of clients have reported they feel uncomfortable with how the Cheeky Scientist program is managed. My fellow clients have questioned why the claims of the program don't match the lived experience of their job hunts. These clients payed $400 or more, often while working low-wage jobs and paying off student debt, for this fraudulent\u00a0service.\u00a0\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to read this message. If you find yourself concerned by this report, please forward this note to any PhD email lists you have access to.\n\nIf anyone has questions about my experiences, I will do my best to respond to comments.",

      "text": "I just joined CSA a couple weeks ago and while I've found some of their content interesting and useful, I'm generally quite dissatisfied.\n\nI had joined a free webinar and they offered a special discounted price for attendees ($300 off of $650) so I paid $350. I was already not going to pay if it was full price. They made it sound like a lot more was offered with this payment than there actually is (there are ELEVEN additional add-on courses/programs e.g. project management, data science, each costing around $650). They do offer discounts to those for related webinars (wow! what an amazing deal!) but that's still a lot of money to spend.\n\nI too am irked by their narrative that almost seems fear-mongering that says it's your fault if you can't get a job. ALL the webinars end with the head guy preaching this.\n\nThey also send way too many emails. Like WAY too many, several per day. They also send emails like 'this is a personal welcome' and it is no way personal, it's a cookie cutter email. And since their forum for communication with other members is on facebook, you get a ton of notifications there and DMs from them on webinars.\n\nOverall, I feel like I have gained some from joining and am sure glad I haven't spent more, but could have gone elsewhere for much less or even free.",

          "text": "Really appreciate the well-reasoned, neutral insight.  \n\n\nYour last line is a lot of what prompted me to speak out. It's not the material is wholly bad. It's just a lot of fluff, intense and predatory marketing, and a cult-like \"do it our way or else\".  \n\n\nI wish a career service or professional organization (Nature magazine for example) would run something like this. Moderating a Facebook group  well is a bit of weekly commitment but not all that much. A centralized source for well written information would be nice.  \n\n\nHonestly, it really comes down to this. If you want to pivot...  \n\n\n1) Learn, from the inside, about the field. Call people, ask around. Be honest that this is likely a favor, be polite. Don't feel pressure to \"add value\" if you have none. A willing listener is value - nice people like talking about what they do and helping others. Never ask directly for a job. That's networking.  \n\n\n2) If you have an inside lead, cover letters and resumes aren't that important. Get a decent template, if tuo have a PhD you can figure out the rest  \n\n\n3) Interview skills. Interviews are about two things\n\nA - What are the required tasks and show you're demonstrated ability to perform those tasks, or that you can quickly learn them.  \n\n\nB - Do you seem like you'd fit in well? Similar vibe. Are you generally, within reason, \"likeable\". Be honest on both sides, sometimes vibe is off. If you're desperate and need any job maybe you sign up anyway.  \n\n\n4) The Transferable Skills Pitch  \n\n\nThis takes a bit of practice. Basically, show why you can still complete a task without direct experience. Have respect for showing you've learned a bit about the industry. For example, in business analytics \"KPI's\" and the equivalent of scientific indicator variables. Speak THEIR language, show why you can learn quickly.  \n\n\nAnd know this - the experienced candidate almost always wins out of the transferable skills candidate. Here's the reason - even if you seem smarter and more generally life capable, you're a risk if there isn't demonstrated experience. Risks are less defensible. They get people fired if it goes poorly enough. Direct experience is defensible. \"Hey, it says here they've done this before, we couldn't know they're actually this bad at it\"  \n\n\nAnd that's about 90% of the career pivot job hunt plan. Easy. Post that somewhere, create a Facebook group, invite industry guest speakers in who actually know a thing or two, and that's the a CSA model that can be run for probably $750 / month or less.",

I joined their conference, their Twitter, looked at stuff on their website, joined their Linkedin when it was temporarily free.. they claim to help PhDs find jobs outside academic settings.. so I expected solid advice is how to target non academic jobs.. all they said is that you should request \"informational interviews\".. network with people and ask everyone you meet about their job and email randos on Linkedin demanding an interview.. a few days ago they actually put out a tweet, and i kid you not, saying that networking and asking for informational interviews is not about using people, people are happy to help and pay it forward.. I paid to attend a two day virtual conference and I skipped day two because all they talked about is network, network, network. They expect you to go up to random strangers and ask them about their jobs and an \"informational interview\" where you market yourself to them. In a nutshell their only advice is you will get a job if you have connections and essentially cold nose random strangers expecting them to give you the time of day. Linkedin is known to be useless and that website makes no sense but they think spamming everyone there is your ticket to a job.",

We also offer advanced programs for those who would like specialized, in-depth training in a specific area (such as Project Management, Medical Affairs, Data Science/Analysis etc). You are in no way required to join any of our advanced programs once you are a CSA member.\n\nWe will help you until you get hired and far beyond - through onboarding, promotions, job changes, you name it! We offer further support and direction for members who are not getting hired within their desired timeline, and never blame or discourage them. You can hear this first-hand from PhDs who willingly put their names, faces, and professional reputations on the line to talk about their experiences in the program on our website or social media. Make sure you listen to both sides to make a logical decision.",

      "text": "Hi M.T., I wanted to respond personally here out of respect. The team and I won\u2019t use your first or last name here out of respect for your privacy. I\u2019ve asked any the Associates who end up commenting here to show you the same respect. However, it is important for everyone reading this to know that this thread is written by someone who was removed from the Association because they repeatedly violated our terms & conditions, as well as those of the platform by refusing to be kind and respectful to all members, by refusing to being inclusive, by attacking other members, and by posting political, racial, and/or abusive comments.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that it came to this because our goal at Cheeky Scientist is to leave no PhD behind. We really do wish you the best in your job search and career M.T.\n\nPlease note that negative comments are common online but positive comments are harder to come by because when people have a positive experience, they rarely feel the need to start a thread. Therefore, it is important for anyone considering a job in industry to listen to the other side of this story. You can do so by watching any of the following videos of PhDs who joined the Association and where subsequently hired by top companies like Amazon, Google, Intel, Pfizer and many, many others which you can see on our website's success stories page or our social media pages. These are all PhDs who you can find on LinkedIn and contact. There are thousands of of such PhDs.\n\nFor all the issues raised in the many replies here, the Association is definitely NOT for everyone. The Association and all Cheeky Scientist Advanced Programs are only focused on one thing - getting PhDs hired into top industry careers. As such, our private groups are not places for people to attack others, criticize others, or post wild comments completely unrelated to job searching, let alone racially charged comments. Instead, the Cheeky Scientist communities are a refuge from this - one where the culture is inclusive, solution focused and again, job search focused.\n\nAs to the point raised by the author of this subreddit, M.T., please see below:\n\n1 \u201cCSA offered me a \u2018pay only once\" lifetime membership. Once enrolled in the main program, I was told that numerous specialized modules on offer are \"pay to access\u2019, at a price tag of several hundred dollars per module.\u201d\n\nThe Association membership is a lifetime membership. There are no monthly or yearly subscription fees and nothing more to pay for ever in terms of all Association content. \u201cModules\u201d are NEVER charged for as the author says above. In fact, all upgrades to the Association are free, including a large scale upgrade that just occurred, updating all training videos to HD videos with green screen and light board technology, and doubling the total hours of training material. Of course, like every company, we have multiple products based on demand. Our products are programs. Over time, demand for new programs such as a program specifically for Data Scientists, or for International PhDs, or for Medical Science Liaison careers have been developed. Memberships to any of these programs are also lifetime memberships. Each program has separate Program Leaders (all PhDs working in a specific career track, or in some cases a JD or MD or other expert, a separate Board, a separate website, separate training dashboard, separate private group, etc. Importantly, none of these additional Programs are required for Associates. They are all voluntary.\n\n2 \u201cCSA repeatedly and consistently claims that all PhD skills are \u2018highly in demand\u2019. They claim that companies are eagerly looking to hire candidates such as yourself. I believe this claim to be objectively false. I do believe there is a small, select subset of in-demand skills that are desired in industry. This is a vastly different reality than CSA's claim that employers are rushing to hire any and all PhD holders.\u201d\n\nThis statement is one of the reasons the author became increasingly angry in the group and started attacking other members. The author was having a difficult time getting hired, which I deeply empathize with. However, just because it takes some longer to get hired than others, it is not an excuse to abuse people. If the author would have focused on following the program\u2019s training materials and job referral process, they would have been hired. Instead, like many of us PhDs have a tendency to do, they focused intensely on the rejection they were facing in the job market and how the job market was \u201cnot fair\u201d. Sadly, the job market, nor life in general is often fair. But again, that is no excuse to take it out on others. PhDs are being hired in industry more than they have ever before in industry. Of course, there are more PhDs being produced than ever before. The landscape is changing though and more and more PhDs and Universities are realizing that most PhDs will end up in industry now, not academia.\n\n3 \u201cCSA consistently promotes a narrative that if you're not getting hired, it's your own fault for not trying hard enough. That message is emotionally abusive. It pushes all accountability away from CSA and onto the paying client. They consistently blame you, the client, for any job hunt failures you are experiencing.\u201d\n\nGetting hired is difficult, especially now that the world economy is in a recession. Again, the entire Cheeky Scientist team and I empathize with that. However, it is important, especially during difficult times, to focus on what you can control rather than what you can\u2019t control. This is why the culture of the Association and all Cheeky Scientist Advanced Programs are solution focused and job search focused. No individual is to blame for a rejection in their job search. They are responsible to how they respond to the rejection though - because no one else can control their actions. That person has to choose how they respond. They can respond by revamping their resume and LinkedIn profile, connecting with more people in industry, setting up more interviews etc \u2026or by being nasty to people and complaining. Encouraging PhDs to try again and helping them do so is not emotionally abusive; it\u2019s emotionally kind.\n\n4 \u201cWhen I began raising questions about the program's methodology, I was passive aggressively threatened. My most recent post to the group's private Facebook page was a note expressing that a \u2018think positive\u2019 mentality didn't work for me personally. That post was deleted in less than three hours and my account was immediately suspended. I was told the reason for the suspension was unrelated to the post I've referenced here.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad that the author brought this up but surely they know that they\u2019re coloring this with their perspective. The author became increasingly agitated and aggressive, and started attacking team members and other Associates, and posting wild comments completely unrelated to the job search process. They were being unkind to all, very negative and critical - repeatedly. Our administrators removed the author after they breaking our terms of service and the terms of the platform repeatedly and as such, we immediately responded to the author on multiple fronts and asked them to change their behavior. Instead of working with us, the author remained critical, negative, and aggressive. Many other Associates had complained to us about the author\u2019s behavior and our team member\u2019s repeatedly brought up concerns. We could no longer risk them distracting our other Associates from their job search or making them feel uncomfortable.\n\nWith all of this being said, we are still open to working with the author if they are willing to be kind, solution focused and job search focused in the program. These terms are NOT something Cheeky Scientist will ever compromise on. We will always ensure our communities and learning environments are safe, inclusive, solution focused and job search focused so PhDs can reach their career development goals, whatever they may be.",

Each module contains around 10 short videos (10 minutes on average) and about 2 real workbooks, which while informative, don't really go much in depth...they seem quite generic. Nothing that you could not find yourself online...\n\nAnother reason why I signed up is to make use of their member directory, since this could prove useful for job referrals, but the list itself is also very limited. There are about 125 entries, but most seem to be people looking for jobs themselves...\n\n\nThat said these are my initial impressions, I have not fully worked through these modules, and hopefully I am wrong. I'm not that optimistic though. I don't think it was worth the 400$, and I doubt I can get a refund.....\n\nWhile their sales-pitch/webinar (on data science) of theirs made use of boiler room tactics, it did provide lots of useful information and seemed to make sense, so I was willing to give it a chance despite recognizing all these red flags, like the \"limited\" discount offers.",

          "text": "I was reading that blogpost last night. The CS founder is extremely passive aggressive and unprofessional. If that's how the founder of the organisation responds normally to negative feedback or honest discussion, then that's red flag number one.\n\nI mentioned in another comment that previous Reddit threads discussing CS consistently have Reddit users with only one comment writing positive accounts about CS and nothing else. Here's [one thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/5xqeuy/anyone_have_experience_with_cheeky_scientist/), and [here's another.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3ggoqm/has_anyone_paid_for_the_cheeky_scientist/) While there are legitimate positive experiences from actual users in the comments, the fact CS clearly have accounts made to write positive testimonials across Reddit (and Blogspot) is red flag number two. \n\nAlso, the first question on their [FAQ](https://cheekyscientist.com/faq/) is \"IS THE CHEEKY SCIENTIST ASSOCIATION REAL, OR IS IT A SCAM?\" with their response being: \"We get this question a lot, which make sense for two reasons\" with one of those reasons simply being \"the results seem too good to be true.\" They obviously get asked this a lot...and don't really provide evidence that it isn't a scam apart from \"it's too good to be true\" and \"it sounds unbelievable to those stuck in academia.\" \nThey say \"the data doesn't lie\" and provide literally no data, just to look at video testimonials instead. Throughout the FAQ, a lot of the expectations are placed on the client rather than the organisation, such as \"You are an intelligent academic, which means that you know that no program will work unless you work\" and \"It\u2019s simple: the more you put into the Association, the more you\u2019ll get out of it.\" Red flag number three.  \n\nI have always thought CS operated under a rather predatory business model since I came across them on Twitter. Grad students face desperation on the job hunt, and CS knows this and how to exploit it. I'm glad OP and other users have been writing about their experiences. That doesn't mean people haven't had positive experiences with them, but their practice certainly rubs me the wrong way.",

          "text": "Glad my post helped.\n\nFWIW, most of the advice boils down to two main concepts:\n\n1) Networking\n\nThis is a buzz word, right? For new job seekers, the playbook is this - research careers of interest. Ask around. Look for interesting work, see who does it. Then write to those people and ask how they got where they are. Don't ask for a job, that's a bit presumptuous. If you are courteous, people in general like helping other people. Don't ever expect a reply back, you are asking for a favor here and that's not owed to you. But some people will help. Especially younger folk who themselves are just starting out.\n\n2) The Transferable Skills Pitch  \nIf you don't have direct experience, you are still likely qualified for all sorts of roles outside your direct field of study. The problem is, qualified isn't usually enough to get hired. Employer want proof that you can do the work, and a pivot skills candidate is riskier than one with direct experience. So, you can either play the odds and try to make the transferable skills pitch (I've gotten to several final round interviews this way). Or, you can train yourself independently if you really feel like it's a career of interest.\n\nThere. That's 85% of what CSA would teach you. Sure, there's some tidbits on cleaner resumes, interview skills, ect. But, end of the day, every person looking to hire an individual wants to see two things:\n\n1) Proof that they you can perform the skills of the position, or can learn those skills rapidly and effectively\n\n2) Are you likable. Do you seem to fit the social culture of the current team (within reason).",

What I do want to point out - it's a *lot* to ask of a person to build a network from scratch. It's super hard. You get rejected a lot. And for many of us there's no training.\n\nIt's just short of unfair in my mind. For me, my grad school was just about worthless for explaining how to do these things. I don't think academia should be a job factory. But, conversely, you get sent out into the world not knowing and not fully equipped to deal with that world.\n\nMy take is that schools, society, and employers *should* be a little more accountable for helping job seekers. I'm not saying 100% accountable. Self-reliance is an important skill.\n\nMy take is that it's patently unfair to put people through this. You can't fully control building a network - you're relying on the good faith of others to help, which they are under no obligation to provide.\n\nWe have no choice, so it's what you have to do. I'm just saying it's okay to find that difficult and hate it. And not have to like it, if that makes sense.\n\nAlso, if this rant runs contrary to other people's world views, want to state that I don't think my opinion needs to be universal. If 100% positive thinking / grind it out works for you, that's good.\n\nFor me, having this mentality of \"it's a little unfair and I'll do it anyway\" helps my self-worth tremendously.",

I felt so lost as an undergrad when it came to \"networking.\" There's a lot of unspoken social norms that are impossible to navigate, because the people who DO know to navigate them do it subconsciously and would never know to explain to you how to do it. Also, most networking events are geared towards business and finance students, but not STEM. Also, if you are in STEM, literally FUCK YOU if you study ANYTHING aside from biology (for the intent of going to med school) or engineering. Environmental studies? Geology? Either work for an oil company or go fuck yourself. Also, if you have the mildest of autism, ADHD, or social anxiety, networking is even more impossible. I went to one of those stupid liberal arts schools and the career placement center was abysmal. My adviser was nice but useless at helping me find a job. The education itself was fine (actually love the liberal arts aspect that requires students to study stuff outside their major), but I got 0 help with finding a job or figuring out how to find a graduate adviser.",
