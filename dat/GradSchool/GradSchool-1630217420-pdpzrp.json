  "text": "I don\u2019t have anyone to share this except my family, but my family doesn\u2019t really understand the PhD experience so I thought I would share this on here.\n\nOur lab has an annual evaluation where each student meets with the PI for an hour just to talk about everything, plan out the next year, and comment on each other. (Btw I think every lab should have this kind of thing).\n\nI started my program (Chemistry) during the pandemic and am finishing up my first year. I tried so hard during my first year here doing research, TA, and taking classes at the same time for 9 months. The research I\u2019m doing was totally new to me and I had to learn everything from the beginning. I also learned to code and took several relevant data science courses because I thought it would benefit me later.\n\nLast year was also brutal to me not only with covid, I lost weight, stressed out so much, broke up with my boyfriend, my grandpa passed away, and had a few serious dental procedures due to a car accident several years ago. I never complained to my advisor about my life except the dental part since it affects my lab schedule before because I don\u2019t like using them as excuses.\n\nDuring the annual evaluation, my advisor told me that \u2014 I am the most productive first year she has ever had \u2014 my presentations, reports are the most professional and beautiful ones she has ever seen \u2014 she loves how much I have grown since the first time she met me \u2014 and she believes I will do great in my PhD time.\n\nThose words just mean so much to me after all the efforts I put in and all the burdens I have been through. I know the hardest part has yet to come but I\u2019m thankful to have my advisor as a great mentor and supporter. I hope y\u2019all the best in your journey.",

          "text": "Hi there, for coding, I\u2019m not confident enough to give any advice. I\u2019m lucky because I have a project that requires coding so I just follow the flow of that project and learn what I need to. I have also done some silly coding projects just to practice my skills. Codecademy is good!! I watched a lot of MIT open courses for data science as well.\n\nFor my first year, I wish I did more research on what my group is doing before joining the group. It took me months to learn everything from scratch and I wish I could go back to the summer before grad school to read all the literature about my project now.\n\nAlso, socialize and have some close friends. Friends are crucial in grad school :)",

In your first year, make sure you know what you really want to do during your PhD time. Like when someone asks you what your research is about, you know how to answer specifically and with enthusiasm.",
