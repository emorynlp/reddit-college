  "text": "I'm at the tail end of 4 years into my PhD (in a field where 6.5 years is the norm), and the last 2 years have been very unproductive from my end. Not so unproductive that my committee has had an issue (I've never had a bad committee meeting) but bad enough that my supervisor has raised concerns multiple times.\n\nA combination of mental health problems (depression, suicide attempt), lack of support network, and of course, COVID, eventually eventually lead to my supervisor suggesting I master out since November last year. I felt that was drastic, and opted to take a short leave of absence...which did WONDERS for my mental health but my productivity is still not up to my supervisor's standards (e.g. he's been asking for some figures for the last 3 months that I just...haven't gotten around to).\n\nI've also been focusing on a lot of things to wrap up datasets and what not, and still maintain a positive outlook, but the main issue is that before my leave of absence, my supervisor directly told me he would likely not write me a reference upon graduation.\n\nI still want to do my PhD, not for academia but because a lot of jobs I want require PhD level experience (plus I'm 4 years in and I like my project!), but has anyone had success with not having a reference?\n\nEDIT: I should add, I made the huge, huge mistake of opening up to my supervisor about some of my mental health issues (just the lighter, depression related stuff) -- huge mistake.",

      "text": "Not my field at all, but there's a story of a mathematician named Yitang Zhang that became an overnight celebrity in the math field. His PhD supervisor did not write a letter for him, and he spent years after his PhD doing various odd jobs, including working at Subway. He still thought about research and published a groundbreaking paper that landed him a professorship at UCSD. Reading his supervisor's comments about him on his personal website was quite shocking. There are many paths in which you don't need a letter from your supervisor, such as an industry job. You do not have to stay in academia at all.\n\nAs for your own situation, I feel like opening up to a supervisor or anyone in a similar position of power to be a mixed bag. They will either be super understanding, or they might not understand. Either way, I would rather have a potential reference tell me they won't provide me with a letter, rather than have them write a letter with bad comments about me in it.  At least you will have an opportunity to find someone else that can say positive things about you.",

      "text": "I think that is not real problem. Yes, it limits your choices, but still there are many chances. A close friend of mine finished her PhD in 3.5 years, but because her PI surely wanted to keep her as postdoc labor, she couldn't ask him to write rec letter. So she applied many postdocs, which didn't require rec letter. And you know, what? She got a fantastic offer from Karolinska university in Sweden, being selected among some other candidates! \nAlso, I know the case, that one PI didn't want to write rec letter, but the student insisted. Finally, it turned out, the letter was very bad and it didn't create good impression for her postdoc PI.\nSo, I would say, go without letter. Just believe in yourself.",
