  "text": "I am a 2nd year grad student in an art history MA program and have been having such a hard time. I was so much better in undergrad, but I am constantly burnt out with terrible mental health. \n\nI have this class that\u2019s a heavy course load, more than any I\u2019ve ever taken. We have to do a total of two presentations on the readings, for the duration of class, with a partner. We have to do a 10 minute artist presentation as well, a 15-20 page final paper, a two page research proposal, add glow posts to each week\u2019s readings prior to class and a final 15 minute presentation on our final paper. Additionally I have three short response papers (2-3 pages) on readings. I only did one response paper. I have been so burnt the hell out and didn\u2019t have time to finish the short response papers. I feel so horribly disappointed with myself.",

And follow through on them.\n\n2) Consider academic and/or mental health counseling services to help you meet your deadlines.\n\n3) Don't feed the anxiety you're experiencing. Write down what the actual circumstances are - put it all on paper so it doesn't stay this abstract, emotional experience in your head so that when you are talking about it/building strategies to move forward, you can honestly approach them without being crippled with emotion.",

I am already getting support with the office of accesible education for dyslexia and adhd, and asked her for an extension and she gave me a week extra, but because I put so much work into my final presentation today, only had the change to do one response paper.",

                      "text": "Don't worry - everyone in grad school, especially during courses, is perpetually in a state of falling behind. You come out of it SO MUCH STRONGER and more capable than you began. I don't mean the whole degree, I mean the course components. They push you so far and hard, so even if you FEEL like you're failing, your capacity to produce has exponentially grown. The downside is, it destroys your self-esteem and sense of accomplishment. So just know... all of the negative feelings you are experiencing are basically universal in grad school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy best advice is just to focus on what your goals are after grad school and redirect your attention to how each assignment or presentation gets you closer to that or serves a purpose for that. If you fail something, no big deal, you just do it again so you can get the degree so fulfill that goal. Often people get bogged down in performative details during grad school itself and become all-consumed with meeting every expectation, regardless of the cost to themselves. People almost always give FAR too much of themselves to their programs, whether that be in terms of not taking care of themselves, providing unreasonable amounts of  free or underpaid labor, etc. so that by the time they finish, they are so burnt out they've got nothing left to give for their ACTUAL goal. Just take care of yourself, use everything here as a learning experience, and focus on what your priorities actually are and how to achieve them :)",
