  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m applying for an MFA in illustration or digital art for Fall 2022 and I was wondering if anyone here has had success in being admitted to a program like this and if they have any tips they\u2019d like to share! I\u2019ve been working closely with my professors on pursuing this goal and I think I have a solid portfolio and artist statement\u2014 I just need to write a statement of purpose for each of the six schools I\u2019m applying to.\n\nDespite overwhelmingly positive feedback from peers and professors, I\u2019m still terrified about not getting into a single program. How competitive is it, really?\n\nThank you!",
