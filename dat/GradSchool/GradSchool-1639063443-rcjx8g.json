  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently doing a research project on cashless payments impact of the economy of a country. So far I\u2019ve got okayish datasets for the two but to estimate the total cash transactions in a country what do you think I should do?  I was considering taking M1 total or Currency in circulations. I was getting results on the multiple linear regression but all of them have p values of 0.1-0.2 I feel a bit stuck now any suggestions would be helpful.",
