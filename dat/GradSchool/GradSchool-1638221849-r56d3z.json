  "text": "so this is my first year in my MS program and I think i\u2019m going to end this semester with two B\u2019s on my transcript. i\u2019m so disappointed and worried about how much of a failure i\u2019m going to look like to my PI and potential PhD application.\n\nHas anyone else started their program pretty rough? is it redeemable and what happens if you get a low cumulative GPA in grad school (say you graduate with ~3.0)?",

      "text": "Hey there, I don't mean to be rude, but it seems like you may have never failed at school before and could use a reality check. You're doing great.\n\n1. Your grades do not define YOU.\n2. B's aren't remotely close to failing.\n3. Break the seal on not getting straight A's now and save yourself the anxiety of always being perfect/imposters syndrome in a PhD.\n4. No one ever looked at my Masters grades when I applied for PhD, yours may not either depending on program and how you sell yourself at that stage.\n5. You'll be okay. Finish the semester as best you can, take a break, and come back with new energy.\n\nGood luck!",
