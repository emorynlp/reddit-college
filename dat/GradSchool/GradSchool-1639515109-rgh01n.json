Unless we have to do work at home or have something to share with each other we just focus on us when we\u2019re home. Having pets and lots of board games helps.

      "text": "Wonderful that you both are figuring out ways to do this. I really like your idea of keeping boundaries between work and home. Are you doing okay with it already, but looking for new ideas? Or is it a struggle supporting each other? \n\nI think one of the harder things is to learn how to just be with each other and listen. Grad school is so busy and stressful, it's often challenging to sit quietly and listen. I'll be curious to see what others have to say.",

          "text": "Thank you for your reply :) I\u2019m just curious about how other couples experience grad school together. I figured with my partner and I being in similar fields we\u2019d find joy talking about our work together. Turns out, it\u2019s the opposite lol which I don\u2019t mind at all especially when it gets overwhelming. \n\nWe\u2019ll just see what others have to say.\n\nEdit: you are right though, it is important to listen. That\u2019s something I need to do more of for sure. Sometimes, we just need to vent",

We helped with each other\u2019s work a bit but respected when the other didn\u2019t have the capacity or time for that. But I can honestly say my thesis wouldn\u2019t have gotten done without him writing across the table from me. We didn\u2019t leave school at school but still had outlets\u2014non-biology hobbies that we both love and spend time together doing!",

      "text": "My fiance and I do very different things, so talking about our work or helping each other in minor ways doesn't feel like a chore. But we are both naturally very curious people. \n\nWe tend to give each other space when we are both working from home to focus and then eat and relax together. We make a point of reading things for at least a few minutes every day so that we do have obvious things to share with each other that aren't work. I think we are both more inclined to want to talk about the other person's work, but don't feel like talking about our own since we've been thinking about it all day. We also make a point of doing things together, which now is usually cooking elaborate meals or baking large batches of things, which is a wonderful reset!",
