  "text": "I am a senior in my undergrad for psychology and I have been applying to grad schools this past month. If I'm being completely honest, I am dreading graduate school, and honestly, kind of regretting picking psychology as a major. \n\nI LOVE psychology and I have always dreamed of being a counselor/therapist, but the amount of money it will cost... it's scary. I know a career in counseling will make me happy, but the process to get there is 3 more years of college. \n\nI think the biggest issue as to why I'm dreading getting a master's and regretting my career choice is the debt. I've been crunching numbers and the amount of debt makes me very anxious. Therapist/counselors don't make great money and I already know I will be paying this loan off for the next twenty or so years.\n\nHow do I deal with this anxiety?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso idk if it is important to include but the total for 3 years of graduate school and living expenses will amount to about $80,000 (this doesn't include any possible scholarships or grants). Also, idk if it's important to include but I want to be a school counselor in specific.",
