  "text": "In the last 10 months, I've had a lot of shit go on in my life - from my mother getting cancer and going through treatment, breaking up with my fiance, moving in to my own place, meeting and getting my heart broken by another person.... You get it.\n\nAnd I'm fucking struggling with school. I feel like I've lost my desire for grad school and my program in general. I know I'm just stressed but what are y'all doing to compartmentalize and focus? I'm struggling with racing thoughts and I'd appreciate any insight",

You might just need some time to clear your thoughts and come to terms with what's happening in your personal life before continuing grad school.",

      "text": "My mother got cancer in the middle of my first attempt at a masters degree, and my girlfriend (now wife) moved 1000 miles away. Compartmentalizing in life sometimes requires time. I was doing well enough that I could quit, graduate with my bachelor's, get a job and get accepted at another university, I'm doing well now, married, mother is recovered and cancer free, but I needed to take the time to focus on myself and family between my current school and Alma-mater. \n\nMaybe it's time to take a break, goals are great, but if you give up everything else for them, sometimes the cost doesn't justify the means",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I have also had my personal life take over my brain space these last few months as I write my thesis. The best thing I did was speak to a therapist. The best advice they gave me was the do some self care, if you can. I know that\u2019s easier said than done, but a little bit of time for yourself makes a huge difference in your mental health. Also, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Grad school is hard enough, and it gets exceptionally harder when your personal life takes a turn. You are doing the best that you can- you aren\u2019t running on the same amount of energy and brain power as you were when you didn\u2019t have all these problems come up, and that is okay. \n\nI would also make sure your advisor is aware that you have a lot going on. I was nervous to tell mine, but was relieved after doing so. It was a stressor off my plate. They should understand that things will be done a little slower than usual. Again, that is okay :) you are only one person and can only do so much. \n\nTake care of yourself. Sending lots of positivity your way!",

      "text": "I had a very similar past year.\n\nBroke up with my gf of five years last September. \n\nShortly thereafter, sister got cancer.\n\nShortly after that, my stepfather physically assaulted me.\n\nTwo days after that, I got fired from my job. The same day, the new girl I was seeing broke up with me unexpectedly.\n\nI\u2019m now in a much better job and excelling in my graduate program.\n\nWhat I did? During my unemployed time, I worked on myself. Took the summer off of school, travelled, talked to a therapist, and did things I\u2019d always wanted to. The best advice I got during this time came from a close friend- spread your arms out, spin in a circle, and realize that everything within that circle is the only thing you can control in life.",

      "text": "Self care, whatever that means for you. It's your life so you can call it what you like, but this seems like more than personal \"drama\" to me. A parent getting cancer and a breakup with a fiance are major things, and it's okay to acknowledge that these things are serious and will impact your ability to focus on your work. Anyone going through the same thing would be feeling the same way. If you have a good relationship with your adviser, maybe let them know that you are struggling if you haven't already. You can share as many or as few details as you like. \n\nIf you haven't already, you may consider speaking with your university's mental health services. I went through a stressful time awhile back, and while a lot of the \"therapy\" was not helpful, they did help me with some stress management techniques for when I found that my thoughts were racing and I felt like I was catastrophizing. Otherwise, I agree with the other person who suggested you take some time for yourself. Do something nice for yourself and take time to grieve if possible. Compartmentalizing and not processing these things don't make them go away, it's just a mental promissory note for another day, but eventually the bill comes due.",

          "text": "yeah this - also see if your school has an office of student services that deals with student leave - I had massive health issues that got in the way of my work and had no idea medical leave was a thing until nearly the end of that issue. But I\u2019d imagine they also do other leaves like say compassionate or whatever. But if you\u2019re having trouble sleeping & with racing thoughts medical may cover it. You\u2019d probably have to go thru your school's mental health services for that. But either way, mental health services are worth checking out",

      "text": "First, I am verry sorry to hear what you have been through these past months. It's impressive that you were able to manage grad school with all that. Remember that taking time off is not a bad thing at all and you should do it if you feel like you need time to process things instead of building up emotions and stress. \n\nI found that for me, when i am stressed and struggling mentally, the quality of my research, work, etc is not as good as when I am \"normal\" and it takes me more time to do things. I figured it's more worth it to take a weekend off to unwind and regroup my thoughts than keep trying to make the dead hamster in my head run. \n\nUnwinding doesn't mean you have free time where you can go out and see friends. You need to put your brain in a coma of emptiness. In other words, you take some \"me time\", so you are alone doing nothing that is too demanding mentally. Play videogames, watch movies, do some arts, read a book, do some home exercise if that's what you like, etc.\n\nSending you positive thoughts, you got this!",
