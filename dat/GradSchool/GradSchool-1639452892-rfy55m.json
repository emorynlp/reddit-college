  "title:": "They gave me a Scholarship and now they want the money back!",
  "text": "Last week I got an email on the 6th from the financial aid office saying I got the \"Educational Re-Engagement and High Demand Scholarship\" for $1,000. It showed up on my tuition page and on my financial aid page  so I thought it was legit. I got the money on the 9th and of course I already spent it! Now that I went to check my classes for next semester I noticed there is a hold for $1,000 and the Scholarship doesn't show up anymore! So my question is do I really have to give that money back? Why do they give it to me on the first place? \n \nObligatory sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language",

If it\u2019s a hold it could be because they have to verify you meet enrollment and/or other requirements of the scholarship before it can be disbursed. Don\u2019t preemptively freak out, call the school and find out what happened.",

If you're attending a small private uni and they give you some sketchy reason for taking away the scholarship, I wonder if you're being scammed.\n\n\n\nLike others said, it could be a purely administrative hiccup with student status.",
