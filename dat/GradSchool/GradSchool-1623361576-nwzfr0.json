  "text": "You don\u2019t know me, I don\u2019t know you\u2026 but I feel you, and I empathize with each and everyone of you.  \n\nWhy is it so hard? Idk.  Would I do it again? Debatable. Was it worst it? Hard to tell because I still feel like I have a minor brain injury. \n\nKeep up the good work\u2014or shit, it doesn\u2019t even have to be good.  Because let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s bad even if it\u2019s good. \n\nOr, just fuck it.  Either way, good on you for trying.  It sucks, and sometimes it\u2019s just not worth it.  \n\n-Sending love to stressed out masses\n\nP.S. mental health is super important, take care of your selves <3",
