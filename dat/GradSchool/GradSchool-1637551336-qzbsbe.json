  "text": "I'm an undergrad History and Political Science major and I'm starting to apply to PhD programs, and I just wondered if you guys even think its worth it to apply for higher ranked programs? I'm a good student; good grades, research experience, etc. But I go to a small college that doesn't really have a name for itself and I just don't think I \"stand out\" that much. I've thought about applying to programs like the University of Chicago (that's really the big one I'm most seriously considering application to) but I just don't even know if its worth it. I think it is but then again I don't think it is... I don't know I just keep talking myself in circles. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance!",

I would then research all of these schools to find out the quantitative stuff for admitted students: GRE scores, GPA's, etc. If my scores were significantly higher, I would use conditional formatting to color the cells green. If they were within the range, they would be yellow, and red for if my scores were lower. I also listed a few professors I'd be interested in working with and looked at their recently published articles, and reached out to those professors. Acceptance rate is really hard to find for a lot of programs, because it will often be for the school as a whole, which grad students don't care about. Occasionally it will be buried deep in a department website.\n\nI would apply to mostly greens, a couple yellows, and a handful of reds if I had a good conversation with potential advisers.",

              "text": "yep yep, these other replies are great advice! I had about 15-20 schools I was interested in. The way I found these schools was simply by going on Google scholar and looking up papers that I found interesting, then finding the lead PI for those papers. I would also speak to those that were writing my LoR and ask if they had any recommendations. I\u2019m not really applying to any reach schools like Stanford, MIT, or anything like that. I\u2019m applying to 6 schools, for me my reach school is Georgia Tech, the program seems the most difficult and is probably the one I\u2019m least likely to get into. But even for Georgia Tech I spoke with professors, graduate students and current researchers. Including Georgia tech I\u2019m applying to 6 programs, 1 reach, 4 normal, and 1 safety. The 4 normal ones aren\u2019t necessarily easier to get into that GT but my relationship with potential PI, and other professors I believe definitely improves my chances. My recommendation is to not really worry about which schools are going to be reach school, comfort schools etc, but really just rank then for yourself. GT is my reach school but is not my #1 choice. Really think about program fit, motivation, and when talking to PIs consider if you\u2019re actually willing to be working with that person for 5+ years. One quick tip I have for talking to PI is, don\u2019t try to use their work as a reflection of what you want to do (no one wants a copy) think about how you can build off of their work, or how your research interests are related to their work/expertise. \n\nSo for now, as you look at programs, don\u2019t worry about reach schools and rank. Find programs that you\u2019re interested in, talk to faculty, talk to your LoR writers, and make a list. From the list, you\u2019ll be able to see later on which ones you consider reach schools. You got it!",

I am now faculty in a history department with a PhD program that is relatively competitive for my field. When evaluating grad admissions, the top questions for me are\n1) do they have an interesting/promising and well thought out research agenda?\n2) even if they don't seem to have solid training due to circumstance, do they seem independently motivated (personally engaged in doing research, etc)\n\nWhat school they came from is at the very bottom of my list. In fact, and this is just a personal bias,  I think given 2 students in the same ranking in terms of what I perceive as their research potential, I tend to look more closely at the one from a less prominent school because I feel they had to perhaps go more out of the way to achieve their intellectual agenda. But that's more of a personal bias to correcting elitism in academia\n\nMy experience: applied to 5 programs, got into the no. 1 ranked for my field, got rejected by all others including my backup school. \n\nThere's always a lot of randomness you are unaware of and have no control over (relevant faculty not taking students that year because they admitted someone in that area last year, someone going on sabattical, etc). Contacting faculty you want to work with might help filter out some of those cases for you.\n\nSo yea, I would say apply high BUT also apply widely. If cost of applications is a concern, always ask grad admissions at the university if they will waive the fee. They often do apparently\n\nEDIT: GRE scores are not something I care about either... It's all about do they seem to be have a good/innovative research agenda and do they seem motivated to pursue it (have worked on their field beyond classes)",

      "text": "I applied to a PhD in history at UChicago a few years ago.\n\nI am british and did my undergrad at a college in London that is specifically for mature students and doesn't admit based on school results but their own admissions process. Basically  the uk equivalent of the SAT is irrelevant to them, but if you do a good essay and interview they give you a chance. It's a good, respected college, and part of London university, but it's definitely a non-traditional school and one that, let's say, may not be as highly regarded by admissions boards as some other schools.\n\nFWIW, I didn't get into UC's PhD program, but I did get into their Social Sciences MA program, and from there reapplied to PhD and got into Northwestern (UChicago didn't have a program that suited the nature of my work/research by that stage.)\n\nI should note that this was the kind of program focused on by the big, much-discussed, recent article that talked about MA programs tending to be money spinners for the university, but I loved it, it helped me figure out what I want to do research wise, helped me prepare my PhD applications to a high standard, and was generally a good thing\n\nbut I agree with all the comments - they can't admit you if you don't try. also, with UC specifically there are these other options available. I would suggest that UC (and other schools) probably won't care much about the name of the university you're at, but about your potential. also, these are university admissions folks, they know all the universities from which people are applying to them, even if they're small, not well known.\n\none other thing I'd add is about this statement you make:\n\n>I just don't think I \"stand out\" that much\n\nSo MAKE yourself stand out! the real key to getting accepted to a program is almost certainly not the school you're at or even your GPA so much as your personal statement. yes, the GPA matters at some level, they're not going to take someone with consistent B- or whatever, but the personal statement of the application is the thing they'll focus on. they want to know how you think, what your potential for analysis is, whether your research ideas have potential, and also how well you write.\n\nAt my Northwestern interview one of the faculty pointed out a specific phrase I'd written in my writing sample and that had piqued her interest enough to want to admit me. a couple of years later, a member of my Northwestern dissertation committee told me that when they're thinking about admissions, the personal statement comes first, then the writing sample, then the GPA. so if you think you don't stand out in terms of grades, extracurriculars and so on, tailor your statement to show what you think you CAN do. show them how your mind works, show them you are excited about a particular topic, and show them you can write analytically.\n\nTL;DR: do it! you can! but there are ways to think about how you do it that can increase your chances and make yourself stand out as a good candidate - good luck!!!",

You need someone in the faculty interested in your ideas and the work you're doing. That's how you build your shot of getting in. Beyond just thinking about \"rank\" you want to focus on where you see your research ideas going and who might be a good person to work with to pursue those ideas. I'm not saying rank is irrelevant. Certainly going to Princeton matters more than going to NYU. But between Princeton and Chicago, it's more a function of finding the right supervisor.\n\nSo don't assume you're not viable just because you're from a smaller university. What matters is your SoP, your writing and your ideas for research. Reach out to faculty and figure out who you would be a good fit to work with.\n\nPS: Though you've left it far too late to do it this admission cycle. I'm assuming you're thinking of making these decisions for next year.",

Frankly a PhD in history or political science (my two fields, I know your pain), from a non-top-15 or so program isn\u2019t worth a whole lot on the academic job market these days. Read [this article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/02/university-hiring-if-you-didn-t-get-your-ph-d-at-an-elite-university-good-luck-finding-an-academic-job.html) if you don\u2019t believe me. Basically a preponderance of all professors went to the same 10 or 15 grad schools. Unfortunately if you don\u2019t go to one of those, you\u2019ll have an extremely difficult time finding work afterward, and frankly you\u2019ll have a hard time anyway.\n\nNow for the encouraging part. Absolutely apply!! I went to a state school with open enrollment that\u2019s completely unknown in my undergrad field and doesn\u2019t even offer a major in my graduate field. I got terrible grades and dropped out for several years. I got better grades, and most importantly did some really cool research, and I got into a top-10 masters program! \n\nThat\u2019s another thing, if you\u2019re absolutely set on doing a PhD but you don\u2019t get into one of the top ranked programs, go for an MA at a lower ranked program. I\u2019d advise against paying out of pocket for it, but lots of smaller state schools will offer funded MA programs in history and poli sci. That\u2019s a great way to build your CV. One of my friends did exactly that, went to a middle tier school for undergrad in history, then went to a small state school who funded his MA, then went onto complete his PhD at the top program for his sub field. This dude turned Harvard down.",

      "text": "Honestly it just depends what the standard of qualifications is within your field. That\u2019s not to be confused with what they state on their page, but rather what it is in reality behind the scenes (ie they might say that you need at least a 3.0 to apply, but in reality they won\u2019t consider anyone below 3.6\u2026 stuff like that). Unfortunately there\u2019s a massive lack of transparency in these processes, so unless you know someone who sits on the selection committee, you\u2019re likely out of luck.\n\nSpeaking for myself, applying to neuroscience PhDs, the bar of standard is loosely: 3.6 gpa, at least a year of full-time research experience post-graduation, one coauthored paper _at the minimum_, essays that are so well polished and articulated that they could be published in the New York Times, and three letters of recommendation that make Jesus himself look like Satan by comparison. I\u2019m not joking. Schools get 5-700 applications per year for 12 spots. People usually get in either because they\u2019ve _effectively_ already done a PhD (ie their qualifications are sky high) or they know someone. It\u2019s frankly quite demoralizing to think about. I\u2019ve definitely lost myself more than a few times tugging too hard on that thread. As an aside, therapists can help a lot if you get to this point. If you do, please don\u2019t be stubborn: take care of yourself and get help. Good lord, therapists help so much! \nBut I digress\u2026\n\nMy advice: just apply. Worst thing that can happen is they say no, you lose $80, and you get experience writing about who you are, what you have done, and where you want to go (which can be quite enlightening sometimes, especially if that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve laid it out explicitly). Maybe you\u2019ll get some interview practice too! The flip side is that they judge you to be well matched to their program and you get in. Like I said, just try.\n\nBest of luck!",

I applied to maybe 12 schools, 3-4 of them were kind of \"reach schools\" while the rest were, I thought, safety schools. I ended up getting rejected from all the programs I thought I could easily get into, but got into almost all of the programs I thought were a medium/long shot. It wasn't a guarantee, of course, but as other's said, if you don't even apply, then you can't attend.",
