However, because exams aren\u2019t really my thing, which makes me not like courses as much, my plan is to get all coursework done within two semesters so I can have more time doing research and teaching.",

I definitely get the frustration with coursework, but I don't see how one would get a good founding in the field in general *only* through research; speaking for myself, I would end up knowing nothing about the fundamentals (e.g. surface water and groundwater hydrology), since my research doesn't depend on them.  Which would be problematic after graduating.",
