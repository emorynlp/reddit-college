  "text": "I am thinking about going to grad school next year after I graduate this December, but I\u2019ve never done research before. My girlfriend just finished her honors thesis and it took her a year and a half to finish it. I was wondering if all research is this long or big. Or is it just some? Or most? Or your choice? Sorry for the ignorance!",

      "text": "Most research based masters will probably take at least a year and a half, often at least 2 years. For PhD, at least in the us, most programs are going to take 5+ years, though some people are able to finish in 4. Id recommend trying to find some sort of research experience before you apply however, and taking a year or so to do that, both to figure out if you enjoy research and to boost your application, especially if you\u2019re interested in a PhD, if you\u2019re interested in a masters that may not be necessary.",

              "text": "It would depend slightly on your field. Research assistantships are pretty common, post-bacc positions are also good, and seem especially common in biomedical-leaning research. Research leaning industry experience can also work, and I think is more common in fields like computer science or engineering.",

              "text": "There\u2019s a huge variance in programs. There are masters with and without a thesis option, the former tends to be designed for those who hope to continue in academia, where as the latter tends to be a good option for science educators or those wishing to go into industry or other professional programs. Length will also vary by program, though I haven\u2019t really heard of many under a year and a half in biological sciences. If you plan to do a thesis based masters it will likely take up to two years, especially if you need to either work as a research assistant or TA for funding.",

      "text": "My PhD directly out of undergrad will take just a smidge over the 4 year mark (4 years being the minimum time for my university given no prior masters degree). It's really a matter of how self organized you are. I am following up form a masters student who took  4 years for his degree cause he let my supervisor run him around the garden path with random other projects which weren't enough to graduate on according to her. It's really a matter of if you're able to say, okay this is my project, and stick to it without flitching for the needed time how long it'll take. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. break yourself out of the habit of feeling sorry for ignorance, nobody knows these things until they're either told or learn through experience. Learning academic jargon gets annoying but you need to make sure you ask as soon as it comes up or you'll be wondering what X actually means forever.",
