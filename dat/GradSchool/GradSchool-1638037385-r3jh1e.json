  "text": "Hello All, \n\nI\u2019m a current undergraduate senior graduating with my B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Political Science this upcoming May. \n\nI have most of my graduate applications and schools finalized at this point, I just am needing to work on my personal statement and departmental essays. I am applying to mostly programs that have dual M.S. degrees in Engineering and Public Policy (Carnegie Mellon, Michigan, UT Austin). Has anyone on this subreddit pursued dual degrees? Any insight about these programs specifically? \n\nMost of my colleagues aren\u2019t going on to graduate school so I would really appreciate some advice/answers to the questions I\u2019ve included below. \n\n1. How did you motivate yourself to write your personal statement//departmental essays? \n\n2. Is it essential to get graduate application in before the \u201cEarly Funding\u201d or \u201cPriority\u201d deadline? \n\n3. Is it really as terrible as it\u2019s made out to be to stay at your B.S. institution for your graduate education? \n\n4. Any other advice//tips? \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "1. It was tough, but you have to keep reminding yourself of what your working for. Visualize yourself a year from right now in graduate school and how much your life has changed and improved all by submitting a simple application.\n\n2. A common deadline is January 15th, however, this is not a hard deadline for all graduate programs. It is absolutely imperative that you submit your application by the deadline. In my experience, graduate programs typically don\u2019t have a \u201cEarly Funding\u201d or \u201cPriority\u201d deadline, just the one deadline.\n\n3. It is not at all terrible, there is no real merit behind this idea. \n\n4. Submit on time, give your rec. letter writers at least a months notice and send out reminders to them 2-3 weeks in advice of the deadline (if they are professors remember that this time of year as just as busy for them as it is for you), double check your submission deadlines and submission materials. Good luck!",
