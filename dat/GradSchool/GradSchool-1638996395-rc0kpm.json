  "text": "Hi all!\n\nThe research lab finally sent me an application and told me to fill it out and they will set up an interview. On October 30th I sent in an application to a research lab to volunteer. I haven't heard back yet. They do take awhile to respond between emails I'm just not sure if they are genuinely busy or blowing me off. I sent a follow up email Nov 28th to make sure they received the application but I got radio silence. It's a state university if that matters.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Not a great sign. It doesn't necessarily mean they aren't interested; it could mean that they are very poorly operated or organized. So something for you to consider in moving forward with them if you do get the opportunity. With my experience, I personally would look for another lab. If people involved (yourself included) don't communicate effectively, you're going to have a bad time.",

              "text": "Well if I were you, I would try reaching out to people associated with the lab but aren't a part of it to get their perspective on it. If there are online reviews or forums, student subreddits for the school you want to attend... anything like that. You can also ask current students in the department to recommend labs to you for what you want to do and see what they say!",
