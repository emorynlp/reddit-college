  "title:": "I had a small victory with my social anxiety!",
  "text": "I can objectively say that my social anxiety has improved over the past year. This time last year I was waiting for my flight to go to a convention. I was starting to feel really isolated and would get to the point where I would hide in the bathroom if I spotted a faculty member coming towards me down the hall. Anyways, I saw a faculty member (who has been nothing but nice) waiting for the same flight as me and I tried my hardest to make sure she didn't see me. I boarded the plane, sat in my chair, and I was in tears and felt like I was going to throw up at the possibility that she was going to want to talk to me and hear me say something stupid. I think this was the point where I realized that I needed some help.\n\nToday, I'm travelling to the same conference. Today, I saw 3 faculty members chatting while waiting for the flight and I approached them and asked if I could join and wait with them. We had a pleasant conversation about random BS. I felt nervous and I took a deep breath before talking to them; however, I don't feel the urge to cry, throw up, or anything like that.\n\nOn the outside, it's really small. But for me, it's a huge victory that I wanted to share. \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "Congratulations on overcoming this and thank you so much for sharing. I get so incredibly discouraged because I feel and do the same things. I had a seemingly uncontrollable panic attack at a recent conference where I was presenting a poster and couldn't get control of my body and resulted in me hidnng in the bathroom and crying and missing the presentation. I feel really immature and unprofessional for my anxiety levels seeing everyone else seemingly get through it. I would really appreciate any tips you have, I stay so isolated because of my anxiety that I don't even have a friend and its so painful and frustrating. I just take everything by the second. Wonderful job again, I'm so proud of you and this makes me feel a little less alone.",
