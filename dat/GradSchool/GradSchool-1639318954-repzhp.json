  "text": "Mental health and the ever so lovely symptom of motivation issues over the last 2.5 years has been the only thing standing between me and submitting my application. I was wondering if anyone could share their experiences if they hired someone to help them with completing their application materials, and where did you look to hire that person (Taskrabbit?) Thanks!",

      "text": "I agree with the other poster. Applying to grad school is going to be easier than what you experience once you're in grad school.\n\nIf you're having a lot of trouble getting motivated to complete the applications, maybe now is not the time to apply. As you will need much greater motivation to succeed in grad school.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t want to be a Debbie downer and just would like to chip my two cents in (as someone who has also struggled w/ MH issues and continues to manage them). Not addressing those issues may only exacerbate them many times over once you get to grad school. Please consider putting yourself first and confronting those issues (via therapy/ medication/ etc) to be able to better manage them now rather than later. Motivation, resilience, & grit are a big part of getting through a grad program and you need to be ready because the obstacles will come left and right at you like snowflakes on a snowy windy day. \n\nI have never heard of anyone hiring professional help for an application to grad school (for premeds I\u2019ve heard of this frequently but that\u2019s another path). And there is no one to save you but yourself in grad school because it\u2019s ultimately you that does the work at the end of the day\u2026 so I would definitely recommend focusing on self-care and becoming resilient before taking on this challenge. It\u2019ll be here for you when you\u2019re ready \ud83d\ude0a",

And of course I didn\u2019t put my whole life story in the comments or text, but I am indeed seeing a weekly therapist, medication managed by a psychiatrist in conjunction with my primary care provider, and so I was just wondering if anyone had experience with seeking assistance from a professional to oversee your application materials. Cheers to us both and thriving in spite of our mental health!",

I know a few people that struggled immensely due to a lapse in good mental healthcare due to the transition to grad school, and this lapse corresponded with first-year exams, so they were unable to remain in the program.",

MH is a real bitch so I empathize with you, and just being in therapy/on medication isnt a magic bullet. If you arent stable enough to tackle the application on your own, you shouldnt be applying.",

She had previous experience in the field I was studying in, and she made some wonderful suggestions on making my statement stronger.

I know some people who worked with their undergrad career office or writing center, but no one who hired someone. Is there a particular aspect you're struggling with? Do you need help with writing, organization, etc? Isolating that will help you figure out where to look.",
