  "text": "I\u2019m not really sure what to do about my department and their transphobia at this point. I\u2019m openly non-binary/trans, and it\u2019s caused some issues within my department. \n\nFirst issue is that I teach Spanish and use \u201cElle\u201d pronouns (neutral). I teach them to my students as an option, but one that is still new and not the norm in many areas. I was told I need to use female pronouns to not confuse my students. \n\nSecond issue occurred because I have my name changed on Zoom and Canvas, but my professor dead-named me in class last week. I explained I don\u2019t use that name, and would appreciate her using the name I have everywhere. She told me I should just change my name in the canvas grade book (I can\u2019t unless I legally change my name). \n\n\nNow today was the last issue. I participated in the research of a fellow student who asked for gender at the start of the study, and put the options of \u201cmale/female/other\u201d. I clicked other. During his presentation today, he said he put me as female since that was what I really am. I was shocked. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to approach this. I could submit a complaint with my name attracted to it, but I\u2019m worried about pissing off everyone above me and fucking up my shot of getting into a PhD program or future networking opportunities. What should I do?",

No one wants to deal with the **constant** accusations of bias.\n\nFaculty are also less inclined towards mentorship. It\u2019s created a contentious us vs them environment between faculty and grad students. Many of the faculty think the grad students are frothing to report them for any perceived infraction.\n\nI see a certain level of social and administrative bullying coming from the trans community in my former dept and then hiding behind their trans identity anytime someone is critical of them for anything (including valid criticism of work product).",

      "text": "This is going to get downvoted, but I\u2019m also trans and studied Spanish too, and I think if these are isolated incidents you maybe should just relax a little. If things become a pattern, then bring it up with administration. \n\nGetting deadnamed once or twice by busy people who don\u2019t know you very well and are reading your name, before having your name legally changed, happens. Frankly, when you interact with tons of students it\u2019s hard to remember all of these details, and the professor may not know how your name can even be changed in the system. Maybe wait and see if it becomes a pattern of intentional malice, and not just a mistake. You don\u2019t want to go nuclear too fast and destroy what could potentially be really good relationships and professional contacts. Even people who don\u2019t seem super \u201cwoke\u201d at first might very well warm up to you. I\u2019ve seen it happen. It\u2019s hard to know at first. These issues are still new for a lot of people, which. Not trying to make excuses for them, but I felt like me just being polite and understanding went a long way. \n\nThe prof who changed your gender on the survey can go to hell tho lol. What kind of research was it? If it was social and not biological research then I don\u2019t get why he would do that. Weird. \n\nAs for teaching.... I think this is complicated. Personally I wouldn\u2019t introduce gender neutral pronouns to students to use all the time in the  classroom, but more introduce them to it once as just \u201cthis exists in the world and you might see it in some places.\u201d It can be confusing and it\u2019s definitely controversial. However, college classes are supposed to introduce you to a wide range of accents and situations. My professors who were Chilean spoke super differently than my professors who were Spanish, for example. In that sense, you may be just one \u201cflavor\u201d of Spanish your students could acquire and grow to understand. I think the problem may arise if you inflate the gender neutral pronouns to seem more common than they are, or insist that they just be used or else the students are inherently bigoted. I\u2019m not sure that a direct attack like that is the best way to go in terms of just acclimating students (or profs) and convincing people to your side. Some people also have the perspective that non-binary identity can be separated from gendered pronouns, that you can be non-binary while using gendered pronouns. Some languages (like turkish) dont have any gendered pronouns at all but that doesn\u2019t imply the speakers are all non-binary nor does it erase social gender. So I feel like there\u2019s multiple ways to approach this. \n\nIn any case, I would prioritize positive relationships however you can if you want to continue into a PhD program. Compared to like, actual physical violence against trans people, these things are pretty minor and the best statement you can make is continuing to succeed professionally, however you need to make that happen. Imo, anyway",

This is also the same class where the guy presented and said I was really a girl, and she didn\u2019t stop it. \n\nAs for how I teach pronouns, I encourage you to read my comments about how/why I teach it below. I don\u2019t feel like reiterating, but basically my research has proven that the gender neutral aids in students processing of grammatical gender and helps them become more fluent. It has a lot less to do with social things than it does with actually processing. AND I don\u2019t force them to use it, I only bring it up in relevant contexts.",

Also, I'm assuming you're teaching college students... who are old enough and smart enough to understand pronouns?

You may think on a surface level that it is impossible because that is such a common verb, but estar is becoming the norm because of overgeneralization. The same thing happened with the entire vosotros conjugation in Latin America. How do you think dialects happen? It\u2019s change over time in a language. This particular change is called a \u201cchange from below\u201d meaning a minority group is making the change and it is slowly spreading through the community, but there are also things called \u201cchanges from above\u201d, where a majority group forces a specific language structure on the rest of the population.

For their part, OP is being incredibly accommodating.\n\nIt's exhausting, and absolutely harmful, but it's the reality of being \"out\" and marginalized in academia that you're going to be held to a higher standard, and be expected to be a patient educator and take responsibility for departmental culture on some level. I spend a significant amount of time each week on outreach and education, sometimes much more, and the reward is usually more unpaid work. But if I don't do it? I'm a bad scholar/educator and reflect poorly on my whole community and feed into stereotypes (some of which you can see in this thread) about being a crazy <slur> snowflake that's unwilling to meet people halfway. At my lowest point I feel like academia is sometimes worse because people are genuinely trying to learn and aren't actively malicious. (At my highest point I see a tangible difference in policy and student success though, so there's that. Also someone once bought me a beer for helping them out.)\n\nBut that's why I suggested elsewhere in the thread that OP find a community of people in a similar situation, whether online of in their community. I'm in both and it's honestly the thing that keeps me from throwing in the towel some weeks, being able to openly air things and be understood and supported by people who understand.",

(also, it's incredibly shitty policy, but most places when there's a complaint about a prof will tell the prof the details as a matter of course).\n\nDo you have a tertiary union? It might be worth talking to them as well as the diversity/inclusion office. If the professor of the people in the department that told you to use the wrong pronouns are in the union, it might be more effective if they get correction from that avenue as well (so they know the union isn't going to have their back if it comes down to a dispute).\n\nComplaining about this absolutely has the chance of pissing people off and could definitely affect your phd applications. But here's the thing - you probably don't want to do a phd program with someone who doesn't respect your identity. It's hard enough to do a phd as is, even harder to do one as a nonbinary person.\n\nYou *can* just go in the closet and get the masters and phd done. I'm not saying it's the only way, but it's going to make some things easier (and lots of other things way harder). It doesn't get any easier as you go on, either: Post-docs are hypercompetitive and something like \"having annoying pronouns\" isn't great for the \"department fit\" portion of a lot of post-doc applications. Not to mention, even in the most supportive department it's going to fall to you to educate and advocate. Even if it's something you enjoy (like I do), it can often be an exhausting burden on top of everything else you need to do over the course of a phd.\n\nYou could also be up front at your phd interviews (I probably wouldn't bring it up during the application process, though). You don't have to lead with the transphobia you've experienced, but asking about the faculty culture and if you'll find support and camaraderie as an lgbt+ person at X campus is a totally acceptable question.\n\nI'd also suggest, if you haven't already, building your own personal network of contacts. There are facebook groups (nonbinary academics network and nonbinary linguistics network) that you might find helpful. I'm out as trans/nonbinary and just coming to the end of my linguistics phd. In my case I didn't really have a choice about whether to be out or not because my research topic centers nonbinary voices, but that doesn't mean I don't sometimes wish I didn't have to deal w/some of the bs -- and I'm in an incredibly supportive, like one-in-a-million lotto win supportive, department. \n\nedit: being downvoted for speaking honestly about my experience.

I respect who you are and identify as, but \u201cElle\u201d is not used in any Spanish speaking country I\u2019ve lived or been too. Granted, you said \u201cas an alternative\u201d. In this particular part of your post and again as a native Spanish speaker I must side up with the decision to use our gendered pronouns. Unlike English, our language is incredibly dependent on the gender of things (things have a gender? What? In Spanish they do). Not because I oppose any of your views, or identity, but because you\u2019re setting people that are learning under you to a world of confusion. I see this a lot...our language, which has been ours for centuries, and mutated along the way with the local/regional context cannot undergo a forced change by people outside our culture. Something about it doesn\u2019t feel right at all. \n\nThen again I am no linguist. Just pitching my five cents. The other two points you raised should be denounced ASAP. Contact your equity office.",

And what we\u2019ve seen is that this change was started by native Spanish speakers for native Spanish speakers. Originally, it was found in Argentina, and now that neutral is taught in schools and is part of the native language of the youngest generation. So this isn\u2019t a \u201cmutation\u201d due to outside forces, but a change within a community that has now had wide spread. \n\nI also do research on how teaching the neutral to students effects their processing of gender in Spanish, and it doesn\u2019t confuse them, it actually helps them. Most people who learn Spanish as their second language view the masculine as the default, and never fully acquire the feminine form. This leads to consistent gender agreement errors. However, I\u2019ve found that when you teach them the neutral, they then become equally sensitive to masculine and feminine, helping them become more fluent. This is actually I study I just concluded last week and am now getting to the phase of submitting it for publication.",

Choosing the -e ending is also consistent with the grammar rules for non-gendered words in Spanish -- there are neutral adjectives that end in -e, so a neutral pronoun ending in -e makes logical sense. The form is just not *widely* used because most of the population is not trans or involved in the LGBTQ community, so it's less likely to enter their lexicon. There is also obviously still a lot of prejudice in this area, as OP is experiencing, which slows this sort of progress.

The other thing is that by the time you're fluent in a new language, it will (usually) be a couple years after you were taught the basics like gendered nouns and pronouns. Something that was just a new usage back then could be much more widespread by the time you're fluent and interacting with native speakers, if the trend continues in the intervening years. And given how awareness and acceptance of trans people has been growing the last 5 years, it's not at all a stretch to predict that \"elle\" will be more widely used a few years from now. So it's not a bad idea to give the beginners a heads-up that that pronoun is out there for specific contexts.",

Especially if the students are interested in reading contemporary news or participating in any online spaces in Spanish, they're likely to come across the form sooner or later given the increased visibility of trans/NB people these days. Back when I was in school (even in high school which feels like forever ago now) we were already being taught about the existence of the @ symbol as a more inclusive, less default-masculine form. The teacher who introduced us to it was, to my knowledge, cisgender, she just wanted us to be aware that it was out there. A lot of people hated that form too, but I definitely did see it used \"in the wild,\" so I was glad she took the time to explain it. The newer -e ending form is much less clunky and infinitely more pronounceable, which is great. If I were a student of OP's, I would be grateful to learn it, and I bet their students (at least the non-prejudiced ones) are too.",

For one thing, the English solution is a lot simpler than it is in Spanish, as you know.\n\nSecondly, even though a neutral pronoun is right, that doesn't mean it is commonly used in Spanish and hence practical for students. \n\nThirdly, neutral pronouns in Spanish encounter many grammatical difficulties, as you know: should they introduce their own articles, like \"*Tod@/e/xs*   *l@/e/xs* estudiantes\"? should they introduce new neutral nouns like \"*Tod@/e/xs*   *l@/e/xs* enfermer@/e/xs\"?\n\nLastly, you say Elle poses the least amount of issues as if this was a settled agreement for either native speakers or proponents of such changes. But that's not the case for either of them, in Argentina or elsewhere. The change may indeed happen, over many decades, and it may not take the form of \"Elle\".\n\nIt is one thing to push for needed changes in a language and another to use your students as a means to an end. Introducing words that are not really used in Spanish and collide with other grammatical rules (articles and gendered words) can be detrimental for your students.

Do you (either of you) know a non-binary Spanish speaker living in Argentina (or other Spanish speaking place)? Have you talked to them about it?\n\nLet's say I'm into skateboarding, am gay, and really like whisky. When I'm travelling, I'm going to encounter a lot more words that have to do with skaeboarding, lgbt+, and whisky than someone who thinks skateboarders are hooligans, is cishet, and a teetotaller. If I happen to have a family member in that place that's really into skateboarding or something, I may encounter some of those words, but it's not a guarantee, and it's not likely I'll remember them compared to words about stuff I care about.\n\nThere are a lot of ways gender and language interact. I know a lot of people who use different pronouns in different languages. Sometimes that's because the language doesn't have an easy 1:1 analogue with their identity, sometimes it's because language can be so culturally intrinsic that you gender manifests (hits different lol) in different languages. That doesn't mean a person who uses \"they\" in English and \"ella\" in Spanish is any less or more valid than someone who uses \"elle\". But there's no reason to withhold that option from people. If there's a nonbinary person in the Spanish class, and an option exists for them in the language (OP did not make \"elle\" up), why should that information (and the context around its use) be withheld?\n\nIt's also kind of off to present this as OP trying to cancel you or accuse you of being transphobic for innocently going about your day speaking your language, tbh. This is OP's thread. It's specifically about the transphobia they face in what I assume is an American school. Nobody accused you of transphobia, but tried to explain a perspective you admitted yourself was newer than your experience. (also, the \"changing the language we use takes effort and therefor we shouldn't\" argument underneath the joke at the end is tired enough to be r/badlinguistics bingo territory).",

You\u2019re making a lot of claims that are not substantiated in the literature or are exaggerating them, which doesn\u2019t help your cause. You deserve to use pronouns that you feel comfortable with, but you may as well stick to what the literature actually says. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referencing McCarthy (2007/2008) along with Battistella (1990) for defaults in Spanish. Neither concluded that learners are able to fully learn masculine but not feminine. If you actually read the papers, you see they over-rely on masculine, but it leads to error in agreement both for feminine and for masculine contexts. \n\nAlso, there is no \u201cneutral\u201d gender in Spanish. There\u2019s a neuter that exists for abstract nouns, but it is not neutral. I also think it is incredibly unlikely that what you are describing about a gender-neutral pronoun making learners sensitive to both masculine and feminine equally because, once again, if you read the founding articles on default morphology, you\u2019d realize that learners shouldn\u2019t be able to construct representations of the feature of gender in a second language - which includes neuter. I would be SO interested in seeing what methodology you used to determine that gender-neutral pronouns are turning over the current literature on its head. \n\nOnce again. It\u2019s not fair you have to defend your pronouns or how you\u2019d like to be treated by your colleagues, but don\u2019t make stuff up. \n\nI encourage anyone who is in academia to stick to facts rather than opinions because people who don\u2019t know better when it comes to linguistics aren\u2019t going to know that what you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t true.",

          "text": "Yet another linguist with a BA in Italianistics, these \"changes\" are not forced nor from the outside. They have been started by these language communities (I know Italian, French, and Spanish had these for a while now), and in fact English is a late adopter. But I'd say the sudden popularity of esp. singular they in English speaking (or mostly, writing) circles has brought visibility to all these attempts at removing or minimising grammatical gender. I think there are proposed forms for German too tho I do not know much about the rest of the scene. But forms like Italian \"stasera andremo da l* amic\\*\" are increasingly more visible and more frequented.\n\nHistorically speaking, English too had grammatical gender like Spanish, but except for pronouns, it's lost. Romance languages descend from Latin, which had a neuter gender, which has vanished. Many national languages, including Spanish, have government bodies that act upon them, sometimes making drastic changes, like in France or Turkey or Italy. And besides, communities deciding to change _huge_ swathes of their language are not uncommon. Language is something that changes all the time, that's normal and humans are well equipped to deal with that, in fact remarkably so. No language stays the same for decades or years even, let alone centuries. Written text and language standardisation creates a false impression that it's otherwise.\n\nWhen it comes to confusion there's no confusion at all. Many languages lack a distinction between you singular and you plural (e.g. English), many languages lack grammatical gender (e.g. Finnish, Turkish), many have an incredibly complex excess of it (I can't recall exact names but I'll mention a book for the curious in a bit). Language is a phenomenon that's filled to brim with ambiguity and mechanisms to resolve that ambiguity. If a change introduces ambiguity and complexity, it won't be too long that the speakers will innovate to make sure conventions and grammar if necessary is created to account for that.\n\nSo that's somewhat disorganised, but if anybody wants a glimpse of the huge variety of languages of the world, you could read Romaine's (2001) great book. It's one of those texts that while not being a sci-comm artefact, is beautiful and captivating and well-made enough to accomodate a complete beginner. After reading that you'll see that these changes are nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n- Romaine, Suzanne (2001). \"Language in Society: An Introduction to Sociolinguistics\". Oxford University Press. \n\n(P.S.: sorry, u/pettyprincesspeach, I kinda had a knee-jerk reaction and jumped at typing a reply without reading yours first, so I'm kinda reiterating what you said in your reply in a wordier way, but I thought I'd post it regardless in case u/Missapizza finds examples and the book recommendation interesting.)",

They would not argue that the name needs to be changed on all official platforms in order to address the student how they wish. As a cis person with a legal name that I never use outside of official paperwork, and a nickname that I have had since birth that is not an obvious derivative of my legal name, I can tell you that this is how it has always been from daycare through college graduation, and in the workplace. OP has already explained this to those involved, and they have chosen to continue disrespecting OP by using the wrong name and trying to enforce pronouns that are not appropriate for OP's gender identity. After polite attempts to educate these colleagues without success, it's time for the university and/or government to step in to protect OP from discrimination, which is what Title IX is for.",

I would argue that OP has been slighted 3 unrelated times, not a series of continued disrespect. \n\nFirst, we all know how hard it is to care about everyone you meet day to day. One day a coworker tells you they would like if you called them Bill instead of Will. Now a person might remember that/care but most people are occupied about themselves. We typically see this as a good thing, do we not? Most people don't care about their coworkers, or classmates in any personal sense. \n\nIf it's easy to forget someone's new name, why is someone's (for lack of better terms) 'new' gender? Because gender is more important than a name, or is it that is something we hold closer to our personal identity? No one is going to answer to their gender in a crowded room, they're going to respond to their name. If you're in the LGBTQ, I think you may hold gender closer to your person than cis people. We all have values we care about, to me the two incidences sound like a misalignment of values. The third seems the most abhorrent of the bunch, it sounds very childish.\n\nTitle IX is for when you've exhausted all routes of civility, you've said it yourself. Does civility mean one strike and you're out per person? Three strikes for a campus maybe? Its hard to say, but what I can say is this sounds like OP has *not* exhausted all forms of civility.  Title IX shouldn't be a cudgel we best people who don't capitulate to our whims, it should be treated as a shield to protect people from actual pieces of shit.",

I too am from a non-linguistics background (Italianistics), but y'know, people study to get into these programs, and if you're picking people who wouldn't know the very fundamentals of TGG, your admissions are reeeallly broken... Tho tbf it could also be a tactic to avoid difficult topics that he himself doesn't know. You start with the basics and barely scratch the surface of advanced stuff that you don't know well enough to teach, so at the end of the semester you've \"taught\", tho nobody has learned anything new...\n\nIn any case, I hope you'll soon find a nice place to do science without miserable humans like these! And I hope, if you escalate and seek for justice, you'll be successful! Academia needs to be rinsed clean of people like this, it's a terrible kyriarchy.\n\nP.S.: PotS and similar biological arguments are [somewhat shaky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_of_the_stimulus#Criticism) anyways. My thesis is on phonology, but for the rest of my studies I wish to do usage based grammars too because post TGG grammar studies are _very_ exciting stuff.",

I do want to really reiterate that using neutral pronouns is not confusing.\n\nIs there an equity / inclusion office at your school? You may be able to submit a report without your name explicitly attached to it (though I imagine people may know and you may still experience the backlash you're afraid of).\n\nWhat year are you in? When will you be applying to PhD programs? Will you be looking at *different* programs? Ultimately, it only takes 2 or 3 relationships with professors to write recommendation letters. Do you think you could maintain good relationships with some faculty after submitting a report?",
