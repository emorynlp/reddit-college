  "text": "This is coming from someone who essentially just lost 3 years of data after their work computer crashed. \n\nAbout a week ago the power was shut off in my lab building and when the power was turned back on my computer wasn\u2019t turning on properly. Our IT department took the computer to reboot it. Our computers are supposed to have automatic backups but I told them to back the computer again b/c I am paranoid that the backup wasn\u2019t up to date. \nGot the computer back on Friday and nothing was backed up. Apparently backup that was set up on my computer was just backing up install files IT set up and the person in charge of backing up my computer was some part-time/intern who didn\u2019t back everything up before wiping my computer. Going to talk to IT on Monday but they already warned me that its 99% certain everything is gone. \nI have already have had super low motivation to do anything and this is just another major setback that has me really questioning if I should even stay in school.",

      "text": "I agree with others who are skeptical of your IT department. I had an old Dell several years ago, and it straight up died and I don't know what was wrong with it. I ended up having a date with this guy who was super into computers and just made an offhand comment about my computer and he told me he could take a look. Long story short, he was able to take out the hard drive and transfer everything to an external hard drive. I didn't really have anything backed up, it was just saved on the hard drive. \n\nI would definitely get it looked at elsewhere. If someone else was able to fix it, I'd probably contact the IT department to let them know, because it's something they'd need to be aware of so they don't end up misinforming other people. \n\nIn a comment, you mentioned that the computer is university property and IT folks are the only ones allowed to look at it. I agree with others' suggestions to go over their head and keep asking to speak to a supervisor until you get the very last person in the chain if need be (I'd also loop in your supervisor and/or department chair since this is a broader issue and may impact others). In the meantime, is there really any harm in getting a *consultation* from elsewhere? Your IT folks told you there was a \"99%\" chance the data is not recoverable (which, btw, I tend to interpret figures like that more along the lines of 'I don't know how' or 'I could, but I'm too lazy'), but if there was someone else who told you it was a 40% chance the data could be recovered, maybe it's worthwhile to have a discussion and let them know what the IT people did/said.",

All of my work is backed up in the cloud, on an external drive in my office, and on my home server as well as being on my laptop.\n\nAnother issue some colleagues at public institutions have encountered: subpoenas!

If the data is THAT important, which it clearly sounds like, then immediately go over the IT departments head and speak with either the director of the IT department AND (AAANNNDDD) the head of your department/lab.\n\nFight for this because, at the end of the day, you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s going to get screwed if it\u2019s truly gone.\n\nTips...\n\nA) write down the situation, like you did here, but much more robust. This will help to consolidate your thoughts and make your discussion with the Heads more persuasive (this is doubly important if you\u2019re emotionally frazzled b/c that will impact your thinking during the discussion).\n\nB) clearly state the reasons why the IT department shouldn\u2019t deal with it (e.g. their clearly demonstrated negligence so far). This, combined with (A) is why you should have *profession* services look at it.\n\nC) the IT head will, almost assuredly, not allow you to take the computer to professional services, so what we\u2019ve done is clearly demonstrated liability on IT for your personal loss. If this is a clear mistake on their part and it directly impacts your graduation, time in grad school, potential damages to your research progress / reputation, then this is a very clear case for a lawsuit (or, at least, compensation by the university for personal damages). This will allow you to basically hold them accountable because now they have had the argument for professional services presented, the reasoning for not doing it in-house, and the potential personal impact explicitly stated. That means that if they screw it up in-house, it was a conscious choice that led to it; ergo, they are now at fault for damages to you. Whether this goes anywhere or not is unknown, but it\u2019s definitely a good setup for getting everyone to take it seriously and try their best to get your data back.\n\nI\u2019m really not kidding. 3 years of data going away due to someone else\u2019s negligence against written protocol and impacting your degree, job prospects, research reputation, etc. is the entire reason why lawsuits exist and is what defines personal damages.\n\nIdk what kind of person you are, but this isn\u2019t a small thing, so, seriously, fight for it.\n\nYou got it bro!\n\nGood luck!!!",

This way they can quickly access them without scanning the drive looking for them all the time. When a file is deleted, all that happens is the entry in the index is removed, to indicate that it's unused space that can be written over. But if you haven't written over it, the actual data is still on the disk and can be recovered. So if you ever accidentally deleted something you really need back, pull the power cord -- don't go though the shutdown process, actually just yank the power cord from the wall to immediately kill the system and give you the best chance at data recovery. The operating system is constantly making small writes for logs and other stuff, so if you shutdown normally or just leave it running, the chances of recovery go down. Therefore, yank the power cable, and bring the disk to a data recovery service.",

They say they have for example 100G of space, but they actually have say 101G and an onboard controller that maps the incoming data address to the actual physical location. That extra G copies frequently accessed data so that if the main sector holding it dies or wears out, it can use the copy. This allows the disk to appear to last longer than it actually physically is, because the computer knows nothing about this. It's actual firmware in the disk itself doing this.
