  "title:": "Got into the only place I interviewed at!",
  "text": "Today I got accepted into the only PhD program I interviewed at! I interviewed last month and at the end of the day they said people would hear back in a week. Previous students also mentioned throughout the day that a lot of them heard back the next day. Needless to say, after 2 weeks of radio silence, I accepted my fate that I would not be going to grad school in the fall. I actually started revamping my resume to try to get a lab tech position until I could reapply. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, this morning, I oddly couldn't sleep and woke up at around 7:30 to some loud ass bird screaming outside my window. I roll over to grab my phone and as I pick it up it pings with the acceptance email. \n\nI shit you not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so happy! My stats weren't that great but I've had 4 years of research experience so that definitely helped.",
