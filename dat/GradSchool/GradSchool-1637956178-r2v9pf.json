  "text": "First year grad student and I struggle to do the advanced tasks in the shared offices. The offices are very chatty with a lot of gossip and collaborating on projects. It is really distracting to me. There's also construction in the adjacent building which is a lot. Earlier this week they were welding pieces directly outside of my window as a part of construction.\n\nI have been managing this by not doing intensive work (problem sets, studying) until leaving for the day but that is stupid since I should be able to work in my office space to do the nitty gritty work.\n\nI have tried to manage this by going to the library or another space, headphones, and noise cancelling headphones. I dont really like any of these options. If I go to the library then someone will call me that I need to come to the office because my PI wants to see me, if I play music than it distracts me, and if I play noise cancelling headphones it helps but its still something I am \"listening to\".\n\nIn private I navigate this by wearing earplugs and they do help a lot. I feel a lot calmer when I wear them. It crossed my mind today that maybe I could be allowed to wear them on campus? I'm not sure if my peers would make fun of me for it. I dont want to get made fun of but I think it would help with my productivity?\n\nAlso, I have been diagnosed with autism but dont want to bring it up at grad school because I dont want people to be weird about it. Its not something I really bring up? And I don't think accomodations exist in grad school. So I dont really know what to do. I think if I wear earplugs around it will be super obvious that I'm autistic. I dont want the attention of it.\n\nETA: I also dont like earmuffs because they feel too tight on my ears. I dont like the pressure.  I have tried them before and they bother me. ",

      "text": "Accommodations absolutely should exist in grad school and if they can be made you should pursue them if it helps you. I don't think anyone will mind you wearing earplugs, it's functionally the same as noise-canceling headphones. I don't like noise-canceling headphones because they tend to be big and heavy on my head, earplugs are much smaller and less uncomfortable for extended periods of time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually, even if someone does care that you wear earplugs, who gives a shit? That person is daft and you can probably just disregard their input because they have the cognitive capacity of a sandcrab.",

      "text": "i don't think at this stage in the game anyone should be making fun of you for wearing earplugs. many wireless earbuds these days look like earplugs imo, and people wear wireless ear buds literally 24/7 on my campus! this brand i feel looks a lot like a wireless earbud that i see some people in my lab wear: [loop ear plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Loop-Quiet-Noise-Reduction-Earplugs/dp/B08MFH1TTJ/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?crid=3HH0A0K1CSSK1&cv_ct_cx=earplugs%2Bwith%2Bcord&keywords=earplugs%2Bwith%2Bcord&pd_rd_i=B08MFH1TTJ&pd_rd_r=dd84d188-592c-4cfc-9099-954df120cf75&pd_rd_w=c8SIj&pd_rd_wg=U64A7&pf_rd_p=fb401969-1dca-4736-bb17-fd1d356224ef&pf_rd_r=S45VNSWHK108PBGQX8G1&qid=1637962718&sprefix=earplugs%2Caps%2C267&sr=1-2-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVVUyTktaNlVYTEczJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDA5Nzc5MUU5NlQ1RDVJS0ZaWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODMzNDM1MVI5OFhaMjVQV0MxOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1). also, if you get earplugs with a chord connecting them, that could possible enhance the wireless earbud look (i have a pair of earbuds that look like these earplugs: [wired ear plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Waterproof-Reusable-Protection-Earplugs/dp/B07DTZ6X63/ref=sr_1_11?crid=3HH0A0K1CSSK1&keywords=earplugs%2Bwith%2Bcord&qid=1637962718&qsid=137-4215482-0427124&sprefix=earplugs%2Caps%2C267&sr=8-11&sres=B0017JIT4C%2CB00284DIPK%2CB000E2609Y%2CB077G2NR4J%2CB07NKVXSLP%2CB000DZF7T6%2CB07DTZ6X63%2CB0936CY7CR%2CB081ZYRW99%2CB08PBQFQH6%2CB07528L3ZY%2CB07S7DMXG5%2CB07Y1C5SGZ%2CB0037F92RC%2CB07J5FBDMC%2CB07B7J9XTV%2CB00GD8YCT8%2CB071ZGBL93%2CB0017JNYR4%2CB07W4J6F3D&srpt=EARPLUG&th=1)) i also know there are some wireless earbuds that have noise cancelling capabilities (some models of air pods have this i believe?) if you don't mind paying a lot and want them to blend in even more. \n\ni don't think you should need an accommodation to wear earplugs around the office but if you're concerned about it, definitely contact your universities office for disability services because accommodations definitely still exist for phd students and if you would like accommodations for your classes you have a right to them. \n\ni do not think if you wear ear plugs around it will be super obvious that you are autistic, most people won't even notice because so many people wear wireless earbuds around all the time now. half of the people in my lab keep their wireless earbuds in all day, even while having conversations, etc.",

I think accommodations should absolutely be met in your case. \n\nAlso, I don't think using earplugs will be a big deal to anyone. If someone asks, just say that they help you focus. I think anyone would understand that and even say \"that's smart! I might try that too.\"\n\nDo what you have to, don't be concerned about what other people think/say.",
