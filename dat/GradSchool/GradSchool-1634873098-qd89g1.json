  "text": "Hello. I am looking for an advice.\n\nI found out that one of my committee members lost a relative a few days ago, but not directly from the person. The professor did not show any signs of the loss and it came up when I was having a conversation with my advisor. It is my first time having someone lose their relative in the gradaute school and don't really know what to do. I'm currently in the US, but as an international student, I'm not accustomed to the courtesy.\n\nAny advice or tips that I should do? I do not take the professor's class or anything, but will be in touch eventually this semester.",
