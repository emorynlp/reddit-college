  "text": "Hi Hello! I am in a bit of a cluster and very much in need of someone's help! My thesis finally got accepted! I now have to make a presentation and have an oral defense. My teacher said to invite the company I \"worked\" for if they would like to attend the presentation. \n\nUnfortunately, the company and I have parted ways in an awkward way. We did not have a contact for 2 months and I finished my thesis without their help. Yet, my school wants me to invite them because it only seems fair/reasonable to have them there, to a thesis that is about them. But because it is an option and not mandatory to have them present, I would rather **not**. I am so insecure about having the company there that I would fear failing my presentation and oral defense because me and the company are not in the best relationship... why? I promised the company to deliver the report/thesis in August, and it is now November. So for the companies side, I am too late, and they already have given me the cold shoulder.\n\nHow do I politely write in a mail to my teacher I rather not have them there without sounding like a little child? Just inviting them doesn't sound that bad, right? But I am shaking already just with the thought of them having there and I would rather not because it is an option and declining my teacher in a blunt way makes me feel like he would get suspicious. And I am finally at the end of my studies I just want everything to go smoothly...",

If your advisor is indicated you're ready for defense, then I wouldn't worry about that.\n\nAnd if you're former employer asks some awkward questions, that's not going to change the dissertation committee's mind.\n\nOn the other hand, inviting them, might possibly rebuild that bridge you feel you've burned.",

      "text": "Under NO circumstances should you NOT invite representatives from the company. Regardless of your relationship, you were once in good professional standing with them. Although they may consider your work being late, the act of not inviting the company will reflect negatively on you since your thesis involves them. You should extend your invitation fully acknowledging that your work is late and despite you not being in contact, they are still welcome to attend. This indicates to the company that you are self-aware of your mistake but you are willing to re-establish some form of communication with individuals there. If they chose to ignore the invitation, that can negatively reflect on them rather than you. You would've done your part: you extended your invitation, you cannot control how the company will react. However, you should email your professor or advisor and indicate the change in relationship between you and the company, highlighting that you feel bad about submitting the thesis late but you feel it's polite to invite them. That will help make them more aware of your situation.",

      "text": "You mentioned delivering the thesis, which seems like a different arrangement than a summer internship or similar.\n\nIs the company funding your graduate work? If so, I would probably bite the bullet and invite. Especially since it seems like procrastination on your end that caused the rift. (Which I totally sympathize with, I'm procrastinating with this comment on a paper that's past due right now.)\n\nIf they aren't funding you, I probably just wouldn't invite depending on how authoritatively the school said it.",

If not, you can just nod, agree, not send the invite at all and then tell after you presentation that no one was able to attend. If you're that anxious about it, try not to bring attention to it.\n\nAnd yes, I'm giving this kind of advice because that's exactly what I would do :D I'm terribly anxious and cannot deal with those situations at all.",
