  "text": "Can someone please explain to me what the GEM fellowship actually is? \n\nI am a second year neuroscience PhD student at Brown University and I am thinking of applying to the  but I can't even tell if I am eligible because of the wording. Brown is listed as one of the member universities. But currently my tuition/stipend is coming from my PI. Am I eligible even though I am now a second year? Would Brown start paying my tuition/stipend instead of my PI or would GEM pay? Where would I do the summer internship, at Brown?\n\nAlso, is anyone having a hard time getting past the contract initials page of the application?\n\nsuch confusion :/",

      "text": "I do not have direct experience with GEM, but I would say I'm decent at interpreting fellowship terms. \n\nIt doesn't seem like you would be eligible to apply at all; the fellowship is targeted at students currently applying for (or admitted to, but taking a gap year before matriculating) PhD programs. There's no provision for current PhD students to apply, unless you're looking to master out of your program and apply to start a new PhD program elsewhere.\n\nThat aside, GEM has two tracks of PhD fellowships: \"employer fellows\" and \"university/associate fellows\", which have different terms. GEM selects a pool of fellows, after which they try to match with \"employer members\". Those selected as those \"employer fellow\" do an internship with their respective sponsor employer, who will contribute to the stipend for the first year only. If you are chosen as a fellow but not an employer fellow, then there is not internship obligation and the university instead guarantees 5 years of funding... somehow. That can be through your advisor's continued support, but can also be assistantships or outright grants.",
