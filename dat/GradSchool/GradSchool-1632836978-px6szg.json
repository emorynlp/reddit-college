  "title:": "As a PhD student, can I address my soon-to-be advisor by first name in email?",
  "text": "I need to send a casual email to my two future advisors letting them know that I am not reachable on my cell phone for the time being. One of the future advisors is a postdoc who I always call by his first name. The other is a full professor who I don't know as well, but he has always signed his emails to me with a nickname version of his first name (it's not a preset signature).\n\nI feel like its weird to write an email  to both of them saying \"Hi Prof. (last name) and (postdoc's first name)\", but I am nervous about calling the professor by a shortened version of his first name (I have never seen him use his full first name so I don't want to do that either)  without being explicitly invited to do so. Opinions?\n\nETA: I am in Austria, where formal titles are a big deal, but my previous advisor seemed almost annoyed with me when he had to explicitly ask me to call him by his first name.\n\nETA2: Haha I went with the safe option and just sent him a separate email where I addressed him as Prof. X, and he signed his response with only the first two letters of his first name. What does it mean?? ",

      "text": "Yes, titles in Austria are quite big, however, it really depends on the individual person if they insist on being called \"Prof, Dr,..\" as well as on the language you're communicating in.\n\nIf you're communicating in German it's a tough question since a lot of Profs are referred to by \"Prof/Dr\" (always use highest title though), as well as with \"Sie\", unless they tell you otherwise.\n\nIn some groups it's common to call each other by the first name but still use \"Sie\".\n\nIf you're communicating in English, I'd say it's more of a grey area. But if he already signs his emails with his first name, my Austrian gut tells me it's okay to address him like that.\n\nMy best guess: If he signs all his Emails with his first name, he is okay with being addressed that way. If you're unsure you can still ask his other PhD students or Postdocs how they handled it.",

In practice, after they\u2019ve written their first paper, or they have been advanced to PhD candidacy, whichever happens sooner.\n\nI think it would be a bit presumptuous to address a professor you don\u2019t already know well by their first name, and I think it would be an incredibly bad idea to do that, particularly in Austria. In the situation you mentioned, I would refer to both the professor and postdoc formally in emails to the both of them.",

I've only met the professor a few times but he is also young and quite casual and has never signed an email to me with anything other than shortened versions of his first name (sometimes just first letter, or first two letters). We also have each others personal phone numbers already, which is why I needed to write the email in the first place, so it just feels odd to continue referring to him as Prof. X (although that is what I ended up doing here, to be safe). \n\nMy experience in Austria is that the formal titles are a big deal but as soon as you are a doctoral candidate (thus staff at the university) you are considered a colleague, and professors can be annoyed when you address them formally... or at least that's how it was with my previous advisor (who was much older and more formal)",

They earned the title Prof. so that\u2019s what you should call them when using a title. I had no idea. But, that being said, every professor (in Chemistry in the US at least) will say that grad students and postdocs (and undergrads in a research setting not a class) should call them by their first name. There are even some professors who get very annoyed if you don\u2019t use their first name and use their title. Once you\u2019re doing research with someone you become their peer, and you address them as such.",
