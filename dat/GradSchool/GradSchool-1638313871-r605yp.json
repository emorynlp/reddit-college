  "title:": "Afraid I\u2019m failing at my first lab rotation: advice?",
  "text": "I\u2019m starting a PhD program and struggling to even know if I\u2019m doing okay. We have 3 lab rotations, each 10 weeks long to do while we are taking classes the first year. So far my classes are going fine, and I spend a decent chunk of my time outside class in the lab to work on my rotation project (~50 hours per week physically in lab not including reading/writing up results from home). \n\nHowever, I only have a few experiments worth of presentable data so far. Most of my experiments involve multiple days worth of effort since I\u2019m working with living cells, so when one fails that can set me back almost a week. It\u2019s a very small lab, so I have my own project and am not assigned to a current grad student or postdoc. I do ask for help when I don\u2019t know where reagents are kept or am uncertain how to do a technique or use equipment, but I worry that people get frustrated since I\u2019m not directly helping with their research projects, and tbh I\u2019m often at lab much longer/later than the other people in the lab because I also usually have to spend 2-3 hours per day in class. So sometimes things don\u2019t go well, or are delayed because I can\u2019t find something and there\u2019s no one to ask\u2026 finally, one of the things I\u2019m working on is a somewhat complicated cloning project that won\u2019t directly produce data. Rather it\u2019s to make a better model system for future experiments. \n\nThe PI is great, provides helpful scientific feedback and meets with me once a week one on one. But she is busy and not always around outside those times. She hasn\u2019t said I\u2019m doing poorly, but I\u2019m afraid she wouldn\u2019t unless it were really bad? I know I could directly ask her if I\u2019m doing okay, but I\u2019m terrified to do so (not her fault as she\u2019s very nice, but this kind of thing scares me). I also am exhausted, already have very little time to sleep or do anything fun and don\u2019t know how much more time and effort I can sustainably devote to this.\n\nBottom line being I\u2019m worried that my rotation presentation at the end of the quarter will make it seem like I did nothing and that this will reflect poorly on me. I\u2019m not sure how much data I am expected to have accumulated in such a short time frame but I\u2019m very concerned that what I have is not enough. \n\nDo any current or prior grad students have advice on dealing with this issue practically and/or emotionally? Am I worrying for no reason? Is my unwillingness to devote over 70 hours  a week to grad school a sign that this isn\u2019t for me? What were the expectations for your lab rotations and did you find you needed to be very direct to get feedback on your performance?",

I think some students with very thick skins can handle that kind of pressure, but many of us just find it paralyzing.",

      "text": "Tbh if you're spending \\~50 hrs a week on a rotation research project, I would think that you'd have made quite a decent amount of progress. If your rotation advisor doesn't agree, I would really suggest you look elsewhere for an advisor (I know this is hard advice, but I'm giving it because I didn't listen the first time around. Only now, after \\~2 yrs with my current lab, do I feel like I've begun to adjust to my advisor's style)\n\nFor your rotation presentation, it really won't matter much in the  grand scheme of things. I would recommend you just do your best to present your progress in the best light. Maybe focus on the difficulties of the problem you are trying to solve instead of your current solution (assuming your current solution isn't working all that well). Maybe present all of the various methods that you have tried or experiments that you've run. It's mostly story telling, so try your best to create a narrative around your research project",

          "text": "This is true, I\u2019ve certainly done a lot it\u2019s just that only about half of it has worked. My presentation is only supposed to be 10-12min with 3-5min for questions, so I think with background, next steps and explanations of troubleshooting I can fill that time even if I only have a couple slides of actual data. \n\nAnd yes, I\u2019m trying to remind myself that if my rotation advisor expects more effort than I\u2019m currently capable of giving, it\u2019s probably not a lab I want to spend the next several years of my life in. Thanks for the hard advice because I need to hear it!",

      "text": "Hi there, I\u2019m sorry to hear about this stressful situation! I think it is worth chatting with your PI about their expectations for rotating students. I know PIs are very intimidating, but I think it\u2019s worth finding out how yours communicates about expectations. Would you feel comfortable asking how they imagine the scale of a rotation project, or whether they have suggestions for improvement for you? I say all this because my experience with rotations has been quite a bit different - my rotation PIs and others in\n my program have emphasized that rotations are mostly for me to get a better understanding of the lab, with no expectations of me showing up >=40 hours or successfully getting data. In my first rotation I didn\u2019t get anything close to publishable data and basically gave an end-of-rotation presentation on all the experimental issues I was grappling with, but the PI still said my rotation was \u201csuccessful\u201d because I learned common techniques used in the lab and gained a deeper understanding of my study system. I also think people do understand that rotation students need lots of help (though I also find it awkward to ask for help and of course grad students have varying personalities and willingness to help). I know other programs and labs might have very different cultures that don\u2019t gel with my PIs\u2019 \u201cit\u2019s just a rotation project\u201d way of thinking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be terrible.",

          "text": "That makes a lot of sense, and I agree I probably need to just work up the courage to ask her! I think part of the confusion is that my project is not really rotation-sized. While it\u2019s the kind of thing where I can certainly get data during a rotation time span, the project is more like at least one solid paper in scope. It has also sort of gotten bigger as my rotation went along because a few new papers on related topics came out giving us some new ideas, and we started a collaboration with another lab to try additional experiments. The PI almost certainly will be continuing with it after my rotation because the early results are promising, though it\u2019s unclear who specifically will take over from me.\n\nSo in lab meetings and stuff we discuss a lot of ideas for experiments and next steps for the project, but I\u2019m not sure how many of these I\u2019m actually expected to accomplish during the rotation. Hopefully not all, because then she\u2019s in for quite a disappointment :/  I\u2019m glad to hear that in your program just making the effort to learn and getting to know the lab was enough! I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s similar for me and getting lots of good data is more like a bonus if it happens.",
