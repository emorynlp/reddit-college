  "title:": "Do you ever worry that grad school is just a way to delay really figuring out your career choice and finding a job you love?",
  "text": "I had an appointment with my therapist today, and I was talking about how I just keep procrastinating on one course in particular. I\u2019ve always been a procrastinator, but this time it\u2019s really bad, and I\u2019ve turned in two assignments late. He asked me, \u201cDo you really want to be there? It sounds like you might not.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if perhaps this degree program is something I took on because I\u2019m not sure what I want to do in \u201creal life.\u201d Almost like being in grad school is a delay in figuring out what I want to do and how to actually get there. \n\nHave you ever had to sit down and really consider why you\u2019re there? Assess whether you\u2019re really doing something you need to be doing? I\u2019m having a really hard time to determine whether my thoughts or leaving the program are just a way of self-sabotaging because the one course is incredibly hard, or if it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t want to be there for more valid reasons and it\u2019s best to leave. What have you analyzed in your own thinking and career if you\u2019ve considered whether getting your degree is worth it?\n\nTl;dr: Have you ever felt the need to consider if grad school is a crutch to lean on instead of really starting your career?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for offering your thoughts and sharing your experiences. I had a tough day yesterday, so it\u2019s nice to feel support from people in similar environments. It seems other people are considering questions like my own, so I hope others have gained value from this like I have. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll stay the course, but I\u2019ll do my best for the rest of the semester and see how I feel about this all in May.",

It took me forever to get my BA and when it was close to ending I was like \"wtf am I going to do now?\" I didn't feel like I learned enough to make me a professional. Masters are more useful in my field in the social sciences so I applied to the graduate program in the same school. My program is supposed to be 3 years but covid kind of extended it since certain classes had been cancelled, thesis also delayed. I still don't feel like I'm good enough to call myself an anthropologist or archaeologist. I love the field I'm studying in but I know for a fact that I only went to grad school to delay going into the real world.  Being in school means I don't have to worry about finding a job, my parents are glad to support me so that I can get my degree. I'm honestly glad that I got delayed by a year cuz I can't imagine looking for a job right now. \n\nI've started seeing a therapist though since I've always been depressed and that's probably one of the reasons. I am so overwhelmed with just surviving day to day that it's hard to think about the future and actually apply myself. I'm hoping that working on my mental health will help with attain the kind of career I'll enjoy or at least be good at and stop having to rely on parents",

Now that I have treatment through medication and therapy, I'm working on developing the skills necessary to make that structure for myself. \n\nGrad school is maybe the best time to do this (if you were diagnosed as an adult and had no other opportunities for treatment until now lol) bc of all the resources universities provide. Therapy, psychiatry, accessibility services where you can often work with an academic coach to learn how to manage your symptoms.\n\nThat said, I still love my field of study and  knew since undergrad I wanted to eventually conduct research. But having that opportunity materialize without knowing how to actually self-direct and manage my time made it overwhelming, and I questioned whether my ambitions were sincere or not. \n\nI don't know if you have adhd, and I don't know how passionate you feel about your field.

      "text": "Bachelor's is useless for my field. Only viable option for me is to transfer to business after my undergrad and work up the corporate ladder. Not a bad option, but I know I won't be passionate at all about my work. No hate on business, a typical 9-5 desk job is just not for me. \n\nSo, PhD is actually a very productive use of my time given my life goals and passions. Sure, I could probably make more money if I chose another career path but the program I'm in and the experiences I gain should make way for a six figure job or just under that straight out of graduation if I play my cards right. If I look at others at that age, I'll probably be making just as much as them in 5 years, but I'll hopefully be in a career I love with tons of upwards mobility because, well, I would have a PhD.\n\nA lot of people don't \"figure out\" their career goals so early on in life anyways. All those business and engineering grads that flaunt their entry level salaries often find that there's a lot more learning and discovering to do until they find themselves in a position they truly love. For example, tons of business grads end up doing an MBA somewhere down the line, which is an extra 2 years of school anyways. Or they find themselves wanting to switch fields from say consulting to finance. Very rarely do students straight out of undergrad find themselves on a career path they'll stick with their entire life. \n\nIn fact, statistics show that the average person changes career 5-7 times during their working life. I would wager that number is significantly lower for people that do graduate school or professional school, because time in these programs narrows down your career goals significantly. \n\nSo never feel bad that you're \"delaying\" the career you love by doing graduate school. Be confident that grad school is going to take you places you can't reach with any other degree. Pursue your studies with a general idea of where you wanna be by graduation and be confident in yourself.",

It is a moving target. Feelings of \"this is who I am\" are typically only true in that moment. Like opinions about everything, they change over time.

It's not that I hate the subject, I just feel like I used it as a very expensive life raft and I feel no closer to understanding exactly what I want to be doing. It doesn't help that the few people I know who went to grad school cannot even remotely relate because grad school was always their calling. One friend of mine said it was the best time of her life. I can't help but wonder if I had just applied to more jobs or tried to network or something if I would be in a better place than I am right now.",

I would personally get very angry at my therapist to suggest something like that implying that she knows me better than me.

Answering \u201cDo you want to do the intense, time-consuming thing that you are struggling to do?\u201d seems like step one for someone figuring shit out. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re on the wrong path if they can\u2019t answer with certainty, but it is worth careful consideration until they find their own answer. Because if someone actually doesn\u2019t want to be doing what they\u2019re doing, then no amount of coping strategies or therapy will be effective.

So I figured grad school wasn't an option. \n\nI got a job out of state, quit after two years. Then another job, quit after another two. Both times it felt like I just wasn't really being challenged, wasn't achieving my potential. Living for a paycheck without ever feeling accomplished.\n\nThen I did a Master's, loved research, and went for the PhD. Not because I want to be a Prof. But partly because I have something to prove to myself.\n\nYet here I am, one year into covid, looking for every angle possible to finish asap. I still love Research, but I no longer think it's what I'll do for the rest of my life. I couldn't have known that without taking this step.",
