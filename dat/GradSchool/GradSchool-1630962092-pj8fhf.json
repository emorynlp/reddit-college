      "text": "I like using an iPad to read! Hand writing notes directly on papers is much easier for me than typing them, and I prefer not to waste so much paper printing them out. \nI have used Onenote, and you can also take notes on the built in PDF viewer on iPad. I\u2019m waiting for the zotero app to get out of beta as well. I think it\u2019s primarily a matter of preference which app you use, onenote worked for me because my school uses outlook for email so everything was connected.",
