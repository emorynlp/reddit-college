  "text": "I actually like my advisor very much and we have a good working relationship, but lwhenever I get an email from her it usually means either 1) she wants to meet to talk about progress or 2) she just finished editing a draft of something and I\u2019m about to open a Word doc with a ton of revisions I now have to work on. Both scenarios are extremely anxiety inducing to me and now after a couple years into my PhD I\u2019ve developed a somewhat irrational immediate panic response whenever I see she\u2019s emailed me lol \nAnyone else relate?",

If it's during work hours, I don't mind, but my advisor tends to wake up and work a lot earlier than me, so she'll send emails to me before I've woken up. For a long time, her email would be the first thing I would see when I woke up, even if I was just trying to check the clock to see how much more time until my alarm is supposed to go off. It would fill me with anxiety and immediately wake me up, which made me lose a bit of sleep too. I had enough after a while, and I finally got an app to block notifications from Gmail in specific chunks of time (night time, mornings before I've woken, and weekends).",

      "text": "Yes! Around the end of year 3 I found that I was experiencing massive mood swings tied to phone notifications for work-related emails. Just seeing the name of my advisor or a committee member pop up when hanging out with friends would give me this crazy anxiety that I shouldn't be relaxing and had to get back to work. This is despite having extremely good relationships with my advisor and committee members.\n\nMy solution was to adopt [Quiet for Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sgarcia.quiet_for_gmail&hl=en_US). I set it up so I don't receive email push notifications except from 9a-5p on weekdays. I can still check my emails manually, but it allows me to relax when I want to relax without intrusions from work emails that might send me into a panic spiral. I still get some anxiety when I check my email, but at least I get to put myself into the right mindset before approaching it.",
