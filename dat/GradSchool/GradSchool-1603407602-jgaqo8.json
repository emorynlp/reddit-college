  "text": "I\u2019ve had my bachelor\u2019s for 10 years now and haven\u2019t ever really thought about going back to school for my Master\u2019s till now but stagnation and limited career opportunities in my current profession have pushed me over the edge to apply and I got my acceptance letter today! I\u2019ve been on edge for the past month waiting to hear back because my undergrad gpa was less than stellar and now I feel like a weight has been lifted! I\u2019m honestly over the moon and I don\u2019t have too many friends or family to share with today so I wanted to share with some folks who might appreciate!!!\n\nEdit: Several have asked; I\u2019ll be attending the University of Alabama pursuing my MA in Instructional Technology!",
