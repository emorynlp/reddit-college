  "text": "Just wanna share. I'm excited about this decision. I don't regret coming to get my PhD but i've definitely realized this is not for me. I don't enjoy it enough and it's been eating away at me. I'm qualifying this year so I'll be ABD. Not telling anyone yet, but I'm gonna start looking for jobs this year. It's a scary decision but I'm so excited. Only issue rn is I have no desire to work ever since I've decided to do this lol. But I do want to qualify at least. Overall just feels so gooooood to know this is not a life sentence and I am not gonna keep feeling this way for the next 3-4 years and then for the rest of my career.",
