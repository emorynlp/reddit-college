  "text": "I have my proposal defense tomorrow and I feel absolutely terrible about it. My committee is going to absolutely tear me a new one. Which annoys me because aren't they there to help me and better my proposal to make it better? I think it annoys my advisor when she has to help me and thinks of me as a lost cause. My anxiety does not let me sleep well and sometimes it just makes me want to walk away from this whole experience. Is this really worth it? I tell myself it is because I am sure I would run into similar situations in the workforce like toxic supervisors, difficult work, etc. but damn this *sucks*.\n\nEDIT: I passed!!! With a few contingencies in regards to statistics and refining a chapter. But I passed!!",

If so, and they were positive about it, then the defense is were they'll offer further critique to help you improve your dissertation.\n\nSo they aren't there to attack you.",

      "text": "I know this probably doesn't help much, but what you are feeling now is quite normal for grad students. Are you in a PhD or masters program? What field? \n\nHonestly, just the fact that you are worried sort of signals to me that you will get through this okay. From my experience in my program (PhD, genetics), the people who failed these type of defenses were the ones that got cocky - they didn't see it coming. You seemed like you have some humility going for you. \n\nWhen you wake up, do whatever it is that makes you most comfortable. Light breakfast, Coffee, meditate, whatever. You've put in a lot of effort I'm sure and at this point you just have to let the cards fall as they are - if you can achieve this mindset, it may make your defense a little easier. \n\nAbout your committee....yea I know what you mean, but it also sounds like perhaps you are reading too much into their motivations. For them, this is their job, and if there is that type of professor that tears proposals apart, try not to let it get to you, they are just trying to fulfill their little duties and it isn't personal. \n\nSince this is your proposal defense, you shouldn't be expected to 'know it all'. If you get caught up in a question or a conversation that you feel is over your head, don't be afraid to think for a moment and articulate --- what you know, what you don't know, perhaps how you might approach something had you known X, etc. The point of this day (at least in my field) is go test your thinking/breadth of knowledge....not so much the nitty gritty that your final dissertation will become. \n\nGood luck. Please come back and let us know how it went.\n\nEdit: oh and your comment about work environments. It's really hit or miss. My grad experience was like yours it sounds like. For me, 6 hears of straight he'll. With some elbow grease and determination, your hide may thicken A LOT. Now I'm in the private sector, biotech, and although I'm two years out of school, it's almost hard to believe that I actually went through that BS and survived. You're doing it dude! Don't stop. In only a matter of hours this will be behind you.\n\nEdit2: oh and one other thing, make sure you take full advantage of mental health services, at least as much as possible. Only a little effort on that front may help a lot as well with with anxiety. In my case, I started getting help for depression and anxiety and my doctor even prescribed me medication FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING. I am not saying you need this, but just know real solutions are out there, cognitive/behavioral or otherwise.",

              "text": "NICE! I see your update. In hindsight, how do how do feel about your group of advisors now? \n\nI know you didn't ask for this advice, but if I were you, starting now if you already haven't, I would start establishing 1:1 relationships with each and every one of your advisors. In particular, don't have a committee where you simply see the other members only during your formal meetings. Do this even if you have to schedule random little meetings with them at their office/Zoom - get advice perhaps on portions of your project that are particularly THEIR wheelhouse. \n\nSo yea, you didn't ask for that, but for my anecdote, I in particular had one of those occasionally \"psycho\" advisors that always had drama with their student when they approached graduation. On the later end I realized this might be a huge problem to not be backed up by my committee, so I started making these connections (plus with the grad coordinator and the grad director). It was one of the best decisions I made because I truly think it made the difference  between me getting my PhD or getting a Masters at hour 11, 6th year. They all went to bat for me because they knew me.",

The most important thing I learned from my therapist was that even if I can't prove that I will be a tremendous success, I also can't prove I will be a colossal failure. And in fact, most things we just do not know, so just let them go. \"Oh he hates me, she hates me, everyone thinks I'm stupid\" - literally all of this is unknowable conjecture.
