  "text": "After a pretty big data loss scare, I have decided that it is dumb of me to only have my data backed up onto a physical drive. I\u2019ll pay for Dropbox if I have to, but I\u2019d obviously rather find a free version haha. I have about 400GB of data (in pictures) so far, so I expect I\u2019ll gather another 400GB by summer.",
