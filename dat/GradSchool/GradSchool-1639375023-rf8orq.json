  "title:": "I can't finish my classes this semester because of mortiple health crises - my advisor is angry",
  "text": "This is my first year of my PhD and this semester has been a disaster. I have chronic, treatment-resistant migraines, my depression has flaired to the worst levels I've ever experienced, and I was in a climbing accident and tore my labrum in my hip. This has added pain and made it hard to exercise. I have been passively suicidal for the last 2 months. I have a Neuro team, therapist, and physical therapists working with me. \n\nI definitely could have communicated with my advisor more. I emailed her a month ago and two weeks ago the above information and have had meetings with her to work on coursework, but she's frustrated with my minimal progress and states \"You really need to learn how to communicate with people you work with.\" She also has made comments about how it would look bad if I took incompletes in coursework and how she's funding me on projects that have deliverables so my lack of progress is causing problems. I finally got her to be on board with an incomplete in one course, but I don't think I can finish either of them.\n\nI understand her concerns, but I can't function right now and I need support. It's a miracle if I can get out of bed. I struggle to sleep. I don't want to eat.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this! I unfortunately can relate. I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses (Ehlers Danlos syndrome, IBS and gastroparesis, and fibromyalgia) as well as multiple mental illnesses (bipolar disorder, anxiety, BPD, and OCD). Between March and August I had multiple mental and physical health crises, and was hospitalized twice for suicide attempts. My PI ended up kicking me out of her lab despite me having disability accommodations for medical absences. Most likely because I didn\u2019t advocate my situation to her beforehand, but I can\u2019t be sure.\n\nMy advice is to advocate advocate advocate! Make your needs KNOWN and stand firm and COMMUNICATE. Open and honest communication with your PI/advisor is key. I recently joined a new lab where I\u2019m making sure to maintain open lines of communication with my new PI, and so far things have been going much better for me. I hope your PI can be understanding of your situation \u2764\ufe0f",

          "text": "My old advisor kicked me out of her lab because of my disability, and no one on campus - the disability center or ombudsman - was willing to advocate for me. Now I'm super cautious about this kind of stuff and much more informed on my rights and how to advocate for myself. The disability center at my new university has been incredibly helpful, and my advisor tries his best to accommodate me. I ended up having to take a leave of absence because grad school + pandemic has gotten the better of me, and everyone in my department supports me. OP - can you look into taking a leave of absence?",

It can sometimes help for someone else to be able to tell your supervisor 'hey, this student is struggling because of health reasons and you need to be more accommodating',\n\nIf won't look bad that you haven't completed things. If anyone asks you about why you didn't or why you completed them later or whatever, you tell them you had some bad health issues and they'll go 'oh that sucks to hear, hope you're doing ok,' unless they're an absolute shitbag.\n\nTake care of yourself.",

Hang in there.\n\nBut also : wouldn't it make sense to get a medical certification stating that you are officially out of action, doctor's orders? I know the US is shit in terms of healthcare / sick leave / things the rest of us take for granted, but in my country this would lead to (paid...) sick leave (also for phd students) and the employer has no right to have an opinion on it what so ever. You're going back when the doctor says you're going back.\nIs there no such thing?",

Some compassion is warranted and the feedback could certainly have been worded like someone who wanted to help you succeed rather than someone who wants to criticize. Clearly the things you\u2019re struggling with make communication difficult and your advisor should understand that. \n\nAnyway, I think your advisor is right to want to talk to you about the path forward and some of that is going to require frank, open, honest discussion\u2014 but what you\u2019re describing sounds mean and if I were in your shoes, it would make me feel worse. So I just wanted to provide a little validation that you deserved better emotional intelligence from your advisor no matter how your work is going.",
