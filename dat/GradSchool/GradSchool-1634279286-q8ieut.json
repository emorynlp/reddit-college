  "text": "I'm a non-EU national who's looking for a good Master's degree to study for in Europe. \n\nI've looked through a lot of options and I'm still unsure about what field would suit me best, since I'm looking for a job that would be in-demand for the next decade or so, and finding a reliable source of information about which jobs are actually going to remain relevant for expats in Europe (or the West in general) has proven to be difficult for someone without connections or experience living there.\n\nI've got a 4-year Honours Bachelor's in Linguistics, so, ideally, it would be a Master's that I could potentially pick up without having to re-specialize or go through a full pre-Master's course for.\n\nI'm also looking for a degree outside of STEM and IT, which I don't think would be even possible, considering the above. And if it's important, I look to start a degree taught entirely in English.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, Master's in Business (Risk and crisis/International management) and Master's in International Relations seem promising, but it's hard for me to tell if these are actually a good choice for someone who intends to start searching for a job in Europe right after graduating.\n\nWhat would you recommend in this case?",

As far as likelihood of finding a job after, it'll depend on the languages you speak. Without the local language, most countries are going to be difficult, as non-EU nationals often need sponsorship. And you won't have endless time to learn a new language during a master's degree. As far as I know, business and IR are definitely not high on the list of \"good\" master's degrees to immigrate. Health and technology are the top two fields, but your only option there would be a computational linguistics program and you said you want to stay out of STEM. You'll really need to narrow down what countries in Europe/EU you're looking at, as well as how much you can afford to pay for tuition.",

          "text": "Thanks for the thorough response, highly appreciated. \n\n> You'll really need to narrow down what countries in Europe/EU you're looking at, as well as how much you can afford to pay for tuition.\n\nIn regard to the tuition fees, at the moment I can afford to pay around \u20ac15,000 for the entirety of a Master's program, which I assume is going to last 2 years on average. I know that business degrees are much more expensive than that, but that's not the main path I've been planning to take.\n\nGenerally speaking, I'm looking for an opportunity to put myself in a situation where I'll be able to find a stable job and start working after graduating in any Western European country as soon as possible.\n\n\n>Master's degrees in Europe are generally consecutive, meaning that they have to be in line with your bachelor's degree. \n\n>Health and technology are the top two fields, but your only option there would be a computational linguistics program and you said you want to stay out of STEM.\n\nThat's great advice. I've considered IT, but I assumed I'm simply lacking the Bachelor's requirements for this. \n\nDo you know if it's generally possible to get into a Master's in computational linguistics with a Linguistics Bachelor's, by completing a pre-Master's course of 1 year or so at the same university that would offer that degree?\n\n> As far as likelihood of finding a job after, it'll depend on the languages you speak.\n\nI'm bilingual, but out of European languages I only speak English and intend to use it as my main language for employment as well.\n\n> Without the local language, most countries are going to be difficult, as non-EU nationals often need sponsorship.\n\nI see the concern now.

              "text": "> I've considered IT, but I assumed I'm simply lacking the Bachelor's requirements for this.\n\nYou are. It's quite simply that. Comp ling is a very specialized field with very few jobs, so it doesn't exactly have the same employability as more CS-focused degrees (especially as it generally introduces you only to the CS necessary for the field unless you're coming in with a CS background, in which case it introduces you to the linguistics necessary for the field, and it won't qualify you on its own for more general CS jobs). Comp ling itself varies from more heavily linguistics or more heavily CS.\n\n>Do you know if it's generally possible to get into a Master's in computational linguistics with a Linguistics Bachelor's, by completing a pre-Master's course of 1 year or so at the same university that would offer that degree?\n\nYou'll have to look at specific programs. Where I am, programs in comp ling seem to ask for either a linguistics degree or a CS degree, but only one of those programs is mostly in English and it requires linguistics/language bachelor's to already have a grounding in programming and basic math (it lists that beginners in linguistics may apply with CS degrees, but does not say the inverse). I don't know how many European universities offer pre-Master's courses. It certainly isn't a thing where I am.\n\n>I'm bilingual, but out of European languages I only speak English and intend to use it as my main language for employment as well.\n\nThat limits you to Ireland and Malta in the EU and the UK in Europe.\n\n>But if I managed to start a Master's for an IT degree somehow, do you think it wouldn't be possible to get by working in the IT field by using English exclusively in most Western European countries?\n\nYou would have to *qualify* for a CS or IT master's first, which won't happen for things outside of comp ling in EU countries without already having a background in it. The UK does foundation year programs, but they're not EU anymore. After that, only the Netherlands, Germany, or Scandinavia have higher incidences of English-speaking workplaces (outside of anglophone countries). And not speaking the local language is a crutch when it comes to EU hiring law and job opportunities.\n\n> And I would definitely need a sponsorship, but I've heard that there's a \"grace period\" of around 0.5-1 year to find a stable job after graduating that makes it easier for the employer to hire you with less hassle, is that not true?\n\nThere are post-study visa schemes, but they don't necessarily get rid of the requirement for sponsorship - they just allow you more time after graduating to find a job that will sponsor you. Some countries have extra requirements if you use this scheme, like the job has to pay a minimum amount and be directly in line with your degree.\n\n>Otherwise, does it mean my only choice would be Ireland? Since that's the only EU country that speaks English.\n\nMalta is also EU and speaks English. But, yes.",
