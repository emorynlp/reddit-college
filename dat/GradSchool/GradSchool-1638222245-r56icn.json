  "text": "I'm a Canadian student finishing their B.Sc at UofT, and if I don't get into grad I was hoping to do a research based job instead. I can't find much info about Canada (so any info is useful!), and most US programs are only for citizens. does anyone know about any US programs that will allow for international (or at least Canadian) students to apply? Any info is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Specifically I'm looking into the biological sciences",

      "text": "I'd say most post-bacc research jobs in academia don't go through official programs and are not necessarily advertised. After undergrad, I had two research positions in academic labs, and got both through cold-emailing professors that I was interested in doing research with. So even if you can't find info about it in Canada, you might have luck by directly reaching out to Canadian profs.\n\nFor official post-bacc programs, you'll probably need to be more specific about your field of research.",

      "text": "What field? If engineering/physics/math/etc you can look at the US DOE labs. They will be research oriented and you can apply as a Canadian. Not entirely sure how the visas/ coming directly from Canada immigration would work, but a lot at least take non-US citizens. The less nuclear it is, the easier. These will often just be listed as \"Co-ops\" or year-round internships. A few labs will officially list them as post-bacc. I did an internship that was essentially a post-bacc at the national renewable energy lab and was able to publish a paper and co-author a couple of reports before grad school. Other options outside of DOE could include something like NIST, US department of agriculture labs, or private research orgs like Energy Power and Research Institute (EPRI).\n\nSorry, this is a bit US-centric advice, but I do know Canada at least has a nuclear lab that operates in a similar manner, so there may be other government research orgs that are similar. Also, don't rule out the UN or other international research. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency has year-long internships in Monaco or Vienna and they expect international workers from all member nations, so immigration is a touch easier. Figure out if your field has a similar international research organizations.",
