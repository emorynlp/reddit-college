  "text": "Before orientation I got in a car accident. Last week my laptop wasn\u2019t working. All these inconveniences make me upset.I\u2019m a first year MA student and i\u2019m struggling so badly. I mentioned to my professors that I have a hard time speaking up in discussions. They gave me advice about taking detailed notes and bringing in talking points. Why is everyone so natural when it comes to talking? My body felt so stiff and I felt uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t talk during the second week of my seminar. \n\nI feel stuck and overwhelmed. What do I do?\n\nI really want to get my MA degree and don\u2019t want to go back\nhome :(",

      "text": "Hey, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Grad school takes some time to get used to, it is a challenging transition. You are going to learn so much during your MA that it takes new sets of skills to adapt. What you're going through is normal. Make some friends in your faculty and get to know them. Perhaps they can also share what they did to alleviate the anxiousness in the beginning.",

      "text": "I guarantee that you\u2019re not the only one in your program feeling that exact way, some people are just good at hiding it. I\u2019d recommend giving it a bit more time to make sure you\u2019re not just having these thoughts while your mind is anxious. \n\nHave a good hard think about how you truly feel about grad school and your program. Do you feel this way because you\u2019re truly just nervous and overwhelmed like you said or did you have hesitation and second thoughts about grad school beforehand? Think about why you\u2019re in the program and what you\u2019ll get out of it and if it\u2019s truly worth it. Grad school will be tough and you\u2019ll have a lot of overwhelming experiences, but not always and the benefits may far out way the stress for you. \n\nIf you truly want to continue, I\u2019d recommend seeking out someone you can speak with whether that be an advisor, family, or a therapist. Start a study group, there will be others that are nervous or may feel inadequate and would love to vent or study with you. \n\nIf you come to the conclusion that grad school truly isn\u2019t for you and you\u2019re in it for the wrong reasons, there is absolutely nothing wrong with leaving your program. You have to do what\u2019s best for your mental health and life. Life is too short to waste time doing something that causes meaningless misery. I did a year of my program and just dropped out because I came this realization and I\u2019m relieved by my decision. There were many times that I had imposter syndrome and felt overwhelmed by the work, but I adjusted and was able to push through that. Those feelings are normal in grad school. I left for a myriad if other reasons.",

      "text": "Do give it some time, and see if you warm up to it, but you know, it's not for everyone. Maybe your program or grad school in general just isn't for you. Assuming that you are paying for it, don't spend lots of money on something you are only somewhat interested in. Some students romanticise grad school and bring in unrealistic expectations. I don't know if that is you, but I've had plenty of grad student colleagues that figured out that they really weren't that invested in it after all. No shame in a change of plans, if that's what you decide.",
