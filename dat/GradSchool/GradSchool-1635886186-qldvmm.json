Nobody even asked and now I have two Masters degrees. If they do ask, obviously dont just say \u201clol I didnt wanna do it\u201d, if you have a valid reason, tell them! If its a situation like mine, I would have said \u201cI had a full course load and the extra course was not needed to fulfill my course requirements and was taking time away from the courses that I decided were more prudent to my future career goals; unfortunately I didnt make that decision prior to the deadline for it to not show up on my transcript and now it is a W\u201d.

      "text": "Where I am, you can't retake a course you previously received credit in, so that may make the situations a bit different. A W is always better than an F, so if someone thinks they are somewhat likely to fail, withdrawing is a good option. And because you can't retake classes you pass here, I think there are definitely scenarios where it's better to opt for the W instead of a low grade, depending on the circumstances (what the class is, where it falls in your program -- many grad programs only look at the last 2 years of undergrad GPA here, etc). I imagine if you're frequently withdrawing from classes in your major and then retaking them, that might look bad to grad schools. But fwiw, I had a couple of Ws on my transcript and it didn't prevent me from being accepted to grad schools. \n\nIf you know where you're planning to apply, it might be worth checking with that program, as different programs are going to have different admissions criteria. E.g., med school may frown upon things like Ws or not taking a full courseload in a way that some other programs wouldn't. (I don't know for sure how med school admissions work -- just using that as a hypothetical example)",
