  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo I'm hoping to apply for Data science programs in USA for fall'22. I was able to shortlist a few universities based on my profile. However, I'd like your opinion on this too. Its really difficult to get ranking on DS programs and to use it to understand if they are actually great.\n\nLink to shortlist-https://imgur.com/a/waDjNV4\n\nThanks in advance! :)",
