  "text": "Idk why, but my entire cohort and myself are really struggling. I feel like we're all running on empty and the shock of juggling in person classes with re-entering the world post lock downs has been exhausting. Is it normally this bad or are others experiencing the same weird covid burnout in school?",

My colleagues (many of whom have been working for decades) are also burnt out. My friends outside academia are often burnt out. Life is hard right now.",

      "text": "The burnout is real rn. But I would put it down to the \"end of semester push\". In the beginning of the semester I still had time to go to gym once a week but that's gone.\n\nIf we are still burned 3 weeks into next semester then I would put it down to covid.\n\nAlso, wearing masks the whole day really does take a toll. Especially if you have glasses.",

      "text": "I'm so glad to hear other people are experiencing this too. I knew there would be a learning curve and period of adjustment when starting grad school, but now my first quarter is almost done and I feel so exhausted and stupid. We're really pretending that everything is \"back to normal\" yet we sit in classrooms every day wearing masks. That is not normal! Professors are not being accommodating anymore at all! I wish we had a slower transition, maybe with hybrid online/in-person classes.",
