It does not look like there is a difference in funding just when the invites for visits and interviews go out.\n\nI made kind of a late decision to just go ahead and go for it, but now I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it.",

You should probably ask an admissions person there. \n\nThat said, I doubt it looks \u2018bad\u2019 or is impossible to get in otherwise they wouldn\u2019t give the option at all.",

      "text": "You are only guaranteed to be considered \"fully\" if you submit by the priority deadline. Missing it by a few days is probably fine, but I wouldn't trust the secondary deadline unless your application absolutely sparkles. \n\nOne of the schools I was admitted to had a priority of Dec. 1 and a secondary deadline of Jan. 15. There was a technical glitch with my transcripts that meant that my application didn't actually go through until Dec. 4, so I did technically miss the priority deadline but evidently not by enough to miss the review period. Seeing as I received my interview invite in early January, certainly before the secondary deadline was met, I doubt that anyone who submitted after, say, Christmas had their application fully reviewed. \n\nGradCafe is a bit of a cesspool, but likely a useful one in this respect. Check to see when interview invites were historically sent out to see if the program actually respects the secondary deadline or not.",
