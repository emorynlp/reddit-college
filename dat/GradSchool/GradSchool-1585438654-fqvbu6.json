Which in my case barely exists. To say I'd be Frankensteining something together is an understatement.\n\nI worry about bringing it up with her again, but we meet Tuesday. I don't know how to couch it that wouldn't involve one of us having tempers flared since the entire point of my research was **supposed** to be China's SOE relationship with BRI nations.. but that was struck down because \"it has an N case of 1\"... Somehow. \n\n\nI've spoken to other professors who have basically told me just to go with it for now and not rock the boat, since \"you're not really in a position\" to create a totally fleshed out methodology. As of now if she asks I'll say that I've discussed it with numerous friends of mine in academia who tell me it generally checks out as valid and something they'd use.\n\nTL;DR The methodology has to cover both how productive/capital driven SOE impact a nation's corruption as their %GDP rises, **and** if their closeness to the central regime (based largely on organizational charts) matters. That last part is a sticking point and what I don't think I've articulated well enough.",
