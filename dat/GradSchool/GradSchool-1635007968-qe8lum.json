  "text": "Learning has always been a big part of my life. Over time, I\u2019ve found that many of us aren\u2019t as curious about discovering new areas and skills to learn. Perhaps this is because the bar that we set is far too high.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve spent the last year immersing my self in learning platform Masterclass. There is nothing like a recognizable expert walking you through the things that you need to know about become better at a particular skill. I\u2019ve shared a thorough breakdown of the platform and how we can approach learning efficiently here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcipG4LnTgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcipG4LnTgY) Definitely check it out and let me know if it helps.\n\nPart of what makes the Masterclass courses so great is the instructors, and part of it is the perspective that they provide. And I think that that just might be a winning combination.",

      "text": "Dude are you even a grad student? Why are you here? This reads like an ad, and probably is one, which is against the rules. \n\n> There is nothing like a recognizable expert walking you through the things that you need to know about become better at a particular skill.\n\nIn grad school you are literally surrounded by experts. You don't need a \"platform\" to get access. Also, if you need an expert to \"walk you through things\" (aka handhold you through what you can probably teach yourself through textbooks and research) then grad school probably isn't for you. \n\nAfter taking a look at the website, it looks like it teaches topics on a superficial level not even worthy of undergrad level status. For real, anyone who is smart enough to make it to grad school can easily self-teach themselves anything on that website THAT REQUIRES A $15 PER MONTH SUBSCRIPTION. \n\nOf course, if you were an actual grad student, you would realize this. \n\nGet out of thus sub and stop spamming. No one likes anyone who hangs around for the sole purpose of making a few bucks.",
