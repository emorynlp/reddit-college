  "text": "I am an introvert who only went to the university I graduated from for one year.  I didn\u2019t really get to know my instructors, and wouldn\u2019t think of asking the others because they were not fond of my content subject-wise. Now I would like to pursue my master\u2019s but I am stuck at the letters hurdle.",

      "text": "The best thing to do here will involve talking to the people you need LoRs from. Get them to know you starting now. When you email or call them, let them know what you are/have been doing. Why you want a Masters, what you want it in, what you want to do with it. Give them a CV so they can see more of what you've done. If you do other work (outreach etc) in your field or outside of it, let them know. The main goal here is to have them see you and your work outside of what's on paper so they can write a better informed more personal letter for you.\n\nI find that the best letters have some sort of personal touch or appeal. Make sure you connect with your LoR writers now so that they feel confident talking about you as an individual and not just some random student in their class.",
