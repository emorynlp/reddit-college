  "text": "As the title indicates, I was recently dumped and not handling it well. It's Sunday and I have a shit ton of homework to complete; I spent all Friday and Saturday worrying about the relationship, then it got broken off last night. People are quick to advise that grad students should \"take a day off\" and \"let your brain rest\" but I am literally out of days in the weekend and my professors aren't going to let me turn in assignments late due to heartbreak. How do you manage the constant workload of grad school during setbacks in life?",

          "text": "I relate to this so hard. Covid has taken away almost all of my friends (I moved to a new city too) and I mostly work remote, so I was very excited to start a relationship with someone I could regularly see. And I did end up relying on him too much for support, which got ripped away from me. I constantly think about how much easier life would be if I had never met him. I say that at the end of every relationship though, so this is probably a deeper issue of me relying too much on partners in general. I won\u2019t graduate for six years so hopefully I won\u2019t be single for that entire time, but we\u2019ll see haha\n\nI\u2019m glad this post was able to help you. It sucks so many people are going through this, but good to know I\u2019m not the only one I guess. I hope things get better for you",

Not only that, but my dog of 15 years passed away the day before the final. I remember trying to clear my head for a bit before the final and I was lucky enough that I had kept up with the notes enough that I aced it. After that, I could barely work 4 hours a day on my thesis project and I ended up calling my supervisor and telling him about the breakup and my dog passing away. He told me that as long as I could get a couple of hours of work done a day, to think of it as a success and that it would eventually get better. I ended up taking a couple of weeks off to travel with my dad, and then when I came back, I made an effort to meet new people and it helped me move forward and continue working. I learned to lose myself in my work instead of in the heartache. And gradually, it gets better!",

You can\u2019t perform well if you aren\u2019t feeling well. \n\nBe open with your mentor/professors. I turned in a half-assed assignment to my professor and in my email, I told him what happened to me and that I will strive to do better next week, and he was really supportive! \n\nIt\u2019s hard right now, but take care of yourself and know that it will get better. It may feel unmanageable now, but you will regain a sense of normalcy again. \n\n(And honestly, there should be a subreddit/support group for this. Dating and love life is so hard in grad school).",

Cry as much as you want. Spend some time in the sun. Try a new hobby that will be good for you (I started doing yoga on YouTube).

I'm done with coursework so it wasn't entirely the same but I did tell my supervisor, in general terms, that I'd had a bad breakup and so that was why my productivity was down.\n\nIn my experience, supervisors would like to *know* that you're not getting things done rather than to hear nothing from you.\n\nYour profs might surprise you... otherwise consider taking a leave of absence if things aren't getting better after a few weeks. Generally speaking they won't pry if you say the reason is mental health-related.\n\nThe best therapy I found during my period of heartbreak (I tried conventional therapy too and it was meh) and to this day is just keeping busy with hobbies. I took up a lot of crafts during lockdown as well. Therapy, to me, always seemed to allow me to dwell on things instead of putting into action ways to move on from that bad period.",

Take frequent breaks to let your mind rest as much as you can. Avoid contact with your ex completely, don't even go there. Avoid Facebook stalking, avoid all of it. Nextly, the first month is the worst, but after that, it begins easing off. Keeping busy is actually really good, then you don't have time to sit and dwell.

Now I'm stuck in a graduate program with no summer break for the next 6 years and my favorite relative is dying of cancer, so that opportunity to see him is gone. I'm starting to realize that I tried to use this relationship as a band-aid so I could convince myself I was happy, but now that's gone too. Being thrown into grad school for the first time is the worst possible thing for my mental health right now and I don't feel like there's a way out of it",

I'm done with classes, so my situation is a little different, but I basically tried to figure out what absolutely needs to be completed (committee meeting, conference submission) and what could be dropped. It turns out a lot can be dropped if you ask for it. And I probably could have dropped the meeting and conference- what do those matter in the biggest scheme of things? But the key is definitely to let your professors know- I worded it as a \"personal emergency\" or \"personal crisis\" just to be a little less specific.\n\nFor emotionally coping, I also high-tailed it to our university's counseling center and starting therapy has helped. I also find that exercise and talking with friends have been the most helpful activities for me. \n\nEvery day is hard!

When I was having productivity problems due to life stuff, I forced myself into this twice a day. I set up two 30 minute work sessions each day at the same time, exercised each day at the same time, and slowly began making progress. 30 minutes or 60 minutes of work a day adds up over a week even if it feels like so little.\n\nLong term: start seeing a therapist. Your university probably offers some free sessions through student health services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",
