  "text": "My first rotation sucked ass and I felt pretty useless for 8 weeks straight. I was just informed that I will be listed as a contributing author on a paper to be submitted soon for work I did in my second rotation. Not a huge accomplishment but as a first year grad student it made me super happy. That\u2019s all, thought I\u2019d share something positive for once.",

It is a little cubesat that an army of undergrads, a handful of grad students, a couple engineers, and a PI built.  It monitors space weather and steers itself using the magnetosphere.  I was the lead of Fabrication (machining parts) for a time.  Honestly, I just wanted to play in that machine shop so when I found someone with access, I begged him to take me with him.  They told me about the project and I volunteered/got hired.  It was one of the most enriching experiences of my undergrad.  The whole team has a lot of heart.",
