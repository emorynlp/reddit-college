  "text": "Hi fellow researchers! I\u2019m preparing to collect data for my dissertation and need some advice. I\u2019m completing a large-scale public opinion survey and comparing the findings to previous studies conducted by my lab. I need a representative sample from the U.S. and I\u2019m struggling with which route to take. Has anyone used Prolific, MTurk, or other sites that you would recommend and why? Anyone use online snowballing approaches and have any advice on how to handle the potentially very messy data that comes from that? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",
