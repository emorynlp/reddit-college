  "text": "I\u2019m in a biology program at a Canadian university, and was very surprised when I found out we only need 2 classes to graduate (regardless whether MSc or PhD). One is a mandatory \u201ccore skills in biological research\u201d course, and the other is your own choice.  \n\nSo how common is this? Before I started I expected I would have at least a couple classes per term. Is this normal for STEM degrees?",
