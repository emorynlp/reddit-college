  "text": "Is it possible to skip Bachelor's or it's a mandatory requirement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf one has work experience and self-employed and wanted to pursue an academic career in the same field, Would admission staff consider other qualifications(the work experience, MicroMasters and GRE) as a replacement for a Bachelor's?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpending 4 years on a Bachelor's as an adult student when you're already above undergraduate level in terms of knowledge is redundant and exhausting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: While I really appreciate all responses, please note that I'm not looking to pulling strings and cheating and influencing. I asked to know if there are any options/universities to accept edX MicroMasters or similar to save time. I especially appreciate replies from those working in admissions or those who have any experience with this problem.",

However, when looking to apply late last year, there are now far more opportunities as universities start to understand the value of professional experience.\n\nHope that helps!",

Basically, if you are already managing a business they'll def let you in. \n\nOtherwise, probably not going to happen.\n\n What field are you going into? For instance, if you have already designed a bunch of successful softwares, maybe there's a possibility of pursuing a CS Msc, but honestly I'm struggling to think of many careers where you can get successful enough at the job without a bachelor's, successful enough for a department to waive the bachelor's requirements.

It's meant to top up existing training for new technologies, new tasks, but alone won't do things like increase your paygrade from \"holds a bachelor's\" to \"holds a master's\". As far as I'm aware, with software engineering, you pretty much need to do this sort of training/workshop every few years. \n\nThe reason why MOOCs won't work for grad admissions is because standards are generally fairly low, testing is very limited in scope, and there's no way to verify you actually are the one who took the test. So it's incredibly risky from their perspective, whereas for an employer it pretty much makes no difference, since your work performance is what matters.\n\nDo you have no bachelor's whatsoever, or just not a bachelor's in  CS? This is important. Another thing is how much experience are we talking about? Two years at an entry level or 10 years of working your way up to pretty cutting edge design implementation? Are you working with a company that say designs medical software and you've identified a serious need/lack you are confident can be solved with some research? \n\nIf you want to skip a bachelor's, basically you'll kind of need a really clear and really good research project to shop around, as well as enough experience to convince people you will be able to complete it. If you've got this, it's definitely not impossible.",
