  "text": "Long time lurker, first time caller. I\u2019m currently a grad student in a research-based program (biochem) at a Canadian university. With most of the programs here, grad students enter at the Master\u2019s level and decide if they want to transfer to a PhD program in their second year. I\u2019m conflicted about the decision and was hoping to get some opinions from here. \n\nMy main motivation to succeed during undergrad was getting into grad school, doing a PhD, and becoming a rockstar professor, the whole nine yards. I had good experiences with a few undergrad research projects, enjoyed my coursework and figured I was on the right track. And right now, I\u2019m working in a lab with a great supervisor, great team, great environment across the board. Unfortunately, most of my passion for science has kinda... evaporated. The inability to \u201cunplug\u201d from work coupled with the lack of any real financial stability and the general grind of running experiments has made me drastically reconsider a career in academia. I'm no longer sure that the benefits match the costs. \n \nI\u2019ve spoken to my supervisor and colleagues about this and they think I\u2019d be a good fit for a PhD. I know that the degree can be valuable on the job market outside academia, and I also know that a supportive lab environment isn\u2019t an opportunity to be wasted or thrown away lightly. But it also seems to me that the folks who thrive in PhD programs are the ones who couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else\u2026 and that ain\u2019t me anymore. \n\nTL;DR having a lot of second thoughts about transferring from a research-based MSc to a PhD. Has anyone here faced a similar dilemma during their academic career? Any words of wisdom or even tangentially-related experiences would be immensely appreciated. Thanks for reading this rant and hope everyone\u2019s studies are going well.",

But man, I can\u2019t stand the process of publishing. In academia, there is a lot of stress to be productive with grants and publications. It is extremely difficult to get a job and you work all the time. I want a family, I want a life outside of work. So I am right there with you. \n\nCurrently I think I may go the teaching route- I love teaching. The PhD is funded so I don\u2019t have much of an incentive to leave the program\u2026 I\u2019m just going to pass on the professorship lol \n\nIf you are feeling this way now it will only increase with time. Only crazy people like academia, no offense:) I guess I\u2019m just not that crazy- kudos to people who can do it",

Maybe you should see if your institute offers similar courses! I found the ones at mine to be amazing. The program even had an 'internship' type component that I ended up not doing but this might help you in the future :).",

That's part of what school is about.\n\nI am just finishing up my PhD, and I wish I would have stopped at the Master's degree because I have been experiencing major burnout for the past 2 years. I'm also from an amazing research group, with a very supportive and helpful advisor, great community of grad students, etc. I learned that getting a PhD isn't about being the smartest person... it's more about being persistent and having that motivation to keep going and learning and experimenting. I lost my motivation about 2 years ago but wasn't in a good position to leave (on a funded project, only student in the lab with the skills to keep the project going, no support to leave from family) so I have been dragging myself along to the finish line. It's been tough. I also was considering teaching but it is so much work for not very good pay and is a high stress position, and one of the things I've learned in grad school is high stress positions are not good for me.\n\nMy advice would be to listen to yourself. Things aren't going to get easier in terms of work-life balance once you're in the PhD program. But there are benefits to getting a PhD. Do you have an idea of what you want to do once you graduate? Maybe do a little job hunting right now and see if the positions that interest you need a MSc or PhD.",

I\u2019ve only been in one semester, and I\u2019ve realized two important things:\n1) There are several jobs I could work in with a Masters that I\u2019d be more than happy with.\n2) My career interests are a lot more broad than my current research topic, and I\u2019m worried that a PhD might \u201cpidgeonhole\u201d me into only having career options in the field that I\u2019m currently in. \n\nIt might be helpful for you to start job searching now. Are there jobs requiring Masters that sound really cool to you? If so, might not be a bad idea to think Masters. Also, the qualities that would make you a good PhD student apply to anything you chose to do. I wouldn\u2019t let compliments from my supervisor/colleagues influence my decision. Just because you have the ability to do a PhD, doesn\u2019t mean you need to.",

I could make more money with a PhD, but I'm not convinced my mental health would be able to recover if I forced myself to keep going for 2-3 more years. I look around and see the level that my colleagues let their jobs control their lives and honestly it feels like I'm leaving a cult. It's like this constant \"I fucking hate my life but I'm a scientist/will get an advanced degree/work way more than others and that makes me worth something\" attitude that I just can't live by and that I don't think is very healthy. Like so many people talk about work life balance and then turn around and brag that they work 12 hour days and answer student emails even at 3 am and stuff like that. I honestly feel like a weirdo every time I tell people I'm not answering emails after 6 pm or similar things because of how people look at me. \n\nIt took me a while to finally admit I'm going to master out, but once I talked to my advisor and another professor on my committee, I realized how much better of a path taking a Master's degree would be for me and how many options I actually do have. I think a big thing holding me back was a fear of the unknown, like staying on the path of least resistance is always the easiest thing to do, even if there are better paths. \n\nEven if it turns out that you want to go back for a PhD, you can. Leaving with a Master's doesn't mean you're barred from grad school for the rest of your life!",

I\u2019m trying to use those connections now before I enter the real world after the spring (scary lol). But I think we\u2019re both making the right decision! When the paperwork was finalized for me, it was weird but also a relief! \n\nAnd yeah for real, academia is super toxic in many ways. I was also lucky my advisor had good funding for me.\n\nThank you, you too!! Good luck with the rest of your master\u2019s :)",
