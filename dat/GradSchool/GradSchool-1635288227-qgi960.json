  "text": "Hello,\n\nI tried to post here once before, but it got removed automatically, so I hope this one goes through -\n\nI am currently a first-year PhD student at an institution in Canada. I am an international student from the United States, I moved here back in September. While I've tried to make this work, I've been absolutely miserable since I've come here, I haven't had much support from my department, and I don't forsee much in the way of opportunities in my specific field of research here. There are other reasons as well, but those are the main ones. I am fairly certain (like 90% probably) that I'm going to withdraw from this program at the end of the term. \n\nI initially wanted to wait until next year before I started applying for jobs, but there was an opening posted within the last week in my field of research, one for which I fit the listed qualifications, at the institution where I earned my Bachelors. I want to apply for this job, as it closes at the end of next month. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? I have to assume it reflects poorly on me that I'm withdrawing, but is it something completely disqualifying? Should I just wait until I'm fully out of the program to apply anywhere?",

      "text": "Apply for the job! There\u2019s a huge shift in our collective and individual priorities since the start of the pandemic. It shows initiative and bravery to walk away from a miserable situation to pursue better opportunities. Of course, there will always be hardcore academics who shame people who leave and it\u2019ll be worse/better depending on your field and institution. I believe in you, there\u2019s no harm in applying and exploring your options.",
