  "text": "I'm currently doing my bachelor's at an online school (it's fully accredited, just not very prestigious). Does the fact that I'm not doing my bachelor's at a well-known and prestigious school affect my chances of admission? \n\nAlso, when it comes to admission how do grad schools calculate undergrad GPA? Do they look at every class you've taken or is it just the final two years?",

      "text": "Totally depends on the program. I can\u2019t speak much for how admissions views school rank but I know some if not most will mostly look at your last two years and how you did in relevant classes. They will ask for you cumulative, sometimes your 60/90 (basically last two years), and sometimes only your major gpa. I think if school ranking is important, you can probably offset some of that by doing research work/internships at other universities during the summer or if you find a professor to help with research interests you may have. Depending on the program, admissions will put your research experience/relevant experiences above all.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a compilation of about 8 different variables.\n\nGPA (cumulative and major), undergraduate institution, undergrad major and classes taken, research, letters of recommendation, personal statement, relevant entry test results, publications, scholarships/awards, involvement in relevant clubs/activities.\n\nConsidering any variable in a vacuum without the others isn\u2019t super worthwhile.  If it\u2019s terrible, it might be a challenging hurdle to overcome, but otherwise it\u2019s always just a compilation.\n\nUndergraduate institution plays a huge role because it directly affects so many variables- ability to take advanced classes, ability to be involved in cool research projects, ability to publish, ability to be more competitive for major fellowships/scholarships, ability to be taught by the leaders in the field and have your understanding of the field be crafted by someone that understands how to actually approach cutting-edge thought in the field.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: so no, it\u2019s not an absolute no-go, no variable is.  But you will have to work harder in all the other areas if you want to be competitive.\n\n(I\u2019m referencing research-based PhD programs for some of the variables- I realize some programs have fewer/slightly different variables, especially for masters programs).",

      "text": "FWIW I went to a local state school that's not well-known outside my region for undergrad and got into one of the top grad programs in the country for my field. I would say a good chunk (maybe even close to half?) of my peers here had similar undergrad experiences. Different people have different strengths and weaknesses on the application process, and as others have mentioned your app will (should) be reviewed holistically.\n\nI made the most of my undergrad time by taking as many electives as I could, participating in the honors program, taking on student leadership roles, and studying abroad. Those specific things may not be feasible or interesting to you, but I would say definitely boost your credentials in any way you can - it'll be good for more than just grad school anyway (networking, friendships, your own wellbeing, etc).\n\nAs far as GPA, my school just wanted my overall. I've heard of other places asking for overall + your major. I think it depends, honestly.",
