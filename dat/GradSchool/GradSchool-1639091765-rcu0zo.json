  "text": "Hi everyone. I started my PhD this year and met my boyfriend shortly after. Things became serious quite quickly. We practically live together now and see each other every day.\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us have any family in the area, nor do we have many friends. I do have some girlfriends, but honestly they go out a lot more than I'd like, and I generally just consider them people to have fun with and not people I truly have good connections with. They are also all single. My cohort was very small, just 6 people, and unfortunately I just didn't hit it off with anyone. They're nice, but no one who I consider a great friend. My bf has a few friends, who we have hung out with on occasion, but nothing consistent.\n\nBasically, this is just a big transition for me from undergrad. I had so many friends and was constantly socializing. Now I'm just seeing my boyfriend everyday. I'm also the only grad student in my lab, and most people in the dept. work remotely, so many days my bf is the only person I talk to. I really like him, and he's a great friend, but I just don't think this is healthy for us. It's almost like we're married?\n\nI'm just trying to think of some possible hobbies we could adopt or general things for us to do on the weekend. I'm just worried that the relationship is getting too close too fast and might implode...\n\nGenerally we have tons to talk about, but you know, it's good for us to talk to other people too.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not healthy at all. My girlfriend has severe social anxiety, so I\u2019m her only close friend in grad school and it\u2019s atrocious. It\u2019s just not healthy to not have a robust social network (like, 3-5 people, not saying 50 close friends) you can talk to about your life and problems. \n\nAlso, it strains the relationship because she doesn\u2019t have anyone to vent to about Our relationship. I love my gf, I want to marry her, but sometimes we fight and I want to vent to a homie about it and get some advice/perspective. She doesn\u2019t have that. Her only soundboard for our relationship is\u2026. me. It feels like a wierd power imbalance too - because of course I\u2019m more sympathetic to my grievances, my perspective, and think that I am right, so it feels wrong and unhealthy for me to be the only person she can receive feedback from regarding the relationship.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear you're going through that! I pretty much only socialize with my SO and 1 friend in grad school, so I feel you, especially with the pandemic it can be hard to meet people. Have you considered joining a student org that meets regularly? Or perhaps you can organize a get together with your bf and his friends and get to know them better.",
