  "text": "I've recently been looking into the case of Jonathon Pruitt, who's had dozens of papers retracted due to data discrepancies. \n\nHere's a link if anyone is interested.\n\n https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/11/behavioral-ecologist-jonathan-pruitts-phd-dissertation-withdrawn/\n\nWhat happens to students in his lab? What about people who have graduated from his lab? Are they \"blamed\" a long with the advisor and blacklisted from academia, etc? I'm assuming that his students would be honest, and are just in an unfortunate situation. Likewise, what do people who've graduated in his lab do now that potentially a large part of their CV was just nuked?",

      "text": "Students in his lab have been transferred to new labs/supervisors. He has also lost his prestigious Canada Research Chair (which he won, at least partially, based on fraudulent research). All of this has been kept quiet because he lawyered up and basically threatened and intimidated co-authors and even journals (e.g., American Naturalist). He was the one responsible for the completely made up data, so he has not future in academia. His current employer, as for as I know he is still technically employed and just on leave, McMaster University, has said basically nothing and not been transparent whatsoever.\n\nAs for his previous and (formerly) current students? I think it is abundantly clear they were not responsible for the problematic data and papers. So, in effect, they are in the clear from this saga. The problem is that many lost several papers and years of research, and that they cannot get back. I would imagine that would be taken into consideration during any job application in the future, academia or otherwise. I don't think any of his former students or collaborators have had issues getting work, though I know some have left academia (not really because of Pruitt). Pruitt has had his thesis taken down from the University of Tennessee thesis archive, but it's not clear if \"withdrawn thesis document\" means Pruitt no longer has a PhD (i.e., his PhD was revoked). It's a mess, but that mess is with Pruitt and not current/former students and collaborators.\n\nA similar situation is brewing at the University of Toronto. Basically, an abusive former PhD student (Denon Start) manipulated or just outright made up data for his thesis (which has 8 research chapters, basically unheard of in ecology and evolution). Several of those chapters have expressions of concern or have already been retracted. I don't know what will happen to his PhD and if he will lose it, but he should. There is a lot more to this story I cannot share, either because it was personal to others and it isn't my story or I just don't know all the details, but it is very messy (to put it mildly). Denon was stripped of awards by CSEE before the issues with his research came out, and those awards were revoked because of his personal and not research conduct. Denon has absolutely no future in academia, and I imagine the same goes for Pruitt.",

I've been looking into specific cases of Pruitt's data sets and he seems to have pretty much copy pasted exact numbers in cases where that is suspicious - so relatively sloppy.\n\nIt makes me wonder how many people have gamed the system by being smarter about their dishonesty. Hopefully it is not too much.",

When I was in grad school, if my PI had a cool dataset which I could analyze (or a public dataset, etc.), I don't think it would be a big deal to have been first author analyzing it. Especially in ecology, datasets of value take decades to collect and often get used in many projects.",

When it comes to the paper, the one(s) who collected the data might not be first author (i.e., a student a could be first author), but the true responsibility for data collection wouldn't be to the first author. I put very little to no blame on any of Pruitt's students or collaborators, particularly those who had to fight against legal threats and other nonsense to correct the scientific record.

              "text": "Any problematic data was collected by Pruitt. Yes, technically all authors are responsible, but you expect/assume a basic level of honesty and integrity in the research process. It took a fair bit of sleuthing across a couple of papers for people to really start looking into his data. Only then was the full extent of his fraud apparent.\n\nAlso, I don't know how many of his students or collaborators are affected and how. What I do know is that Pruitt was the cause of all the problematic data. I can't speak to how each individual case played out, only that Pruitt was consistently identified as the problem and fighting against retracting papers despite other authors unanimously agreeing to do so. There were at least a few retractions where his name was absent from the list of authors requesting a retraction.\n\nEdit: And his current student's lost years of research under his supervision, because we are almost exactly 2 years from the data of the first retraction. Many of them, if not having to start completely over, will have to add time toward completing their degrees by re-starting experiments/studies.\n\nAdditionally, there are several papers where the lead author collected their own data and Pruitt also ran 'experiments' and provided his data. So the lead author had perfectly valid data, but data coming from Pruitt was the problem. There are like 30+ papers on PubPeer with comments documenting the issues.\n\nRegardless, if your advisor gives you data in ecology and evolution (really, anywhere), you trust that it was collected properly and the data are valid. It seems you are blaming Pruitt's former students/collaborators for his actions, which is suspect to me",
