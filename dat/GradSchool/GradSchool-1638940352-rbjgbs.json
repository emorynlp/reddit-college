  "text": "Hi.\n\nI think I probably need to see a therapist about this, but I'm going to post here first. I have been having weekly mental breakdowns lately because I just feel like I am never going to publish anything. I have been working in research for three years now, social psych specifically. I have helped with countless projects. I have been the most dedicated research assistant, going above and beyond to collect data quickly and efficiently. And so many of the projects have just been abandoned by the graduate students. So no authorship. In fact, I've helped with at least FIVE different projects all of which I was guaranteed middle authorship for. Not one of these have been published and honestly I doubt they will ever be.\n\nI have two first author studies in the works but honestly the PI I designed the studies with isn't an expert in the field and I am deeply worried that the studies are very flawed and will be rejected outright. I was a lab manager for two years before starting my PhD this year, and IDK I feel like so many people get excellent mentorship out of their lab manager jobs but my PI was pregnant and then the pandemic happened and everything just got fucked. Now I'm a first year PhD student and although my data collection is starting, I just feel like it's going to be 1-2 years before anything is finished. I honestly just feel like such a fucking failure because in undergrad I was the hand raising, go getter kid who had all the potential. Yet one honors thesis and two years of lab managing later, I'm not very close to a publication at all. \n\nIt's so depressing honestly. I really want to be a professor but I am so fucking terrified that in three years I'll still have no publications. I want to do something theoretical, maybe a review of sorts, but I have no guidance on how to do that sort of thing. Gahh I also keep comparing myself to everyone around me and I just want to cry. I hate my shitty studies in the works, I hate that no matter how hard I work it doesn't matter. I just hate that I have nothing to show for all my hard work. \n\nK made myself cry again.",

      "text": "Wait but you\u2019re just a first year. I feel like most people don\u2019t start a PhD with publications under their belt. In my program, we don\u2019t normally start research till our third year! I think you are putting too many unrealistic expectations on yourself :( Do you have a PI you can discuss this with? Therapy helps in not spiraling into depression and anxiety but I personally think therapy won\u2019t fix your worry that you\u2019re current projects are going no where. Rather, I would talk to your advisor and see how you can meet your goals of having enough good quality publications before you enter the job market.",

      "text": "Would definitely recommend a therapist, seems getting things out may help you. I felt the part about being a go-getter, when I first got to college in undergrad I started out that way because that\u2019s how I went through grade school and it nearly killed me. Slowed down the pace, gave it a good effort instead of my entire being, and I got through. \n\nGrad school I had to switch gears again because what got me through undergrad wasn\u2019t enough, was going through a rough patch, and ultimately felt like a failure my first semester in the program. I hadn\u2019t done any professional research prior to graduate school, and finding a topic was probably one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do in my life. Was terrified my paper wouldn\u2019t get published because it was merely a hunch with little literature evidence to back up (online program so no labs or partners) and ended up turning into an overview rather than trying to prove a theory. Committee and advisor tore it to shreds 4 times and I felt my heart go through the floor on each one because it felt like I was getting nowhere. \n\nBut! When I got to my exit seminar and defense, my committee said everything in my presentation solved every one of their issues they had with the paper, and I went along with their feedback from that. My original paper and idea aren\u2019t good enough to publish due to lack of definitive data, I did however get an opportunity to publish two separate overviews on topics within the original paper because the information was just that in-depth compared to past publications. They also passed me because I proved I worked my tail off, had a passion for the topic and program in general, and would use the knowledge for both hobbyist and scientific purposes! \n\nPlease don\u2019t give up, and don\u2019t let that impostor syndrome eat you alive. I couldn\u2019t eat for months thanks to the nausea from anxiety I built up over that paper getting torn to shreds every time I submitted it, thinking I\u2019d never graduate or make anything of myself for the student loan debt I accrued. Every single one of us has gone through this exact thing. Yes, it\u2019s stressful, but ultimately we all get through it and live to tell the tale! And don\u2019t stress yourself on publications. They\u2019re important, but they aren\u2019t the end all be all of grad school or your career. You\u2019ve got plenty of time to work out kinks, perhaps garner help from other professors or advisors? TA\u2019s too! Sometimes having another person to ask for help or advice helps. My advisor could be cold, but another professor on my committee I was able to talk about the severe anxiety surrounding the impostor syndrome I was dealing with and she was able to get my head back to earth and give me feedback without ripping me a new asshole lol. You got this friend! If my deathly anxious, procrastinating ass can survive grad school, so can you!",

      "text": "I published my first paper in my third year, which is final year in Europe. I graduated last year and I submitted another couple of papers. They're still under review, so their value on my CV is practically zero. I am afraid they will be rejected after so much waiting. I feel you, and I have your exact same fears. Couple this with a negligent supervisor and you can see my anxiety spiking.",

      "text": "Publishing sucks.  Often times, you just have bad luck with reviewers, advisors, collaborators and projects would implode. This is one reason you might want to cast a wider net of projects (which is kinda what profs do with their students and collaborations).\n\nI'm also in social psych and I barely got a first author papers out by the time I graduated. What worked for me to keep myself sane was writing up the stuff I learned on my personal blog. I HATED it when I didn't have anything to show for when a project died so I figured out ways to write up what I learned or achieved from the projects. This really helped my mental health and less stressed out about publications. \n\nI eventually left academia and I wish you better luck in publishing. I also wrote an [article](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/four-tips-you-need-to-know-before-starting-your-phd-ce950d39e3d) about a few advice that helped me survive grad school. Sharing in case it could be helpful.",
