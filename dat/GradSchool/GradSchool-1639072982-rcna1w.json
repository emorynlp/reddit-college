      "text": "I am in a PhD program with some blips on my academic record. I\u2019d been dismissed from community college because my gpa was so low. So it\u2019s possible. \n\nI was told that everybody likely has something imperfect\u2014we are humans, right? I was advised to account for it, and explain it in terms that make it an asset to your program. For example, do your mental health issues have any relevant overlap to your field or what you want to do with your research? You don\u2019t have to give them specifics, but frame it as a passion that has grown from your experience. \n\nNext, you need to look at individual program requirements. Sometimes the program is seeking a different GPA from the grad school requirements. You may have already done this, but it helps manage expectations. \n\nNext, it doesn\u2019t matter the prestige of your institution. Truly. What ultimately matters is that you are in a place that will work with you and for you to meet your goals. Then you find a job. If a job is looking specifically for people who have come from elite institutions, then you probably don\u2019t want to work there anyway. And most people don\u2019t actually know much about universities rankings or care. If it\u2019s accredited your degree is valid. \n\nNext, ask some of your professors about internship or fellowship opportunities that might be available to you, and are relevant to your interests. They should be able to help you, or point you toward those who can. If you have a career center, they could be a good resource to help you sort through all of this stuff. \n\nNext, when you work on your application materials, work with someone. If you have a good professor mentor that will help, great! If not, career center and writing center will help you. \n\nFinally, workin on your gpa is going to probably be the most important. Don\u2019t spread yourself too thin. Again, I\u2019m in a PhD program I never did anything extra in my undergrad. I had to work basically full time. So, it might be different in different programs and disciplines, but I have done well.",

              "text": "Yw and best of luck! \n\nI think research experience is the number one thing that can help you get into grad school. You may also want to take some basic Data Science/Statistics classes if you haven't already because it usually comes in handy for plotting/data analysis regardless of your field. Even just doing a research project with a professor at your institution that produces some kind of write-up and maybe a presentation at a local/regional conference can help set you apart. Worst case you at least build a better bond with a professor and get a better letter of recommendation out of it.",
