  "text": "Hi,\n\nI got accepted an English-taught master program although my score was not sufficient to meet language criteria. Specifically, I had a score of 92 in TOEFL and the requirement was 100, however, the selection committee find my English adequate in the interview and accepted me. Today was my first class day in this foreign country in which people don\u2019t speak English. I literally struggled to speak fluently with other students. I have been afraid of being disgraced in every moment. I could not stop the thoughts constantly flowing in my mind and saying \u201cyou will not be able speak well\u201d, \u201ceveryone will realize your English is terrible\u201d in my native language. After this extremely stressful experience, I am now thinking it is impossible to complete this program, considering the fact that I will have to actively participate in courses, make presentations, pass exams etc. \n\nI was wondering other non-native English speakers\u2019 first day experiences. Am I the only one in this super anxious situation?\n\nYour response is appreciated.",

      "text": "Hey there I am in germany and learning after I got here! I have learned so many things I wish I knew before about how to talk to non-native speakers.\n\nIt can be very isolating but if you find an activity that doesn't require much talking like playing a sport then you can make friends that way. Very important not to isolate yourself too much.\n\nLearn to introduce yourself very politely and mention that you're still learning English, and then ask that they try to speak a little more slowly. Native speakers think faster and louder is the solution when you didn't catch something so try to just tell them that you can't speak and understand as quickly as they can.\n\nThe more your immerse the faster you'll catch on, so switch your media diet to English as much as possible and try to just enjoy it. You'll notice pretty quickly that you're able to do most activities without much trouble.",

There are going to be places on campus and probably around town that are basically just for international students to practice speaking in English.",

      "text": "I'm a non-native English speaker as well and I can understand the anxiety. I botched the speaking section on my toefl test and I'm not an eloquent speaker, even in my native language. But then after I met my friends, I realize, no one even trying to \"fix\" my English. They don't care if my grammar is wrong and only ask for confirmation if my pronounciation is a bit off/in a heavy accent. And the professors are also never mention about any of the students' English ability.\n\nBeing in a new country and new school is overwhelming so even communicating can be hard. But really, the committee thinks your English is adequate, so trust their judgement. It's not a fluke or anything. Give yourself some time to adjust to the new environment and you will be okay",

As long as I can understand it I don\u2019t really care how it\u2019s said.\n\nBut then again, I only speak English and I\u2019m not an eloquent speaker at all.",
