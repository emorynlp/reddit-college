  "text": "My primary laptop is almost at the end of its lifespan and I am planning to buy an M1 Mac Mini as my primary work-station. I am primarily torn between choosing the 8 GB vs 16 GB. My question is 8GB enough? Do any of you have any experience?\n\nConstraints: Need to save as much $$$ as possible, so I do not really have the luxury to go for the 16 GB, unless if I really need to.\n\nNot interested in the iPad, although I agree it's pretty great! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am sorry if it's off-topic. I posted in the appropriate subreddits and got almost no decisive answers. I just thought, given the use-case are more similar to the people of this subreddit, I might get a better response here.\n\nThanks!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/rbj2zi)",
