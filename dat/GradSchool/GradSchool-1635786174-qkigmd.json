      "text": "It can depend on what specific field you're in. I would look into your department first. They may have internal grants and scholarships that you can apply for. Then I would look into societies that relate to your study. For example, I study birds (specifically raptors) so I am part of the American Ornithological Society, the raptor research foundation, Sigma Xi and a few more. Your advisor may actually have a few suggestions for you so I would ask them what they may recommend. Those societies also typically host conferences as well as scholarships and grants. \n\nYou could also ask other grad students in your department what scholarships and grants they have applied for in the past.",
