  "text": "Hi! \n\nI am a first year and I am starting my  4 week rotation with my first choice lab today. They have desk rotations, so we just sort of shadow a group member in the lab and get to know people. \n\nI'm kinda nervous because this is my first choice group, and I've been told it's one of the more competitive ones to join (they are only taking  3 people and I suspect more than that will have them as the top choice). \n\nThe PI was the one recruiting me to the program, and I sat in on his groups meetings during the summer, so I'm hoping that helps my case as I was the only one doing that. I want to make sure I stand out during my rotation and make sure I have a the best possible chance of getting in this lab. What can I do?",

      "text": "If you rotated in that lab in the summer, you\u2019re likely at the top of the pile in terms of one of the slots, assuming you\u2019re not terrible.\n\nBest thing to do to stand out:  act like you\u2019re not rotating, that you\u2019re actually in that lab already, in terms of how much effort and work you put in.\n\nMake them see you as a valued team member that is possible of long-term success in the lab.",
