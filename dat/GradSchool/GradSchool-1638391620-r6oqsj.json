  "text": "Are you planning on visiting your home country? I\u2019m asking because I\u2019ve been planning on going o home for a while given that I haven\u2019t seen my family for years. In the light of the new variant, I\u2019m terrified that the travel bans will resume leaving me stranded and causing harm to my visa status. (Not to mention actually contracting and spreading the virus despite being vaccinated)\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell, but I\u2019m due to travel next week and I have to make a decision fairly soon. I\u2019m leaning towards staying though. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to get your perspectives on this!",

      "text": "I managed to get a RA position with no teaching duties, made arrangements with the professor supporting me with his grant and with my advisor, and went to visit family in the beginning of November.\n\nI'm currently in a battle with the consulate to get my visa renewed (I'm eligible for an emergency appointment), and I'm planning to return to my program on the first week of January.\n\nThere were no new variants when I came home. I have no idea of what will happen next, but every time I got too pessimistic, nothing of the worst I thought could happen ever happened. So I will not stress over it, keep my travel plans back, and whatever happens, happens. I'm just too tired to care.",

      "text": "I'm in Aus and have flights booked to go back to Canada on the 9th. Stressed because for the first time since covid started they were supposed to open the borders on Dec 1 to allow international students to enter the country, but they just pushed that back to the 15th. Obviously the 15 is another deadline they may decide to extend if the situation warrants it. So I'm worried if I go home I'll not be able to get back in to continue my PhD. Not sure what to do yet",

I feel kind of weird because I haven't been back since the start of the pandemic and I had already started making plans for going back for the Winter break before Omicron was announced. I guess the upside of not visiting home for almost two years is that I have the experience of the previous Christmas too and I know that I can have a good time in my current country as well. Plus I wouldn't feel safe travelling right now in any case!",
