  "text": "I'm in a grad program. I have autism and anxiety. My advisor, prior to knowing this suggested I \"go get counseling \" because of my \"need for reassurance\". I've since asked her perfectly reasonable questions about late policy, etc. Her assignments dates change constantly, so this is reasonable. Other people have complained about her and her rudeness. She's since put me on an action plan for \"excessive communication\". Any advice? I'm really hating life right now.",

At many schools, they work with students who have chronic issues, and then recommend accommodations to faculty.\n\nThis because faculty are not qualified to evaluate someone's specific needs. So maybe your teacher didn't express things quite as well as they could, but the normal process is to work with other university services.",

          "text": "I second this. Although, forewarning, the university counseling service may try to shepherd you out of the university, but you should not leave if you don't want to. Also, I've heard that at certain elite universities, the office of student disability services is not particularly helpful, but you should also try to receive help there, because that will be where you see the most help, if at all.",

      "text": "Your advisor sounds like a dickhead, but if she didn't know about your issues potentially she is just a bad supervisor, not specifically an ableist one. If she's put you on the 'action plan' because of your autism and anxiety which she knows about that's discrimination. \n\nI have had mixed results from telling supervisors about my mental health problems (OCD), one has been really welcoming and accommodating, the other started communicating with me even less than he already was because he didn't want to 'trigger anything' by giving me bad news. I'd suggest going through disability services if you feel like you need her to know about your situation and change her behavior to accommodate it, but if she's just an asshole to all her students then maybe a student union/student representative (if you have one) would be a better option.",
