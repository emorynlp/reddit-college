  "text": "Hi! I am a first year PhD student and I just took a class in the business school. I loved the class and want to pitch a study to the professor. However, I am still working on getting my original primary study going with my main PI. Do I need to ask mY PI\u2019s permission? I feel perfectly capable of working on multiple projects at once",

      "text": "Another consideration---who/what is paying you? If you're being funded centrally by the department or on your own fellowship this isn't too much a concern, but if you are being funded by your primary advisor then it is absolutely critical to get their approval to take on additional projects with other professors.\n\nMore generally, it is good to be on the same page with your primary advisor to make sure you're making good progress overall and determine whether an additional project is more likely to help or hinder you. My advisor is encouraging of me to take on my own collaborations, but we talk through the ideas first to discuss how productive each opportunity or idea is.",
