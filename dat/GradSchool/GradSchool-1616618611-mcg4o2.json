  "text": "Honestly, I feel awful. I don\u2019t tend to be open about my mental health or how difficult it has been in my program so I don\u2019t think many of my friends know that it has been rough. I went from a T100 uni to a T10 PhD program surrounded by students that went to the best universities in the world. \n\nI will be honest and say I have been a shitty friend. I have spent the last eight months working, reading and frankly just trying to catch up (skill and academia wise) with the rest of my cohort. I am behind; I am not on the level as some of my cohort members. The little free time I have had I decided to use to spend with my partner. \n\nGoing forward, I don\u2019t know how I can make this situation better. My program is across the country and it is only going to get harder. I have let my friend know what I have been going through but I don\u2019t want to negate/overshadow her feelings.",

This is the worst time for everyone and the fact that this friend is burdening you with their criticisms while you take on this massive task in the midst of a pandemic is really unfair. You're/They're not the only one feeling that way. We've all lost touch with one another a little bit and we need to understand and heal, not cast unfair criticisms.",

I have lots of friends who I love to death, but they will hear from me MAYBE twice a semester and it's likely they won't see me until the summer. The only people I really speak to on a daily basis are my colleagues (mostly to vent about courses) and my partner (who is literally my rock through all of the stress-induced panic attacks).\n\nThis is our time to be selfish. I strongly believe the people who matter will be ok with a brief check-in every few weeks, and they will be there to cheer us on when we finally get that degree.",

I don't really want to take time off to have fun.  I have schoolwork up the wazoo right now, I am focused and driven to get it done, and if you are a true friend, you will understand and go to lunch with someone who isn't draped over a computer right now.\n\nHigher education is tough, it's your thing at this moment in time, and you keep doing you.  Friends--real friends--get it, understand, and put their own little needs aside for you for a bit as you work your butt off to get through it.",

There's only so many things that we can do within a day. The workload never ends with work and thesis writing. Not to mention writing is also a never ending task. \n\nI rarely go out for lunch dates anymore with friends. I only have time for 20 minutes lunch/dinner on my own schedule which is just not possible with friends. The close friends that I have, many of them ping me on their own. Just to ask how I am and sort of promise to make plans for the future. \n\nYou're not a shitty friend, honestly. This thing called PhD demands a lot from us. The thesis, the paper, online conferences, review cycles and administration work is just A LOT.",

If your friend can\u2019t be more understanding and supportive about how overwhelmed you are, then they are not a good friend.\n\nYou are barely surviving. This is just not a season in your life when you can have the same friendships as you did in your pre-PhD season, and that\u2019s okay. You will be prioritizing different things at different times in your life.",

Tbh, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being shitty at all. \n\nBut, I\u2018ll know they\u2019re shitty if they marry for example and don\u2019t let me know.",

I think this person was a shit friend for telling you this and for holding it against you.\n\nI've kept in touch with a bunch of friends from high school and college, and friends of friends who became part of my social circle shortly after graduating.  Some of them have gone on to pursue graduate or medical school, and many of them haven't.  Those of us who didn't were under no delusions about what it meant. Grad school is permanent crunch time, period.  It's a 4+ year hiatus from the friendship.  We keep in touch in the group chat and feel lucky for the very few times during those years that we do actually get to see each other in person.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to make the situation better.  It is your friend's responsibility to be supportive.  By all means, be kind to your friend and try to get them to understand what you're going through.  But if they can't or won't, absolutely do not feel guilty about it.",

The quality of friendships doesn't depend on how much time people spend together. It depends on mutual understanding and love. My good friend is taking his masters and doesn't have time for anything else either. That's just life.\n\nSo I tell him I miss him and hope he's doing good. I check in with him once in a while, because mental health can take a nose dive. I know he would absolutely return the favour when it's my turn. As a good friend, I don't want him to feel guilty. I remind him this is only temporary and we can catch up once he's done.\n\nAs students, we can tell people we miss them too, and that we can catch up during breaks. Send them short texts we're thinking of them and acknowledge our absence from their lives. Sometimes people don't know better ways to tell us they miss us so we could probably take it less personally when they call us shitty friends. It's tough both ways so don't feel bad.",

      "text": "Hey OP, the comments are very echo chamber-y so I think you should take it with a grain of salt. As someone who\u2019s also trying to get their PhD and having interacted with people in this space (i.e academia), I have come to realize that we are not the best sort at being the kind of friends people want. I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone, I think it\u2019s the nature of the thing. That being said, you probably are being shitty friend. And friendships like any other kind of relationships might outgrow a person... lives change, people change, shit happens. If your friend decides that this friendship isn\u2019t serving them how they believe it should, then it is what it is. Your friend\u2019s feelings are valid and if you\u2019re busy then it is what it is.  \n\nI get vibes from the comments here that people (outside of the PhD) are just expected to put up with whatever time people getting the PhD is willing to offer - seems shitty to me. This is a tough road and not all relationships survive, friendships or otherwise. I hope you can work something out with your friend though, losing friends is difficult. I don\u2019t have grand advice because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much you can do given the circumstances, I just wanted to offer an opinion that differed from the majority of the comments. I think sometimes people can take advantage of thinking that this friend or that friend will just be available when they\u2019re ready to resume a normal life. I find people take friends for granted in this space, but that\u2019s just been my experience.",

To our old friends from before we started, to our current friends and cohort-mates, to our significant others, to our family, to our self (mental health, self care, just time to BREATHE) this life is not an easy one and most of us are doing our best and that is not always going to match up with what other people need or even want from us. \n\nI\u2019m commending the people in the comments saying stuff like it\u2019s right to be sorry for not being able to give more, but it\u2019s not right to feel like you\u2019re a bad person because of it. You\u2019re not doing it out of malice and you\u2019re not taking your friends for granted, you\u2019re just stretched really fucking thin. The good news is, it\u2019s temporary!

I don\u2019t know what OP\u2019s relationship with this particular friend is like and we\u2019re also getting one side of the story. I think we can all come up with anecdotes about knowing a person who does it all versus someone who can only manage 2 extra things while in their program. My comment mostly served to express to OP that there are two sides to this and don\u2019t take the echo chamber comments at face value. However, the comments seem to be more polarized now than at the time of my initial comment.\n\nEh, calling someone a shitty friend doesn\u2019t mean people think they are a \u201cbad person\u201d. I think at the end of the day, OP obviously feels like this person is important enough as a friend to make a Reddit post about. I agree with another post that mentioned setting reminders to text/call the person seems like a solid idea. Hot take: I think if OP wanted to carve out time to connect with this friend, they would.",

I\u2019ve narrowed my friendships to the ones I find meaningful and sustainable, and I invest in them and compromise at the same level they do. \n\nThis feels odd coming from the same crowd that is very vocal about maintaining a work-life balance, only working 40 hrs a week as much as possible, so on.

It can be sad but it should not make OP feel guilty. (And if friend makes OP feel guilty on purpose, then friend is a crummy friend.)",

I think it's important to be up front with people about what you can offer and if that doesn't work for them then that's ok. It's the friends for a reason, friends for a season, friends for life situation. Once I realized the season of some friendships had faded, it made it easier. \n\nWe can't do it all and shouldn't try.",

      "text": "I've become a worse friend and family member over the course of my PhD. I felt (and feel) guilty about it, but I remind myself that this is literally the most logistically complex thing I've dealt with in my life. I boom and bust, sometimes I spend days pulling myself together for a stressful deadline or meeting or interaction. I'm trying very hard to be professional and supportive of the people in my direct workspace and figure out my next steps, so by the end of the day my brain just shuts off. I have a lot of supportive friends and family who want to help, but the only thing I can really ask them for right now is patience.\n\nThat being said, isolation can really do damage. I found myself in a cycle of not being in contact, and then feeling too guilty to resume communication. The stress also made me feel incredibly vulnerable, so I became more avoidant to avoid dreaded questions like \"how are you?\" from friends and family outside the program. Waiting it out is not the answer.\n\nIf this friend is important to you, I think it's important to set expectations that allow you to be a reliable friend even if you're not around often. Figure out what time and effort you can provide, cut yourself a margin for stress inflation, and then ask your friend about one thing you can do that fits within those limits.\n\n* A phone call every 4 or 6 weeks isn't a ton of time with your friend, but it's something you can both look forward to.\n* Pick an emoji that means  \"can't talk, still alive, thinking of you\" that you can ping out once a week or so.\n* Avoid nebulous commitments - being more present in the group chat or texting more often is an unclearly defined stressor when I don't know how I'll feel week to week. Give yourself a system.",

If OP had not provided reciprocity (as s/he has recognized), then it is actually quite reasonable for the friend to indicate that s/he does not find that satisfactory. Further, it is mature to bring it up in case it is something that can be satisfactorily resolved; for example, in case OP was unaware of the friend\u2019s view or there had been a misunderstanding. Because the friend brought up the issue, the parties can each (and hopefully collectively) now make informed decisions about the future of the friendship.",
