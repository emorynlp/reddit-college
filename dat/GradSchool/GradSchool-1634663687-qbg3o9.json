  "text": "I have a zoom interview (first ever) tomorrow for a grad school program. It\u2019s pretty last minute (scheduled it yesterday) and I don\u2019t have a ton of time to prepare. I also feel like I\u2019m trying to cram potential questions and answers into my brain and I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. Any tips? \n\nShould I just focus on a few possible questions and wing the rest? I was told it will only take 15-30 min so that\u2019s not very long and not sure how many questions they can even ask in that time frame. TIA!!",
