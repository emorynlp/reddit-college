  "title:": "Defending my dissertation on Tuesday, is it normal to feel this anxious?",
  "text": "As stated in the title, I'm defending my diss on Tuesday (finally!). If it was just a matter of answering the questions posed by the examination committee, I don't think it would be so bad; I've already gone over their reports, they're all extremely positive and even include many suggestions for publication in the future.\n\nIt's the presentation. It's strange: between teaching, conferences, invited talks, etc. I have prepared hundreds of presentations since I began my PhD. None have caused me as much anxiety as this one. \n\nIs this normal? Am I massively over-reacting or over-thinking it? Is my committee going to watch me bomb my presentation and say, \"whelp, we clearly can't give this person a doctorate, back to the drawing board,\" cause that's been the subject of my nightmares for the past week.",

      "text": "This is absolutely normal!!  Although in other presentations we don't feel as much anxiety, presentations that involve a direct judgment (such as defending a dissertation) are very anxiogenic. \n\nTry to practice as much as possible, to breath, and to remember that no one knows more than you about your work!\n\nYou got this!",

The questions you are likely to hear are going to address the reliability of your methods and the logic that contributed to developing your conclusions. You know this stuff. You're going to be fine.",

If you've received positive feedback from your committee, and your advisor said you were ready to defend, then the dissertation defense is more of a formality. A chance to talk about your dissertation in a more formal setting.",
