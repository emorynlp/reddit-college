      "text": "Hey, I'm in social sciences but I just did one of these over the weekend. It was 30 minutes long, with a panel of 3-4 faculty. Mostly it was just to get to know each other and the institution. In my situation, the two substantive questions I was asked were \"how would you teach an intro course in [subfield]\" in addition to a state-of-the-discipline question asked by the faculty member closest in research interest to me.\n\nHope that helps!",
