      "text": "Hey, I'm in social sciences but I just did one of these over the weekend. It was 30 minutes long, with a panel of 3-4 faculty. Mostly it was just to get to know each other and the institution. In my situation, the two substantive questions I was asked were \"how would you teach an intro course in [subfield]\" in addition to a state-of-the-discipline question asked by the faculty member closest in research interest to me.\n\nHope that helps!",

In my case it will be 2 faculty and its a Biomedical Science program but it would make sense for them to ask about my knowledge of the field (Molecular Therapeutics) given my experiences. When you say get to know, did they ask why this program?? Thank you in advance!",
