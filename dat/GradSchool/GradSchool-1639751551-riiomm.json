  "text": "I submitted my final paper for this sem. I have survived my first semester of graduate school! (I think) I can't feel really accomplished right now as our grades aren't posted yet (maybe on January). It feels so nice to have no deadlines to stress about. Grad school really made me cherish having free time. Happy holidays!",
