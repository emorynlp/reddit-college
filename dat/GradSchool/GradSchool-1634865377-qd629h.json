  "title:": "Debating on switching advisors a year into my masters",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been in my lab group for a little over a year now. I\u2019m the only masters student (the rest are PhDs) and I feel like my boss unfairly compares me to them a lot, especially when I make mistakes. Most of them had also worked with him as an undergrad researcher as well. He\u2019s very disengaged and isn\u2019t very patient with me. I have to rely on other graduate students for help to get things done the way he likes but even then he finds fault with the things I do. I feel like no matter how hard I work on things or make a genuine effort, I\u2019m never enough or he finds something wrong with it. I\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s not a very well liked person in his field because a lot of his colleagues think he\u2019s a jerk. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m so far behind everyone because I don\u2019t have the experience they do and I\u2019m burning out really bad because I always feel like I have to be working. Plus he is notorious for giving unrealistic deadlines and I feel as though my time as a student isn\u2019t respected either. I also feel guilty when I take time off on weekends even though the other graduate students do the same. \n\nI have a weird position where I\u2019m staff/graduate student at the same time, so I get paid more. This is great and all, but since my boss throws that in my face every time I make a mistake and gets frustrated with me, I feel as though I don\u2019t deserve my job. I thought as I learned more and gained more experience I would become more confident, but I\u2019m struggling really hard. I\u2019m not really sure what to do at this point.",
