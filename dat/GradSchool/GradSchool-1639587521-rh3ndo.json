I have to constantly remind myself that my, honestly, terrible application for grad school was accepted and is already a sort of validation in itself: that a committee of faculty members saw the potential in me to learn and grow in the program. Reminding myself that I am still a student and by telling myself I'm not good enough, is really just setting me back when I could be thriving. Using those feelings to push me to try to get through (I have an avoidant personality) and once something is graded, to not second guess it and move on, to how I can improve (if a low grade) by talking to my professor/PI, or reading the notes to see what I did well, and *hang onto that*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wasn't the smartest person in my program, for example. I wasn't making huge waves. I didn't get any scholarships, or awards, or accolades. I was there to learn, grow, and get a degree, which few others had the opportunity to do. But I was strong at organization. I was strong at analyzing. Use your strengths to help you build up your weaknesses. Honestly, sometimes you just have to forking go and do the damn thing, and you will.",

I switched from the major I started 31 years ago and started small. It gave the boost to go to full time. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but I\u2019ve been growing mentally stronger as I go. This semester, I got a B and didn\u2019t have a meltdown over it. I start grad school in a month and I am truthfully scared to death, but one of the major features of my mental illness is avoiding anything that is hard, uncomfortable or otherwise challenging. Can\u2019t fail if you don\u2019t start, right? Saturday, I will graduate with my BA, three decades after starting it. That\u2019s pretty big. The MA is going to be tough. I\u2019m less qualified than your average MA student in my department because I was allowed some concessions on the prerequisites. So I\u2019m starting out behind the curve. It could blow up spectacularly. But I\u2019m medicated, stable and in therapy, and by some miracle, I\u2019m fully funded. I am out of excuses. If it doesn\u2019t pan out, I will be disappointed, but not near as disappointed as if gave up before starting. I think it\u2019s critical to get your mental and physical toolbox fully stocked and then keep tabs on yourself along the way.",

If I am ever unable to see her (if one of us moves, etc.) at least now I know what to look for. My take is, if your therapy sessions are mostly just shooting the shit with someone, but you have bigger mental health concerns than situational stressors, it\u2019s not enough. I needed someone with a plan. Someone who called me out on my BS. Someone who was honest about why I wasn\u2019t getting better. Before her, I got a lot of platitudes verbally while my file was loaded with \u201cnon-compliant\u201d and \u201ccombatant\u201d.

I struggle with anxiety and depression and these things will probably never NOT be a part of my life, but I've spent a lot of time in grad school in therapy (thank you amazing union health insurance) and I have the tools to handle my mental health most days. \n\nPlus my advisor and lab group are absolutely amazing and supportive - our advisor makes us take 4 weeks off (like, completely off, no emails, no work, nothing) per year (2 in the summer, two in the winter, or split up however you like.) She has the kind of mindset of 'as long as the work gets done, you can work however/whenever you want', which has been a godsend for making sure I can take care of regular life things during the working week, and taking breaks when I need to. My work-life balance in grad school is honestly so much better than it was when I was working as a tech after college - and I have access to things like a free gym, craft center, dance classes, etc that all help my mental health.\n\nMy first year sucked because I didn't really know how to prioritize and plan around my mental health, I had multiple breakdowns and panic attacks and finally landed in crisis counseling when I couldn't take it any more. In retrospect, I wish I had just gone in to counseling before the crisis, maybe I could have avoided it.\n\nI know I'm probably in the minority of grad students in terms of my experience. I don't say this to brag, but to show hopeful applicants that a positive grad school experience where you can take care of your mental health is possible. Don't be afraid to prioritize your needs and look for a place that will be a supportive environment for you. Don't be afraid to take medication or go to therapy.  Make a plan to take care of yourself.",

              "text": "Sure thing! Honestly nothing I changed was revolutionary. Sorry in advance for the novel-length comment :) I should also start with the disclaimers that I do not have children or family that I am caring for either physically or financially, and I know those things are big mental health contributors for many people, so I just want to state that I do not experience those stressors. I do live with a chronic physical health condition that affects my day to day life but the flares are related to my anxiety, so getting that under control has helped with my symptoms.\n\ntl;dr: improving my time management skills, learning my anxiety/depression triggers & making a plan to deal with them, exercising regularly, having creative hobbies/pursuits, taking time off, extending compassion and grace to myself when I am struggling\n\n\\- I started going to group therapy once a week (a grad student specific group that the counseling center offers). Group was amazing for me as I had a chance to talk about the things that I was struggling with each week, and get advice as well as commiseration from other grads and the counselor leading the group. This was invaluable as it made me feel less alone in my experiences and I got to get feedback on my situation, as well as offer support to others struggling.\n\n\\- In this group and in individual therapy, we talked a lot about tools to cope with anxiety, procrastination, and time management. For me, proper time management is HUGE - if I am overwhelmed and don't even know where to start, I will continue to spiral and never actually get anything done. Prioritizing my goals/tasks using the [Urgency/Importance matrix](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm), a tool I learned in therapy, is really helpful. I also utilize Google calendar to block out time to work on specific tasks. I don't always stick to it exactly, but I feel less overwhelmed and anxious when I can look at my daily schedule and know what I have to do. \n\n\\- I started paying a lot more attention to what actually triggers my anxiety. I have general anxiety so it's there all the time, but certain things throw it into high gear, enough to disrupt how I live my life. Once I identified these triggers, I took some time when I was NOT anxious to make a plan for how to deal with them. This is probably gonna sound stupid but it works for me. Answering reviewer comments or responding to my advisor's comments on my papers gives me anxiety. So once I know I have to do that, I look at the comments, set a timer for like 20 minutes to feel my feelings, make a cup of my favorite tea and listen to some upbeat music, and then I sit down and work. This helps me complete the stress cycle that gets induced by anxiety and puts me in a better headspace to address comments without feeling as overwhelmed or anxious.\n\n\\- Exercise. I know this gets talked about a lot and it's so simple but man...it fucking works (for me.) I build time into my daily schedule to go to the gym, go on a walk, go swimming, or even just a light 10 minute yoga routine. It gets my mind off of my anxiety. It makes me feel strong and capable. It took me a while to figure out the kind of exercise that I like enough to keep doing it, but once I shifted my mindset from 'I work out to change my body' to 'I work out to keep my brain healthy' it got so much easier. Now I weight lift or go swimming at the campus gym a few times a week. If I don't work out for a week or so I can definitely tell! I get stressed MUCH more easily and my health condition flares up more intensely. \n\n\\- Having a creative hobby (or multiple). I paint, draw, play TTRPGs, sew, read, and am currently learning French. Having hobbies outside of grad school is, again, super simple, but making time for those things improves my mental health drastically. \n\n\\- Working 9-5. Taking evenings for myself. And weekends! I rarely work on weekends unless my animal work necessitates it. In the evenings I play video games, watch shows, work on my hobbies, hang out with my partner and friends, read books. Caveat to say that this only became possible once I was done with the coursework portion of my PhD. Homework fucking sucks but finishing classes freed up a LOT of time. \n\n\\- Another thing I learned in therapy: showing myself compassion when I struggle and feel like a failure. Knowing that it's not a reflection of my worth. Taking a break when I need to, to recuperate and come back mentally fresh and ready. Not beating myself up for not accomplishing a certain goal on time (and to that end, being flexible with my goals and the criteria I set for considering them achieved.)\n\nGrad school is hard. Doing these things doesn't mean it isn't. But it helps me focus on the challenges of my research and thesis, with less of an added burden from my mental health. I'm not perfect and this doesn't always work, I still have depressive periods especially in the winter where I just can't get anything done and feel super low for weeks. But I am in a MUCH better place in my fourth year than I was in my first, and I consider that a win. I hope this was helpful!",

Also, statistics have shown time and time again that richer people are MUCH less likely to have mental illness problems like depression and anxiety or dissatisfaction with life. There is also a lot of research about just how much socioeconomic status affects a person's developmental outcome that I won't get into here.\n\n> I just don't agree with the fact that mental health issues are more predominant in academia in comparison to people outside academia.\n\nI totally do lol. I've been preparing for exiting academia and have finally had the time to step outside the academic bubble for over a year. My non-academic contacts are all way less stressed, or if they're stressed, it's in different ways. They all have a clear boundary of time where they no longer have to work (5pm) and can use that time to do hobbies, socialize, whatever they want. Their workload in general is also much less difficult and mentally taxing. Sure, they still suffer from anxiety, depression, etc. (My partner is nowhere near academia and suffers from those two plus OCD, but she STILL thinks my grad school life is worse.) From my academia escape plan, I was able to get an RAship with an industry research grant (within academia), and the pay raise I got noticeably increased my quality of life overall. I also actually felt appreciated while doing my work now. This is in comparison to before my 2 term break from grad school, where I was struggling with depression, anxiety, and serious suicidal thoughts.\n\n> If you eat like crap and never exercise, you are more inclined to have poor physical health. \n\nCorrect. And guess what? Grad school drains me out so much that I can't even think of meal planning or health planning because all my mental resources are devoted to academic work. When I was away from academia, I was a lot healthier and had more time to actually cook nice meals for myself. \n\n> How many grad students practice good mental hygiene? How many go to therapy and meditate? \n\nHow do you know they don't try? Also, a more comfortable living environment contributes to good mental hygiene. And having more time and energy gives you the resources to better help your own mental health.  \n\n> I'm talking about severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia here.\n\nOk, but these aren't as common as depression and anxiety and have more specific ways to address them. You've also said you're suffering from GAD and depression, so the next point is more relevant to you.\n\n> Issues like anxiety and depression are very manageable if you actively work on it. \n\nAgreed. I've had instances in my life where my health was nearly completely under my control, and then it got worse again when I was back in grad school. The environment makes a huge difference, my friend. This is common knowledge in psychology. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure why you're saying this if you're saying you yourself are suffering from these two, yet you're saying they're manageable if you work on it. \n\n> It's just that a lot of grad students are bad at working on their mental health.\n\nIs it just that they're bad, or maybe also that the environment doesn't *let* them have much of a chance to work on it?\n\nAlso, aside from salary and more time, academia is a bit of a different beast because there's very little accountability within professors/supervisors, so toxic workplace behaviours are allowed to run unchecked (compared to outside of academia, where there are HR departments).",

Try talking to past PhD students to understand what kind of person your prospective advisor is. It should be someone who *truly* supervises you without micromanaging you. It should be someone who respects their PhD students. No insults, yelling, and stuff like that. Dealing with an abusive supervisor is hard even if you have no mental issues. So if you have OCD you should pick your supervisor very carefully. A supervisor should guide you. Some stress is inevitable. But it can be manageable if you have a good supervisor who actually supervises you.",

It doesn't help that I'm living completely alone for the first time ever, it's very isolating. It came to a head a little over halfway through the semester when I ended up at urgent care for heart palpitations and walked out with a xanax prescription. And even with a very supportive program, I still never reached out to anyone at my university about all this (which I know is a me problem, but I've just been too scared to look weak or look like I can't do this).\n\nIt's gotten better this last month or two, I finally got back into therapy and my friendships are slowly starting to form. But I genuinely thought I was going to be happy here, I LOVED undergrad, I was so excited to start school again and focus on my work and meet new people and make friends, I was EXCITED to be busy! But so far everything has been pretty miserable, even though I'm doing well academically. It's disappointing.",

Stuff happens along the way to throw you off the path, but you recover and keep going toward that goal with more knowlege. \n\nBeing able to make productive plans desipte great uncertainty. Research involves exploring the unknown, so you don't know what will happen. Being able to asses the relative likelihood of various outcomes, and reorienting appropriately when the time comes is resilience. \n\nDealing with ambiguity is another key area. Many goals, paths and feedbacks are ambiguous. Using the information at hand to move ahead--with confidence--in a reasonable direction is resilience. \n\nAll of these are learned skills. They come easier to some people than others, but nobody starts of with the skills. \n\nThis point is relevant to mental health, because the demands of graduate school will put a lot of stress on your mental health if you don't master the resiliance skills. Even the best grad student will suffer if they try to muddle through rather than build their skill set on something that may seem meta to their course of study.",

To say there aren\u2019t a lot of toxic people in academia who lack any amount of sympathy for the nuances of human mental complexity would be a lie. We all know that this environment and the bureaucracy of it all is very often toxic and archaic. \n\nSo although I can understand trying to warn people about the mental health issues, I can also see how these posts can read as: \u201cyou have mental health issues, you aren\u2019t cut out for grad school.\u201d Which is ableist, and a sentiment I know plenty of people in academia agree with, even if they don\u2019t outright say it. \n\nI think we need to constantly be reminded in these discussions that the underlying issue is the toxic environment itself. Edit: (specifically, these posts seem to make it all about whether you are capable of doing it, not that the system is shit and unhealthy). I wonder why mental health issues are 6 times more likely in graduate students compared to general population?\n\nI\u2019m a person with multiple sclerosis, along with anxiety and depression.

Also I wished my graduate school actually had useful mental health resources. At mine they are an absolute joke and almost intentionally.\n\n\n\nAll in all these kind of  \u201cbe careful\u201d posts bother me because they\u2019re way too simplified and don\u2019t always get to the real issues.

Grad school has the trade-off of unstructured and unbounded work in exchange for being able to dedicate your time to something that hopefully matters to you because you care about the subject (not hustling just because your boss put you on an arbitrary deadline).  I think this cuts both ways for a lot of people.  \n\nIn my case, though it\u2019s only my first semester, I feel more motivated to challenge myself with the newfound autonomy than at any other point in my life, though the lack of any discernible goal-posts is admittedly scary.  My mental health (anxiety and depression for me) has overall gotten better because at the very least I\u2019m spiraling about my choices a little less knowing that I\u2019m ultimately accountable to myself and my own passions as a job, something which I get paid to do.  Even though it\u2019s like 1/5 of what I got in tech, I feel like I have one less existential cross to bear because I\u2019m finally using my mind in a way where I feel both its worth and the importance of the tasks at hand.  I imagine people who find fulfilling jobs in industry and the NGO world feel similarly, I just couldn\u2019t wade through the B.S. to get there, it turns out.",

      "text": "The advice is valid, but I would like to add a slight variation in perspective: The people are not at fault, the system is (see [here](https://www.science.org/content/article/fix-system-not-women) for the gist). \n\nMental illness can affect everyone, but the coping success essentially depends on the individual's resources. It is sad and detrimental that people who have little resources are going to have a hard time coping with the stress in grad school. It should not be this way. Ideally, universities should provide and promote mental health counselling (many already do) and the academic culture should change (e.g., focus should shift from quantity (publish or perish) to quality). Unfortunately, the second seems like a distant goal. \n\nCurrently, it seems reasonable to avoid the stress inherent in grad school. However, this likely leads to mostly privileged people making it to grad school & academia (based on personal experience, this is already the case). Again, it should not be this way and less privileged people should be able to go to grad school too.",

      "text": "I chose the best grad program for me. Two classes a semester is considered full time, it\u2019s a two year program, and they have fully online, In-person, or hybrid instruction. Feels really good that they are flexible and the program is for people who work full time already so they do have a good amount of assignments, but it relates to our field of teaching and are flexible where we do out student teaching placements. So much less stressful than my undergraduate program at a different university.",

I won\u2019t say it\u2019s easy, because I\u2019m definitely always crying and anxious, but what helps me to at least push to the finish line is: an army of support outside of school, having at least someone to confide in the program, I have therapy 1-2 times a week and I\u2019m on ptsd/adhd medication and anti-depressants. \n\nDo I plan to get a PhD? Hell no, just collecting my MA and leaving. I realize my mental health is priority, and at least my school and my undergrad are/were super ableist, and that doesn\u2019t help me make the most of how neuro-divergent I learn or to cope with the spells of depression and anxiety.",

If it were a walk in the park, everyone would have advanced degrees.\n\nI went through the same exact thing as you. At one point, I was depressed to the point of suicide. But I got through it. And you will too.\n\nMake sure you have a good advisor. That is the #1 factor that makes or breaks a grad student.\n\nIf you need to talk, I am here for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out. Having a support system is super duper important.",

      "text": "It's an absurdly high number of graduate students who will develop mental health problems either way, so I don't think mental health should rule out grad school. It just means being extremely proactively in making sure you have ongoing mental health care, along with regularly checking in with yourself to make sure you're aware of your headspace before things ramp up to 100.\n\n\nI've been in treatment since I was a teenager and will probably *always* be in treatment. My mix of diagnoses (ADHD, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety) make it *really hard* to manage stress, so my first semester was spent in a really bad headspace. \n\n\nIronically, grad school helped despite starting so horribly. In undergrad, my unhealthy coping mechanisms worked well enough, so it was super easy to sweep them under the rug or to believe they were working. Now, in this environment that's less forgiving, I have to confront that something *isn't* working, and that's helped to get more pointed help in treatment than I had for a while. \n\n\nI'm also fortunate, though, in that I have some supportive faculty and at least one friend in my cohort who understands chronic mental illness. I would probably be miserable if the expectation was to act and perform exactly like a neurotypical person, but being able to work to my strengths and around my weaknesses has made it possible for me to do some great work so far. IMO, we need more academics who have experienced mental health struggles so that environment continues to improve.",
