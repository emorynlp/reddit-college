  "title:": "Supervisor doesn't care about my mental health",
  "text": "I'm coming to the end of the third year of my PhD and the entire process  has been a massive roller coaster for my mental health. This has come in various forms, such as often being depressed and feeling worthless and having a complete mental breakdown at the end of 2020 which caused me  to  develop PTSD and agoraphobia, something which I am still in therapy  for. After taking a step back recently and trying to recalibrate my  brain, I'm almost certain these are all because of the toxic environment my supervisor has created. What I mean by this is that I am often pushed to produce more work via guilt (two examples often used is to ask if or just state that I don't care about my research anymore or to tell me off for not having done any work over the weekend).\n\nI  have had to take time off several times this year (while still doing   some part time research, mostly due to guilt), and am currently on leave (at around 3-4 weeks now) due to complete mental breakdowns related to   the stressed of my PhD coupled with the PTSD and agoraphobia. Thankfully, I have recently seen huge improvements in my mental health through a new psychologist! Unfortunately, several times each week I   receive either emails from my supervisor or messages from fellow PhD   students  who my supervisor has asked to message me under their name to   know when I am coming back so we can get back to work. I have mostly ignored these or responded courteously, however my supervisor requested a zoom meeting on Friday.\n\nIn the  meeting I was asked sarcastically if I \"was coming back this year or next,\" and \"how much longer is it going to take!?\" From my perspective was clear that my supervisor just wanted me to come back irrespective of my situation. I understand his perspective, since I do contribute to   his research output, however I found the whole process disgusting since he clearly did not care about my health.\n\nIs my response to this an overreaction or am I justified in my anger? Is there anything I can do to put myself in a better position?",

      "text": "Are you working with disability services and/or university psychological counselors at your institution?\n\nMany universities rely on such departments to both evaluate mental health issues, and then inform faculty and other supervisors of accommodations that should be made. This because faculty and other supervisors are not qualified to do that kind of evaluation or to determine the accommodation that should be made.\n\nSo if that option is available to you, you should do so immediately, instead of expecting your supervisor to understand what's going on.\n\nAnd if you are working with disability services or a university counselor, you need to take your problem to them and let them address it with your supervisor.",

The disability resource center made it very clear that they could only help with accomodations related to classes and that anything outside of class is HRs responsibility. HR made it clear that they were only responsible for accomodations needed for my to do my TA/GA job.\n\nNobody is responsible for the time I spend in the lab, AKA the majority of my time in a PhD. When I spoke to the department chair they said that if I was struggling then perhaps my area \"wasn't for me\". \n\nThe only way things got better was by moving labs.",

The post is even tagged \"health and work/life balance\" which pretty much implies a conversation about personal experiences. And since I have actual personal experience of being a disabled graduate student, that's what I wrote about. Good job ignoring that part of my posts though.  \n\nKinda funny that you would throw out some (totally inappropriate) stats comment and then recommend Kahneman, who has admitted that he placed too much importance on underpowered studies. Don't get me wrong, it's a neat book, was an enjoyable read, and he is clearly brilliant, but the book is pretty overhyped I think.\n\n[https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/20/placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes/](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/20/placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes/)\n\nAnyways, from my sample size of two of your comments, it seems like you might find Mark Borg's book \"Don't Be A Dick: Change Yourself, Change your world\" to be extremely useful in both your professional and personal life. \n\n  \n[https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Be-Dick-Change-Yourself/dp/1949481026](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Be-Dick-Change-Yourself/dp/1949481026)",

The fact that your supervisor is saying this and (I assume) not giving you sympathy shows he\u2019s in the wrong. At best he has no idea how mental illness works and should know better.\n\nIdk who to contact but at minimum you shouldn\u2019t let his bothering affect you taking time off to fix your mental health.\n\nYou\u2019re right that your supervisor should want you to come back, but he should also want you to have good mental health even if it means you take leaves of absence. In the long run, you won\u2019t perform as well or get as much done with poor mental health.",
