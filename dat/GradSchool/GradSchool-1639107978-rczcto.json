  "title:": "Any summer graduates have no break in between undergrad and grad?",
  "text": "I am in a bit of an unusual situation where I am graduating my bachelors in the summer and heading to grad school in the fall. I was recently accepted to my first program so this is definitely the plan. However, this means I will have little to no gap between finishing undergrad and starting grad school (2 weeks to a month). \n\nThis is making me a bit stressed thinking about the logistics of getting everything together, moving across the country, etc in such a short period of time. Has anyone gone through the same thing or have any tips for planning the transition?",

      "text": "I also had to move in a very short time, so I feel you. The most stressful thing was feeling like I had an infinite number of things to do. So first thing: make a master document of all the things you need to do so you know exactly what needs to get done and when. Start with the most general, top level things, and then fill out from there. This is what some of my moving master doc looked like (I wasn't so neat about it but it got the job done): [https://imgur.com/a/36rnjxq](https://imgur.com/a/36rnjxq)\n\nI also organized everything according to what had to get done when. Start doing this as early as possible because it sucks scrambling to get shit done on move out day.\n\nThe specific moving logistics will depend on how much stuff you're taking with you. I'm the opposite of a hoarder and had few qualms with throwing/selling stuff, so I packed everything I wanted to keep into boxes and shipped them to someone in the same city, so all I had to do when I actually moved was fly with my luggage. Weigh the cost of moving your stuff against the actual value of that stuff, especially for furniture.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help, including from current grad students if they're friendly. At one of the places I was considering but ultimately decided against, grad students volunteered to look at houses for people/facetime during an apartment tour. The person I kept my stuff with was a current grad student who went to my undergrad. Almost anything logistically difficult can be solved with either money or a friend's help.",

              "text": "I've always gone with unfurnished because they tend to be cheaper, I don't have to worry about accidentally damaging anything, and it's relatively easy to find cheap furniture, especially if you're willing to buy secondhand. Depending on the area and time of year too, you can get a ton of free stuff from people (esp students) moving out. Just don't buy any cloth-based things (like couches) secondhand unless you're willing to risk bed bugs. Order a mattress so that it arrives on your move-in date so you have somewhere to sleep. Everything else you can get later.",

      "text": "I graduated in the spring but I moved to start grad school in the summer, ending up with about 2 weeks of a break in between.  It's really not so bad!! Every program is different but just starting you're going to have some sort of orientation things the first few days, so that will be a nice and slow start and give you some free time to unpack, buy things you may need, grocery shop, etc.  Even though you're finishing up school in the summer, you can still work on getting things together that you'll need when you move!  Also, if you have the time, I would suggest getting into town early, even if it's just a few days - that will also give you some time to get things figured out and feel less stressed about the time crunch!",
