I do have one that connects to another project. The other two tho? Just seems like busy work during the most stressful time. We wrote papers throughout the semester about the course material- why keep this up? It just seems so pointless. I'm stressed out over family stuff and this just seems to serve no real purpose. Any explanatory, helpful, or motivational comments appreciated.",

Friends that did their PhDs in Europe said they were brought on, they had X years to finish, then at the end of that they presented their work and a judgment was made.\n\nContrast that with the US system where degrees can seemingly be perpetual for some and not for others. I'm currently in this situation with a colleague who is getting \"fast-tracked\" through; I voiced my concern at this, asking why the standards are so different and the response I got was words to the effect of, \"don't take it personally, we are just setting you up for success, it isn't a race!\"\n\nIt's not about a race!

I can try to choose paper topics related to my interests but the fact that the material is so wildly different means that most of the research I do for coursework is not something I will pursue again. It isn't exactly a waste of time, but right now, with limited capacity for focused attention and a crushing sense of doom, it certainly feels that way. \n\nWhile I am all for growing up and taking responsibility I also think its realistic to lower expectations for quality research papers in coursework.

Everything you are taking should, in some way, benefit you. I took plenty of classes I had no interest in but I needed to take them for either research purposes, teaching purposes, or because someone who had a grad degree in a certain field is presumed to have mastery over a certain subject. Grad school does not equal undergrad in any way and if people are unhappy with what it requires they have the free will to leave. Otherwise you put your head down and do the work.",
