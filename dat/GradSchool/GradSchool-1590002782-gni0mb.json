  "text": "So after facing dismissal from my PhD program for earning two C\u2019s [(Background Story)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gi0rzh/failed_a_course_phd_program_is_probably_done/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), the PhD committee met and decided to allow me to continue on to my qualifying exam! Both my mentor and I wrote letters explaining exactly what was going on in my life and I was apologetic for not being more open about my struggles. I\u2019m also taking a seminar series to improve my writing skills this summer. \n\nI advise anyone who is struggling to be open with their professors before shit hits the fan. I have trouble asking for help or letting people know that I am struggling and let my pride get the better of me. I have managed to get through some pretty rough situations in the past but this does not make me invincible. Grad school, especially a PhD is not a program that you can just get by in by going through the motions.",

              "text": "For sure. Create strong connections with all committee members. The easiest way to do this is to find the one that is MOST relevant to your work and just occasionally seek their guidance on your work's theory/angle/whatever. \n\nDo the same for your program coordinator. Both the head honcho faculty and the admin person. Don't pester them for scientific/etc advice, but make sure they know when you are getting antsy, or you feel you are coming off the rails. They should care about the students of the program first. \n\nIf you have any sort of mental or other disability, make sure it's on record with campus if they have a disability resource center for that. \n\nFind a network of friends. This might be easiest within your cohort because they are also experiencing grad school too, although a different flavor of it, or a different set of \"problems\" along the way. Get into the habit of a regular interaction with them - I started a D&D group with 5 other grass and it's been a fantastic relief on my weekly game days. \n\nBasically, the overall theme, is don't ever isolate yourself. Not every PI is a manipulative asshole, but if they are, you would be doing yourself a huge disfavor if you isolated yourself to only your PI. Work. Home. Work. Home. Work. Home. Meet PI. Repeat. Do not do this. Do.....not.",
