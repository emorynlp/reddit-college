  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am starting grad school soon and would like to update my backpack. Does anyone have one that they love, on the cheaper side (less than $150)?\n\nMy main priorities are back support (my current backpack is killing me), lots of pockets/functionality, and preferably something sleek/slim looking.\n\nI've been looking at travel backpacks for an upcoming trip and have found some that look really awesome (like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Carry-Travel-Backpack-Purple/dp/B079LG18LS/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1K7OPGNT8EF4A&keywords=amazon%2Bbasics%2Bslim%2Bcarry%2Bon%2Btravel%2Bbackpack%2Bweekender&qid=1636058926&qsid=134-3980010-5663259&sprefix=amazon%2Bbasics%2Bslim%2Bcarry%2Bon%2Btravel%2Bpackpack%2Bweekender%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-3&sres=B079LG18LS%2CB01J24H2K0%2CB00EEBS9O0%2CB011J4BPWC%2CB0711DPSXT%2CB01AIVT2AE%2CB01GGNW67O%2CB071VLCH81%2CB014VBI16S%2CB07HZ8MPJY%2CB014VBGKFW%2CB071JN843T%2CB06XKFY3FR%2CB01J24HCL4%2CB07D811C4R%2CB08NV5S5CX&srpt=BACKPACK&th=1) or [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QLKFP8D/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza?th=1)), but I'm worried they'll be too big for daily use as a student.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions? TIA!!",

      "text": "I personally recommend Swiss gear brand. I think I picked mine up from Target for $90 or so, which was pricey for me at the time. I've had it since at least 2010 and it is virtually as good as new. I used to carry a lot of heavy things in my backpack and it never ripped or tore in the corners, and the straps were padded enough to be relatively comfortable even with a heavy backpack. \n\nI don't use it that much anymore since I am done with coursework, but I do still use it occasionally and it's still going strong!\n\nOut of the two you posted, I personally think the Amazon basics one looks like it's going to tear or not be very sturdy.",

      "text": "I have had one of these for over 5 years now and its going strong. it's got an internal frame, so the back support is really good. It can get pretty roomy, or you can cinch it down so it's a lot slimmer. It's a top loader with a big main pocket, which I find is great for pulling out books and stuff, but not as good for organization or if you need to keep things at the bottom. I have an EDC-esc pouch that I keep all my cables and knick-knacks in, so it isn't a huge deal for me. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Unisexs-Redtail-Hiking-Backpack/dp/B078XXSSRL](https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Unisexs-Redtail-Hiking-Backpack/dp/B078XXSSRL)\n\n(search around, it's kind of an older model. I think you could find a better price)",

Rather than the way you see a lot of students wear it with it hanging halfway down their back. \n\nI have always had good luck with Osprey daypacks. They make decent hiking backpacks, so they are very knowledgeable about making good packs for commuter type use.",

      "text": "I'll re-post a comment I made on a similar post a while back (with some extra commentary):\n\n[This should be the last backpack you'll ever need to buy](https://www.jansport.com/shop/en/jansport-us/right-pack-backpack-typ7?variationId=003#hero=0). Durable as hell and waterproof in everything but the strongest downpours. It took 40 years for my dad's to fall apart and with their lifetime warranty, they replaced it no questions asked. Mine is in like new condition after ~~10~~ (now 13) years of daily use. Quite possibly the most worthwhile purchase I've ever made. (I'll show myself back to /r/hailcorporate now)\n\nIt may not look super comfortable, but it is if you don't overload it (the straps here as especially misleading as they are super comfy). Maybe not as many pockets as most modern packs, but its more expensive variant has extra pockets if you need them. Looks don't matter, functionality does. Unless you plan on hauling your whole desk home everyday, buy a smaller backpack for around campus and real business traveler luggage for trips. You'll spend less in the long run and your purchases will last longer if you buy the right bag for the right job.",
