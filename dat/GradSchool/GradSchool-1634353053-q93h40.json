  "title:": "Staying local vs. moving",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m applying to both masters programs and PhD programs. For the masters programs I decided it\u2019ll hurt my wallet less if I stay local and commute from home, there are a few Universities within a 2 hour radius from where I live that seem doable. But only one or two of the programs are decent for what I\u2019d like to do. On the other hand, there are schools out of state that are a lot better for the research I\u2019d like to do, but moving out of state seems like it\u2019d cost an arm and a leg. I don\u2019t really have any financial support aside from my savings. Can anyone share their experiences with getting a masters out of state and costs ? I just don\u2019t know if I justify a move like that. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

          "text": "In terms of education and reputation, Canada is very good . But, seeing other countries would give you a qualify life experience. I wanted to go to England or Zurich but they did not give me any fundings whatsoever. I got some here ( definitely not sufficient) , but I am from Toronto and it looked like staying in Canada would be the most logical way for me. In terms of quality of work, I have my draft projects so I will just do my best to finish them.",
