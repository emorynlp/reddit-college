  "title:": "As I enter my last year, I just want to share a few thoughts with incoming students:",
  "text": "1) Impostor Syndrome is 100% real and will affect you (yes, even you). It's okay, though. You can overcome it. You just have to build up enough knowledge & experience that you start thinking, \"hey, maybe I do know what I'm talking about\". It takes time.\n\n2) Related to #1, regardless of how much you know about your topic, there is *much more* that you do *not* know. Cultivate humility, learn from others, and don't be afraid to admit you don't know something. Real learning will not happen until you accomplish these things. Plus, you're not fooling anyone; I wouldn't even attempt it.\n\n3) Try as much as possible not to compete with your cohort. Don't undermine them, don't put them down, don't be upset when they succeed. Foster a support network, based on care and trust. Help them and they will help you. They will be your colleagues, now and forever.\n\n4) Seek out mental health resources, early and often! Can't stress this enough.\n\n5) Show up to your advisory meetings with a clear agenda, starting with things that are most time-sensitive. Your advisors are busy and may not have the time to be as involved as they want to be in your life. Make it easy for them.\n\n6) The second you start writing the 3rd paragraph of an email, stop. Delete the whole thing. Schedule a meeting instead.\n\n7) Get 8 hours of sleep a night. Non-negotiable.\n\n8) And lastly, honest to god, *very few people are working as hard as they claim they are*. There is this weird culture in graduate school centered around complaining about how much you have to work. I'm not saying you won't have to work hard or that others *don't* work hard, but take what you hear from other people with a grain of salt; I see a lot of self-reported work inflation around me. Given that there's so much flexibility in how to get work done, there are many ways to get it done. Someone else's method may not work for you. Don't let it get to you.\n",

      "text": "Thanks, I really needed to hear the part about the work inflation. My cohort always brags about how hard they\u2019re working and it makes me feel like a bad grad student. How can you tell when someone\u2019s lying about how hard they\u2019re working? I\u2019ve seen grad students talking about being in lab until 10pm but when they present their work at the end of the semester it doesn\u2019t seem like 13 hours/day worth of work to me?? Maybe I\u2019m being judgy or ignorant but I\u2019m entirely capable of getting a decent amount of work done doing mostly 8 hour days?? I mean sometimes I have a longer day but most of the time I keep pretty reasonable hours?? And my PI doesn\u2019t seem to think I\u2019m underperforming?? I\u2019m just so confused am I lazy or something??",

We are all on our own paths to our PhDs, and the way we get there is going to be different. Some of us have year long data collection trips to actually gather data, others can get to work on their data pretty much immediately. So if someone's knocked out a quant paper and you're still at data entry from stuff you've spent ages collecting... don't let the panic set in and make you feel like you're 'behind'. You're on your path and they're on theirs- support them, cheer their accomplishments, and keep plugging away at your work. You'll get there too.\n\nObligatory, 'Social science, YMMV'",

I did something along these lines but it was for my workout. I'm very dedicated to bodybuilding, it's a hobby that keeps me sane. When I started grad school I started skipping workouts and it just added to the depression. I had an exam today and I had so much to cover last night but I said screw it, I don't need to be top of the class, I just need to survive. I wanted to refocus on myself to stay sane and I went and got a workout in.\n\nBut sleep? I'm not sure how I can manage anything over 6 hours tops. I squeezed my workouts down to under an hour and I'm still trying to figure out how to get in all the required studying in without sacrificing sleep. ",

Having at least one person you can talk to outside your programme, field, academia or industry will bring blissful balance to your friends pool, and keep your perspective in check.

I like to think they get something out of this too.\n\nIt can also be great for your work- one of my colleagues in another department (that I could just as easily have been in) asked me to sit on a panel, presenting to their staff and students.

In or out of school, the friends and colleagues you have supporting you will make or break your academic career.\n\n3: Your life matters. Don't sacrifice important things (health, relationships, sanity) for your degree.\n\n4: Coming from 3, remember grad school isn't a marathon to push through. It's a building block for the rest of your academic career. Things get harder after rather than easier, so learning how to keep your work and life in a sustainable balance during grad school is really important.",
