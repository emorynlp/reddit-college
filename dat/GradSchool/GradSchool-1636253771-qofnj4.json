  "title:": "Are part time PhD students ever funded?",
  "text": "I am considering a PhD in engineering with the same advisor I currently have for my master's. I've started working an engineering job full time, however, I still put in a lot of work with my research group. Much if it is unrelated to my thesis. As that workload has increased, I have mentioned to my advisor that I don't wish to continue with unrelated tasks if I'm not being paid. As a part time student I don't expect a full stipend, but even a small gesture, like paying my in-state tuition, would be acceptable. \n\nShe has been waffling and I am considering my options. I understand that a grad student has little choice in a lot of things. But I don't want to work for free, and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'll continue with my advisor as I like the research, but I'm not going to stress myself out with extra responsibility for free.",

I even told her that I would only want my tuition covered since I already have a good living set up. More recently, she has been less agreeable to the idea.",
