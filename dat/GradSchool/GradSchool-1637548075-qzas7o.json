  "text": "I took on a part-time job doing data analysis for a university-affiliated research team. I assumed that I'd be carrying out some sort of planned analysis or at least be given a research question. Instead, i was given a pile of data on a topic I know nothing about and was told to first author a manuscript on a very broad topic. I've never written a manuscript or done any formal data analysis. Obviously, it's not going well. I've got the bones of a manuscript together and it's not awful but it's incredibly simplistic and I'm not proud of it. I really want to abandon it, but I don't know how to get out of this without hurting my reputation. I've been working on it for a few months now so I feel like I've wasted their time. Send help.",
