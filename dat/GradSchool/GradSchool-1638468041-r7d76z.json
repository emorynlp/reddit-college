  "text": "I am almost finishing my degree, am currently doing my internship. I have trieeed.. to establish boundaries. But.. its no sense. The only way my supervisor stops or is comprehensive is whenever see's a medical or health intervention. If I'm trying to set a time to establish healthy work-like balance.. its useless. She doesn't respect it. I am not a quitter.. and am just trying to do the best I can. But really maybe just for the matter of venting. How often this feeling is happening? Is it sort of expected to not have a lot of time for yourself?",

      "text": "Categorically not. The comparison is absurd. I'm very sorry you are having issues with your supervisor, but this way of putting it is not only inaccurate but also disrespectful to people actually suffering modern-day slavery. \n\nYou are right to work toward establishing a work-life balance. It may be productive to check with you school or wherever you are interning about whether she is breaking any policies. You will have to go over her head if she continues to gaslight you and disrespect your boundaries (so long as they are reasonable, of course).",

      "text": "No. An intern can always choose to leave, or seek higher authorities to protect their rights. They do not have their freedom taken away, they are not emotionally and physically abused, the level of trauma and unfairness is orders of magnitude different. Calling a shitty job slavery waters down what slavery actually was. The reality is that a lot of jobs, paid or not, are shitty. But they are not slavery. Slavery still exists in parts of the world, and that's actually modern slavery. Anything else is just shitty capitalism.",

So you pay tuition to be an intern at a neighboring agency for 4-6 credits. You only find this out in your 4th year. So you have already committed a 2 years to the program. The class is required to graduate with that specific degree and the credits arent transferable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis wasnt a shady back ally university either. It was a top 10 name school doing this practice. To answer the question though. I agree that slavery is a loaded term, but when it comes to school you'd have to at least agree to an extent there are some situations where the students consent to leave without repercussions is not fully respected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, I coded data for a lab this one time. I got sick during covid and couldnt really be on my A game so I asked the PI what the plan was with Covid and not coming into the lab, since this is volunteer work. If I left I lost all my rights to the paper (Its my choice, but ... )",

That is not remotely comparable to slavery. You also had the opportunity to quit at any time, which slaves did not have.",
