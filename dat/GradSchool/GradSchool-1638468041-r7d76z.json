  "text": "I am almost finishing my degree, am currently doing my internship. I have trieeed.. to establish boundaries. But.. its no sense. The only way my supervisor stops or is comprehensive is whenever see's a medical or health intervention. If I'm trying to set a time to establish healthy work-like balance.. its useless. She doesn't respect it. I am not a quitter.. and am just trying to do the best I can. But really maybe just for the matter of venting. How often this feeling is happening? Is it sort of expected to not have a lot of time for yourself?",
