  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI applied last year to PhD programs in the US and was unsuccessful, but I managed to get into a one year master's program in the UK which I am now in. I am currently preparing a new round of applications, and am noticing that many graduate schools will not allow you to apply to the school after three failed attempts. However, I'm in a situation where it is likely that this round will also fail, since my graduate program has only just begun and thus I will not look all that different on paper than I did last year. I was hoping to submit applications anyway in the hopes that something comes back and, if nothing does, to then reapply more concertedly next year once the master's is over.\n\nHowever, if I do so, and those applications fail too (or fail to some of top choices), I've just realized that I will then not have the opportunity to apply as a visiting fellow down the road once I *am* in my PhD. Say I get into my second choice and fail in my first, for instance, but then down the road want to apply to be a visiting fellow back at my first choice. I will have then failed three times, and will not be allowed to re-submit. For my top choice, at least, they consider all applications to the respective graduate school, whether as student or fellow, to count towards this total.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and been unable to apply as a visiting fellow during their PhD program, due to failed attempts as a grad applicant?",
