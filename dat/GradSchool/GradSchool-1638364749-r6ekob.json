  "title:": "Getting a New Undergrad and a Masters at the same time",
  "text": "Currently serving out a five year contract in the Navy and afterwards grad school is certainly in the cards. I love schooling and I value education a lot so I have no doubts that a career in academia is for me. I currently have a BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology and a business minor, and I\u2019m looking to try and get into the field of Behavioral Neuroscience.\nKnowing that\u2019s quite a career jump, and still being intensely interested in engineering, I\u2019d love to try and both get a Master\u2019s in Industrial and Systems Engineering and also work toward an undergrad in Neuroscience and maybe pursue another advanced degree after that. Could those two degrees be completed in the same 3-4 year timeframe? Let\u2019s assume that I can manage my time in an above-average way, and that I\u2019m applying to US institutions. \nAny help is greatly appreciated!",
