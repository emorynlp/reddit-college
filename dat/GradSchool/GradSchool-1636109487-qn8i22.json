  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm glad I found this community. \n\nI moved from the US to Poland a month ago (a few days before my classes began). Right now I'm taking four classes. Two of which are engaging. The other two are three hour lectures where the professors monologue. My professors are clearly extremely knowledgeable but I'm struggling to pay attention and I've left some classes having retained little to nothing. The classes I'm currently taking are obligatory and don't completely touch upon the core of what I will later study more in depth. Regardless of my personal interest or lack thereof in what I'm learning right now, I truthfully do not yet understand the foundational knowledge I'm supposed to be getting. I feel lost. \n\nWhen I first moved here I lived in a dorm that was far from my classes. I was diagnosed with scoliosis not long before coming here, and the travel time has been hard on my body. So I scrambled to find a flat closer to my classes. Unfortunately my wallet was stolen so I've also been focusing a lot of time on replacing my documents and accessing money. Scoliosis treatment has also been put on hold since my healthcare functions off of me paying first and getting reimbursed later. \n\nI don't mean to sound whiny or like I want pity. I wish I had moved here earlier but I can't change that now. I hope that when these external circumstances resolve I will feel less distracted. I'm really frustrated though. I'd like to be proactive now but I don't know what to do differently. Do I need to suck it up and try harder to pay attention in class? Should I be trying harder to learn from the required texts? Should I try and express my struggles to my advisor? Has anyone here felt similarly and adopted better strategies? \n\nI'm really appreciative for any insight. I care a lot about what I'm studying and I saved a lot of money to come here. I want to succeed.",

I think this is available at most universities. It might be nice to spend a semester working part time and getting your things in order.",

That way the professor's lecture is refining what you know, rather than depending on it to make you understand it all.\n\nAre you reading the required readings more than once before class? What discipline is this?",

The other two classes we are supposed to read academic novels and textbooks. None of my colleagues read the these (we aren't given guidance on what to read nor when specifically). Everyone else seems to get by fine with the lectures. I think I'm going to really focus a lot this month on the textbooks. I enjoy reading and think this style of learning suites me well.\n\nI am in a European Studies program with a focus on the Holocaust and Totalitarian Systems.",

But are you reading them more than once? \n\nAcademic articles are written for people who are already knowledgeable in the field. They're not written to be digested by a grad student in one reading.\n\n>None of my colleagues read the these (we aren't given guidance on what to read nor when specifically).\n\nNot everyone learns the same.",
