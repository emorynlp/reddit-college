  "text": "I am thinking of changing my field. \n\nI am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in applied mathematics. My current field is biomathematics. I went to this field because I wanted to research age-related diseases. This was my childhood dream.\n\nI have just finished my first semester in the bio math program, but the methodology in bio math is not fun to me. Coming from a pure math background, having less proof and more qualitative thinking did not excite me.\n\nOn the other hand, when I was an undergrad, I also studied financial math. It was really fun because I am into probability theory, 101 of financial math. Also, it had more proof and more programming, which I like. However, I don\u2019t have a topic in financial math I would like to research in my mind. \n\nLuckily, my uni offers both a bio math program and financial math program, which is easy to switch.\n\nBut, I am not sure if I should switch. I have seen some people from bio math going to the finance industry, so if I end up in the industry, it probably does not matter. Also, the childhood dream drags me hard.\n\nAny idea?",

      "text": "As someone doing a field that is similar to, but not exactly my childhood dream, I\u2019m here to say that your childhood self had no idea what a job studying age-related diseases would actually look like, and don\u2019t let this idealized childhood dream keep you stuck in a career you don\u2019t enjoy. You\u2019re going to be wayyy more likely to be able to contribute meaningfully if you like what you\u2019re doing. There are probably ways you could end up doing research you find fulfilling but just in a more circuitous route- maybe you just don\u2019t like applied math very much, but there is important work in pure mathematics to be done that would advance the study of age-related diseases? You don\u2019t have to carry an idea all the way from theory to application yourself.\n\nJust putting this out there, have you looked into biostatistics specifically by any chance, if you like probability theory so much?\n\nThat being said, hell yea switch into a more lucrative field that you are also going to enjoy more. Seems like a no brainer to me.",
