  "title:": "Applying to a new PhD position",
  "text": "I am a PhD student suffering from many related problems: an absent advisor that exists only in papers, lack of research activities, lack of experts around me, a very bad and non-healthy working environment, ...etc. Despite all that I managed to learn few things in my field and do research on my own at the point to write a paper and submit it. Recently I found another PhD position abroad in a country very known for its traditions in mathematics, and its very good universities and laboratories, the position is very appealing to me and I want to apply for it, and I would like to be advised in that matter in regards to some points, which are the following:\n\n\\- How can I motivate the fact that I want to resign from my actual PhD and go for another one? Even though I have my reasons but I find it somehow non-professional criticising my department and advisor, and this is what I have been told before.\n\n\\-How can I mention the issues that are pushing me to this change and be professional?\n\n\\-Anyone went through the same process? Please let me learn from your experience.\n\n\\-Are there any pieces of advice or tips that you would like to share with me, please?\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

      "text": "Just like PhD students often change labs and, consequently, their advisors, I don\u2019t see a problem in applying for a different PhD program. Also, you don\u2019t have to mention you are in a PhD program when applying for a new position. At the same time, if you are unsure your current program is not fit for you, you can let your advisor or the program\u2019s chair, for instance, know about it. Mention your reasons. To me, it seems you are in no need of your advisor, or anyone for that matter, to carry on with your work. However, there must be something I am missing. In any case, if your advisor and other administrative personnel care about your academic success, then they will understand. In my case, my former advisor and I were not a match. We often disagreed, and I lacked his support on following my own ventures and research. My chair understood it and signed off on any required paperwork.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your comment.  \nI think that we are in completely different systems. In fact here any comment on your advisor or honesty on saying that we are not a good fit is considered offensive and may cost you your career. In my case, I have never talked with my advisor about the research that I do, when I have an appointment with him, he drives the conversation to unrelated topics. later on, when I wrote a research paper on my own, I had to write his name first, in addition, I didn't benefit from an internship or courses offered by my lab, simply because it doesn't offer any! I hope this makes the situation clearer, I hope to hear from you again.",

              "text": "Based on your reply, it is clear to me now that your relationship with your advisor is faulty. Let\u2019s face it, if you cannot talk about your own research/interests with your advisor, then you need to find someone else. A PhD is hard on itself, a healthy advisor-advisee relationship is thus extremely important. If you are at a point where you are looking for a different program, then it is seriously complicated where you are at and may not be the place for you. By the way, that is totally fine. You have other options, don\u2019t you? Back in my days in a similar situation, I felt overly attached to the work I did, which I did not enjoy at all. The time invested haunted me. However, enough was enough. I wasn\u2019t happy with my situation and work, so I moved on.",

The system and all programs are the same here in my country, that's why I am looking for another country, hence the one I found is in Germany, and I would like to make sure that I express my motivations, reasons why I want to leave ...etc in a good way. any advice with that regard please?",
