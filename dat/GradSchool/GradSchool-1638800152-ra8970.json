  "text": " \n\nA  few semesters into my BBA course, I found myself absolutely falling in  love with the more Human Resources and Management Theory bits of my  curriculum. As I'm now in my final year (finishing up my first term),  one of my courses essentially had me prepare an entire plan for how I  would take on a research dissertation. Although my topic is commercially  related, I'm more interested in the antrhopological/behavioral angle to  the research, versus the commercial implications. Adapting the  methodology to reflect this would be very simple, and I'd be in an  excellent position to write a killer dissertation next year!\n\nWith  that being said, the relatively obscure nature of pure  Sociology/Anthropoly (as opposed to business, engineering, law etc),  makes it hard for me to understand if I really have the necessary  pre-requisites. To compensate for this, I spend as much time as I can  reading up on sociological texts, since of course I will be behind in a  few aspects.\n\nI found several  universities that offer sociology degrees, with excellent options that  suit me. I just don't know if I'm wasting my time (and money) pursuing  this dream of mine. Are there any sociologists out there that can let me  know?",
