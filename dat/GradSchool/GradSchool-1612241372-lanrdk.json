  "text": "I had a really short rope already like everyone else and on Friday it snapped so here's me letting off steam in hopes that strength in misery numbers will somehow buoy my motivation to continue...\n\nHas anyone else seen a complete deterioration of their degree and educational experience, which started out as a bearable 'for now' feeling, but now it feels like a derailed freight train, except that train carried no cargo in the first place?\n\nI never discuss science (in STEM)  anymore with colleagues, since we're discouraged to spend time near others due to social distancing. The number of seminars (and interest in internal seminars) has plummeted since the beginning of the pandemic and I think even departments have stopped bothering to invite external speakers. Workshops, **conferences**, and overall quality is training is heavily reduced because we're obviously not traveling, networking, meeting future employers...\n\nWorse yet, and not unique to us, we can't celebrate any milestones. Successful committee meeting? Passed your candidacy exam? Did your comps and they didn't tear you a new one? GOD FORBID, DEFEND YOUR THESIS? Can't celebrate, can't congratulate.\n\nForget about the personal toll that the pandemic takes on everyone, much less students, postdocs, and academics, which tanks our ability to want to be imaginative, to delve into literature and actually be excited about our work ahead.\n\nI try hard not to be negative, but when you're doing a PhD, it kind of is also your life when you're used to living and breathing your work. It makes me sad to think that we are so robbed of what should be such formative years in our careers.\n\nSomehow a year into this mess, I'm still grieving over the loss of what could have been a good PhD.\n\n*     \n^^oh. ^^and ^^still ^^trapped ^^in ^^the ^^same ^^5 ^^mile ^^radius ^^of ^^my ^^house. ^^thanks ^^UK.",

There were many opportunities esp. near the city I moved to, multiple international conferences, and some that I could've attended about last spring should the Shit Hath Not Hit The Fan, do that was doubly sad.\n\nBut as my thesis neared (which I'm beginning to work on nowadays, the semester ended ~5 days ago), I focussed on it and it's really helped catch my breath and keep up.  It'll still be difficult, as I'll have to work with human participants about the summer and god knows wtf the world will be doing about then, but still it's a great goalpost and it's _mine_, which is an immensely better motivator than all the handout-able lectures and bullshit homeworks we did.\n\nIn the end, I'm not in the MA for the MA, I'm here because I want to become a scientist, and when I can remind myself of that, a lot of hills flatten and mountains dwindle, so to speak.",

      "text": "Dang. I feel it all too much. I completed my masters with my adviser and decided to continue on for a phd in a different topic because I enjoyed working with him so much. The first 2.5 years of my phd were a blast, and I had an awesome relationship with my adviser, we travelled abroad for fieldwork and had plans to continue that. We celebrated milestones, it was special. Our lab started out pretty optimistic too, but somewhere along the way we decided this was it and settled in. I've tried to suggest things like lab hikes or other outdoor field excursions to keep morale up but my adviser wont participate. We have weekly lab meeting on zoom, which is the one cohesive thing we've got going right now. I definitely got some PTSD from being ripped away from my community at the lab. Maybe some would say its unhealthy, but I was doing well with that being my community while I completed grad studies. \n\nOn top of relationships deteriorating, which may not mean that much to some, the grant money for my field work has been slow as molasses to come in, and resulted in me not getting a whole lot done last summer/fall, which should have been my major field season. The university has also taken back almost all of my advisers discretionary funds which were slated for my work and subsequent publications. It just sucks. It was kind of the best time of my life so far and I'm still mourning the loss or relationships and experiences. Im finally back on track and pumping out publications but it all feels so empty without being able to share the excitement with people. Now I need to schedule my quals, which I'm sure will once again be on zoom. So that's great. \n\nHoping the university comes through for us and helps us get vaccinated before summer. But I'm afraid that I'm once again being overly optimistic.",

In addition to all of the support posted by others here, I would offer this:\n\nDuring the pandemic, I actually think that my friendships with academics at other institutions has improved, thanks to **Twitter**. It felt silly at first to get on Twitter, a place I knew mostly for political arguments and memes, but I've actually found a really great corner of the social network by following researchers in my field and adjacent fields. I tracked down old acquaintances from conferences, and we all celebrate virtual candidacy wins, Zoom dissertations, and multi-tweet, GIF-heavy Twitter threads about new papers. I've attended way more virtual conferences this year than I ever could have afforded to attend in person, and the Slack/Discord channels for those conferences are a lot of fun.\n\nI know it can never replace in-person interactions, but just putting that out there in case it helps you the way it helped me. I even got a contract job via a mutual on Twitter, so I'm picking up some extra remote work to squirrel away some money for a hiking trip this summer! Sending lots of love <3",

Wonderful options during COVID: Risk advisor from hell since we can't even actually get a feel for lab culture or their style or get kicked out when we don't find anyone.  We also have end of the year comprehensive exams that require extensive group studying and good luck finding a group that you gel with when you don't even get to meet people.  Even my TA assignments have been teaching on Zoom.\n\nI've thought about changing programs just to get a fresh start at actually meeting people and finding labs if we're back in-person a bit more for Fall 2021.  I've also thought about asking about a leave of absence if we're not.

My paycheck is unaffected. I go into lab some, which is a change of scenery and gets me exercising for the bike commute. I'm not struggling to get enough food to feed a family, or about to be evicted, or laid off, so I feel lucky most of the time. Or at least I try to figure on that when I am stuck in the mental doldrums.\n\nFeel you on the lack of celebrations. Sharing food and spending time with other people to celebrate accomplishments is very missed. We just finally got a paper out and... I guess the champagne goes on the shelf until we can drink it together?\n\nEdit: but I am also a champion at compartmentalizing, so I'll probably feel worse about everything when it's \"over.\"",

Not sure when I can go back to campus and start working in the lab/field. Job opportunities are bad. I don't know my labmates personally. My friends think I'm doing better than them as I'm doing a PhD. I'm at my parent's now, and they think PhD is staring at screens and have been advising me to keep looking for 'better' opportunities (I'm first gen grad in my family). Add to all these, heartbreak from a long time relationship and sad winters. I'm kinda glad I'm not alone in this period of grief but I honestly wish things were better and people had more empathy.\n\nI kinda wish to attend some lousy seminar and have the lousy coffee and sandwich and then complaint about the said seminar, sandwich and coffee and take home a tote bag and some goodies. \n\nI really hope things get better for everyone and may everyone find their motivation back, do good research and contribute to the greater good.",

No networking. No eating lunch with my cohort. No interesting seminars. No social events. No celebratory happy hour beers. \n\nI hate it. If I wasn't already 3 years in I would defer. It is so, so demoralizing and feels like all of the worst parts about grad school with none of the things that make it worthwhile. \n\nGrieving is a good way to put it.
