  "text": "Hey everyone! My graduate program has made getting full time work very difficulty and my university doesn't offer a health care plan for grad students. I'm beyond the age where I can be on my family's plan so that is not an option.\n\nWhat have others done to get health care in the US?\n\n(I've also applied for Medicaid in the state of Virginia, where I am a resident, but have been denied).",
