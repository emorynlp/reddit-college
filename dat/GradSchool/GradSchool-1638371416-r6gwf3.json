  "text": "I finished my degree 6 years ago but because of some mental health problems I have been NEETing ever since, I really want to go back to school so I can get back on track. \n\nI have been seeing a therapist and am in a better place right now, problem is I have a massive employment gap. The only thing on my cv is my degree and a 3 month internship I did,many many years ago. I have no references and no work experience at all\n\nI am contemplating just saying I freelanced or something if they ask me what I have been doing since graduation.",

And now I am almost done with the first semester of my grad school. In my case, I told them everything, and they understood.",
