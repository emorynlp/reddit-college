  "title:": "Best Books and/or Practical Advice for a New Grad Student",
  "text": "Hey all, I was recently accepted into an MSW program that starts in January. It is a two-year standard program and I'm both excited and anxious. I've Googled \"best books for grad students\" with little luck. Do you all have any book recommendations that might help one prepare for grad school (in general, not specifically an MSW)? I know one can't completely prepare for grad school, but anything helps. Some books I've seen are how to read textbooks properly, \"how to write a lot\" and how to write papers in general for college. Also memory books have come up in searches. I likd to read and learn best by reading and seeing something physcial, hence my question. I graduated with my Bachelors in 2018 so I'm a little rusty on school. Any practical advice would be welcome as well! If there is already a post with similar questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks!",

The biggest thing is to learn to think critically and independently, and learn to learn by yourself - you often have less support than you did in your undergraduate program. To my knowledge, there isn't a one size fits all book that you're looking for, otherwise it would be recommended to every grad student.",

OP, MSW vs MBA vs PhD in physics are all very different experiences of grad school. You\u2019d probably get better answers cross-posting in r/socialwork for that reason.\n\nI finished my MSW in May, and my recommendation would be to relax and enjoy this time. Soon enough you\u2019ll be inundated with reading, I promise. If you really want readings now, my recommendations would be based on your interests/program or would just be foundational social work texts. MSWs are more about critical thinking than memory, so I really wouldn\u2019t bother with those books personally. My program also wasn\u2019t particularly writing intensive so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend books on writing unless you feel that\u2019s an area you need improvement.",

      "text": "My general practical advice for graduate school would be to get yourself a citation manager if you don't already have one. (I like Zotero. It's free and it has a Chrome button so you can easily cite webpages.) When you write a paper, have the citation manager handle numbering the citations. That way, if you add or remove a reference, you don't have to go through and renumber everything. And if you have to change the citation style in a paper you already wrote, it's a piece of cake instead of a tedious nightmare.",

Makes all the difference in being able to keep track of things.\n\nIf you send an email to someone and you need a response, have an \"unresolved\" folder where you move the sent email to. That way, if they're not responsive, you still have a way to keep track of what you're asking about and aren't reliant on their response. Then once it's resolved you just move out and file the email. Then just check your unresolved email periodically.",

For a professional masters, you might not find anything perfect. I haven't heard of the book you mention.",
