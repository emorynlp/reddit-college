  "title:": "In academia/education, is there a difference between the phD and edD?",
  "text": "I'm enrolled in an alternative certification program that would allow me to be a teacher in New York City public schools, but lately, I've been falling down the rabbit hole, and obsessed with the idea of obtaining a phD since I heard they pay you, albeit not much. I do understand it is about 6 years of one's life, so it is a big commitment, financial and energy wise.\n\n  \n\n\nMy program would heavily subsidize my masters for me, provide me a living stipend during training (not much) and a teacher's salary while I work towards that masters, plus some other benefits. But is it common for students to go straight to their phD with just a masters? Do I need a masters?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, what is the difference between an edD versus phD in the field of education?\n\nAs I have heard the phD would be funded studies, but outside of phD's, they are not. Knowing this, why would anyone grab the edD when you have to pay out of pocket?",

      "text": "edD programs are \\*not\\* thought highly of  in academia. There are a lot of diploma mills that give this degree out. They are a great stepping stone for individuals to move up the administrative ladder in a school district but don't have much value outside of that.\n\nA PhD in education would give you more research skills and be viewed more favorably by education focused firms, academia, and school districts. Just my opinion.\n\nedited: an important typo",

      "text": "I would also say, I think the content of these programs would be a bit different. In a PhD, there will be a focus on research methods and they will teach you specifically how to craft an article for publication, and how to build on existing (often theoretical) literature to do so. Academic research is a pretty specific skill, so the training takes a while.   \nIn an EdD (I am not as familiar, so others may correct me), you will also need to write a thesis, but the emphasis will be on the value to *education*. For example, this may be a study of how a specific part of the new math curriculum is affecting children in your school district (or something like that). You will of course need to know methods to answer this question, but the focus is not on the body of literature that you are contributing to, but how we can improve the curriculum.   \n\n\nIt's just a different way of approaching the world. I personally am in a interdisciplinary social sciences PhD program (so, similar to what an Education PhD would be) and I know others who went into Education PhDs to do research on quantitative measurement in education. I think you can gain a lot from the knowledge and skills you get in a PhD but they will be very research heavy and you should try to go to a top 20 school or you may have trouble finding a job after.",
