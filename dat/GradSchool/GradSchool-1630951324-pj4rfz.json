  "text": "Well, I am sincerely lost. I\u2019m starting grad school tomorrow at night (I work in tech full time) for a totally different program than what I went to undergrad for. I\u2019ll be studying Applied Politics, Domestic and Public Policy, after graduating THIRTEEN years ago from my undergraduate program. Basically, the imposter syndrome has kicked in, I\u2019m nervous as all heck, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be a huge failure. \n\nDid anyone here go through something similar? Thanks in advance for your thoughts \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

      "text": "Somewhat similar. I took 6 years off between my undergrad and Ph.D.. My undergrad was in a STEM field, but my Ph.D. is a specific sub-field of engineering that I had NO prior experience in. I always joked that I don't have imposter syndrome because I am the imposter. \n\nFor me, I lacked field-specific knowledge, but had far more soft skills than most of the other students. Having worked in industry, I knew what it took to drive my own schedule and projects, how to work with difficult managers or teammates, how to keep a work/life balance, and I had confidence in myself. My first two quarters were FUCKING ROUGH because I was not only starting grad school, but catching up on a lot of the stuff I didn't know. However, once I got going I noticed that some things came much easier to me than others because I already had so many other skills built up. \n\nEvery faculty member I've talked to about it has agreed that having 'real world' experience is extremely beneficial in grad school. It may be tough at first because you're playing catch-up, but once you get going you'll notice you have skills years beyond what others have. You'll do great :)",

My fields are somewhat related, but I'm not nearly as versed in this as I was my old field (Public Relations). Being the imposter is something I should maybe embrace, haha. \n\nIt is a plus to have some other life skills since graduation so many years ago. I look at these youngsters just out of their bachelors and sometimes I think I'm glad to have a leg up on life experience and other times I wish I were as naively confident as they are \ud83d\ude02 Thank you so much for your thoughtful response and kind words. I really appreciate it!",
