  "title:": "Question for Canadian PhD programs regarding GPA.",
  "text": "Hi Everyone, I am wrapping up my first semester in a STEM internship program and have had a rough couple days. I tanked a paper which dropped my grade from an A to an A- and have been overall feeling kind of shitty.\n\nI have predicted my other courses will have final grades of either 4.33 or 4.0 for one of them with the last one being a 3.67 or a 3.33.\n\nMy program is unique in a sense where I have an internship but grades still matter. This made me thing what requirements are needed for a PhD program.\n\nI have read that grades may not matter so much if you have lets say 5+ years of work experience or maybe have a couple publications. From my understanding this sub is mostly U.S based so I wanted to ask if grades attained in a masters program heavily impact a PhD candidate. What is the average gpa needed to apply? What other factors matter? \n\nI am currently 23 and at a stage in my career where I dont know if I want to pursue a PhD. My biggest fear is graduating with decent grades but then realizing I have to raise them in order to get into a PhD program or maybe even a second masters degree so I just thought I would ask.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi! I'm Canadian and did my PhD in Canada (fast-track to PhD option). I'm assuming you are looking for a research-based PhD? I think you should search some programs you are interested in to get an idea of the average grade required but honestly I think I you'll be fine with an A-. The admission requirements to the program I did was a B+ average during Master's. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk more! :)",

          "text": "Thanks for the response! I am just worried about my GPA overall. My Masters is only 1 year and I hope to finish with a minimum GPA of A- (3.67). However, in the instance where I have a B+ average will I still be able to compete for a PhD. This is without any work experience or research experience and is all hypothetical. \n\nI am asking because I would like to be a professor eventually.",

              "text": "What program are you interested in? I'm in molecular biology so I can share my experience. It depends on the institute but in my case, as long as you met the minimum requirements and found a supervisor willing to take you on you were accepted. For some programs, funding is department-dependent so what I experienced might not be true. What Masters are you doing? I know 1 year ones aren't that common. You might need to check if they would even accept that type of Masters for PhD programs.",

      "text": "I also went to UBC for my PhD and got in with a little B+ / A- average ish (US school for undergrad). In my experience, meeting with a PI and convincing him to take me on was way more important than anything else on the application - once you have someone who wants to bring you in, you just have to meet the requirements. With that said, this varies a ton between fields, universities, and even programs within a university. You'll have to look into the specific programs you're interested in to figure out how they do it.",
