  "text": "There is a grad student unionization effort at my school (USA) and it will come to a vote soon. I personally feel heard and treated well already, so I am inclined to oppose it. Of course those in favor of unionizing have a list of pros, but I'm always skeptical that the grass will be greener on the other side. To grad students who have unionized, is it worth it? To grad students who aren't unionized, do you want to and why?",

When our contracts are up to be renegotiated again, the union and the university negotiate what will be in there, with the union usually having specific demands/goals of what needs to be changed for this go around.\n\nIn terms of strikes, it also helps to know that it\u2019s very much not an instantaneous thing that happens. Our union has only fully struck once, which required the approval of the union members, due to specifically severe conditions where continuing working was more harmful for us in the long run than deciding to strike. (Ex: striking was considered the better choice than losing both healthcare and tuition waivers, which in the union members\u2019 eyes, would have led to losing work anyways because people couldn\u2019t afford to stay in their programs.) From what I\u2019ve been told, people in my department made up the hours fairly easily because striking for around two weeks shut things down so much that they needed us back and working to catch up ASAP once a deal was made.\n\nShort explanation is, yes it may \u201cshoot yourself in the foot\u201d in the immediate sense, but strikes are usually for conditions so bad that work is inevitably not going to be able to continue anyways, particularly due to workers being exploited.\n\n**Small edit: I don\u2019t know much about how this exactly affects research, sorry!

We have pretty good health insurance, but the pay isn\u2019t enough for the area, and without a union there wouldn\u2019t be pressure to fix that. In the past, the union has won things like fee deferrals, parental leave, childcare stipends, training pay, etc. It\u2019s also a support resource for if someone is breaking your contract (for example, asking you to work more than you\u2019re paid for) or if there\u2019s harassment or discrimination.

If your faculty/department is truly supportive, then they would have no problem with students unionizing. Your professors probably belong to a union anyway. \n\nWhen it comes to the administration, the only reason you feel heard and treated well is because it is financially viable for them to do that right now. The minute your interests diverge from the administration's, or if you become a \"problem\", you cease to matter. The president, provost, and other over-paid admins will, of course, get their money and potentially bonuses, as they cut programs and services that students rely on. There may mysteriously be \"no money\" for graduate student stipends, but the president got a $100k bonus and they just decided to build a new building on campus.  If you want to complain, you're unimportant because you represent a population of 1. The president of the university isn't going to meet with you. If they do, they will pat you on the head and send you on your way. They're more likely to listen to a leader of an organized union who represents a population of thousands. \n\nAt my university, my student union organized a mutual relief fund for students facing financial predicaments due to COVID. If you were having problems making rent payments due to job cuts, you could apply for some money from them to help out. There was a professor at my university who committed some pretty serious abuse against a grad student, and the union was integral in ensuring they never teach or supervise students. The administration (and the department!) wanted to let them come back, start teaching, and supervising grad students like nothing happened. \n\nSo really, the only reason things have gone so smoothly for you is because you may not have dealt with a serious situation so far. If you do, do you really think the administration is going to have your back compared to other graduate students?",

The difference was staggering. \n\nAt MA institution, I had benefits like life insurance, paid less than 500/year for medical and dental (and the plan was fantastic and covered everything), paid less than 300/year for parking, and was supposed to get a pay raise after I hit my master's. I had legal union-based representation if there was ever a conflict with my funding sources (read: they could not just fire me without the union getting involved, so there was job security there), I could only work the hours paid (if my assistantship was 13 hours I would work 13 hours, and my supervisor could not demand more), and advisor-student abuse had may different solutions/methods for advocacy. Everyone in the university was required to attend trainings in diversity and sexual harassment because of the union, which made for a safer environment for everyone where we all knew how to see help if we needed it. The union also represented graduate student and university-related issues to the state through lobbying, which made working there overall more pleasant. \n\nI moved for my Ph.D. (had to, long story). I took at $16,000/year pay cut for the same level of funding (made barely enough to scrape by), was forced to pay more than $2,000 in student fees (that university still cannot explain where the money is going), paid more than $2,000/year for just medical, if I wanted dental or vision insurance it would be extra, and paid more than $500/year in parking. There was no representation, no advocacy, and it was general practice for advisors to require a student to work many times the amount they were being paid to work. \n\nSo yes. Definitely unionize. The grass is millions of times greener, and I am not just saying that.",

A lot of people here want to unionize, but supposedly because we're \"state employees\" (only when it benefits the school, not when it benefits us, funny how we're not employees when it comes to ways they can take money from us or benefits they'll give us), we're legally in a weird spot where it may or may not be illegal by state laws to unionize.

Without a union you have little protection and little ability to have a voice in the future direction of your work environment, but also in current shitfuckery. \n\nYou don't need a union until you do. You may be treated well today, but not tomorrow. You may feel you're treated well your first year and realize in year 5 you're being exploited. You may not need a union because you are independently wealthy and can afford to not have your pay increase with inflation, but your colleague may not have that luxury.\n\nI've got to ask: why would you oppose something just because you do not currently need it? Do you oppose selling toothpaste because you currently have toothpaste? Do you oppose public transit because you have a car? \n\nWhat is the worst that you think can happen if you unionize? Do you think it's going to somehow make your work conditions worse? Unions lobby and lawyer up for better working conditions, and will fight for retroactive wage increases, better/cheaper health insurance, advocate if you have a conflict with a superior, etc. What is the downshot that causes you to consider actively opposing these kinds of things?",

My first job at 16 I was a grocery store bagger raking in $7.75/hr, and I remember feeling super frustrated that union dues took a decent chunk out of that. Obviously I just wanted as much spending money as possible and didn't care about any insurance or literally anything else, but nevertheless it left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFast forward to grad school, my stipend is relatively fantastic (~$39k), so I don't expect a union to increase that. To answer your question, my fear is that my stipend will decrease cuz of the dues. I live in an expensive city with lots of undergrad debt, so I still want as much stipend as possible.\n\nAll that said, these comments have really changed my mind about unions so thanks. I definitely overlooked just the peace of mind of knowing I'll keep all these great benefits I already have, plus maybe some more (dental???), and helping others at my school with kids/different circumstances/less fortunate etc. have these same benefits as well",

Unionizing grad students consistently win modest to exceptional stipend increases on their first contract , and that's not counting the potential gains to be made by e.g. improved health insurance coverage, or less-tangible benefits like guaranteed transitional funding for students that change advisers. The historical data is a little heterogenous because of the idiosyncratic American public-private distinction, but the biggest stipend increase upon initial contract ratification I'm aware of was ~11% at the University of Michigan, on a contract that also won them full vision and dental. \n\nBy contrast, I am not aware of any grad union which ratified a contract that in net cost them money after dues. If I'm mistaken, I'd love to be called out here -- but to my knowledge, the situation you're worried about has literally never happened!",

I'm sure you'd agree that not every grad student is in such a position, and a union could do a lot to help them without really impacting you - certainly not in any negative way. So at worst you gain nothing, at best you might gain something you didn't know you were missing.\n\nPersonally my advisor has treated me well - at least as well as he can within the confines of the rules set by the university. But I only need to walk down the hallway to see that I'm the exception, not the rule. Not to mention my university was at the forefront of \"look how progressive we can be in COVID times\" - which mysteriously involved using grad students as cannon fodder for in-person teaching (Quite literally \"a professor who isn't comfortable can work from home and have a grad student teach\") - which, incidentally, led to the formation of a union here.",

My department was smaller and less well funded than others at the university and so we all had TAships, the salary for which was inadequate for the majority of us to survive in the city where the university is.

It's run by a board of directors and profits are a huge part of their agenda for a variety of reasons. Their major concern is reputation, getting funding and increasing undergrad enrollment. Graduate students are not bringing in money, in fact they are getting paid by the university, so graduate student welfare is at the bottom of their priority list. (Of course graduate students are bringing in money long term because of their research/patents etc but if you talk to most board members that's not how they see it. Most of them are executives who are old rich white men and have a specific perspective on how things should be run).\n\nPoint being you might be doing well right now but whenever there is a power differential there is potential for abuse. And whenever there is a crisis your benefits will be first on the chopping block. Second, there is mass brainwashing as to what scale of benefits can be expected. Junior academics are led to believe that they should be happy with the meagre benefits they receive and to not compare it to the real world job benefits. However this philosophy doesn't seem to extend to the obscene pay and benefits given to university administration and coaches. So whether you realize it or not you are currently undervalued for what you bring.\n\nMy student body had to fight hard for something as simple as getting the PIs to cover dental insurance for students, something as small as $250 per student per year. Of course many PIs still made a huge fuss and tried to \"forget\" singing the forms until the enrollment deadline ran out. Even if your PI is good, many other students have it quite bad.\n\nThe fact that universities are so troubled by unionization and are trying to stop students from joining should tell you everything you need to know about who benefits from unions.",

It\u2019s the nature of those visas that we are at the will of immigration, border officers, universities and that we are only allowed to be in the US temporarily as students, not employees. It\u2019s a tough position to be in but it is essentially the only option to even come to this country. I understand that there have been no known cases of international students to be openly discriminated against because they have joined a union, but maybe that\u2019s just so bc it hadn\u2019t been a thing in the past. We cannot be recognized as employees, we need the student status to get the visas approved and we need the goodwill of the international office and our respective school administrators to fend for us if worst comes to worst.",

But it was driven primarily by the humanities saying they wanted equal pay and summer opportunities as STEM grads (their words when they went around to offices on campus). In my opinion we already had great insurance, yearly raises, minimum fees, and comfortable living with enough to save a few grand each semester. Where does the extra money come from to bump the lower paying fields' stipends and how do you regulate summer opportunities when most are outside of the university or on limited prof research grants?\n\nNot an anti-union comment, just a genuine question from an uninformed post grad.",

Unionizing benefits everyone, but particularly the people who are the lowest earners or the most vulnerable. The benefits you had may not be enough for people who are in a different circumstance (single parent, non-STEM student, someone with chronic health problems, international grad student, etc. ) than you, and that's important to recognize!    \n\n\nIn terms of \"where the money comes from\", there are a variety of sources. Universities are, for better or worse, run like a business to generate profit. You can look up your school's financial reports to see what their sources of income are (often it is interest from banks, investments, donations, etc). If it's a public state school, you can even look up the salaries of upper admin, faculty, etc. Grad students do just as much (if not more) work for the university. They totally deserve the compensation. I'll add too that it's not a competition between grad students when asking for more pay, benefits, etc. You won't lose things because others have gained things. So it isn't the responsibility of grad students to choose where the money comes from, that's for the university to sort out. Hopefully this gives some insight!

Your dues are important because it's money you've earned that will be spend on advocacy - and most of that money goes to the national union (in most cases, but possibly not all) and not the local.",

Notably, you're not party to your own contract, so if you're asked for a concession or work outside what's been agreed to, it's up to the union to push back - you don't have legal standing.\n\nUsually they will, but sometimes unions take dues and don't do shit. Leadership can be cliquish, they should work for everyone equally, but often you'll get more out if they like you.\n\nUltimately, these aren't big concerns in most cases. I say join the union!\n\nBut as good as academics are at finding nuance on lots of things, we've got to be honest that mileage can vary with unions too.",

I had to cross the picket line just to get to Chemistry department to get my degree. They were promising money for degrees like English, or Humanities, or other non scientifically funded degrees in order to get those grads to vote for them. NO science related grads voted for them because we are funded getting our degrees.\n\nSee you are in a educational program not a job. The result is a PhD not 70 grand per year. Follow the money! \n\nSo when the union fights for more pay even though you are making 39K per year where do you think the money comes from? The school's endowment fund? Nope, it comes from increased fees for both grads and undergrads.",

The national union primarily exists to provide the threat of legal action, to counterbalance your university from simply hiring a union-busting law firm and bogging you down in court. If you are concerned about the political positions of your national affiliate, push to join a union which allows its locals more autonomy and democratic self-determination.\n\nIf joining a union actually hurt the finances of grad students, there would be dozens of cases of shitty contracts with no meaningful raises or benefits. But that's simply not the case. As you can see all over this thread, unionizing students consistently win better wages, stronger healthcare coverage, protections against abuse, and more. To top things off, unions don't just win benefits, they protect the benefits you have.",
