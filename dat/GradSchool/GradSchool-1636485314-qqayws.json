  "title:": "Plagiarized Group Project",
  "text": "I had a group project with 2 other group members in which we were given an article and we had to give a presentation about it and then write a group report on it. As we all know, group projects can be frustrating and some people work at different paces than others. My group members did not finish their sections until 1 hour before we had to submit it. I read it once over, thought it sounded good and was formatted well, and submitted it for us. Now that I'm looking at it again, Unicheck says their parts were over 30% plagiarized, my section is basically clean. I've never had this happen with any of my work, but I'm assuming 30% is very bad. I reached out to my teacher about it, and she said she will look into it. I'm very worried that despite it not being \"my part\", it was a group project therefore all of it is my responsibility and I will get in trouble for this. I guess I'm not really asking for advice since I've done all that I can, but has anyone else ever experienced this before?",

      "text": "I would not be concerned about getting in trouble; it is clear that the section you created was not plagiarized. There is certainly something to be said for \"checking it before you submit it\" but:\n\n1) If your group members don't submit it to you in a timely manner for a check, how can you be expected to check? It's not your fault they left you with no time to be overly diligent, and \n\n2) You all (presumably) agreed to an honor code/academic integrity policy. You should be able to trust your cohort members to not plagiarize; the fact they lied to you and the professor (which they did by submitting someone else's work as theirs) isn't your fault and you can't be expected to be policing your classmembers, especially given the first point.\n\nDon't worry, you've done what you should by reporting it/explaining what happened.",

      "text": "Are you sure that the 30% percent didn't come from references? If I run my projects through any plagiarism program (I use grammarly usually) with my references, I get a ridiculous number since many people use those references. When I submit without, I get a much better score.\n\nBut if you were honest with your professor, I think you will be okay.\n\nThis is yet another reason I hate group projects.",
