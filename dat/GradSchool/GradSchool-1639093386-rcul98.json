  "text": "So, I have a term paper due for this semester. I've chosen a topic and everything, and the professor provided us with only the following instructions for the term paper:\n\n* Please do not just summarize each paper in a short paragraphs.\n* Instead try, for example, to synthesize from all the papers you read in terms of phenomena and/or how it changed with experimental techniques, materials used and modelling conditions\n* Mechanistic discussion of above\n\nThe course is Chemical Thermodynamics (masters level) if that helps. What does he mean by this?",
