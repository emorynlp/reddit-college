  "title:": "I'm about to have my defense, but very unsatisfied about my dissertation",
  "text": "I will have my defense next week and I don't think that my dissertation is good enough. My supervisor has even hinted that there's nothing new about my dissertation. I honestly feel like it's at the same level as a bachelor thesis. My defense will be open to anyone in the department, so it's going to be embarrassing. I feel like I consistently rank at the bottom compared to my colleagues and it's just so disheartening. The problem is, I think I could have done better and I wasn't given enough support. I think my supervisor pushes me for the defense so he can get rid of me. I know I can't quit now--I'm so very close to the end.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same way? How do you deal with that?",

I remember my PhD years as a terrible black hole. My body suffered too. Now I am feeling much better although it's hard to be early career (and first gen...) without a senior academic I can ask for advice. I'm learning everything through trial and error. I have a temp contract now but it's fine, considering I'm doing everything on my own.",

      "text": "\"Done\" is better than \"good\"! \n\nAlso, after dedicating so much time and energy into learning your topic & researching it, *you* will see the weaknesses and flaws far more than anyone else. If your committee passes it, which I'm sure they will, then it's plenty good enough. \n\nI know it varies by field & career goals, but remember that the primary function of a dissertation is the final gatekeeping mechanism to getting a PhD. Your goal is to finish it, defend it, and move on. Sure, some people turn their dissertation into multiple articles or a career path and that's great, but you also *don't have to* - that's a cherry on top. \n\nIf you're going a research route after this, great! You can learn what you didn't like about your dissertation and apply that forward to future work. If you're not going a research route, then as soon as you pass just drop this and run far away.",

Without an advisor. It is primarily meant to be a learning experience.\n\nSo your advisor may recognize that in you, and that you are ready to finish this project so that you can move on to doing work on your own.",
