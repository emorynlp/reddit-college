  "text": "I hated school during my bachelor's degree. I didn't think I would need a secondary degree. After having lost my job in the pandemic, and jumping from job to job, I just feel I need to go back to school. But I'm unable to afford it.\n\nMy mindset has changed because I often felt I hit a ceiling. About 4 months ago, I was accepted to an alternate certification program that would supplement and subsidized the first masters. In my state, it pays, literally pays to get a second masters or PhD. You get a higher salary step and rate. \n\nWhat are some free or close to free programs that would allow me to go back to school full-time and pay me like a PhD? Thanks.\n\nWant to plan for after the first masters.",

If you can\u2019t answer this question very thoroughly then you may be setting yourself up for an awful time.\n\nThe master\u2019s is honestly probably sufficient with any teaching requirements you could ever need. Remember, the PhD isn\u2019t just a title, it\u2019s a full time job that requires a lot of sacrifice to prove you are capable of producing your own research. \n\nTo add a further answer to your question, I understand a lot of education PhD\u2019s can be done  while you are teaching. In Houston we have certain districts that are even willing to pay for them IF you can justify it but this is rare and I only remember one case off the top of my head.

So your first step should be to identify which programs sound interesting to you, and then reach out to their admissions officer/program manager to ask about how funding works in their program.",

You *may* be able to power through a Masters degree, but trying to do a PhD without really wanting it is a recipe for disaster. Take it from someone who is Mastering out of their PhD program as we speak. I see in another comment of yours that you're also in it for the title - that's another red flag. \n\nNone of us here know you, so take everything with a grain of salt, but I literally can not imagine successfully completing any graduate program without an intense desire to be there. The system is just not set up like that. It's not remotely like undergraduate where you can go on autopilot and graduate with no issues.",

I can but I have to be on a pathway to higher educational levels. My program will help fund the first masters, which will make me certified, granted I pass all of the other certifications and tests. \n\nSo I repeat, I need a masters degree. The first one. \n\nAs you may or may not be aware though, teaching as a field, in my state, because I'll be enrolled in the union, fights for benefits. I'll be earning more via a secondary masters, PhD, or some other professional certificate. \n\nSo why would I not try to obtain that? My salary will increase heavily if I have that. Teaching is the only field where it pays to learn. \n\nI realize this is down the line. But why keep my options closed? As I've mentioned, I'm not going to the PhD route for shits and giggles. It'll pay to obtain it.\n\n My long term goal is to work as an assistant principal, and eventually a principal.",

My doctorate is me reading and writing without much interaction with people outside of my mentor/cohort. I'm laser focused on a minute subset of my field for 3+ years (and counting). I'm an inch wide and a mile deep.\n\nTeaching requires me to use skills like public speaking, story telling, managing a room, and providing consistent feedback. I couldn't teach successfully in Stem without working in the field and having life experience to draw from. Classes cover broad topics so you have to be able to talk to a lot. It's an inch deep and a mile wide. You don't have to have a Dr to be a good teacher, it's part innate and part practice (again, in my experience). Honestly I don't use anything from my research in teaching and working to be a Dr has no impact on the skills I use to teach. \n\nYou could tell in school who was a researcher forced to teach a class or two and who was a teacher forced to put out research. People usually gravitate to one or the other, a few love both. \n\nI would recommend teaching an intro class at a community college to get a feel for teaching (or this exp might come from your current program) and then write a 50 source/30 page paper about a niche topic. That should help you understand your strengths and might provide more direction to research or teaching. \n\nNo need to go through the pain of a Dr if it won't help you in the long run (if you fell in love with teaching but not research). Or you could focus on research positions outside of teaching (which don't all require Drs).",

I don't think you can blame folks for being skeptical; you've been out of college for several years and (in your words) hated a less rigorous college experience.\n\n\nYou mention teaching law school or philosophy. Those are *extremely different* paths and getting an education degree doesn't get you to either of those. For teaching academic subjects, you want a subject-based PhD, and generally that means doing your own research, ie dissertation. Education PhDs can also require dissertations. Do you have a sense of what you'd write a literal book about? I'm not asking that to be mean; I'm asking because that's what you need to demonstrate in your application materials. You really need to think more about your specific goals and do more research about how to get there before you worry about funding.\n\n\nNow, most likely you'll want funding through assistantships or fellowships depending on the major. Those are program-specific, so again, it's doing a baseline level of research into programs that fit your goals and what they offer in funding. Look at pages, send emails.\n\n\n\nAlso, in response to your jab: *we're trying to help you.* I'm in grad school because I love research, I love learning, and I love trying to develop content that will teach more people about my field. On the other hand, academia is something that takes so much out of you, and the culture normalizes being stressed and overworked, and the competition can be toxic. Because of that, I'd only recommend it to someone who had a clear passion and couldn't see themselves not continuing their education and career. That's the approach my faculty took in undergrad, and that's the same advice I'd give a close friend. If you can't stomach that skepticism, you'll have another thing coming from academics.",
