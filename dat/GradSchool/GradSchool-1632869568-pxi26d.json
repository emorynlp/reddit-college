  "text": "I am applying to Communication Studies grad programs for my Master's, which each require a 10-15 page writing sample. This would be no issue, but I think I lost all of my work from undergrad (I have been graduated for a year now). I used Word on a MacBook, and then 1 month before I graduated it broke and I got a Chromebook which I used Google Docs on. I swore I saved at least one or two papers on Docs or emailed them to myself at some point, but nothing is coming up. I don't have access to my student email or Canvas. \nI am thinking my best bet is to just write something new, with a focus in what I would be interested in pursuing further research if I get accepted to a program. I am working a job that would allow me the time to do this, so that wouldn't be an issue. Is this something other folks have done? I know they won't necessarily know or care when it was written, but it just seems like it could come across as trying too hard for the application? I don't know, help please!",

Often as much as grades and GRE scores. \n\nSo you want to put together the best writing sample you can. Whether it's something old that you revise/refine. Or something new.\n\nIf you recently completed your undergraduate degree, and wrote a very good paper your senior year which you submitted digitally to your professor, and received back digitally, your professor may still have a copy of it. You could contact them.\n\nWhat was your undergraduate degree? Did you complete some kind of senior thesis?\n\nAlso, if the writing sample relates in subject matter to the area you hope to study in your Master's, that's also a plus. What area of Communications are you interested in?",

          "text": "Thank you for the insight! I was able to get a few papers from my senior from my email, thank goodness. \n\nI was an Organizational Communication Studies major in undergrad, but I'm leaning more into a community and interaction interest while applying. I have a few examples I think could be a nice starting point to rework/re-research for my application. \n\nThe programs I am interested do not require the GRE- would you recommend it still? (If you have insight, of course.) Thanks!",

              "text": "I don't know about the GRE. My specialty is digital rhetoric and technical writing, but I taught in a writing department. My guess is that if they really wanted the GRE, they would have asked for it.\n\nThat's great you got hold of your papers. Since the program doesn't require the GRE, you can bet they're going to heavily weigh the quality of the research and writing in your submission. All parts of it. Not just the writing sample itself. So take your time to compose and revise everything you submit. Get someone to give you a final proofread, too.\n\nAs far as re-researching, did you do primary data collection? If you feel like it could be improved, you can instead note that in your write up, rather than collecting data all over again. Then focus on the quality of the write-up.\n\nIf your research worked with secondary sources and academic theory, and you know you could dig a little deeper for a few more sources to support your thesis, then that does make sense. I think it's pretty rare for a professor to say, \"You did too much research and over-supported your thesis.\" lol\n\nThen again, a very well written 10 to 12 page paper would be better than a 15-page paper that includes more information, but is not as well written. Your paper could be read by a rhetorician looking at your rhetorical strategies, technical communication expert paying attention to the usability/readability of your writing, or an academic theorist who is mainly interested in your ability to engage theory. Etc. You really can't predict, so you want to make it the best writing you can. \n\nI also would guess that you don't need to rewrite to support your new focus for graduate work. It's very common for people to make lateral shifts within a field when going from undergraduate to graduate school. And people in the committee won't necessarily be in the area that you're applying for.\n\nMake sure the first page or two of your paper is fantastic. And spend a little extra time on the conclusion in case they mainly read the first page or two, skim, and then slow down at the end.\n\nNot everyone on a graduate committee is going to read your whole paper carefully, because they'll be looking at a lot of submissions. This is also why I said what I did about the 10 to 12 page paper above. So if the first page or two is not excellent writing, they may not read much further. \n\nFinally, some programs may ask for a portfolio. So having an academic piece to show off your academic research and writing ability, and a technical/professional communication piece, like you would do for the workplace, could be a good idea.",
