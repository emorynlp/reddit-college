She suggested minor revisions (which are nearly all technical things about academic writing that I didn\u2019t know because uh... this is my first real paper) and wants me to submit for publication! \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude2d Thanks for existing, GradSchool Reddit, so that I can share my joy on this...",

          "text": "As far as the argument goes I think the research should kind of argue itself, if that makes sense... The analysis should answer the question(s) you posed. My understanding of the discussion session is that it is more a place to acknowledge weak points/caveats in your analysis and findings, raise issues for consideration that you haven\u2019t raised elsewhere in the paper, and highlight what comes next, as in, ideas for subsequent research that would build off of your findings. Hope that helps!",
