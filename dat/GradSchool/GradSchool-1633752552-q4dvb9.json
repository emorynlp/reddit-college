Delicious, non-junk food (and sometimes junk!) does make it better too \ud83d\ude0b",

Depression is also a part of burn-out and it's not worth it to hold a high standard forever. I don't want to say you should drop any of your tasks, but perhaps look if it's possible (also financially) to lower the pace. I'm now in my PhD and enjoying my work thoroughly, but I'm also taking sick leave to work on my mental health right now.",

              "text": "I can't speak for everyone's experiences obviously but I think it often has to do with two main factors. First, graduate school programs by unintentional design lack positive feedback. Students are often working on long term research projects where the it takes years to be published. Essentially, the rewards are not very immediate and the ratio of positive feedback to negative corrective feedback is quite skewed. Second, unlike when working for corporations, grad students are very much stuck in their programs without the ability to leave. If you dislike your job, you can always start looking for a job at another corporation. In graduate school, there are very few options to switch advisors or programs without significant setbacks which leads to a feeling of helplessness. That's all compounded by long hours, low pay, and the fact that most folks move for their programs (removing you from your support network).",

My situation was a little different...not exactly sure what your field is like, but I got a PhD in genetics, and I would say the toughest issue in school was just \"getting through\" it when so much of my experiments (it's normal for this to happen to others in labs) would 'fail' or yield results that were \"uninteresting\" and therefore in the broken science publishing unpublishable. Soooo I'm assuming there are just aspects in your field that although different, it just feels like you're constantly beating your head against a brick wall and then nothing happens. Sometimes you chip away at it, but it's so few and far between, and then right after you're just back to the same ol' same ol'. Depression, imposter syndrome, all real and all so common....sorry.\n\nIf your experience is like most others', and forgive me because I have to make an assumption, most likely your brain is lying to you in some way or another. If I were in your shoes, I would immediately, if you can:\n\n1. Take advantage of your school's mental health resources. If they are limited (mine only allowed twenty visits in my 6 years....) or just not there, seek outside professional help.\n2. If you get diagnosed for anything, get it on record with your school, whatever that may entail.\n3. If you aren't, get more connected with others in your program and plan to do some things outside of school.\n4. Be kind to your body and mind.\n\nFeel free to reach out for other strategies. It's easy to see all the bullshit I went through, all the stupid mistakes (such as coping with alcohol), all the fake things the Imposter was telling me then --- but only now in HINDSIGHT. For example, at what sounds like your stage I started contemplating opening a nubian goat creamery, somehow get paid to pick up litter, or maybe open up a hotdog stand.....all really cool things, but not related to genetics.

With that said, I would suggest reaching out to your support system for guidance and perspective; which I mean those who strongly support you no matter what. Most often, it may feel more nuanced because you felt all the more burnt out emotionally before. In fact, it's the worst feeling in the world when you are mostly ignored by others, especially when it comes to what you are going through. But it's worth knowing you are not the first one who dealt with adversity given these abnormal times, nor that you are the last.",

I am over it and just want grad school behind me.  \nFor me it feels like my creativity has just dropped and I'm on adrenaline fueled autopilot.  These next two months cannot come fast enough.",

      "text": "I hear u, I really do. The other day I started crying after having a rollercoaster of emotions relating to my ability to do well in grad school, be good enough compared to my classmates, not feel like a total failure for taking more time than others, etc. Crying is important and helps us release this stress, but at the same time, it's draining and it sucks. And it's hard as hell to go through this process, but you definitely are not alone. The attempt to keep a professional appearance (i think) keeps people from talking about this more often, which is BS because I know my classmates feel this way too.",

Absolutely nothing from this program is bringing me joy and it saddens me, being in this program has been my long term goal for years now. Feel free to PM me, I can resonate with a lot of what you\u2019ve said!",
