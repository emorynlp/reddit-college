  "text": "Hi! I'm 26F reaching out to see who would be interested in joining a discord support group for those with ADHD. This is a pretty casual group where you can vent and get support, ask for advice about school or managing symptoms, or just post funny memes and talk with others.\n\nI started this group because I thought it would be nice to connect and share support with a more niche group that would best be able to relate to eachothers struggles. I've found other ADHD discord groups, but their so general and too large to keep up or make connections.\n I have friends in my program as well, but they have a hard time exactly \"getting\" what's going on in my head and some of my struggles. Which is no fault of their own, but can still feel pretty isolating.\n \n\nsome criteria and membership info:\n\n- You must have ADHD (bonus points if it's severe and you also struggle with anxiety & depression)\n-  You must be in a graduate or doctorate program or the following: Post-Doc, recently graduated, or soon to be applying for grad school welcome as well.\n- Ages 21-37 is approximate age range currently \n- United States is where most members are from, but there are also members representing countries in Asia & Europe.\n- 35 members as of this post\n- There are actually current more members self identifying as bi than any other group!\n-  Members are from a wide variety of fields, but STEM & Research are the most represented, followed by health & medicine and education & academia. \n- Most members identifying as female, followed by men, and than non-binary \n- There are more pet parents vs human parents (pet parents for the win \ud83d\udc08)\n\nHit me up if you're interested! Again, please give me some info about yourself as far as your experience with ADHD and school.",
