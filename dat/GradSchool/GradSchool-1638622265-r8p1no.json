  "title:": "How much of a research article do you skim vs. actually read?",
  "text": "I started my PhD this semester, and I've been trying to be \"smarter\" about how I read research - when I was doing my master's, I committed to reading, more or less, every word in a given article. Granted, I would start to skim if the research was clearly repeating itself, but for the most part I spent a ton of time reading research and taking notes\n\nThis semester, with the amount of reading I've had to do, I've found myself using the three pass approach more often. This has worked great on more traditional articles with conventional structure, but not every paper is structured this way, and regardless of format, I still fret that, if I don't read everything, I'll miss something important \n\nI want to be thorough in my reading and preparation, but I also don't want to spend an inordinate amount of time reading. Just wanted to get a feel around here for your reading habits when it comes to research and how much time you devote to it",

      "text": "It depends on what I am looking for/researching for. I'll select my papers to look further in by abstract. Once selected, if I am looking for information, I'll go to introduction + discussion and if I see something relevant I'll go to results and see how did they reach it. Usually method is not something I read, unless I want to understand the procedure.\n\nNow if I am looking for something methodical, then I'll go to method first then results and discussion, see how they used a method. \n\nI don't read a paper cover to cover unless I am going to use it as a basis to build on for my research or I am presenting it as a literature sample. \n\nIt is all about being mindful really, reading it all wouldn't be productive or beneficial, you'd lose time to review one paper while you could three while obtaining the info you want.",

I\u2019m very good at speed reading and 90% of papers I \u201cread\u201d it\u2019s more of an assessment: \n\n1) Is what this is saying relevant enough for me to put it into my mental bank?\n2) Is it worth reading more?\n\nThat is a speed reading approach that\u2019s some combo of: abstract, last paragraph of intro that summarizes the conclusions, first paragraph of discussion, and the figures. \n\nFrom there I still rarely read the text because for me what the data shows is more important than what the authors say the data shows. The only case where what they\u2019re saying REALLY matters is if it\u2019s in my specific field area and I\u2019ll need to account for that in writing my work. \n\nThe last part is usually some part of \u201cdo I buy it?\u201d Or \u201cis the data for this robust?\u201d but I\u2019d say it\u2019s extremely rare for me to read a paper cover to cover. Modern biomedical papers are just too dense and cover too much for it to ever be the case that it all matters to me.\n\nOften the papers I \u201cread\u201d the most are the ones I save to a folder and refer back to over time. In that way reading isn\u2019t a one sitting thing but a progressive consultation",

Might jump straight to the hypotheses in the last paragraph of the intro.\n\nIs the paper more about establishing an effect or application than theory? I'll spend even less time in the intro and look toward the hypotheses and results. If there are many analyses and the authors appear to be using copacetic statistics, I may jump to the discussion unless I'm looking for a specific effect.\n\nI can only read this way because of the first articles I read all the way through, though.
