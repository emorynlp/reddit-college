  "text": "Title says it all, i'm currently a MSW student and i'm thinking about going for my PhD eventually. Right now I'm burnt out and want to finish, but I'm thinking about going into social welfare, or not necessarily social work, but something along those lines.  I plan on applying next year to avoid being out of school too long.",
