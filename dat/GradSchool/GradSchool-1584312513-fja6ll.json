  "text": "I'm the first student in my department to defend online - we've had people's overseas committee members Skype in before, but nothing on this scale. I plan on still going to campus and setting up the (empty) lecture hall as if I'm presenting to an audience...but it does feel weird. I'm excited to be done but I can't shake the feeling that I'm kind of just slinking away after 3 years here. Maybe there'll be room for fanfare later on and I can take my committee out to drinks over the summer or something.",

It rubs me the wrong way when people talk about not having fanfare or loads of people able to show up and have to do it through zoom.  As a kardashian said (yes I did just write that) \u201cpeople are dying \u201c , personally I have had a couple of friends have to quit or take lots of time off for mental health reasons.  Some people who are defending in the next couple of months are having their labs closed down.  You are rightfully allowed to have these mixed feelings and your follow up focusing on not having a passing goodbye makes it more poignant. Reddit is also the place to share /vent to all in categories, I just wished people on this thread would be a bit more mindful.",

Completing a graduate degree is a *ton* of work, during which many obstacles must be overcome - I, too, have struggled with mental health, financial insecurity, et cetera. But that's not the point of a defense. It's a capstone to communicate and disseminate your results to the public as somewhat of a closing rite, and missing out on that culmination of years of work is more than just disappointing.
