  "title:": "I have discovered 6 new species in the past 3 years",
  "text": "Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to name a new species of something. Anything, really... I just thought it was so cool to be the first person to name an organism. Three years into my grad program, and I have discovered six living things never before seen by human eyes. I've named two of them and have the others waiting on me.  \n\nDiscovering species isn't part of my thesis at all. I do this in my own time. One of the best parts of being in grad school is having 24/7 access to a world-class lab, but these aren't obscure microbes that require multimillion-dollar culture vessels to observe. I'm literally finding these things in puddles, on the side of the road, at the beach. The vast majority of the time, I can key out my critters and bugs with a few days' work in the library or a quick genetic barcode. But those times when I can't... those are the moments that make all this worthwhile. \n\nI went to grad school because I like new things. The irony is that new things are everywhere. You're probably stepping over new things on your way to the toilet every morning. The joy of being a lifelong student is looking where others never thought to look, and seeing what others never dreamed to see. ",

          "text": "Lots and lots (and lots) of reading. \n\nThe only way to be absolutely sure that your critter is new is to identify it as far as you can (say, to genus level) and then read every single \"we found this new thing\" paper at that level. It can be a huge slog, and you often have to wade through several languages to get the information you need. (That's how I learned passable French!) Being familiar with the general group is a huge benefit. I would have no idea where to start if I found a new plant or vertebrate! But for most invertebrates, I know them well enough at first glance to say, \"Oh, that's a nice little bdelloid rotifer\" or \"What a cute gastrotrich!\" That familiarity helps you home in on the right stuff to read more quickly than if you had no idea what you were looking at. (Again, me with plants or vertebrates.)\n\nThe cool part is that we totally live in the future... most scientific literature of the past 200 years is available online! It's absolutely crazy to me that I can, from my personal computer, conduct a literature survey in a matter of days that would have taken MONTHS just a few decades ago. ",

                  "text": "> How do you distinguish between different species and same species but different phenotype? \n\nThat's the question underlying the whole field of taxonomy! How different is \"different enough\"? We've got a decent functional definition of different species:  groups of organisms that don't interbreed. But how do you test that? For most things, you can't just jam their faces together and say, \"Now kiss.\" How do you really know if this new thing you found isn't just a punk rock rebel subgroup of this other thing? \n\nGenetic barcoding is a great tool to help answer that question, but relies on a pre-existing database. If the closest relatives of the new thing you found haven't had a barcode sequenced, you're SOL on the genetics front. I actually ran into that problem with my first species... I knew the genus, but nothing in that genus had ever been sequenced. My sequence was the first for the group. That's when I had to use life history evidence (where the thing lived, how it reproduced, etc.) and morphology to argue for a new species!",

The only things you really need to do to describe a species are 1) name it in some kind of publication, and 2) submit a \"holotype\" to some museum. The holotype is the single organism upon which the new species description is based. It's submitted to a museum so that, later on, anybody can go look at it to verify its identity, compare it to other species, etc. \n\nAs far as financial ramifications, the only \"necessary\" cost is publication fees (because academic journals are a total scam). You don't get any money or anything for the discovery. Sadly. Because I'm a poor grad student and could really use a bonus ;-)",

I\u2019m not in a science field, but one of my science teachers towards the end of high school (so just under 10 years ago) used to do research in geology at the US Geological Survey. One day he was telling us about this fish that\u2019s long since extinct, and then he shows us a picture of the fossil. Then another kid in the class raises his hand and says that there\u2019s a video of the fish on YouTube. He thought it was bullshit so that night the kid found the video and emailed it to the teacher. \n\nWe all came in next class and instead of taking a quiz we got to watch a video of a diver in the Caribbean taking a video underwater of this fish. (Still had to take the quiz, though.)",

His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
