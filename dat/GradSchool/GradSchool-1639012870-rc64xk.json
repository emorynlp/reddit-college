  "text": "I share an office with 4 other grad students. The office has a window that looks out into the hallway. Top half was covered, button half was not prior to my arrival. People would peak into the office and I can see peoples legs walking by and causing a distraction. Another student and I decided to cover the bottom half. Another student\u2019s supervisor forced them to take it off when we weren\u2019t there, stating that we do not need privacy and don\u2019t need to be hiding if we\u2019re working. Is this prof being an asshole?\n\nMy future plan is to put Christmas decorations on the same location.",
