      "text": "It really comes down to the department or even the supervisor. Talking to current and recent grad students can help you get a feel for the atmosphere of the program. If you're worried to directly ask \"is this toxic?\" you can ask in other ways, for instance \"How does the department/faculty support students\" or \"what would you change about the program\" and so on. \n\n\nIf you do this, it's best to talk to multiple people, because some folks may have different experiences than others, or some may be more willing to talk about certain issues. For instance, I've loved my graduate assistant work this semester, but I had friends who were miserable.",
