  "text": "I am a first-year Ph.D. international student in the US. My field is mathematics. Today\u2019s session with students were horrible.\n\nStudents asked me questions, but I couldn\u2019t even understand what they were talking about. I\u2019m having a hard time with the English language. I am pretty sure I got a fluke when I took TOEFL.\n\nEven if I could understand, I didn\u2019t know how to answer them. The curriculum is vastly different from the one in my country. Even worse, I told one of them an incorrect answer. Fortunately, the prof followed up, so the mess I caused got cleaned. (In this case, I learned that I should have prepared more)\n\nSimilar things happened too many times ever since I started here a few weeks ago. I can see I'm losing their trust. When I go to students to answer questions, sometimes I will just be asked to get some other people who can actually answer questions.\n\nI'm trying to improve, but things don't seem to get better. It just makes me want to quit being TA, but my tuition relies on the TAship, so I just can't, or I have to quit everything.\n\nDoes it get better, or am I hopeless?",

      "text": "You are being asked to do a job with less training than what a lot of schools provide. First, many grad programs don't expect graduate students to TA in their first semester. Just getting situated and taking classes is a lot. \n\nSecond, there should be a TA training program, usually offered as a first-year course, that teaches grad students the basics of being a TA. \n\nThird, good schools offer training in English for international teaching assistants. These are specifically for language skills that are important when TAing, and for grad students, who are really good at learning things and expect to be good at what they do. \n\nYou have not been provided with any of those things, so it will be harder to succeed this semester. Inquire about some of those support resources.",

      "text": "I agree with all of the other comments here that this is just part of the process, and that it will get better. Language gets better when you use it; your written english is perfect so I'm sure the speaking and listening will get easier quickly. One short-term/practical suggestion is to see if your university has any resources for international TAs; they may be able to match you up with a mentor who has been through this and/or give you advice on managing the language difficulties!",

You can help them with math, and all of this interaction that you\u2019re forced into will help you with English. If you can\u2019t understand something they say, you can say something like, \u201cCould you please repeat that for Mr. Foreigner over here?\u201d It\u2019s self-deprecating humor, but it could help them understand how to communicate more clearly. You should be confident in your skills\u2014 both English and math! You passed the TOEFL! It wasn\u2019t a fluke. You\u2019re working professionally in a second language. That\u2019s really something to be proud of! It may be exhausting this semester, but it will get easier. Also, if you were taught a different way to approach a problem, why not show the students that way? They might be interested to learn an alternative approach.",

The mess was already here before you got here, so don't worry about that!\n\nUndergraduates can be pretty mean to TAs, especially when there is a language barrier. You should still be the TA. They need to learn to be patient with nonnative English speakers. They might not learn this lesson until long after your class. For now I suggest a lot of smiling and nodding.\n\nFor future semesters you should request to teach a class in a subject you enjoy. That way at least if the students give you grief you can focus on the material and get some satisfaction out of it.\n\nI'm also in math. I finished my degree a couple years ago. In a PhD program the teaching is really a small part of it. Focus on your studies. The professors will judge you on your math.",
