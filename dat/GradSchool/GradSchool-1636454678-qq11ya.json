  "title:": "How do you pick the right word, and could I have your advice on this one?",
  "text": "Some words like multidimensional, examine, multifaceted, aspects, etc they are difficult for me to know which one is right. Even after looking them up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo its believed that there is a critical period of time in children's lives where they can learn language easier than adults. but there are many different (WORD IDK HERE), such as the accent, or how fast they learn simple grammar, or how fast they can acquire super complex grammar stuff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ncould it be \"aspects\" or I don't know... lol I've looked through the thesaurus front and back and sometimes even when reading the definition sometimes its almost a philosophical question what word is best there it seems. Thank you.",

There are a lot of native english speakers that hang around there (myself included) and are usually pretty quick to respond.",

I think that is the closest representation of the word you're looking for.\n\n\nEdit: To add, English is my second language and the meanings of the ideas you listed made the most sense to me with the word \"perspectives\". A native speaker could be able to lead you to a better option.",
