      "text": "Sorta depends on your program. The first two terms of my program was course-heavy so I didn't really need my supervisor for much. We still met and discussed potential topics for my dissertation. In the summer and subsequent fall term they helped guide me in studying for my comprehensive/qualifying exam.  In the coming winter term they'll help me develop my methods for my thesis proposal and give feedback on drafts. We haven't officially collaborated on anything yet, it's still in the planning stages.",
