  "text": "(no I don't actually have a country dialect)\n\nOk sure, I barely slept before I defended my thesis and was working too much and tired even before then. Sure sure I'm way past burnt out.\n\nBut then I took basically two weeks of reduced/no work and I'm as tired as ever! I can barely do anything!\n\nIs the fact that I went to a football game relevant? I didnt party after and don't drink. What's a guy gotta do?\n\nAnyone else just perpetually dead dispite resting some over Thanksgiving?",

I couldn't figure out why my two weeks of rest and relaxation didn't fix my exhaustion.\n\nUnfortunately.. it took me about 2 months to start to feel human again after I burned myself into the ground. I think you might need a little longer to recoup.",
