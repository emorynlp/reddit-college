  "text": "I'm in a Masters in Ed program right now and I'm on track to become a teacher. I'm realizing that, while I love young people, I struggle a lot with classroom management because I don't want to tell them what to do. Like, kids already spend so much time being told how to act or how to behave and that's basically the bulk of what teaching is. I also don't like lesson planning and struggle a lot with it. So essentially all I really love is working with children and hate the act of teaching.\n\nNext semester, I would have to be in my placement school full-time. I'm currently there 2x a week and I have spent the past summer taking 3 classes on teaching and some theory. I spent this semester taking two classes on teaching and then being in the school, and taking other courses I like.\n\nI'm supposed to take a class in January and I don't really want to do that. I don't even know if I'd want to be in the school full-time. I could tell them that I don't want to teach anymore but I would have to come up with classes next semester that are about schools or schooling in some way. I think it's doable, but I do want to switch careers into tech somehow and I feel like I fucked up. I should've just switched full programs before I even started, but I didn't do that. \n\nI am struggling really hard to figure out what to do. How am I going to get a job? I used to work in non-profit and don't want to do that. How can I make this work for me? It feels awful to even consider this.",
