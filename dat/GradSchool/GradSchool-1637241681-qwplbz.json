  "text": "I propose my thesis next month, which means I have to have my final draft to my committee in about two weeks. I have been having a lot of motivation issues lately and I\u2019m just so worried I won\u2019t finish on time. To make matters worse, the past week I keep waking up multiple times a night every night from nightmares about my thesis! \n\nLast night I kept dreaming that my advisor forgot to tell me about a (not real) 40 page addendum until the day before. I woke up this morning panicking about this not real addendum!! I do not need this right now",
