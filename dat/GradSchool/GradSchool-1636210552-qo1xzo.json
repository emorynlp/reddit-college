An important part of getting a PhD is knowing what you don't know and being willing to express that.\n\nAnd that's not just having an awareness within your discipline of what you do know and what you don't know.\n\nBut it's also about being comfortable with expressing the limitations of your knowledge, because you don't have enough information to provide a correct answer or an educated opinion. \n\nThat's important to being a true expert. There are a lot of people that wing it and throw out an opinion based on anecdotal experience or limited knowledge (Reddit is full of that), which makes them unreliable as an expert. And it also makes them bad researchers because they make faulty assumptions.\n\nFinally, in this instance it's a good thing. With your professors pointing out where your knowledge is limited, that can give you ideas of where you may need to build expertise in order to complete a good dissertation.",

I was listening to a BBC show about a massacre against slaves for insurance money on a ship and one of the guests, a Harvard prof, wondered how word of the massacre spread on the plantations in Jamaica. He was asked by the host if he had any evidence of that happening and the prof said something like \"No, I haven't done that level of oral historical research, but we can assume.\"",

      "text": "Oral examinations are dynamic; they don't have to waste a bunch of time on stuff that you obviously already know. The committee doesn't know the limits of your knowledge unless they ask questions that lie beyond it, and force you to stretch. Asking questions that are at - or beyond - the limits of your comfort zone can offer revealing insights into how you think about solving problems.\n\nAn analogy that I've used before is to think about your field as...a literal field. Your knowledge and expertise are a fenced-in area within that field. At the start of your graduate work, the fence might only enclose a tiny circle, an arm's length away from you in any direction. As you learn and build experience, you push that boundary out, further and further.\n\nCrucially, no matter how much you learn, no matter how many skills you master, that fence will always be somewhere on the horizon. Indeed, the more you learn the longer the fence gets, so that there will be more and more stuff - and more *interesting* and *unique* and *unusual* stuff - just beyond its edge.",

      "text": "\"I don't know\" is important in industry as well as school. Not knowing shows the importance of being honest about your areas of knowledge at that precise moment. If you are unsure you can be informed or look it up later. If you try to BS someone who presses further on the matter, they will see through that facade immediately and it hurts your credibility.
