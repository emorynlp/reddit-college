  "title:": "I've spent the last two months literally doing nothing in the lab AMA",
  "text": "Hello, I am a 5th year graduate student. I currently take 4 days off per week. I've generated 0 useable data in the past 2 months. I only go in to maintain my cells.\n\nI have a fully written manuscript but my PI insist on more data and says this is the last piece before we submit. I've spent 3.5 years perfecting my rejected manuscript and numerous times had to scrape many many hypotheses. The core premises of my project constantly shift and it makes me feel unconfident in my science however it is too late for me to start something new. Also, I am currently 'working' on 2 review papers except I lie and say I'm not ready to show my drafts.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic my productivity has slowly windled into a place where I no longer feel an urge or drive to do experiments. I have 0 intellectual curiosity when it comes to this project because my PI has magically squeezed every last ounce of my enthusiasm and I'm left as a shell of my former science self.\n\nSoon the jig will be up but I'll just collect my stipend payments and not give a shit about my productivity.\n\nAMA",

The first time I when I struck out completely broke me. It didn\u2019t help that despite multiple lab experiences and publications I couldn\u2019t find an entry-level job for the life of me\u2026 in over a year of constant applying and constant rejection. Meanwhile, in the same time, my parents didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t relate to what I was going through and how morally drained I was from being told again and again \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough\u201d. My mom compared the whole thing to her own applying to medical school - where she got in on the first try. The parallel was absolutely aggravating. Those were dark days to say the very least. Thank god I had a significant other at the time to help me through it. It was hard enough to go through even with their support - I struggle to imagine what would have happened if I didn\u2019t have them.\n\nBut yeah, I\u2019m reapplying this cycle! Hopefully it pans out this time around.",

Yes, its impact factor is  higher... but in biomedical research, I believe most people regard it in the same tier as PNAS, JCB, Curr Biol, or EMBO J. Although eLife's IF is dropping, but I think people regard it up there too. Before covid19 (most biomedical journal rised in IF after covid19), Nat Comm has an IF around 12. The rest of journals I listed are around 8-10, and the review process is generally much more pleasant. Like I said, I would probably sacrifice my sanity if it is something like Nat Cell Bio where the IF is like 20+. Heck, Curr Biol/Cell reports are Cell sub journals too and I heard way better publishing experience for those.\n\nedit: typos",

We got microscopy, cellular fractionations, multiple high-throughput assays, radioactive assays, genetics and plenty of biochemistry.\n\nMy mistake was not pushing for a smaller publication with an incomplete story. What I've noticed is that when we attempt to flesh out the story too much, either something is undone or I'm left with paradoxical or non-sensical results that require me to re-update my hypothesis. Now, I'm left with a convuluted thesis project where I simply followed the data. I believed my current project could have been published in 2 small impact factor biological journals (4-9). DON'T HOLD OUT FOR A CELL PAPER UNLESS THE SCIENCE IS NEAR PERFECT or you might end up like me with no publications and a relatively trash story that should have been 2 separate eLife papers.\n\nThe constant grind with no reward on-top of pandemic anxiety has finally broken me as a scientist and now I feel 0 emotional investment in my project.\n\nmoral: fight and take the small wins when you can",

Whether they went to grad school generally is irrelevant to my point. I\u2019m saying most therapists, not psychologists, not psychiatrists, have not done **a PhD**. That\u2019s true. As you very clearly said, when someone gets their PhD, they become a psychologist, not a therapist.\n\nIf you disagree with my statement then you must be saying that 100% of therapists must have their PhDs, because all I said was that most didn\u2019t have experience with one. So is a PhD required to be a counsellor or not? I very explicitly mentioned PhD instead of grad school, so don\u2019t just skip over that.",
