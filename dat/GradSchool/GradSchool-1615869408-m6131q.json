  "title:": "School isn't giving us Spring Break. Mental Health going bad from burnout. So I'm giving myself a Spring Break next week. Always prioritize your well being over academia",
  "text": "Hey guys. Not sure if other schools have done this, but my school changed the schedule this semester to not include a proper Spring Break to discourage travel. Wouldn't be so bad if I had a nice winter break, but unfortunately I had to take an intensive 3 week January class during our break to avoid a costly and time consuming Fall 2021 semester.\n\nAnyway, like many of you here....I'm burned out beyond belief. It's literally been nonstop Academics since mid August for me. It's at the point where I dread to open my laptop everyday to begin school work. Zoom lectures have become unbearable, and i'm frankly at my wits end with online learning.\n\nSo you know what? Fuck this. I'm not going to let academia and its bullshit, unrealistic standards ruin my mental health. I'm giving myself a FULL week off next week. Tomorrow I plan to email my professors with a bullshit story and just live my life for a week without thinking about grad school. No assignments, No Zoom lectures, Nothing. I know professors will get upset and give me a 0's for the weekly assignments that I won't turn in. But I just don't care at this point. All I need is one week to recharge my soul enough to endure 8 more weeks of online hell. If they can't give it to me...oh well. I'm taking a stand and choosing my mental health as top priority.\n\nIf you guys are feeling Zoom Online Education Burnout I encourage you to do the same. Look at it this way...if you don't give yourself time to relax you risk going into Finals too burned out to function. That's a worst case scenario as finals are usually the biggest chunk of your grade. Reclaiming MY time allows me to gather enough willpower to crawl to finish line in May.\n\nGood luck guys. Do your best but always remember to put you're well being before your research!",

My school got rid of all breaks except for two \"wellness Wednesdays\" during the semester, and I worked 13 hours during the first one lol.

If I were a prof, I would get it. Also it would help sent a message that this isn't how the university should deal with the situation. People should not travel for March break this year, but it's really not the university's place to enforce that and take away the break from the students who weren't going to travel. It's up to people making the right choices and governments to implement reasonable restrictions.",
