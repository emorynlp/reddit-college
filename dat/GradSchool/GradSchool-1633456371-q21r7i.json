  "title:": "Need advice about asking for a letter of recommendation",
  "text": "So I am applying for a scholarship in order to get enough funding to take an accelerated language course abroad. I know that I should ask one of my previous, or maybe even current, language instructors.\n\nI was wondering though if it would be unprofessional? Unethical? To ask my current academic advisor for a letter of recommendation. Her area of focus is in the same country that I study and want to learn more about the language (Japan). But I was wondering if anyone knows if it would be ok to ask her for a letter of recommendation, even though she's my current advisor. \n\nThanks for any advice or ideas y'all can give!!",

      "text": "It's not unprofessional or unethical. \n\nBut you need someone who can attest to your qualities as a student. And so they will need to have had you in a class to write a recommendation letter for you. \n\nWhat can your advisor say? That you are good advisee? Why would that matter to the program you're applying to?",
