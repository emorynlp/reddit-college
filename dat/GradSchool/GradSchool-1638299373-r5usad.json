  "text": "I am currently trying to upload my NSERC application (due tomorrow). I selected \u201cexport application and attachments to pdf\u201d the last step before selecting to submit the application. I know things are supposed to be slow due to high traffic this close to the deadline, but the dialog saying it is \u201cin progress\u201d has been up for over an hour now. Is this expected or an issue? I\u2019m afraid to close the dialog box at this time and have to start over if this is expected. I would also like to bs able to do something alas with my day beyond babysitting my computer that wants to sleep from inaction. I emailed technical services but haven\u2019t heard back yet.",

Good luck!",
