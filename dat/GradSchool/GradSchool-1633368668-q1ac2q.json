  "text": "Hey all. I'm a first year PhD stupid in Mechanical Engineering. I also have a BEng and MEng in ME. I decided to pursue a PhD because my masters courses weren't that bad and I thought I enjoyed academic life. Well, I feel as though I made a mistake. \n\nThis entire semester I've been miserable. Originally took 3 courses, dropped down to 2 and I still can't manage them. I feel entirely mentally drained and like I made a huge mistake. It is effecting me physically: I have ulcers from stress and can't eat or sleep. I just don't want to feel this way anymore and quitting seems to be the only way to avoid the feeling. I don't know exactly what advice I was looking for, I just feel so demoralized. \n\nIs there anyone out there who dropped in their first semester? Is it possible to take a break and come back? Should I just leave and not look back?? I need any advice because right now I feel like I'm trapped in hell...",

      "text": "Well here\u2019s some probably unhelpful advice: First year, first semester especially of PhD seems to be really hard for many people. That includes me, I was really miserable for most of year 1. I\u2019m in year 2 and still a little up and down, but definitely doing better. \n\nMy short term recommendation is to take a break as soon as you can. Even if it feels like that\u2019s not something you can do because of workload, I think you really just have to take a couple days off and try to chill a little. You can\u2019t be stressing like that for too long, it is unsustainable. If you can rest a little you will get a clearer mind and you can think about what you want to do. People quit PhDs when it isn\u2019t for them, and that\u2019s fine. That might make sense for you, too. I can\u2019t say without knowing you or your goals. I can say with certainty though that you\u2019ll make a better decision if you can get some of your headspace back.",

      "text": "What are your career goals? My impression is that very few positions outside of pure academia are going to require an engineering PhD. \n\nI wish I would have realized it sooner for myself, but there really is no shame in taking a break, or even quitting. I finished my bio PhD program a year ago, and I honestly had such a rough time that I still regret putting up with the distress and not dropping out. However, my field of study is far less employable than engineering.\n\nIf you can take a break, take a break. You'll start to see things from a different perspective and be able to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life.",
