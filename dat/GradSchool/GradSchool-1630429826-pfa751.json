I have mad respect for people who can have kids and make their programs work but I struggle with being tired constantly and can\u2019t imagine both the exhaustion of dealing with kiddos and trying to do school. I won\u2019t be truly financially stable until I graduate from my program and the sooner I do that, the sooner I can start paying loans and settling down a little more. I think everyone has their own timeline and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with continuing your education after 30 but I think it\u2019s that there are often other life priorities that happen in your 30s and 40s and not everyone has the financial ability or stamina to handle the mix of both.",

I told myself at 25 i would go back for my masters degree but 60k in student loans had other plans.  I was pretty much forced to get experience and work my loans off if I was going to survive student loan debt.\n\nFast forward to last year(age 29) getting accepted to a masters program while working full time.  I now personally think its the best option because you can work towards your personal goals(house, debt free, etc.). While getting an education.  The big downside is you are incredibly busy.\n\nIm still open to getting a phd but i think id rather take another few years off and work, im ok with the fact that I might be around 40 by the time i start",

      "text": "Dunno. I'm definitely an advocate of taking time off after undergraduate. In my case, I did my undergraduate part time because I worked full time. I had a whole ass career. \n\nThe disadvantage of going to grad school in your 30s is the stress of \"retirement/savings\". But the advantage is that I do notice that I'm a lot more \"together\" then most grad students. I approach it like a job. It's also a conscious choice I made. So many students I see going to grad school and leaving after a year or never finishing because they just don't know what they want to do, and they just think it's an extension of undergraduate. Not all, but a significant amount. I also do not value my worth on this particular job. I'm doing it till the money runs out. It'll suck if the money runs out but that's life. \n\nCurrently I'm making bank because I publish tons and generally just complete all my tasks. I'm also very passionate about the work since obviously this was a life changing choice I made. All that to say I've scored some big fellowships, plus I'm already teaching. \n\nSo why delay? To avoid imposter syndrome, to not have FOMO about other career choices, to understand what it means to make your career a significant priority not in theory but in practice, to generally just know yourself (your needs, wants, expectations, limits) better, to have perspective on expectations, etc.. \n\nOnce you drop out of grad school, there's basically no going back, so I feel you should be pretty sure this is what you want. Jobs, however, you can take a few years off, change careers, try out different jobs. Of course, if your expectation is to make 100K out of undergraduate, that's unlikely. But you can still work somewhat in the field and get a sense for problems that need addressing, and whether your prospective career is a good fit for you. If you've got even entry level experience in the field, you're more likely to get accepted, more likely to get a scholarship, etc. \n\nSo this is really just if your only reason to go right out of undergraduate is \"pressure\" -- that's a terrible reason and you shouldn't do it.

Doing education later often means you took a side step for work experience another field which is fine, but not something inherently good everyone needs to do. It's something to only do if that other field brings you something. \n\nAs for why people want it early, being a grad student sucks in a lot of ways. You don't have much money, you're often living with roommates, etc. People want the post education salary as soon as possible so they can enjoy themselves more and afford to have kids, care for aging family, etc.",

Disadvantages: More constraints on my time. I am married, have kid, a house, a car, all of which requiring my time and attention in some capacity. I work 9-5 and a bit after my kid goes to bed.

Just old thinking from a traditionalist mindset that holds very little logic in this day and age. I will say that one of the other comments mentioned children and its a good point. Finishing a doctorate with a 3 year old running around the house has to be a lot harder than doing it with no kids (mad props to you parents doing this).",

Commitments accumulate (the classics are spouse and children, but there are others as well -- community, home, politics, career, etc.), and it becomes harder to dive into school with the same vim that you can muster straight out of college.  You can see this effect even within graduate school -- you get your classes done early, because it's hard to bring yourself to focus on problem sets when you're already probing the secrets of the Universe with your independent research (later in your Ph.D. program).\n\nFinally, on the vim topic:  people in their 20s simply have more energy than people at other (later) stages of life.

                  "text": "My PhD program was in Psychology. I went into consumer research / Market Research. And now I've ended up in User Experience Research, which looks to have a better long-term outlook, in terms of demand/opportunities, than Market Research. And I enjoy it a lot more, to boot.\n\nThe reasons for PhDs being less desirable that I came across, back when I was initially job hunting and debating whether to stay in grad school, were mainly that business people associate PhDs with being too perfectionistic to be able to move quickly and know when a task or project is in a \"good enough\" state to wrap up. As opposed to the dreaded \"analysis paralysis,\" which is an issue wherever time and budget are critical considerations (i.e., pretty much any industry setting). There are also perceptions that PhDs will expect more pay than they're worth since they be starting with little to no applied experience.\n\nIn practice though, whether or not this is true can vary quite a bit depending on the company and the hiring manager. My impression is that big, modern tech companies (FAANG, etc.) have more of an appreciation for PhDs. But for smaller or mid-sized companies, it can vary.\n\nBear in mind that most business folks only have a bachelor's. And an MBA is the highest degree most will have. So anything more than a Master's could be overkill in some settings. Or it could even make people envious or whatever in some settings. (Again, YMMV and the context & culture matters a lot.)\n\nI can think of four friends from my program who finished their PhDs and went into industry jobs afterwards. And they're all in a fairly similar place in their careers now as me. So having the PhD didn't necessarily get them any further.\n\nOnce you get into an industry career, and work your way up within that world, your actual industry experience and skills start to matter more than your academic training in a lot of cases.\n\nI'll admit that motivated cognition played some role in my paying attention to this advice initially. I was at the end of my rope with my program when I started exploring industry careers. I just didn't have it in me to continue - mentally, financially, motivation-wise, even spiritually. I was way, way beyond burnt out. \n\nBut the additional 2-3 years of research experience I put into the program beyond my Master's still helped, in terms of giving me additional experience and skills. So it all worked out alright in the end.",

          "text": "Yeah, if having kids is important to you, it's pretty important to not wait until 35 to start trying. Some people get pregnant right away when they start trying, but for others it can take a year or so (depending on biology etc.), so it's best not to roll the dice and start late. All the people who say \"well I had a kid at age 37\" are the success stories, not a representative sample of how easy it actually is generally.\n\nPeople start worrying at age 30 also because of finances. Childcare costs as much as a month's rent in many places in the U.S., so it's wise to plan your career a few years in advance to make sure you'll be making enough money by the time you need childcare. And around the same time you need to start saving for retirement, kids' college funds, buying a house... It all adds up.",

          "text": "Just to confirm though, if you do want to give birth to your biological children then you probably don't want to push that much beyond 35.\n\nOnce you reach around 35 years old, you're looking at 40% of your eggs having chromosomal abnormalities. In your early 40's, it's around 75%. And there's a significantly heightened risk of complications (for the pregnant person) or disability (for the child) once you're over 40. So that's a lot of miscarriages/stillbirths to go through and I completely understand why people would be hesitant to play that game when they could avoid it. \n\nOf course you can freeze eggs or do IVF or adopt, but all are expensive. Egg freezing is the cheapest but then you need something like IVF to use them.\n\nThese problems are definitely something people should be aware of so they can make the best personal decisions in their family planning. Maybe they'll choose to have children earlier, maybe they'll freeze eggs/do IVF, maybe they'll adopt, or maybe they'll decide to live childfree. But they need all of [that info](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200828-how-fertility-changes-with-age-in-women). I don't want someone to *plan* to have children at 35, completely unaware of the risks, and then suffer because of it.",

      "text": "You are missing an important element here, which is why people are doing grad school. It's not because of social pressure to be fully educated like you seem to think. You don't go into grad school for fun*. Grad school opens up positions and opportunities that would have been off limit or very very very hard to achieve for someone with only a bachelor unless they have years of relevant experience.  \n\nThat's the case if you want to go into an academic career, industrial R&D or any other industrial position that require a grad degree. The ''opportunities'' that you seem to think that are out there for us do not align with our interests. What you see as opportunities are not career opportunities for those who have a career goal that requires grad studies. \n\nSomeone who goes on the job market instead of directly going to grad school isn't in the wrong either. Maybe they do not know yet what they want to specialize in and prefer to discover that through a job they like. Even better, maybe their employer will even end up paying for it to promote them in a specialized position! But for those who already know they want a career in a specialized field that require grad studies, there's not really any point in taking on an unrelated job and delaying gaining valuable work experience for their future career.\n\nFor example, if your goal is to become a lawyer, you don't have much choice but go to law school no? What's the point of spending years of your life doing something you don't like that could be accessible if you get the proper education for it? Being on the job market for something that you are not interested in is not going to further your career since it doesn't align with your career goal. The only true opportunity in this scenario is to make money to afford an above-average living quality during grad school. It's not much more rewarding to do a job you don't like just for money no? And also, those years you spend on the wrong job market are years that you could be spending furthering your career in the specialized field of your choice, which is the one accessible through grad school. \n\nIt's not about the ''rewards of education'' it's about the reward of a career that is not accessible without grad degrees either because it requires research experience or to be specialized in a field.\n\nEdit: Not going to grad school for fun *does not mean* you can't have fun during grad school or enjoy it. This comment was to address the general purpose of pursuing grad school. This edit is for those who think the comment is not valid because they had fun during grad school (it's not for those who are making jokes about our awesome mental health. That's funny keep them coming)",

Fun can be a side motivation for some but I do not believe it's a logical reason to stay in school for 5-7 years.\n\nYou can have fun in gradschool. That's not what the comment said. Grad school is such a commitment that you need a purpose for doing it and just \"for fun\" meaning not for you career in any ways, doesn't make much sense. It was to point out to OP that it's not because of a social pressure that we go to grad school and decide not to delay it, it's because we need it. It was to point out there is a reason that they didn't think through before asking this question.",

I seriously question anyone that says you can\u2019t make as much in industry as a recent postdoc within the time span that getting all of that education requires\u2026 which shows the dismal value society places on the enormous time investment of our scientists and the huge financial trade-offs they make to achieve that. Sure you probably won\u2019t be a researcher without the PhD, but let\u2019s be honest: the people that control the flow of money are the ones making the money. So despite more education, more credentials, more working hours invested, etc\u2026 the managers will almost always make more than the scientists (generally speaking). The sooner you realize this, the better you will be able to weigh the pros and cons of grad school.\n\nNow this does not take into account the possibility of managers themselves being sourced from the PhD population. I don\u2019t personally think this is likely though as financial know-how doesn\u2019t overlap too well with basic science/ wet lab knowledge. I could be wrong. A decent counterpoint to this thesis might be that nearly all leaders of biotech have either a PhD or MD.\n\nMy point is that if you care about making money, you may just want to go into industry, get them to pay for a masters, and then go into management in the field of your actual interest. Otherwise you might end up quite resentful after spending so much time pursuing the highest degree available and sacrificing so much for it, only for the rewards to be lacking when compared to the alternatives and the lifestyles those people had and continue to maintain during all that time.\n\nBarring society valuing PhDs higher, I\u2019m not particularly bullish on the US science job market (in terms of pay) over the next 10 years or so.",

              "text": ">One thing I will say is that it\u2019s not entirely apparent to me that you can\u2019t get to the same position as a recent PhD graduate \n\nSome positions require specialized knowledge that you will not be taught about during your undergrad and are not likely to learn about while you are working on something else. Other positions require research experience for R&D. These things can't be acquired without grad school. Many industries have research centres established on universities campuses where they do research projects in collaboration with the school and recruit the PhD students from there. \n\n> the two gap years in a research assistant / lab tech role (that many life sciences programs more or less seem to require these days), the 6ish year PhD, and the 3 year postdoc (that many employers in life sciences now unofficially require irrespective of academic or industry track)\n\nI am not in social sciences (if that's what you mean by life science - correct me if not English is my second language), but in STEM, having a postdoc can actually negatively impact your chances of working in the industry because they often consider you are too academic-focused and might not adapt well. Also, in many fields, you absolutely do not need to have any research/assistant or lab tech role related to academia as you would be seen again too ''academic-oriented''.  Having a PhD if you have no intention of using it in the industry can also affect you negatively as well as many will deem you overqualified. I am not sure which field you are in that would have so many academic requirements for a non-academic job, but I can assure you it's not a generalized experience. \n\n>Taking the latter track, we are talking about over a decade of work experience where starting salaries are around $60K/yr. \n\nMany positions will accept either a bachelor, master or PhD. However, you are forgetting that they will adjust the years of work experience that you need to apply. The entry-level positions that require a PhD are not entry-level positions for those who have a bachelor or master.  For example, here is what I have seen: ''A bachelor degree with 6 years of experience, master degree with 3 years of experience or a PhD with 0-1 year of experience''.   So while it is possible for someone with a bachelor to get a position that is also offered to people with a PhD, they would often need years of work experience to compensate, which are equal to if not greater than the years you would be spending in school. Unfortunately, unless you are an exceptional candidate and were able to accumulate formally the specialized knowledge somehow, the PhD applicants will be the stronger applicants and the job will likely be going to them or to people with a master. Having work experience to qualify for a PhD position is one thing. Having the necessary specialized knowledge, relevant experience, research experience and other requirements to hold a position is a whole other thing. \n\nWhen doing a PhD, you also need to see beyond the level-entry salary.  There are different reasons to do a PhD and money shouldn't be one since, in the first years, the difference can be close to none in some fields. You have to consider that there might be a soft progression cap at some point in your career that will prevent you from making a higher salary or progressing in your role without a graduate degree. So the starting salary is not necessarily a good indicator of career success or opportunities. I must say that the number indicated is pretty low for my field, usually, that's the starting salary without a PhD, so this might just apply to your field.\n\nOverall, I think your comment is very specific to your field. So your first statement (1 quote of my comment) might be true, but applied to your field only. Generalizing it wouldn't be adequate. That's what OP did, they generalized their situation (changing career to do law school) to everyone in grad school. Yes, exceptions exist, but let's not make a rule out of our own experience. \n\nI was in a situation where I wanted to access a certain position and my employer literally sent me away overseas to do a PhD so I can come back and get it. I skipped the master and went directly to the PhD outside of the US (so no master requirements), so in my case, it will take me 3 years of additional school to achieve the positions that I want. I could take my example to contradict your time frame of 6+ years, but I know many here are from the US so it would be useless to do that.  I have also never mentioned the possibility of doing a sponsored PhD after being in the industry for 1-2 years (Just to show you that I also respect my rule of not making an exception out of my own experience).",

              "text": "I'm going to chime in here - I went right from undergrad to a full time job, started working on my MS part time that they paid for while working full time, all the while saving and investing money. I then got promoted after I got the MS. I was curious as to what my financial situation would look like if I instead went into a PhD program full time right after undergrad. When I got out, I'd probably be making a bit more than I am now with an MS, but probably not enough more to offset the 4-6 year opportunity cost of that degree. Especially when you consider the compound growth of my investments in the early years of my career, it doesn't seem likely to me that the increased earnings of holding a PhD would ever offset the head start I got with working + MS. However this did require me to both be in the advantageous position of having enough money left over to invest and actually doing it.\n\nObviously doing a PhD is about more than just money, but some people,  especially those outside of academia, seem to think it's a ticket to riches and that's simply not the case.\n\nI do want to say one thing though - the \"just get a job and get someone to pay for your masters\" is getting less realistic each year. I'm seeing a lot of companies reducing or even axing the benefit altogether. Not to mention that getting one of these positions is challenging in the first place, especially if you're considering a grad degree because you can't get hired.",

I\u2019ll concede that the two options (PhD vs straight to industry after college and then do a masters) will result in vastly different career tracks. The former will likely result in a Senior Scientist position, while the latter will likely result in getting pushed into management.\n\nPoint being, I\u2019m doing a cost/benefit analysis looking very specifically at the finances of it all. I\u2019m presently in a research assistant role juggling 3 separate research projects, making $40K/yr with few benefits, and working a 60hr/wk. Even without hypothetical overtime pay, just looking at weekly pay divided by weekly hours, I\u2019m making under my state\u2019s minimum wage. Target cashiers make more than me on an adjusted hourly basis. \n\nNotably, lab tech jobs in industry start at around $60K/yr for new college grads - somehow inexplicably above what even postdocs are paid in academia. But here the thing: no one recently graduated and seeking a PhD in the near term can really take these roles for gap year jobs (academia is the best predictor of success in academia, and industry often has NDAs which greatly complicate grad school applications). This reality is utterly infuriating to me.\n\nConservatively I\u2019ll estimate: 2 years as a research assistant @ 40k + 6 years of PhD @ 40K (being generous here) + 4 years of postdoc @ 50K = $520K in 12 years.\n\nNow let\u2019s assume you instead go straight into industry and never get promoted. You\u2019ll make $200K more over the same period - and that\u2019s without any promotions or pay raises!! It\u2019s also disregarding potential gains due to investment of that difference.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s unclear to me that the PhD will be able to catch up financially to the person that just went straight to industry. Functionally what this means is that America significantly undervalues the time investment of PhDs\u2026 Or does anyone here want to argue that those who have sacrificed a decade of their life to getting the highest degree and becoming an expert deserve to be paid less than those with less education and expertise?\n\nSure a PhD will likely confer higher employment guarantees, but along a financial basis I\u2019m really struggling to justify why I should pursue that route. PhDs might have a higher ceiling salary, but on average over the long haul I\u2019d argue most will be lucky to meet parity with their non-PhD industry counterparts.",

However, the question you asked wouldn't apply to you since it's reasonable to expect someone to work in a different field before deciding to change fields. You are looking at pursuing a professional degree, which in countries outside the US is an undergrad degree. It's a different situation that is hard to compare with non-professional degrees.\n\nThose who are pursuing grad school (non-professional) after their bachelor want to achieve a single career goal within the same field or similar field, which is only available through grad studies. They do not have a different career goal prior to grad studies vs after grad studies. Someone can have a career goal and decide later in their career they are not entirely satisfied and want to move to another area that requires a grad degree. But if you already know what you want and that it requires a grad degree and that it's only in a single field, then you can't really come up with a different career goal within the same field that would feel as rewarding. What would be the point of staying besides money? In your case, you have 2 fields where you can have 2 career goals, so no need to rush achieving your second one by 30, I agree.\n\nFor example, I am an engineer and need a PhD if I want to be considered for the industrial R&D position that I want. I would still be working in engineering with my PhD, but I would not be progressing in a mechanical engineering role. I would be progressing in a research role that has different opportunities and is a different career path within engineering. So my career goal in the engineering field requires a grad degree. Otherwise, I am gaining work experience that wouldn't be so relevant to my future area of work within engineering. And unlike you, I can't spend time working towards a career goal within engineering that wouldn't require a grad degree since that would be wasting my time career-wise unless it's just for the money.\n\nWhere I am from, law school is an undergrad degree. Pretty much only in the US it's a grad degree. So from my point of view, to do what you are looking at doing you would need to have done 2 separate undergrad degrees instead of a grad degree + undergrad. That's an unusual situation that doesn't apply to most. So from a perspective outside the US, your situation is not really comparable to others who are going for non-professional master and PhD. Motivations are different, the career path is different and education background is different too. Your question is well-targeted towards professional degrees in the US tho.",

While I took a bit of a break after high school on novels because I'd just finished two, I kept writing and my edits/redrafts were far stronger for the novel I decided to pursue farther. If you find more technical and analytical writing to worsen your creative writing, your creative writing is also likely weak. These other skills should make you stronger.\n\nThe novel-writing process is not easy nor fast. It is not about some creative muse, but pure persistence. You will go through several edits AFTER you finish your novel before you have something to send in. You must understand plot and many other mechanics. Then you'll still have edits from your publisher.

To me, your comment shows you are a bit out of touch with the reality of the majority and are in an exceptional situation. I mean who has 2 different career goals?

You would have a significantly higher salary way sooner. The time you are currently spending away from grad school is less money in your pockets, which was the argument you used to justify not going to grad school. Personally, you would be able to establish yourself way sooner and would be able to start a family if you want to in better financial conditions and with better chances of having a baby (over 30 becomes harder apparently)",

And simply having work experience, so long as it's good experience, will always matter because you can build on it, unless you're focused on obtaining some extremely particular kind of work and you take nothing from different work environments and cultures.\n\nI'm not using \"my life\" as a specific example or question. The post could be true for why many different people want to wait and is questioning the general pressure some have experienced or acknowledge to get life done a certain way... How ridiculous to say ones own question doesn't apply to themselves",

Regardless of your \"explanation\" it doesn't make sense, because people are making connections between my personal situation which is separate from the content of the post, which is talking about societal pressure around life achievement timelines. It made no sense that people down voted my private life plan, and your explanation likewise doesn't make sense even if you're attempting to explain their behaviour, because you sound as though you're defending their rationale for doing so, when there is no sound rationale.\n\nThem down voting me is akin to everyone down voting all the comments that prioritized pacing out achievements and going to school later. Plenty of people were not down voted for their life plans, yet mine was, because people nonsensically expected my personal life plan to have a level of alignment with the topic of the post when that synchronicity was never there necessarily, they just assumed it should be, which is why I don't agree with you.\n\nAnd, where alignment does happen to exist between the two totally separate issues of the question posed and my personal plans, the post clearly talks about leaving time to develop talents, and making/saving money as part of why a person would wait, which is a big part of why I'm waiting. It makes no sense why people would downvote someone who's asking about societal pressure that ignores the importance of things like making/saving money/developing talents in the literal question/issue raised, just because they share these are their own personal reasons to wait. It makes sense to expect people who elect to wait to have reasons for it. However, having these reasons does not negate the social pressure I'm asking about.\n\nIt appears that people are insulting my personal reasons for waiting, which is unjust. If instead, they are rejecting my question about societal life timeline pressures JUST BECAUSE I have my own reasons for waiting (which seems to be your argument), they are denying the reality of the social pressure I feel despite having my reasons, which is also unfair.\n\nHopefully this clears up why I don't accept your explanation nor the down voting as reasonable.",

Most of them accelerate when they are on elementry or middle high, with only 3.5 years for elementry, total 4 years to junior high and senior high, so at the age of 14-15 they could take bachelor for 3.5 years and jump directly to take PhD at US uni at age f 18/19, well they will graduate at 24/late I seen 26 or 27, and their supervisor are supportive, and most of the prof encourage them to publish a lot of journal and work close with industries. Some of them that are very brilliant can finish PhD (join with MIT and Standford as I know, UI, ITB, ITS), for about 4-4.5 years.\n\nBut tbh to see this become mainstream is insanity tbh... It's abnormal :/ Look you see, I'm 25 years old, struggling going out master and probably finding PhD and try to catch up with them. at age of 30-32 I will finish PhD (if all on track), and at that time they if very productive at age of 30 or lat 35 will already been Fully prof at their respected Uni (and In Indonesia, it's hard to get Prof, because it's granted by the Gov not by the Uni, and it takes 1-2 years to promote, check, and see their impact of research, IP, Patent, by MoE and help of international Community), like... is there even any chance for normal people like me?
