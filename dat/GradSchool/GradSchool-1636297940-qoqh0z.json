  "text": "I graduated from a good university around 3 years ago with a degree in International Affairs. I simply could not find a job in my field after I graduated, which seriously deflated me and caused me to work a dead-end retail job in the meantime. I\u2019ve always had post-grad goals, but I simply do not know what I should do anymore. Since it\u2019s been so long since undergrad, should I just focus on finding a better job? My life just seems closed to me and all the stress is causing me to not do anything, which is the only wrong decision.",

      "text": "Do you want to go to grad school because the jobs you want require it or do you want to go to grad school because it doesn't seem as real as working? Grad school should be a means to an end not the end itself.\n\nSounds like maybe you need to figure out what you like to do. At the end of the day your degree doesn't matter, a crazy amount of people work outside their degree. I know someone who got a master's degree in healthcare administration, and they now work as an executive coffee bean roaster for a major company.\n\nI would suggest exploring what kind of careers people with international affair degrees usually have, as well as what major positions are open. See if those kinds of positions are ones that you like. And if not I would suggest looking around and trying to identify what skills you're good at, and what you like to do and see what kind of job fits that. \n\nMaybe you like the challenge of many different stakeholders and negotiation that can come from IA? In that case maybe paralegal or working for a court system. If you like having to be an expert on a super niche area, you could become a technical writer or provide expertise to newspapers on fact checking.",

          "text": "I guess I want to go to grad school because I feel like it is a means to an end. At least that\u2019s the fantasy I have in my mind. I always thought I would get an MBA and work for a large corporation, but the more research I do, the more I feel overwhelmed and lose touch with my goal. Finding MBA students/graduates would be ideal, but I just haven\u2019t found anyone or know of any resource I can use. \n\nI\u2019ve gone to my university career center, but they are always focused on my online presence: making a good LinkedIn page, looking presentable, etc. but I want some deeper advice than how to look good online. A mentor is more what I need. \n\nAnother issue is that I\u2019ve always gone down the path other\u2019s laid out for me, which stunted me finding my own voice, but through working (no matter how mind numbing my job is), I\u2019ve found more of my voice. Working has definitely matured me, but it circles me back to the realization that I can\u2019t keep working this job my entire life and living at home. I need something better. \n\nThank you for your advice. I will talk to more people and reach out for mentorship.",

I have been to one and their advice was extremely helpful. They gave me tips on jobs in and oustide of academia, and found jobs that suited me that I would have never found by myself. I would highly recommend it! Example [here](https://www.uh.edu/ucs/).",

I switch to a job in retail, where I am currently working. \n\nMy career counselor in undergrad was absolute garbage; he had me doing some \"find your passion\" exercises that were more for junior high. \n\nOverall, I don't want to act like I did everything right.

My degree doesn't have anything remotely close to do with the goals of the state department, so your experience in international relations seems much more relevant.
