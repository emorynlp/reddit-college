I\u2019ve also spent a week and a half breaking my back to finish something they told me to do last time and found out today they \u201ccould have done that [themselves]\u201d. \n\nFeeling worthless AF right now.",

A mentor with a real backbone would help you fix any difficulties that you're having, not put you down for them in such a shitty way. I also was told shit like that from an old PI, and it hurts a lot, but you can and WILL get through it dude! ",

They were always the first in the building and the last to leave, even working all weekend long. Lots of nice data. But it was never enough. I think they\u2019d have finished months ago if it was anyone else. ",

I would walk out one week feeling like I was amazing and then the next week I felt like I might never produce anything worthwhile. It sounds like this person may be similar. I am always wary when I know someone who treats people badly. Eventually they will give you the same treatment.\n\nI don't know how helpful it it but try not to buy into their attitude. Try instead to find validation elsewhere and carry on as you are. You have got this far because you are good at what you do.\n\nI am lucky I switched supervisors and I am slowly building my confidence back up after it was knocked so often. My new supervisor is very practical and supportive but I understand how hard it can be in your position. All I can say is keep going and to try and find support elsewhere so you aren't reliant on someone like this who sounds unpredictable.",
