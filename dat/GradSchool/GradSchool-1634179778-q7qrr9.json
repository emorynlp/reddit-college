  "text": "Hey, I'm wondering if anybody has any experience from switching from a masters/research based degree to a diploma/course-based degree? \n\n* Do you have any regrets? \n\n* What questions did you ask yourself before switching? \n\n* How did you discuss it with your supervisors?\n\nFor context I am not enjoying my program at all now that I'm in the research phase, and I don't want to continue. There's an option in my department for a course-based diploma, but I'm wondering if I should just push through the difficulties I'm having. I don't see much career value in a masters vs a diploma for my field, at least in the careers I'm interested in (Meteorology).",
