  "text": "We live in southern NH, I\u2019m applying to schools generally in Boston, NYC, NJ, and a few scattered around the country. We\u2019ve been together for over 4 years (will be 5 by the time I enter grad school). He has a career here, but he can work remotely. The cost of moving, leaving his friends, losing our awesome apartment, and the fact we\u2019ve moved 3 times in 3 years are the reasons he doesn\u2019t want to go with me. But I already know for sure I want to go to grad school to get a Ph.D, which can take half a decade so we can\u2019t really do long distance the whole time. Has anyone had a similar situation?",

For example, if you move to another place in New England, can he come visit you and work remotely for a week here and there? Also if you\u2019re not in a lab science, some PhDs can be done without being in residence the whole time. It\u2019s not uncommon in the social sciences for a grad student to be semi-remote post second year. Also if you decide to do long distance for now, you can always revisit this discussion of whether to move in together or break up.",

Any solution requires a large sacrifice on one or both of your parts. And it sucks. \n\nI'd actually recommend having this conversation with a mediator (like a couples counselor) -- not because of anything wrong with your relationship, but because this will inevitably be an emotionally loaded conversation. For you, it's about your long-term goals and aspirations. For him, it's about uprooting his life, and losing the stability of his home and outside support that he has here. For both of you, it's about the love you have together and not losing each other. Having someone mediate the conversation can keep you both focused on finding the best solution for the both of you, as opposed to getting defensive about each of your own needs (which is so easy to fall into in these situations).",

Both things could backfire badly down the line if you actually love each other and plan on staying together. \nI can see his point, but if a relationship is going to work, you need to sort out what's most important - your partner, or the other things you have in your life.\nI've been married for 15 years, together for over 20, and my husband and I have both gained and lost things due to choices we have had to make for the other person's happiness. It doesn't bother me, at the end of the day, as our relationship will always be the main priority. If one of us is unhappy, the other is unhappy.",

The resentment can flow in both directions here, but you\u2019re positioning it as if OP is the only one being asked to sacrifice. That\u2019s a completely unfair portrayal of the situation.\n\nI met my husband while I was in grad school and I still recognize how much he sacrificed to support me emotionally and in giving up any choice over where we would live in the future. OP\u2019s husband might not be willing to make that much of a sacrifice, and that\u2019s ok too. \n\nCompromise is possible without trying to guilt only one party into making a sacrifice.",

There\u2019s only a limited number of schools there, and I\u2019m terrified that the only one I get into will be on the other side of the country. But that\u2019s academia.\n\nFwiw, I\u2019ve known multiple professor couples that have lived long distance on a timescale of years, and managed to thrive through that. My math team coaches in middle school were a grad-student married couple that got separated by the academic job market and lived that way for a few years before they finally managed to get jobs in the same department. It was hard for them, but they made it through and even have a toddler daughter now. So it can definitely be done, even if it\u2019s not for everyone.\n\nHave you talked with him about what a long-distance relationship might look like for you? E.g., is distance a factor at all? It looks like Boston at least is within an hour\u2019s drive of some parts of southern NH. Is there anyone in or out of academia that you could talk to who\u2019s been in one?\n\nGood luck!!",

      "text": ">The cost of moving, leaving his friends, losing our awesome apartment, and the fact we\u2019ve moved 3 times in 3 years are the reasons he doesn\u2019t want to go with me\r\n\nNot great reasons not to move, imho. You can always find new friends or another apartment. And yes, you've moved 3 times, but do you really want your excuse to not move near your SO's graduate school because \"I moved 3 times in 3 years\"? (Granted, I am assuming he is able-bodied).\r  \n\r  \nLegitimate reasons (again, imho): ailing parents, career/school that you must attend in person, you have a house, your children's schooling will be disrupted, ie things that require long-term commitment or are irreplaceable.\r  \n\r  \nIt seems to me that you guys are in the perfect situation to move. I think regardless of what he decides, you should go to your dream graduate school--partners are replaceable, time is not.",

We recently had a similar discussion about visiting a family member out of state. $300ish round trip feels like a lot to us, but we could get to her once a month for less than $4k over the year. Fitting that into the budget as a chunk cost seemed more doable than finding money every month (even though, yes, it was the same amount technically).",
