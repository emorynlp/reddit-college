  "text": "I love working at my office but I hate walking around my campus. My department is far removed from the main campus where I have a class MWF and I have to either walk 30-40 min to get there from my office or take the bus which is like 15-20 min. I have another class which takes about 15 min to walk to because it's down a steep hill and my office is up that steep hill. \n\nI feel bad because my office mate goes to our office everyday and I like chatting with them and I can tell they like having someone around but man after being at home for ~2 years, I can't seem to muster up the energy to wake up early, drive to school, find parking, go to my classes, come back, and then drive home. \n\nIt's not even the classes but the transportation that I dread. It takes a good 1-3 hours depending on the day just to travel to school and classes and it makes me so exhausted. \n\nI have the luxury of staying home because I can still get my research work done and my classes are in person and on zoom for the term, but they won't be next term. \n\nAny tips on how to slowly get back into the swing of in person things and force myself to get to school and my classes?",
