  "text": "Hi everyone! I was successful in getting into a master\u2019s program (counselling psychology) and wanted to share some tips for writing your grad school applications, specifically the mistakes you want to avoid in your applications.\n\nOne mistake that you want to avoid is not knowing much about the programs that you\u2019re applying to and the professors that you want to work with. This will often lead you to be vague and make general statements in your personal statement, which will not allow the admissions committee to get to know you as a unique candidate or understand your motivation and research interests. Before writing your application essays, research the programs and think about your personal motivations for grad school.\n\nThere also a lot of information that you can include in a personal statement or that a reference can say about you that will make the admissions committee think twice about you as an applicant. For example, you do not want to be negative in terms of describing previous supervisors you\u2019ve had or schools that you went to, regardless of whether you had a negative experience or not. You also do not want to disclose that you are currently struggling with major issues in your life because it will make you seem like you are not aware of professional boundaries or that this may not be the right time to start grad school as it can involve a lot of extra stress. You can definitely discuss major life events or obstacles you overcame, but you want to make sure that connects to the story that you\u2019re trying to tell in the personal statement.\n\nIn terms of the letters of reference, you won\u2019t be able to control what the referees say about you (although you can request referees mention specific characteristics or achievements about you) but you will get to choose who writes the letters. Choose wisely! Choose people who know you very well in a professional or academic capacity. You want at least one reference you have worked with on a research project.\n\nLastly, get started on your applications early! If you\u2019re reading this and thinking of applying to grad school this fall, this is your encouragement to start now. Good luck and you got this!\n\nFeel free to share any other advice that you think I missed or any mistakes you made when applying to graduate school!\n\nI've also created a short video about mistakes that students make when applying and how to fix them. Hope it can be helpful to people going through the application process! [https://youtu.be/pUfcjy5PSv8](https://youtu.be/pUfcjy5PSv8)",
