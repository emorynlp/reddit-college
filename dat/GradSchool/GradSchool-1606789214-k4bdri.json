It was mostly due to unfinished work due to my own scheduling incompetency (procrastination is a bitch), but damn, my advisor left me feeling so horrible I had to take some pills and just lie down the entire day. I've literally never done this before.  \n\nStill, now I have to make some huuuuge progress on my thesis by the 14th, which is doable, but just thinking about the long hours ahead of me makes me feel extra tired already.\n\nOn the upside, I was invited to be a reviewer for a journal paper. So at least not everything is a shadowy hellscape.",
