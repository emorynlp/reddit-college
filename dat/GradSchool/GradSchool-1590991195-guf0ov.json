  "title:": "I want to acknowledge how hard it is for many of us to be far from our hometowns right now.",
  "text": "Moving for grad school often comes with the territory. In the particularly tumultuous time that this has continued to be, I wanted to remind my fellow users here that you're not alone in these feelings. Many of us have moved hundreds if not thousands of miles for programs and jobs that are grueling at the best of times. This isn't the best of times.\n\nMany of us are away from support systems and from the places we grew up. We don't know when we'll be able to travel back there. It can be difficult to sit at home and even more so to go out into the protests. There's guilt in needing to work and continue our projects when so much is falling apart.\n\nTo get a bit personal, I'm incredibly lucky that my family moved with me for my PhD but they are also disabled and I cannot risk going out because one of them is immunocompromised. My best friend is in one of the viral videos taking the brunt of police violence and it's awful to not have been there in person to support her. I usually don't want to be where I moved for my PhD and this has been amplified under both COVID and the political unrest.\n\nI hope this post and this sub can be a place where we get each other. I think we all realize that there are pressing issues going on like the pandemic, police violence, and the general uncertainty. But I want to recognize that these somewhat unique stressors at the intersection of graduate school, isolation, unpredictability, and loneliness can be especially hard. It's okay to struggle. It's okay to feel lost or worried or need to take breaks. I want to encourage you to find support in people around you. I can't promise we're all going to get through this or everything will work out but maybe we can be here in this virtual space for each other.\n\nEdit: I also want to share my explicit support for graduate students of color, especially black graduate students, who often navigate difficult spaces in academia in the first place.",

We're planning to drive back to Montreal this weekend, but I'm feeling an overwhelming feeling that I'll be abandoning my family during covid and my friends/peers who are standing up against social injustice. Feeling very confused, concerned and scared. Not to mention, my graduate project is at a standstill. I'm glad that I can share these feelings with others, though, and know that I'm not the only one.\n\nMuch love everyone. Stay safe out there.",

I could fly home, but I don't feel comfortable flying across the country right now. I've been so overwhelmingly sad the past few days.",

      "text": "I believe this aspect is a major reason why we dont have more equitable representation of domestic minorities in STEM. I moved just a few states away from my family to pursue a phd program. It is an excellent program, and I am glad I made the choice. However it has resulted in some serious sacrifices.\n\n* I live alone. No partner, no family. nada. COVID has amplified this feelings of isolation. While zoom and facetime can help alleviate temporary loneliness, it is not a substitution.\n\n* My grandparents passed away while I was at grad school. I was lucky to have an amazing relationship with them. I know they would have been/were proud of me for doing well in grad school. But by pursuing phd studies I feel like I unknowingly abandoned my family.  For those of you who didn't grow up with strong family ties it might be difficult to empathize completely, but in my culture family is #1 full stop. My grandfather understood, but I could hear the disappointment in his voice when I said the next time I could visit would be thanksgiving or xmas. If I knew what it would cost me, I would've chosen a field of study that would have allowed me to be closer to home.\n\n* My program has a very self-centered culture. I would never classify any grad student that I've met as cold or distant. Everyone has been friendly. But also, really no one is incredibly warm and inviting. If shit hits the fan I can count on my peers to help, but otherwise it's sorta a live and let live mentality. Maybe this is the result of me being older, where my peers now turn their time investments towards their own relationships and futures. Maybe its a result of gradschool being a concentrator of introverts. Idk. I don't hold any malice towards my peers, mentors, or friends I've made here. I'm just the only one I know who enjoys throwing carne asadas. Things are different in the time of covid, but it would be nice to have a support network for the little things.\n\nJust some perspectives on graduate studies and isolation",

Our friends and family live in cities affected by COVID as well as civil unrest caused by both the pandemic and police violence. We don't know when we'll be able to see them again. Lately, it is hard to focus -- not because I don't enjoy my work or appreciate this opportunity, but because there is an additional layer of doubt: Is it worth the years away from many of the people I love most: my parents and siblings, my closest friends? \n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer even in normal times: missing big milestones like weddings or baby showers, casual birthday events or everyday family things like weekend dinners. I'd developed a habit of accepting the cost and resorting to small, intentional gestures (cards, emails, texts, phone calls). But lately, it's a heavy thought that has become difficult to defer, and the little things you can do remotely seem like... not even close to enough.",
