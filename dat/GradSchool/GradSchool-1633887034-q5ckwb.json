  "text": "What's up everybody, it's d\u01f0 pi\u0161pi\u0161 (a disc jockey cat spinning records). It's my first semester in an anthropology PhD programme, and one of my first courses is a classical theory class. We read at least 200 pages a week the likes of Marx, Durkheim, Mauss. Later Levi Strauss and Boas just to name a few more blokes. Long story short, it's a really frustrating class, and the discussions are really kicking my ***.\n\nIt was only last week, week 5 of 13 for the semester, I had this epiphany of what was meant by close reading these texts. Part of it, yes, is about understanding the logical trajectory of a thinker's argument, but it seems to also involve how authors deploy their arguments and where they fit in conversations that were had at the time. I can at least confidently say I have trouble with the latter.\n\nDo you have any tips or advice on how I can read essays of these classical thinkers differently? Any ideas on how I can produce thoughtful discussion questions based on my reading of the texts?",

      "text": "Yes, placing the work is its historical context would be part of \"close reading.\" Obtaining introductory- or intermediate-level textbooks on modern European intellectual history or some philosophy textbook that could provide the same big picture. Probably also be a good idea to acquire a general modern European survey text so you can be better aware of the social and political developments that can provide a broad overview to issues/questions of the time.",
