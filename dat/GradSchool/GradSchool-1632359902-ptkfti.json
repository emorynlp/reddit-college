  "text": "I\u2019m a current phd student in a fantastic program for my area of study. This program offers both masters and doctorates, and I am pursuing my doctorate as I did my masters at a previous program. My cohort is mixed of masters/doctorate students, but I feel like they treat me differently than my peers did in my previous program. I loved talking about our research with them, but here it just feels like everyone is trying to one-up each other all the time. For example, I asked a peer what they thought of a certain analysis in a paper we read for class and they immediately began summarizing the paper instead of discussing the question I asked. Or I asked someone about a specific area of study and they listed off other areas of study I should research because they\u2019ve researched it and \u201cit seems important\u201d (it wasn\u2019t relevant to my area of research - I wrote my masters thesis on it).  Am I in the wrong program? Am I just crazy behind where I should be? Or are my peers just going through a bad case of impostor syndrome and I\u2019m a victim of it? I I love this area and the program was supposed to be very collaborative but it feels just competitive.",

I don't think they're doing it to you because they look down on you, I think they're trying to trick you into thinking they're smarter and more experienced than they are. If they looked down on you, they probably wouldn't bother, so I don't think it's anything personal. \n\nFrankly I see this in every batch of first year students since I entered grad school. Not everyone does it, but most people that do get over it as they go.",

But you're right. I think I would just like to feel like I am able to talk and connect with the people in my cohort, but that hasn't been the case so far. I was hoping there was something I could do to make it better but it sounds like just something they'll have to work through and I'll have to not take personally.",

              "text": "Alternatively, they may not even see why your question is a question. In the case of the individual who started summarizing the reading in response to your question, you may need to lead them through your logic. So you let them summarize, clear up any disagreements of understanding, then you point out how \"Well if this is the case, under this analysis, it would seem like X would be the result. Do you agree?\"\n\n\nNot everyone reads the readings, and very few actually do a critical analysis of the readings, which would allow them to discuss a nuanced question. Especially if the question relies on your analysis of the reading, you need to ensure you both are on the same page or you're going to have 30min of frustration.\n\nTwo final things, you need to make sure that you look stupid every now and then, and extreme tact needs to be taken when you ask others to demonstrate their education/intelligence. Being unafraid of being wrong will let others know that you are fallible and aren't also going to be a part of the \"one-upmanship\" that you see going on. Similarly, if people aren't in your field of study, how can you expect them to know what you've researched and how superficial their knowledge is? Nine out of ten times what you will receive is how ideas and research in their field is related to, *what they understand,* your research to be. Why else would you come to them? You're the expert on your stuff; they're the expert on their stuff.",

Another possibility is this is an example of people's brains working differently. I often run into this problem, where I have a very specific question, but people answer a broader question instead of the one I asked because they haven't been thinking about the topic as much as I have and can't quickly enter the headspace of something so specific without going over the whole thing first to refresh their minds on the topic (does that make sense?). So I recommend not taking it personally! I have a very strong feeling it's not about you, and more about them. But of course, if they make you feel bad or uncomfortable, then definitely seek outside friends and peers like others have suggested.",
