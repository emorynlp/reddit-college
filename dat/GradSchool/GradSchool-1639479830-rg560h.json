  "title:": "Just submitted a giant pile of panther shit that was my final project",
  "text": "It\u2019s riddled with errors, calculations that won\u2019t work, metrics that make no sense, etc etc. What a dump. I devoted over 24 hours to that heap and I know I\u2019ll be lucky to get a 50 on it. \n\nI swear nothing feels worse than submitting something you know sucks because the material is unbelievably hard and everything that can go wrong does. My only saving grace is that I\u2019ll at probably at least just barely pass the course so I can just move the fuck on. \n\nIf anyone else is struggling with end of semester stuff to do, I\u2019m here for you",
