  "text": "I often feel like grad students (and students in general) are not being given proper credit & resources for our seemingly collective exhaustion right now. It\u2019s been a lot to transition from finishing my undergrad completely online from my bedroom to beginning a masters program entirely in person, at a new school, in a new place. I am so thankful to be able to have at least somewhat of a \u201cnormal\u201d school year, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I am completely exhausted and that my mental health is tanking as a result. It also doesn\u2019t help that my particular university tends to hoard money and doesn\u2019t give proper funding/stipends to my school (despite their *massive* endowment), leaving me having to work outside of my degree program as much as possible (12+ hrs/week) in order to remain enrolled.",

      "text": "Everything you say is true. I know exactly what you mean. It's extra frustrating when you get these pithy little emails from your program/school about \"mental health week!\" where the only assistance they provide is \"make sure you pet some puppies!\" or other useless nonsense like that. It feels like a fuck you to the people who are struggling.",

The first tried to sell me on some Daoist nonsense; the next told me about the healing powers of a certain crystal; the third assured me that my problems were because I was scared of death. \n\nI gave up after that.",
