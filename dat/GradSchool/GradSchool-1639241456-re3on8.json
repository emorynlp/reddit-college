  "title:": "If I hold a MEng degree should i apply for a PhD or a MS+PhD track? (for CS)",
  "text": "The end goal is PhD, but one particular program is forcing me to choose between MS+PhD and PhD saying that I should pick the first if I don't already have a Masters. The issue is that the MEng is shorter and course based, while a MS is longer and thesis based, so I can't tell if I'm supposed to bypass the MS part of the PhD.",

      "text": "From my experience PhD programs generally don\u2019t accept course based masters if they have a masters prerequisite. In that case you\u2019d want the second.\n\nBut I do know some people who did a course based masters and found a PhD supervisor who pulled some strings to get them into a PhD program without having done a thesis based masters.\n\nIf you have an advisor lined up they probably know the university better and would be able to give you specific advice. Otherwise I\u2019d listen to what the graduate coordinator of the department tells you to do.",
