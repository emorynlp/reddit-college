      "text": "I have two external monitors and mouse that I use alongside my laptop. I use the laptop keyboard, so it's placed flat on the desk and I raise my chair + a hefty cushion high enough to achieve the right height for typing. The two monitors are on risers on the desk so that their bottom edge lines up with the top edge of my laptop screen; this places them at roughly eye-level. The actual laptop screen mostly is only used for video calls or quick actions (e.g., editing a screenshot for my notes).",
