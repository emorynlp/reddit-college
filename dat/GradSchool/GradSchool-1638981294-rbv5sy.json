  "text": "Woke to an email that cheered me up a little bit. I asked my long-term (non-tenure track) mentor and friend from undergrad for a LOR. His response \"I am always happy to provide a recommendation letter for you. Send me your updated information and let me know the deadline. I will take care of it for you.\" I've been entirely stressed with thesis analysis and fellowship apps, having this support from someone who wants me to succeed means a lot. Especially when I had issues last year with a tenured mentor of mine submitting their LOR past deadline (it worked out, but \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f). \n\nReminder that your letter writers should want to pull for you. They should be people that know you well. As said in title, don't underestimate your undergrad mentors and don't be hesistant to ask someone just because they aren't tenure-track. This may be dependent on the type of program you are applying to, but often profs have professional experiences outside of academia that they can touch upon. Additionally, non-tenure profs may have more time to complete a thorough letter.  Networking with both types of profs is beneficial and recommended. But, worth noting, my first paid gig in academia came from my non-tenured mentor.",

I have two professors from undergrad whom I am very good friends with and talk to regularly, despite that I am in grad school.\n\nI'm applying for grad school again, and they were so excited when I reached out asking for advice, and enthusiastically offered recommendations. \n\nI am very fortunate to have met such wonderful people and talented researchers - but even sparing my good fortune, it is something I would recommend to everyone",
