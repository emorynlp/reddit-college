  "text": "As the title says, I haven't had a great deal of contact with my supervisor team over the last month or so. \n\nIt's left me feeling really isolated and recently it's given me a fair bit of anxiety because I can't get any feedback from them so that I can move onto my other research objectives. \n\nHow do I not freak out about this, has anyone else had this happen to them?",

This road is long and it sucks. I've found emotional support from friends and my therapist. Good luck and I hope you find the support you need.",

I think some PIs like to be involved in the writing process, and others are very hands-off.\n\nThe downside is the anxiety that comes with. For both the OP and you, hang in there!",
