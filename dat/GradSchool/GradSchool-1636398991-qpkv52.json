  "title:": "I'm taking a class way beyond my skill level - What should I do?",
  "text": "This semester has been a nightmare. I had a severe personal event that made me get behind. I got extensions and got caught up for the most part, except in one class.\n\nI'm completely not prepared for this class. My PI really wanted me to take it, so I did. I am struggling very badly. It's a stats class where I have to code. The stats concepts are way beyond what I currently understand about stats and the coding is WAY WAY beyond what I'm capable of doing.\n\nI'm so stressed out by this. My PI is awesome, she's really supportive. I just don't know if I should talk to her about this class? Like what could even be done? There is not even very much semester left.\n\nI've been getting the homework done, but it takes hours and hours and I honestly don't know what I'm doing. I'm not learning. I'm supposed to do a final project and I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing. I haven't learned the necessary skills to actually do a project. I've been to office hours and I've been getting help, but I'm not truly understanding. I'm just figuring out how to modify code so it works and I get a grade.\n\nI'm spending so much time on this class, barely anything else is getting done. I'm so overwhelmed.\n\nShould I discuss it with my PI or just keep trying to bruteforce my way through?\n\nedit to add: I feel like the content of the class is learnable. But not with the instruction that's being given. My professor is very nice. Very kind man. But he is a terrible teacher. Some of the homework is questions unrelated to stuff we went over in lecture. He told us we only need basic coding skills but then expects us to know how to do tons of things I've never even heard of. So that is a huge problem too.",

      "text": "It might be worth considering dropping the class. One semester I took 3 classes, two were high level statistics classes. I thought I would be able to manage everything just fine, but as the semester progressed, I noticed I was spending so much time on one class compared to the others, and the coding for it was becoming more complex in a shorter time frame than I was able to manage between coursework, research, and teaching. \n\nSo I dropped it. It's not like dropping it meant I would *never* have the opportunity to learn about that technique, just that when I would be able to do so on my own time schedule. I would definitely talk to your adviser first because they would be more familiar with you and the needs of your program. However, there's also no shame in dropping a class.",

I'm a first year (started off schedule) and I'm just not ready for this class. I just wish I hadn't waited until so late in the semester.",

It looks like there might be something called an \"incomplete contract\" where I get the class marked incomplete and then finish it by some date I work out with the instructor. I might do that.",
