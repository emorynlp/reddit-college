  "title:": "First day as a TA, already had a sour experience",
  "text": "This is my first semester of grad school and I\u2019m receiving funding through a teaching assistantship. I\u2019m teaching a biology lab for non-majors, and it\u2019s a lot of freshmen. I teach two sections, a morning lab and an evening lab.\n\nMorning lab went great, everyone was respectful when I or another student spoke. However, in my night lab I had a situation that kind of shook me up. We were going over the lab safety contract and students had to go around the room and find the safety showers, chemical spill kit, etc. Afterwards, I asked for volunteers to point out the location each thing in the lab to make sure we were all on the same page. \n\nOne student was pointing out the safety shower, and I noticed two students talking loudly to each other. I went over and asked if they could please listen to the speaker. One of those students gave me a bit of sass and told me they were talking about the safety contract and if I had listened I would of known that, but okay, he\u2019ll listen. Thanks, awesome, that\u2019s perfect. I walk away.\n\nThen, he proceeds to (in front of the whole class) to say we need to clear the air and I need to get the class under control, that\u2019s there\u2019s no reason to single him out - that I should understand since we\u2019re both adults, and have no idea what is going on in his life. My adrenaline was pumping, I\u2019m not great with confrontation. So, okay, I addressed the whole class and laid my expectations out that when another student is talking, we should all be respectful and listen, particularly when it involves lab safety. \n\nHe continued, and I then said that if there\u2019s issues with my communication, we can discuss it after class. That was that (if I can remember it all correctly). After class, he left without talking to me further. One student mentioned that I handled it \u201clike a champ,\u201d so that felt good. But, I can also see his point, I don\u2019t have any clue what his life is like or his sensitivities. \n\nDid I handle this professionally? Do I bring it up with the professor? How often does this happen? I\u2019m hoping someone else has gone through something similar and can share their experience! Thanks.\n\nUpdate: Thank you for all of your suggestions and insights! I documented the incident to the professor in an email. They informed me that I handled it professionally and that we can discuss it in our next TA meeting. Sounds like they also have some stories to share!",

But as it\u2019s your first semester, I also wanted to let you know: if your school does anonymous course evaluations, you might get a nasty eval from him in however many weeks\u2019 time. Since there are no repercussions for students, they sometimes give quite cruel and unkind reviews for really petty reasons (like this), and he may criticise more than just how you handled this incident. Given something like this happened on day one, I\u2019d suggest you just totally ignore your worst eval this semester and remember you did the right thing.",

      "text": "So I totally disagree with many of the commenters here calling this student \"disrespectful.\" I want to offer another perspective. \n\nAs someone who's been in that student's situation before, I can understand his frustration. I have been in the position of talking to a neighboring student about the current class content and being chastised by a teacher. I do not like that experience and would like to feel comfortable asking a classmate for clarification or help if I missed something. Sometimes that is the easiest and quickest way to clear up confusion if I missed a word or something. \n\nWaiting to ask a question can really suck because it may mean that in the meantime, I don't understand what is being talked about if the knowledge builds in each other. In other words if I missed one or two words or didn't understand something, and the class is continuing to talk about it, I can either\n\na) ask a neighbor for clarification and then hopefully understand the rest of the class convo/lecture\n\nb) wait to ask and then have to have the whole thing re-explained and feel lost\n\nB might be extra stressful on the first day of class because that's a time when I for one want to feel oriented to what's going on around me. \n\nAlso people have different learning styles and maybe the student's neighbor explained it in a way that was easier for him to understand. So in this case, I don't think expecting absolute silence while someone else is talking is a reasonable expectation. I would ask students, if you are clarifying something with a neighbor please do so quickly and quietly. \n\nI highly discourage you from buying into the stories people have here about this student being \"entitled\" or a \"problem student.\" If you buy into this, I think you may be setting up both the student and yourself to fail. \n\nAlso, any advice to turn into rigid authoritarian is bad pedagogy imo. The teacher/student relationship works best when run on mutual respect. You interpreted this student's behavior as disrespectful, but he also interpreted your behavior as disrespectful. It sounds like it was due to a misunderstanding and perhaps unclear expectations. Look for ways to restore respect and trust, not dominate the student into submission in a power struggle. That's a waste of energy for both of you, and as the person in the position of authority, I think you have more of a responsibility to break that cycle.",

If there is that tone, I have to nip it in the bud. At the end of the day, I will refuse to teach a student if they are making me or students feel unsafe. \n\nI\u2019m fine with students quietly asking their neighbors for help. I saw him passing notes in the beginning of class while I was speaking, and I\u2019m fine with that. But if I\u2019m on one side of the room, and he\u2019s on the other and speaking loud enough for it to be hard to hear the other student, yes, I will ask him to please be quiet like I did. \n\nWe were going over a location of the safety shower, I\u2019m not sure how someone could struggle to understand that topic. If he was speaking about another concept, there was earlier opportunities to do so. If they were in fact speaking about the safety contract, I\u2019m so happy there were engaged in the material! But I won\u2019t have their expression of that be detrimental to other\u2019s experiences.\n\nI appreciate your alternative perspective, but given his tone, I disagree.",

Keep your cool (always pretend someone is recording). Ask yourself if this is a waste of class time. If it is, the discussion is over and you invite the student to chat with you after class. Otherwise, state your mind and leave it. One tactic students will use if they notice that you are willing to consider their bullshit is they will keep feeding you bullshit. It will be done disingenuously to waste class time, create ambiguity, and/or to try and confuse you. I would suggest generally sticking to your guns or saying that you'll consider it and write an email to the class later in the evening. \n\nRemember that, at the end of the day, you are in charge.

He would address students by there name to answer questions or to call them out if they did have their phone, are talking, etc.  The fact that he knew everyone\u2019s name really changed the dynamic of the class with more discussions and respect amongst all.

To cover your ass, send an email documenting the event to the professor in case it continues or escalates, you have the grounds to have him removed from your class and transferred to another. It also preserves a record to cover you if he tries to shift blame, as seems in his character. I have always preferred to start class as a bit of a hard ass, but make it clear I\u2019m there to help. I was 21 when I got my first TA so there were definitely times when I felt that acting more formal, strict, and dressing up (even under lab clothes) really helped make students take me seriously. As time goes on and you get a better feel for the students and have their respect, you can loosen up- but it\u2019s a lot harder to backtrack from \u201ccool TA\u201d. The kid is right that you don\u2019t know his life circumstances, but he doesn\u2019t know yours and frankly that is irrelevant. You are a student in higher education, everyone is here to learn, and no personal circumstances have the right to interfere with the class everyone else is also paying good money to attend. If he has a personal issue, he needs to handle it just so- personally/ privately- one on one with you. Freshmen especially seem to still have the mentality of \u201cbeing forced to be here\u201d like high school, instead of recognizing the privilege they have to be in university. Hope he straightens up, if not don\u2019t be shy about asking for help from the professor. Everyone has been there.",

      "text": "So, I've actually had something similar to this happen before in a night lab I was teaching. It was a student that regularly came to class unprepared, and kept my under-grad TA and I late after the end of class saying \"I'm almost done\" or \"I will just let me finish this one thing\". He would also go off-procedure just to see what would happen. \n\nMy Course-Coordinator was unfortunately on maternity leave at the time. So I had to go to her stand in. And she was not happy at what we were dealing with. I ended up having to send a formal complaint to that student's academic advisor. He dropped the class and I think later apologized (this happened about 2 years ago). \n\nMoral of the story is don't wait for the behavior to drag on to let your course coordinator know about it. And stay brave and firm in laying down the laws in your class room. Night labs will typically be a more rowdy bunch than the day labs. If you notice they have a hard time focusing on the lab and not talking to thier friends ask the course coordinator if you could threaten to subtract points from thier labs if they don't complete the lab on time (due to not focusing, I do realize things can just go horribly wrong in lab in ways that aren't anyone's fault).",

Be empathetic (though I rolled my eyes at his comments), but remind him that the more attentive students are, the smoother (and faster!) lab sessions will go. If he continues to be a dick, let the supervisor know, and set up an office hours meeting. If you're uncomfortable one-on-one, request the supervisor to be present.\n\nAlso, if I ever had students whispering/talking while I was, I just paused until they noticed.

If this student is significantly older than the other freshmen, don't you think that they'd understand respect just as much as you do? You are free to kick someone out of class if they are being disruptive or disrespectful. Once again check with your professor, but don't tolerate bs. You're the instructor, you deserve respect.

Literally the textbook response I would ask for in something like a classroom management seminar.\n\nRemember, in the classroom *you* are the authority. All those things you've seen a professor or grade school teacher do when someone steps out of line, you're now empowered to do in your lab section (possibly after a discussion with your instructor-of-record for the more drastic measures.) If this student wants to act like a child, then it's not just your right, but your duty as an educator to stamp that out and protect the learning environment for the rest of your students. He's testing the waters to see what he can get away with, and by heading it off early, it's much less likely to continue to be a problem.\n\nI would say it's perfectly acceptable to bring it up with your professor, and strongly recommended to bring it up if disruptions continue; there's the potential this student also goes to your professor to file a complaint against you -- in this situation, it would be best that the professor has already heard the story from you.",

I had assumed this would be clear to anyone, but as a matter of respect I would like everybody to listen, when one of your peers is saying something.\" You are conceding a point to him, which let's him save face, while establishing boundaries at the same time.\n\nStudent still trying to stir shit? \"Let's discuss this after class.\"\n\nEDIT: As an example of what not to do. Further down someone gave this advice:\n\n>When he said \"we can discuss it after class\" would have been a good time to point out that you dictate when and if we have after-class discussions, not him, and if he wanted to have a chat you'd be happy to, but he can come to your posted office hours as listed on the syllabus. \n\nThis is the worst kind of response possible. Makes you look petty and very unprofessional. Discussing personal issues after class is a reasonable request, so if my TA would \"put her foot down\" in this situation as some kind of power play, I would instantly loose all my respect for her.",

I know maybe you want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but this student does not have a point at all. It's not his show, it's yours. Maybe it sounds mean, but what he is going through is not really relevant at all. If he is having some difficulties that preclude him from acting in a polite and professional (and safe!) way in class, he should withdraw from the course. \n\nYou mentioned he was an older student and, tbh, sometimes the older ones can be worse than the teenagers. Older students can sometimes have a hard time taking you seriously if you're much younger than they are because they think you don't have \"life experience\", \"maturity\" or whatever--but it's not a class about life. It's a class about biology and you know more than he does, period. And this person is evidently a veteran and hasn't learned you don't talk when someone else is talking? I'm sure his superiors enjoyed him. \n\nDon't be afraid to push back on rude and disrespectful students.

You handled it well, but something tells me that this person might have a problem taking direction from someone younger than them (especially if you're a woman). If they are not paying attention during lab safety demonstrations, that's serious enough to be addressed.",

I tell my students, jokingly, that I like to create an environment of direct democracy in my class where everyone should feel free to express themselves and participate as often as they like, however at the end of the day, it is definitely a dictatorship.",

School is a professional environment, and your expectations were correct. Especially as an older student he should know better, and set an example for the other students (source: was an older undergrad myself). I don\u2019t know your gender, but as a woman I have been challenged before by a certain type of man who would *not* treat one of my male colleagues the same way. Your professional handling of the situation was a spot on way to diffuse it. \n\nThat being said, this guy clearly needs something. You\u2019re going to have to deal with him going forward (if he doesn\u2019t drop). It might be beneficial to send him an email, say you didn\u2019t get a chance to speak after class but would like to address his concerns and ensure that going forward you both have clear expectations of what to expect in class. Suggest making an appointment or office hours. That should set him back to thinking (hopefully). You could also send him some resources, eg if your school has counseling services. Either way I would run the situation by your prof, some have specific ways they like to deal with it. This is kind of above and beyond your duties, but I\u2019m more of a hands-on type of TA, so I figured I\u2019d suggest. No matter what you do I\u2019m sure you will handle it well :)",

Unless you are having a emergency the classroom is somewhere you come and should be prepared to learn and that means leaving what his life is like and sensitivities at the door. No, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be sensitive or take things into consideration but it's hardly an excuse for their behavior.\n\nYou do not need to know what his life is like. This is an educational setting and he needs to conform to the expectations you set.\n\nOne of my first weeks ever  teaching, I also taught intro bio for non majors. A student who wasn't excelling and had a bad attitude broke a piece of glassware. And had the audacity to blame me for it while I was cleaning up.I basically handled it the same way you did.\n\nEspecially with first semester freshman they just went from high school where they were treated as children to being treated as adults. \n\nThis means adult expectations.\n\nHow often it happens is a matter of chance and what classes you teach, but also your confidence (which can't be very high right now). Try to remember you are the authority here, you can still make mistakes, and you can own those but you set the expectations.\n\nFreshman are tough because they don't know where you stand or what is expected of them. Older students know how the game of grading and points is played so they will manipulate you or the system to get what they need while doing the minimum amount of work.\n\nYou can bring it up to the professor or lab coordinator to let them know you had to speak to student x about x. I'm sure they will back you up.",

They\u2019ve been in the workforce for a long time and have probably risen the ranks to the point of not being on the lowest rung anymore. Being a freshman is going back to that lowest rung.
