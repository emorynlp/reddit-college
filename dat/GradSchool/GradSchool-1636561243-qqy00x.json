  "text": "Hi all,\n\nSince most of you here had gone through the application process. And some of you might have a spreadsheet with US universities details. It would be of great help if you could share the link in the comments. \n\nAs there are many universities, it is very difficult for me to look at all the details at all universities.\n\nIf some one has any sheet that has details of US universities...like the tuition fees, deadlines, etc for MS CS Fall 22 program, please share the link in the comments. \n\nThanks in advance.",
