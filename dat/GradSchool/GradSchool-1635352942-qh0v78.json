If it's just a matter of solving a complex problem, a computer can do that. Stating that you derive hedonic pleasure from solving math equations makes it sound like you're sitting at your desk masturbating every time you get the answer right. \n\nI think you can easily articulate that into something more palatable though. Maybe math is challenging for you and you enjoy tackling challenges and contributing to overall knowledge. Maybe you want to work on challenging problems that can help set the foundation for applied researchers to make headway in tackling X problem the world is facing.

You can do math at home without a PhD. You can buy textbooks and sit at your desk all day doing math to your heart's content. That is not a good enough reason for a graduate program to spend over $100,000 over the course of 4 -5 years on you. \n\nIf you are self-funded, maybe they're less likely to care since they don't have to pay for you. But if you are going to need to be funded through a TA, RA or PA position, you're basically asking for $100,000 or more and you should keep that in mind when you apply. A graduate student is an investment by the university, and someone who just likes to do math is a really terrible investment compared to someone who likes doing math but also wants to make a broader social impact (i.e. boost the reputation of the university). You need to make the case to the admissions committee that you are a smart investment compared to everyone else that is applying that particular application cycle and your current reason does not make that case nearly good enough, in my opinion. You're free to disagree, of course. I don't particularly care since I'm in a PhD program already, but it's really weird to solicit advice and then try to argue that you're right. If you just want confirmation, then say so.",

I mention this \u2018love of the feeling\u2019 as a sort off reason why I\u2019m into math ( applied math is what I\u2019m going to grad school for), but with regards to why I\u2019m going to grad school/a PhD specifically I mention that in all the research  projects I\u2019ve done in my various industry roles, I was always left with a plethora of \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019 questions that I couldn\u2019t practically explore. Directions for future research that grew out naturally from the work I did which the practicalities  business didn\u2019t let me explore. I wanna a chance to investigate these topics in greater depth and pursue those directions for research bc I\u2019m yearning for that deeper understanding.",

Enjoying solving hard problems is a very good reason. \n\nMost academics are (at least) slightly obsessed people who put a lot of hard work and focus on issues in their field. \n\nSo also explain that in terms of your ability to focus on the problem, and how much it drives you to put work into it.",

Hedonism (from what I remember) really came out of Wilde\u2019s Aesthetic movement. Could be a little out of context. Just find a more precise word or phrase. You don\u2019t want to risk miscommunication\n\nEdit: yeah I did a little look up. Hedonism is more about the theory that all pleasures should be pursued, and should not be labeled as good or bad. (\u201cBad\u201d even including drug use and sex). It\u2019s a sensational, free-will kind of context",
