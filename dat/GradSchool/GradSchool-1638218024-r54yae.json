  "text": "I'm a 2nd year PhD student in an ecology/evolution program. I made myself a website but now I'm worried it's a bit of a weird and self-aggrandizing thing to do this early on in my career. The website isn't live yet and I might just save it for later on down the road. Anyone have good or bad takes on having your own website as a PhD student?",

      "text": "As a science communicator I'd say go for it! Just make sure you have a particular audience in mind. Mh experience is that the number one mistake most do when setting up a website, is having no intended audience, leading to a website that is really only interesting to the author. \n\nA website is a great place to showcase your published work, conference contributions, and perhaps even write popular dissemination texts about your articles, or perhaps you can have a nerdy blog which would be useful for certain audiences. It's also a great place to make yourself visible to a broader audience.\n\nHowever, if your university has a good interface for its staff, ie bio-pages etc, I'd encourage you to utilize that as well. A university website would for instance appear higher up on Google than your private wordpress site. Also, it's benefitial to be associated with established institutions. We have a lot of researchers where I work who go off and create their own website, because they don't like the design of the university site, or for whatever reason. It's really stupid, because being associated with a large institution beats fancy fonts or whether the captions are in italics or whatever... \n\nA Wikipedia site is also a good idea if your area of expertise is something for example journalists would be interested in.\n\nI'm happy to advice if you have any questions!",

I don't use my own website, but still have several dozen media hits thanks to an up-to-date bio and CV on our department's website and active social media profile (some might say *too* active...). When folks come looking for expertise, they're not gonna know your name to Google - they're gonna look through established institutions' list of people, or they go through people they already know who can point them your way and use your bio to verify. Obviously you can have your own website as well that you can link to through your institution profile, but the latter should come first.",

If I'm a professional blogger, I can spend time to find a particular \"niche\" and then write tailored articles trying to maximize views and income. \n\nBut I'm not. I just want to site/blog where I can compile all my thoughts. I have been writing long articles on Facebook on my travels, my views on different things, book/film reviews...etc over the past several years. I then started a blog in blogger and wrote one page each about my tech projects, and linked them in my CV. \n\nI recently migrated my blog to github pages, and decided to include by travels and thoughts as well. As one site that defines me. I'm pretty sure the audience interested in computer architecture, backpacking and stories and book reviews is almost none. But I really don't have the time to manage three blogs.\n\nWhat do you think?",

              "text": "I will have a look! \nThere is nothing wrong as such with having a personal website with different themes - think of newspapers, they target readers interested in sports, finance, etc.\nHowever if the main reason for having a website is professional promotion, networking, etc, you communicate much more effectively if you target your \"dream audience\" both in terms of what you write about, how you write (important!) and how you present your content.\nIt just always falls into place once you position yourself in the mind of the target reader, instead of seeing it from your perspective. \nIt's like writing an academic article, I guess. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings or move them to another document for the sake of clarity and a read thread in the text. \nFor a young scientist whose main motivation for having a website is to get noticed for their knowledge and research, I would prioritise this way of thinking about the website. \nThere is nothing wrong, however, by adding a category for non-research related issues. It can be fun to \"get to know\" the person behind the research. Also, if you're an excellent writer, showing that off by writing about other things than research related issues, could be benefitial if you want to get into popular dissemination. \nHowever having a target audience in mind for the main content is rule number 1 for effective communication. \nIt really depends who and what the website is for. If it is primarily for yourself, and not that serious in terms of network building or \"personal branding\" (I hate that term, but I'll use it), then have fun and it won't hurt. \nBut if you're serious about using it for professional purposes, it makes sense to think the way I've tried to describe it!",

              "text": "I had a quick look! I'm meant to be writing a paper, so I didn't take time to read, so you know this is not very thourugh! Firstly: How nice to see a blog full of content! It looks really nice visually. I know what you mean, it's quite varied. And I don't think I'm the target audience, as I didn't even understand the first headline \ud83d\ude02. My first thought is that I miss a context. The website doesn't say anything about who you are or what your expertise is in? Or perhaps it does, but I couldn't find it!\nI would recommend making it very clear to the reader who this is coming from and your credentials. I assume you have more expertise in some areas than in others, which should be clear to me as a reader.\nI don't mind the varied set up. It clearly is a personal blog. I assume you would use the blog as a \"database\" of sorts - like you can send links to your blogs regarding certain topics in whatever context (\"I have written about this here:...\") which is handy.\nBut if I were, say, a journalist or an industry person looking to hire somebody to have a presentation in whatever field your expertise is in, I would look for the \"about me\"-information. A text on the frontpage presenting who you are and what on the blog is professional / research and what is just \"stuff I write about for fun\" would be helpful!\nAlso, I find the headlines a bit hard to grasp - if you want people outside of your area of expertise to read those articles, I would make the headlines more descriptive. Also, this could be helpful for the above mentioned journalist / industry person etc. \nIt looks nice, though, and the fact that there's a lot lf content and nice photographs gives the impression of you being engaged, effective and active. That's a good thing.",

Sometimes a researcher has written about something that's relevant for our audiences on their personal/professional blog.

For example, I had spent a nontrivial amount of time figuring out how to analyze some data with a new technique. Unfortunately the result wasn't good. I still wanted to show the world that I knew how to do this and turns out a personal blog is a great way to keep a record of what you've learned and these kinds of posts help others too. \n\nBy my third year when I was presenting at conferences, I noticed that people began to look me up. It's kinda nice to keep track of these kinda stuff too. Make sure you have a tracker like Google analytics or Statcounter installed on your website. Just remember though that it takes some time for things to pick up. Nobody visited my website during the first two years. Now I get about 30+ visitors every day.

How terrible.\n\n[Undoubtedly, your time has been better spent making memes about applying to grad school](https://www.reddit.com/user/greens_giga_chad/submitted/).\n\nI can only speak for myself: mentioning a few interests on my website has resulted in people that share those interests commenting when making contact. It helps a stranger break the ice when they can say they share some common interest when first contacting me. If you liked hiking and you got an interview with this person, you could talk about hiking and instantly build rapport.",

                  "text": ">I like hiking a lot, it\u2019s just not relevant in my opinion.\n\nI hear you. \n\nYou are right that hiking almost certainly isn't relevant for their research.\n\nWhat you're wrong about is that it is \"vain\" to put hiking on their website. It isn't vain at all. If you still think it is, try to explain how it is vain. It isn't relevant for their research, but that doesn't make it vain, right?\n\nI gave an example of how it can be helpful to share some personal details: since you like hiking, you can break the ice by talking about hiking when you contact them. This person you are applying to work under **is a person**, not just a job-title. They are a person, so they shared something about being a person that goes beyond work, and that opens the door for you to be able to connect with them on a human level. If you hike, and you don't ask about hiking, you're missing an opportunity to make a connection with this person over something you both enjoy. That's a failing on your part since you need every edge you can get for grad school. Grad school isn't just like taking courses; you work with a supervisor and it is best when you can get along well, and having shared interests helps a lot with that!\n\n>just cause I disagreed with the gOoD tHiNk opinion on a reddit thread.\n\nYou totally missed the point. This isn't about \"gOoD tHiNk opinion\". \n\nI put the example about how it is actually useful. I didn't just shit on you; I shared a reason why it actually makes sense to post that they enjoy hiking. There is something for you to learn here; you don't have to be butthurt over this. You can swallow your pride and rethink the situation a bit. Yes, it isn't relevant, but it isn't detrimental, either, and there are some cases where it is actually quite useful to a thoughtful student trying to make a connection.\n\nI called attention to your memery because you were shitting on a random person that you don't know for what they do with their time. Calling you out was a small taste of your own medicine. Indeed, I didn't even call you names or shit on you directly; I just highlighted what you do with your time and the judgment was left to the reader. Hiking, making memes, reddit commenting, whatever, we're all allowed to spend time however we want. Apparently you didn't like getting called out for it, so maybe your judgment of the person that goes hiking doesn't add up.\n\nYou're allowed to have unpopular opinions. Still, when someone highlights some alternative, it's good to think it through. You don't have to hold fast to your opinion just because you had it; you can update your views with new information and ideas and form entirely new opinions. You don't have to have the same opinion as me, just think it through. Hell, I would not want to see a whole deck of vacation photos, but then again, the entire platform of Instagram seems to be about sharing inane photos so I guess a lot of people are into that shit, so having that on your website isn't a \"bad\" thing. \n\nHonestly, maybe your negative take speaks to the fact that you're kinda embarrassed about your hobby of making memes. This person isn't embarrassed about hiking. You don't have to be embarrassed about making memes. Could have a portfolio of memes and if they were funny, I'd look favourably on that since it would communicate that you have a good sense of humour (and maybe some Photoshop skills).",
