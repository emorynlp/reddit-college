(Already had a masters, which at my new program doesn't get me out of any classes but lets me do comps my first year.)\n\nNow my family is asking if I \"got an A on the final\" and I'm trying to explain that's not how it works, lol.

          "text": "Thank you!! In my program, quals are done in the form of three written exams, each one month apart. Each exam has three questions, on three different topics, making for nine total questions on nine topics. We have to pass each one of the nine questions to pass comps. We also get basic reading lists and the ability to discuss topics with faculty members who specialize in that topic before the exam, so I felt like we were really supported!\n\nThe sucky part was always waiting to hear the results of each phase even while studying for the next phase, so I hear you! Good luck!! ",
