  "title:": "Has anyone assisted with a book review workshop for a professor?",
  "text": "A professor I have worked closely with (I am a graduate student, currently in a Master's program and applying to a sociology PhD program right now) asked me to assist with a workshop for reviewing his upcoming research book, where several prolific sociology academics who will be present. I'll be taking notes on their suggestions etc., and am wondering if there is a title for this kind of role? Also not sure if there are skills here that would be good to identify on a resume/CV. This strikes me as a very unofficial kind of role, though I am getting paid to do it, so I just wasn't sure if there is a common approach to identifying this kind of thing on a CV, if at all.\n\nThanks!",
