  "text": "I'd really appreciate insight from current grad students & asst. professors on this:\n\nI'm currently working on grad school apps & I see there's specific space available to \"discuss any other information you feel would be important to the Admission Committee in evaluating your application.\" Another app states \"Please also write a brief (approximately 200-word) statement stating how your own life experience and potential outweighs your lack of experience.\"\n\nI was wondering what is appropriate to add to an application. I have had some difficult life circumstances and I refrained from using those traumas in my undergraduate applications but I am wondering now how certain life experiences may be relevant or helpful in explaining a lack of work experience without using it as an excuse. tldr; **Does anyone have experience with discussing trauma in the supplemental parts of grad apps? And how have you stated it matter-of-factly?**",

      "text": "So I had quite a few experiences that I had to include in my section. Among other things, I had been stalked by a police officer and racially profiled, I was nearly homeless in college, one of my parents is disabled and  was caregiving for them, and I was working two jobs at once when I was in undergrad to support myself. Also had one of the advisors tell me that I'm stupid, not thinking, and don't care about my work when I explained why my grades weren't the best.\n\nYou should 100% include those things as they help further contextualize your situation, who you are, and your overall performance. Colleges and universities are not equitable places in the slightest, so including this information is very valuable because without it they don't have that additional information.\n\nI've had the most success framing that in a way that shapes how you conduct your current work, like I listed these things but also noted that I conduct my work with these sorts of inequities in mind and it helps give a perspective that is vastly underrepresented in academia.\n\nA simple format is to summarize what happened and how does it shape your life and what does it contribute to your work? I applied to a social justice based program, so it happened to work out really well for making a case for why it's valuable to the program I was applying for, but you can still frame those things to integrate into any subject because these problems span every industry.",
