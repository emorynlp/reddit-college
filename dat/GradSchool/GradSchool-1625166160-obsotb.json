  "text": "I was working on my PhD in materials science and Engineering when my Advisor and I had a serious falling out. It ended up coming to the point where I could switch advisors and projects and essentially start over or Master out. \nI ended up choosing to master out and I was really bummed. Additionally since this happened so quickly and I had everything and all the requirements to graduate I went from several more years to graduate to graduating in a couple weeks. Since it happened so quickly I was unable to have a job lined up. \n\nSo for the past 6 months I've been doordashing full time to make ends meat while I apply. I couldn't even land an interview for anything worth my time. I can't explain how demoralizing it felt to have my Masters degree in engineering and dropping off someone's chipotle order for a $3 tip.\n After iterating my resume several times to get past the resume robots and recruiters. I finally got an interview with Intel, then a second presentation interview and then 4 more panel interviews... Today i got the offer and the salary is what I would have expected had I finished my PhD. So needless to say I am estatic. Intel is my dream job and I really feel justified that I made the right call to leave with my Masters. The job i got was a PhD preferred, Masters OK kinda job. \n\nIdk why I'm posting this exactly, really excited, but also wanted to share a perspective about how hard it was abruptly leaving a PhD especially during the pandemic.",

          "text": ">My PhD advisor is extremely abusive and is forcing me to masters-out.\n\nBy the way, that's not entirely up to your advisor. **Fight this** - reach out to potential replacement advisors, confide in them what's going on yet without badmouthing (and also let someone in the Graduate School know, there are supposed to be people whose job is to resolve such cases, and these cases are far more common than you think). If your advisor is abusive to you, chances are the people you talk to will be suspicious of him/her and thus believe you. Fight for your PhD, it's yours, not your advisor's. \n\nI got \"unofficially\" dumped halfway through the program by my shitty, unprofessional advisor. First I felt like total shit and blamed myself for like a month. Then I realized it wasn't my fault and that I deserved to get my PhD. I'd been professional and respectful, he was the one who never gave me the time of day and barely responded to my emails. So I switched my attitude from \"defensive\" to confident and a little \"offensive\" - I went and found a new advisor in the department, who I also told what was going on (again, without badmouthing, but with full disclosure). I also told the dean, so that people would know what an ass I was dealing with. I've since moved on successfully, my new advisor is perfect, and I'm finishing on time. \n\nFight it! Believe in yourself!",

I have some friends that graduated after me in CS/Engineering and the sad thing I noticed was how selective they were in applying for companies. They would only apply for top companies and be bummed that they weren\u2019t getting interviews. To any students reading this, you most likely won\u2019t land your dream job out of college. Take what you can get (keeping in mind what you are worth of course) and plan on the dream job 3-5 years after graduation. No offense to OP, but it\u2019s better to take a job for 1 year at a low end low paying company for relevant experience than it is to door dash. I have never been great with words so I probably sound like a bigot but people with tech degrees all think they are going straight to Apple or Amazon the day they graduate. Some do. Most don\u2019t.",

They contacted me 6 months later to tell me they had a job for me, but unfortunately I had already accepted an offer from a grad school.

There's a lot of people like me and many people that I worked with who tested out the waters around going for a PhD and then decided to go make real money instead doing basically the same work but with a BS or MS. The only thing a PhD really teaches you compared to working in a research lab is how grateful you should be for having a job that pays decently instead of treating you like cheap, almost free labor. Most of the best researchers that I've met either mastered out of a PhD program or never even bothered trying to go for one. You go for a PhD because of passion not because it'll help your career.",
