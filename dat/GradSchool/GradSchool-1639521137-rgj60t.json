  "text": "Not sure how to go around it, since I always do everything last minute (for reasons), and essentially that is the reason the assignments turn out shorter than necessary. I'm actively working on fixing it, and I am already better than I used to be.\n\nI'm sure I'll figure something out eventually and will improve even more, but. For now I have yet another paper that was submitted with less pages than necessary and a rushed last section. Anyone else in this boat? How do you cope? Does this have severe consequences in the long run?\n\n(I think about 70% of the paper is fairly decent and I have been working hard and honestly on it until I ran out of time)",

              "text": "So this is sort of a broad, cross-field number, but for 1. and 2. you should have a \\*minimum\\* of three. If you are at the undergraduate level, 2-3 total sources per page of writing is acceptable, but at the graduate level, 3+ otherwise it's very difficult to argue that you are providing substantial enough evidence and counter-argument to validate your point. \n\nFor point 3., paraphrasing is looked down upon when used all but sparingly and quotes are almost always considered to be a form of padding the page. You only do it if your point NEEDS the quote - say, if you are writing a history paper and quoting a speech,  law, or report that directly informs your argument. Even so, it should only be a sentence or too, and again, used sparingly. \n\nIt sounds to me like you're trying to take shortcuts with your papers, honestly. That will only bite you in the long run.",

Also didn't know paraphrasing was looked down upon, but I'll ask someone in my field more about it and specifically about my papers.\n\nMy problem is not that I have nothing to say or am taking shortcuts. The problem is with time and some other things that I won't go into, I mentioned that in the original post. I could very well write a paper that fits all requirements and gets good comments if not for all the other stuff going on. Thanks for trying to help though.",
