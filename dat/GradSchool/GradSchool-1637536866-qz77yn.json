  "title:": "How do I make my \"atypical\" college experiences sound like a non-issue?",
  "text": "I'm applying to grad school for the first time this year and would love feedback on my answers to some prompts on my grad school applications. I had some \"atypical\" experiences in my academic career, including resigning from research labs due to personal mental health issues, transferring schools, and withdrawing from a class. Please let me know how my responses sound below.\n\n1. Have you ever withdrawn from or repeated a term in any college or university?  \nYes. I withdrew from my Biochemistry course the first time I took it at the University of Utah in 2016. I finished that semester and then took a two year gap period due to personal and financial reasons before returning to the University of Utah and graduating with my bachelor's.\n\nI have only ever had to repeat Organic Chemistry I. (Answer A)\n\nOR\n\nI withdrew from Biochemistry the first time I took it at the University of Utah in Fall 2016. I had just moved back to Salt Lake and was in-between jobs and housing. I finished that semester and decided it would be best to take a two year gap period for personal and financial reasons. I then returned to the University of Utah in 2018 and graduated with my bachelor's. (Answer B)\n\nI have only ever had to repeat Organic Chemistry I.\n\n2. Have you ever resigned from any other academic or research role (including industry-based roles) under irregular circumstances?  \nYes. I transferred to the University of Utah in 2016, where I took Summer classes and interviewed for a genetics lab on campus. In Fall, I was busy with a heavy course load, undergrad research, and full-time work. Before the year\u2019s end, I was between jobs and looking for a new place to live. Due to this stress, my performance at the lab suffered and I resigned from the team for my mental health.\n\n3. Have you ever transferred from one college or university to another (excluding summer schools)?  \nYes. I was admitted to Southern Utah University (SUU) right after graduating high school. My major was Biology, with an emphasis on Zoology. I loved being a student at SUU. However, I wanted to study microbiology, and SUU had limited options as a small, rural university. Therefore, I transferred to the University of Utah (U of U) in order to have better access to more specialized courses, including those for cell and molecular biology, which became my new emphasis.\n\n4. If you consider anything about your academic record or career path to be atypical, please explain. Account for time periods of three months or more involving military service, travel, family responsibilities, etc. not covered in preceding questions.  \nI graduated with my bachelor's in Biology, emphasis in Cell and Molecular Biology, in December 2020 from the University of Utah. Due to COVID-19, my last year of classes were all online. This caused some issues with being able to attend labs in-person, as well as complications with virtual learning and test-taking. Due to this, my last year at the University of Utah was atypical and my grades may reflect that stressor.",

      "text": "I would avoid giving much detail about a) mental health and b) anything that might lead an unforgiving reader to think that academia will be too stressful for you. Note this is absolutely not my opinion - unfortunately some people still look down on mental health or don\u2019t understand it, and you want to give yourself the best chance. Ultimately you graduated so there is no issue there. Short and factual is all you need. I would go answer A and remove the word \u2018stressor\u2019 from answer 4 entirely (sentence still makes sense without it) good luck!",

          "text": "Alternative viewpoint: many people who go to grad school experience mental health crises for the first time. Someone who has been through that already is likely to have better developed coping mechanisms and be able to recognise when they need to seek help. Not to mention that undergrad is a completely different kind of pressure to grad school.",
