  "text": "I'm a guinea pig for a program and i've been at a disadvantage for quite some time. Disadvantage roots from me being the guinea pig with a health sciences background going into a program the school is trying to pilot with that emphasis, but it is originally an engineering program (so knowledge of math and physics is very limited, and while everyone else knows how to code I haven't gotten the hang quite yet). I feel motivation slipping from me. I feel like I truly don't belong. I couldn't sleep last night due to anxiety telling me I'm going to fail and I need to be aware of backup options if my MS program doesn't work out. I'm probably gonna graduate a semester late (3rd semester rn and will likely graduate in summer) because I haven't even began data collection yet but have been trying to refine data collection methods since my advisor is no help whatsoever. \n\nI feel like I've lost so much drive and can't work hard anymore. In undergrad I had a schedule M-Sa where I was up 5a-12a daily because I worked 30-40hr/week on top of taking 12-15 units. I just don't have that drive. I can barely read a chapter of a textbook without wanting an hour break. I'm hanging on by a string. I'm currently going to therapy for other personal reasons but I'll probably bring this up to them as well... just wanted to hear if any of you have had similar experiences in this impending feeling of doom, if that makes sense",

      "text": "I think every grad student feels like this at some point and I don\u2019t think COVID has helped. The best advice I received is that grad school is a process and you work through it a little bit every day. \n\nTo me, this sounds a lot like burnout. When my efficiency or attention span drops that\u2019s usually a red flag and things tend to get much worse if I just try and power through it. In these situations I increase the self care (and sleep!), focus on taking one concrete step a day during my productive time, and try to not beat myself up. You got this!\n\nEdit: also I was a non-engineering undergrad and now I\u2019m in an engineering program so I remember the learning curve was really rough. Nothing really clicked for me until I started writing code every day to solve and simulate the topics we were covering in class. That helped me get a more practical feel for the material (and the math) and it let me get tons of coding practice.",
