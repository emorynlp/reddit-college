  "text": "Hey everyone. I know this is a long shot but I was wondering if anyone is or knows someone enrolled in any fairly new biotechnology program? I just feel like it\u2019s been so recently introduced to many schools and the ranking of its success varies so much. I\u2019m also looking for student experiences rather than just talking to admissions about it. Any information or program or anything at all is helpful. Lol thank you!",
