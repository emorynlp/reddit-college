  "title:": "Grad school applications asking if I was ever on probation",
  "text": "I am applying to graduate programs and two of the schools have a section asking to explain if I have ever been on academic probation. Unfortunately I have been on it twice- once in my first semester of community college (I was 18, fresh out of high school and I didn't know what I wanted to do nor did I feel I was mature enough for college). I also was on academic probation my first semester of undergrad after I transferred from community college b/c my mom got sick with cancer and my parents were going through a divorce all at the same time. I managed to clean up my act both times and my grades have proved it. \n\nWhat do I say? Is this going to damage my chances of getting into grad school?",

      "text": "That makes me sad. I was asked to withdraw for a year during my bachelors because I had a really terrible term in 2nd year (mental health struggles), but pulled my grades back up, went on to do very well in a master's program, and then won a full-ride scholarship for my PhD in a department that is top ten globally in my field. Bumps in the road have nothing to do with long-term success. I really hope this doesn't affect your chances.",

              "text": "I remember that I explicitly addressed it in my application letter for my master's program (but not for my PhD). Just mention it very briefly \"due to personal reasons my grades dropped in term X\" and then focus on how quickly you recovered, that you excelled in your final terms. In my case I mentioned on my year out that I worked full time, volunteered in my field of study, followed the developments in my field closely and I had decided on my area of research interest by the time I came back to my degree. Don't give them too much of the back story as to why you did poorly, focus on how you pulled yourself out of it.",

I know plenty of people in grad school that were on probation their freshman years. \nIt may hurt your chances but if you lie about it it will automatically disqualify you.",
