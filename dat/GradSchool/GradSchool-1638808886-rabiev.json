  "text": "I think it's the letdown after weeks of buildup to 2 presentations and 3 final exams.  This morning was my last final exam and now I just feel...tired and unmotivated.  I need a break.  Thank goodness the holidays are coming up soon.  I just want to spend a few days going on long walks, curling up on the couch with a mug of mulled wine, and reading books that aren't required to pass an exam. :-)\n\nWho's with me?",

I\u2019ll take Wednesday off, then I\u2019ll do some lab work for a while before I go home for some R&R.\n\nBut yea I\u2019m incredibly exhausted too. I have a goal to be 100% done by this summer, but idk if I have the energy anymore. I\u2019m so tired.",
