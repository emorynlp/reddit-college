  "text": "We all know the trope: Reviewer 2 has a personal vendetta out for you and your submission. Best case scenario, you appeal to their edits (which are rarely all that helpful); worst case scenario, they cripple your confidence in your paper, your research, and your future career in academia.\n\nDoes anyone have a story (100-200 words) that they would be willing to have read on a podcast (not linking for sake of Rule 8)?",

      "text": "On my third paper in graduate school, one of the reviewers revealed their identity because my paper had criticized their theories and they wanted to admit bias. The other reviewer saw it, accused me and reviewer #1 of doing some sort of \"under the table\" deal. He said in his review that I, my co-authors and reviewer #1 were unethical should be banned from ever publishing in that journal again. The journal in question allows reviewers to reveal their identities, so no rule was violated. The editor threw out the review, but waking up to that email was painful, especially since it was only my 3rd publication ever.",

With that being said, neither us or reviewer 2 were right or wrong with the approach we used/they wanted; both methods were acceptable in previous literature. Why they refused to concede their position.....no clue.\n\nEnded up cutting it out of the paper, which ended up addressing all their comments/led to publication. Subsequently wrote another paper comparing the methods and showing our approach was better and got that published to avoid any future issues about the situation. lol",
