  "text": "I'm a PhD student going into my second year. \n\nI spent my first year working alone at home thanks to the pandemic. I received an email from my supervision team to say that campus is reopening and they sent me a seating plan of the assigned desks for PhD students.\n\nIt just so happens that one of them shared a course with my last year so I kind of know them by face and name. Should I shoot them a message on Facebook and introduce myself as a \"way into\" the PhD office social circle?\n\nI'm feeling a bit lost and disconnected",

It'd be better to have someone to get to know first before going into campus, and I guess you could ask about the lifestyle and working style, etc before joining them. Previously I had someone help me introduce the other lab members to me because I only knew him earlier, and honestly if I did not know him earlier I think it'd definitely make things much harder for me to get by.",

Everyone will be in the same position and wanting to make friends; it just takes one person to set things in motion. \n\nGood luck and enjoy!",
