  "text": "Howdy folx,\n\nI just submitted an AHA predoctoral fellowship, but I can't seem to find the timeline for study section anywhere on the internet. The F31's timeline is pretty easy to find, which I find surprising for a federal system. Anyway, I was wondering if any of you science grads like me have any experience on when study section is for the AHA. The funding period starts on January first, so it can't be too long after submission.",
