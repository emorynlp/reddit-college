  "text": "It was only open to people who have served as previous interns for my organization. Current employment did not disqualify me - I made sure of that and it was reiterated to me after. I am pretty gutted over this rejection as I know that the applicant pool was not huge. \n\nThe president of the organization said to let her know if I had any questions. I am tempted to ask if there is any feedback that I could have that I could implement next year, but I am a little worried to push that boundary since I work there. Any advice or general comforts are most appreciated - I am feeling rather low and unimpressive.",

The last time I got rejected from an RA position I had applied for, the PI actually followed up with good feedback and then ended up putting me on another project for showing interest after we chatted some more. That\u2019s not a common experience by any means, but you should always feel okay about getting more insight on your work.",

      "text": "1. Don't think of it as a rejection of YOU, but rather an acceptance of someone else. It may just be that the candidate of all box-ticking candidates applied this year. Doesn't matter who we are--there is always someone more qualified. For EVERYTHING.\n2. The president asked for questions. Trust me--your supervisors are quietly cheering you on, and would LOVE to give you some advice for the next cycle. Asking for advice in this situation is NOT boundary stomping.",
