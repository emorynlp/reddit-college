  "text": "Almost went into a full blown panic attack thinking about classes starting in-person next week. \n\nThe panic isn\u2019t about getting covid but the abrupt transition from covid life. I\u2019m a pretty introverted person. I also have anxiety and depression. I\u2019ve been realizing my depression is probably worse than I had recognized and masked by the recommended isolation to protect self and others from covid. \n\nI won\u2019t be able to turn my camera off and be on mute. I won\u2019t be able to crawl out of bed from a nap and sign on. I have to actually get dressed, show up, and be a seemingly functional person. \n\nI\u2019m doing two part-time research jobs and taking two demanding courses. The most I\u2019ve taken on so far (2nd year masters student). \n\nTrying to adjust my mindset to make the most of it. It\u2019s my last year, the campus is beautiful, and maybe I\u2019ll even make some great friends\u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll meet some cool people. Guess I\u2019m just writing to vent and remind myself (and others who relate) to have patience and self compassion. It\u2019s okay to slow down and go your own pace.",

You can only do your best.  Then however it is will just be as good as it could have been, and you can take some comfort in that.  I know that thought at least comforts me when I\u2019m stressed out.\n\nNo use in comparing yourself to something that isn\u2019t possible at this point in time in this situation.",
