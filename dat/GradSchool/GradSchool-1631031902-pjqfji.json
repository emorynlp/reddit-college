  "title:": "Template for Resume and Personal Websites for Grad Students",
  "text": "A personal website and a well-organized resume is extremely important especially for us, grad students. There are a number of templates available online but some either require coding or some consume bit too much time for setting up. There are a couple of no-code solutions available online but none of the offer the flexibility and aesthetics of Notion.\n\nMany times, professors and fellow grad students have appreciated the templates I use for my website and resume and it has really helped me in developing relevant connections. Therefore, I am releasing these templates in both free and paid versions. If you are looking for a no-code which offers flexibility and aesthetics, I believe this would surely help.\n\n**My own personal website using this template** \\- [https://ramandutt.super.site/](https://ramandutt.super.site/)\n\n  \n**Some of the features** \\- \n\n1. Notion elements like Tables, Gallery and Toggles make the website interactive and not just static.\n2. Publications are clearly visible and well-categorized.\n3. Explaining your research interests both in brief and detail.\n4. A section to highlight your recent events and news.\n5. A section to showcase your social media (like Twitter) which greatly facilitates networking.\n6. A dedicated section to write blogs and daily journals.\n\n**Website Templates can be found here** \\- [https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4/status/1434854330826436616](https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4/status/1434854330826436616)\n\n**Resume/ CV Templates can be found here** \\- [https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4/status/1434857215098228741](https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4/status/1434857215098228741)\n\nFor any more info or questions, I can be reached [here](https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4).",

          "text": "For me, my website ties up all the information about me from these different platforms and present it in a creative manner. ResearchGate will show your research, campus directory will tell viewers how to reach you etc. Your website is the one place where all this information would be present at once. This makes it very easy for someone who wants to know more about different aspects surrounding you.  \nI am also into blogging and selling digital products so I have given dedicated sections for those as well.",

          "text": "I set up a ePortfolio site with my CV info because it was recommended at my university in there orientation info page, but I don\u2019t really get it either. But I\u2019m used to (in my most recent career) just looking for jobs that are hiring and sending them my resume. No networking or people searching me out. The whole concept is somewhat off putting to me. I am also not on any social media sites as I like to keep my life private. I don\u2019t like the idea of any random person knowing these personal details about me. I have the pages on the ePortfolio site with CV details about when and where I worked at places locked so that they can\u2019t be views without a code. Besides that I\u2019m still not sure if anyone not on the university system can see the pages (In which case is there even a point to it beyond a useless exercise?).",

          "text": "Really the only one on your list that even comes close to a professional webpage is your university staff page, but that gets deleted when you leave so not only do you have to migrate all that content, but you also suffer from people not knowing your new address.\n\nResearchGate only includes your publications afaik (not that anyone actually *wants* to look at that scam site) and your social media is likely more personal and doesn\u2019t give a clear overview of your work.\n\nA professional website is your chance to tell people who you are and what research you do (not just limited to published papers), and you have a permanent web address so people can find your current email address even after you move.",
