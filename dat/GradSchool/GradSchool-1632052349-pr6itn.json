Should I consider applying for some kind of professional certification or a diploma of some kind instead? \n\nThank you for your time/attention.",

Since being in grad school though I\u2019ve found that although not my fave thing, learning research skills would be great application to a tangible and hands on thing. It doesn\u2019t have to be my main goal but I can apply what I get from it to what I really want to do. Depending on your program and school you can hopefully have the flexibility to tailor your education to what you want to do!",

If it helps to propel your career then maybe? If all you want is to study some subject I think you'll find grad school very demanding (time, money, emotionally, etc.) for very little in return.",

If you have a specific thing like the job market is saturated with people with Master's degrees, then yeah it would probably be a good idea because that might be the only way you can be competitive. So if that's the case like in ecology/evolution jobs (my field) then I would say it's a good idea. \n\nAnd yeah the reason I put \"real world\" in quotes was because there's this idea among some people who go to grad school that they're staying in school and that it's somehow not the real world and that they're avoiding something, and I think that's bullshit.",

                      "text": "But... what is your field? You need to be specific.\n\nAs u/KiwiTheKitty said, \"couldn't hurt\" isn't a great reason to go to grad school. I'd argue passion itself possibly isn't a good reason either. You could easily end up hating your passion if you don't like research but are forced to do it as the core of your grad degree.\n\nI was passionate about International Studies, especially things related to Korea. Went to grad school, it wasn't what I wanted and the focus on research made the whole topic hyper specific and boring to me. And it didn't help me get a job because I didn't specifically approach it in a way that had the end goal in mind. \n\nNow I'm in grad school again to upgrade to an MA in Teaching. I still hate it, but I have to get it to get any remotely good paying teacher job. But it is bearable because the end result is to double my pay. And because my specialty is teaching language through content, my final project utilized my International Studies background, which I am still interested in. So because I looked at the final goal as an actual clear cut goal, it doesn't seem like a waste. Although to be honest, if I could have skipped grad school and done some sort of advanced teaching diploma I would have in a heartbeat. Largely because I'm like you. I love learning, but don't like doing original research.",
