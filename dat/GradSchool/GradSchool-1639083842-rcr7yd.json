  "text": "Hello, \n\nI\u2019m in the application process for a few PhD programs. \n\nI\u2019m currently working with a professor on some graduate research as a post-bacc. When I started working with them it was for them to see that I can actually do the research. I thought this would improve my chances of getting into the program with them as my advisor. \n\nI\u2019ve built connections with the PhD students in the lab, I\u2019ve lead research, and am currently working on various projects. \n\nToday I had a meeting with the professor because I was worried about my application (There is a portfolio req. and I am currently working on things to throw in one). Rather than get any type of reassurance or advice they were just reminding me how competitive the program is. And that most students come in with a masters. \n\nThis really bummed me out, I feel like I\u2019m a disadvantage already because of my low GPA but thought I had a chance because I\u2019ve been doing undergrad research and graduate research for while now. \n\nI feel like all the work I\u2019ve been doing for the lab was under the false assumption that this professor wanted me on as a PhD student. \n\nI\u2019m not sure, am I just feeling entitled? This was more of a rant than anything. Thanks for listening :|",

Good chance he might not even be on it. His support may be important for you to be considered in the first place, but your professor probably doesn't have the final say so.",

Most of which played it off as no big deal and that there is more to admission than gpa. I do agree that the research experience itself has been beneficial. I suppose I am just a bit bummed that the professor would bring it up so late and void any sense of encouragement after the work I\u2019ve been doing.

Try to think about it objectively - I don\u2019t know about GPAs because I\u2019m in the UK, but from the sounds of it yours could be higher. That\u2019s one weakness to your application, but you have research experience others with higher GPAs might not have. Add into the mix your extenuating circumstances, I think you might be worrying too much here. Your professor is just pointing out a fact to you in saying these programmes are competitive, because they are. But if you can\u2019t compete on grades then complete on something else, aka your experience. For what it\u2019s worth, I got a very competitive phd scholarship with a 2.1 degree over someone who had a first class degree and a distinction in their masters (mine was pending) and my supervisor has told me several times it was because I had experience that the other candidate didn\u2019t have. So don\u2019t lose heart, you can always try again next year if worst comes to the worst and make sure you get the best GPA you can",

I had undiagnosed ADHD for half of undergrad and a concussion in the other half that, tbh, still messes me up to this day. I still got into a PhD program. I don't know that we're super competitive as a school, but it's vaguely difficult to get into neuropsychology so I really wasn't sure I could hack it. There were only 2 spots in my specific program open and I made it somehow.\n\nI had like a 3.15 gpa or something, but research experience goes a long ass way in making up for it. GRE scores + your personal essay + interview skills as well.\n\nJust because your program prefers people who already have a masters doesn't mean that's the only way to get in. Plus, you have an advantage in that they know you and know your work. They don't need to use your GPA to predict how you'll do, bc they've worked with you. That will hopefully help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway tl;dr you're not entitled and you do still have a chance despite GPA. If my literally brain damaged/clinically MCI self got in even with an ehh GPA when everyone else was coming in with 3.5+, you can do it too. There isn't only one way to get into grad school and you've got a lot of strengths behind you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm on deadlines rn but I do a little bit of like. equity in education type stuff for this one committee, so I have a resource list on getting into grad school that has a bunch of good links. They're tailored to psychology, but there's GRE tips in there + I think resume/CV + I don't remember if we entered the interview tip section yet. I'll copy over the stuff that's relevant in general once I finish my paper, if that's alright. like you don't have to ask but you can tell me not to.\n\nalso edit: ok the MCI got me and I misread the fact it was the prof you work with cautioning you. I think they're probably bad at giving advice for one. I've given one of our RA's similar advice/warnings even though I really do think she would be great for the program and she has a shot, but I followed up with tips and stuff about what I know abt what makes applications good. Maybe they're afraid of getting your hopes up and are trying to make sure you still focus on submitting a strong application and not thinking you don't have to bc they know you. They're still kinda not communicating that well, but that might be where it's coming from.",

You can message/chat it to me if you don\u2019t want to edit your message again or post it as another comment so other may see! \n\nI am also applying to PhDs in psychology so it\u2019ll definitely help! A bit of background, my research is in cognition within virtual environments (video games, serious games, AR, Alternate games, etc). \n\nIt\u2019s weird because in our first conversations the professor was really inclined to bring me on to the program because of my unique experience within cognition/psychology and games. But maybe she\u2019s being realistic in the sense that I should understand that I need more than a unique/beneficial background to get it. \n\nThank you again!",
