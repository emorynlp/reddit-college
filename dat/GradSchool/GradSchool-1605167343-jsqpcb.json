  "title:": "The cult of relationships",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my 3rd year of grad school, working towards the PhD, and I don\u2019t know if anyone else feels this but I have to vent about the cult of relationships. Never in my life have I felt so down and out about being single because almost everyone in my program has a long term partner or is married. I also feel that being in a grad program makes dating seem impossible and if it even is possible then you can\u2019t seem to find someone to fit that right motion of your life/your wants/your schedule/your plans. All of the married grads I know constantly say things like, \u201coh I worked all day and then X made my favorite dinner, it was so great!\u201d Yeah I know relationships can be difficult but that\u2019s not the vibes I get from these people. On top of this they get family housing with the university while us singles get shafted after 2 years. And now with the pandemic it has been completely impossible to meet anyone/even dream about the possibility. Am I alone in this?",

      "text": "In my graduate school class of 28 people, I was one of two single people. Everyone else was married or had a long term partner, like you said. To be honest, I didn't hate it. The vibe I got from my classmates wasn't the vibe you're getting. I felt like their lives revolved around their partners. I would ask someone to get a drink after class or meet up last minute on a weekend to study and their response constantly revolved around \"asking\" their partner, etc. I was actually super turned off that the majority of us were only in our mid twenties and had already lost our sense of spontaneity and to me, they felt \"settled.\" Don't get me wrong- there is nothing wrong with feeling comfortable and settled... but in my twenties, that did NOT appeal to me. I spent long weekends traveling or backpacking with other friends outside of the program, while they were at home taking care of newborns and sleep deprived (again- nothing wrong with this, just not what I wanted at the time, ESPECIALLY in an intense grad program). Now that I am more domesticated living with my partner (4 years out of school), I am even more happy that I spent that decade of my life being selfish and focusing on myself and doing whatever I wanted. My point is- it's not always rosey and nice on the other side.\n\nThe pandemic adds an interesting twist though- I am sure it feels incredibly isolating to even be meeting people right now just seeking friendship. It's always good to try and discover hobbies that aren't as affected by COVID! :) That's helped me a ton these past seven months.",

              "text": "I have never understood the \"just go on a date\" mentality at all.  For all the reasons you stated, finding a potential partner is really effing difficult.  Being a grad student on top of that doesn't help - you're in a different place in life by pursuing higher education.   \n Being a grad student in a relationship is also really difficult - the types of time commitments required of you are hard to manage while juggling someone else in your life (unless they're somehow, miraculously, also a grad student like you, but honestly even then).  \n\nI can agree with the people arguing how much freedom you have as a single grad student - there's no worry about having to decide between or juggle meeting a deadline and spending time with your SO because you haven't seen them in a few days....or arguing over it.  BUT it also means a lack of a close, personal support to keep you sane.  The others go home to their SOs and/or their kids, and you feel like the one person who has no one to go home to or unwind with or just talk deeply to, and it absolutely sucks.  \n\nI'm rambling unhelpfully at this point, but my point is that you're definitely not alone \\[especially in this COVID world\\].  Find some way to build up a support network for yourself.  Reach out to your classmates and friends - at least to fight the mind-numbing feeling of loneliness \\[honestly, even the married ones might be more than a little sick of being around their spouse and kids 24/7 and might welcome a hangout or online movie night or something\\].  And despite what I said earlier, it's definitely possible to meet someone while in grad school.  Sure, COVID kinda makes things difficult, but it's not impossible.  Does your school or department offer any kinds of online events or more casual discussion groups (e.g. through grad student organizations or the like)?",

I did appreciate the opportunity to learn about other cultures, though, and I tried to make some effort to talk to them after class, so I was able to make some friends with the foreign students anyway.  Often times they tend to be clique-y because they're feeling just as ostracized by a foreign culture.  I don't think the size of the city makes a huge difference - I was in a major city and still experienced the same thing.\nI admittedly gave up on the relationship aspect - I had too much baggage from a previous relationship, and masters programs are too short anyway, after which everyone scatters.  I was just looking for camaraderie and support.  I don't think you can really have a relationship if you can't take care of the first part first, anyhow.",

      "text": "Maybe I\u2019m missing your point here but it sounds like you are lonely and bitter and jealous of people\u2019s relationships so you are calling it a cult because those people dare to talk about their relationships around single people? I just can\u2019t believe how much people who are unhappy hate seeing other people happy. You\u2019re bitching that people dare talk about their personal lives around you and it bothers you that they have the love and support of their partners while you don\u2019t? I understand feeling lonely, believe me I\u2019ve been there for most of my program, but I have NEVER in my life looked at my peers being happy as somehow an attack on me.",

However, I'm the happiest being single that I've ever been! I don't have time or emotional energy to devote to a dude right now and I'm good at spending time with myself. It kind of sucks to be the odd wheel when hanging out with people, but I think it's weird when people can't go anywhere without their SO.\n\nProbably the biggest thing for me is I don't fit in well with the culture of my city. I live in a small city in the Northeast that's super outdoorsy and a little crunchy and while I enjoy it alright, I've pledged to myself to never live in a city with less than a million people in the metro area again. But the thing is, most people out of college here want to *stay* here and will get super defensive even if I'm trying to be nice about it, like \"yeah this city isn't really my style.\" I'm also tired of being asked to go on hikes for first, second, third, etc dates. That's great for some girl but that girl isn't me. \n\nPlus, looking back at my relationships before, it's never really been worth it when I've forced it. All the times I've looked for love, I ended up unhappy and I've gotten to the point where I'm like it'll happen when it happens and I just don't care right now. I have bigger goals in life.",

Its nice to have someone to lean on when school gets hard, but when you're in a long term relationship with someone who is doing their PhD, it can be an extremely isolating experience. When my husband was in grad school, we moved to a new country, no friends, no kids, no support system. He's outgoing so he made friends in school very quickly, but no such luck for me. He worked a lot (as is the case for all PhD students), so I was home by myself (no job too!) all day with not very much to do. We actually know a few couples who ended up getting a divorce because of the pressures of grad school. Its hard when you're expected to put in 100% at work and have nothing left in the tank when you get home, where you're also expected to put in something.",
