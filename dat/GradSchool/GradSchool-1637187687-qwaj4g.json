  "text": "Currently enrolled in a multidisciplinary graduate program that is comprised of \\~10+ different labs that all have wildly different expectations in terms of quality of work, time to completion, etc.\n\nI just have been delayed in my thesis defense citing some reworking of 1-2 chapters (which wasn't necessarily surprising), but it's disheartening to look at other research projects that were significantly smaller in scope, less complex, etc., but have been granted the same degree.\n\nJust curious if I'm alone in this, or if this is somewhat common. If so, how did you justify your extra work (and years) and cope?",

      "text": "Yup. I just realized that despite most of my cohort already finishing, there are still multiple people in my sub-discipline in cohorts ahead of me that haven't finished and that I am going to finish well within the average of my subfield. And honestly, the rest of my cohort graduated into a pandemic, and I got to keep great health insurance, remote work, and didn't have to move during a pandemic.",
