  "text": "Your relatives at thanksgiving asking you why you are not making friends in grad school have obviously never dealt with the homework, research, classes, and stress that is grad school. Like, when would i even have time for other people? Y'all are lucky I even came home for the short break lol.",

Plus, this cohort of friends could be your network in the future - you never know when you might need a hand with something or to form a partnership. Your workload is never ending but your opportunity to make friends who are as passionate about stuff as you are will be over before you know it. \u270c\ud83c\udffb",
