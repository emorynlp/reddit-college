  "text": "There were so many points in the last six years that I thought I would never make it. Just this Monday I almost quit. I finished my slides for my defense with maybe 20 minutes to spare after being up for over 24hrs. \n\nAnd the talk went great! A bunch of arachnologists from around the world joined in, and my committee didnt have any tough questions. Expecting some minor rewrites on my dissertation, but, hell, I'm a doctor now.",
