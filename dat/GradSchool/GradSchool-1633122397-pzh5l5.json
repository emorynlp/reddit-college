I do sometimes feel like I'm being arrogant or something, but I wouldn't ever say that to classmates. So I don't think it's bad to be confident and know that you are rocking it in your program!",

It goes a little something like this: \n\nLive your best self! If you know it, then you know it. \ud83d\ude06 \n\nThis does not mean you belittle others though. Help others that know less than you. Don\u2019t dumb yourself down when you\u2019re with others that may have less than you\u2026just to fit in. \n\nNot having imposter syndrome in my opinion is just being your best self, allowing yourself to be passionate about your craft, even if you don\u2019t know all of it or if you\u2019re not the \u201cbest\u201d. You are willing to learn and you are comfortable with failing because you know that after failures, you grow and be better.",

I wouldn't say I'm better than them except at certain skill sets which are my particular area of expertise however they have their own skill sets and knowledge. But good God, if I listened to them I'd truly believe that our PI is Satan incarnate. I don't know how they even have time to do all the shit talking they do, especially if they're really as busy and overworked as they claim to be. It honestly feels extremely high school at times, particularly with the other women who talk about their weight often (they're very thin, bordering medically underweight- their words, not mine), and also going on about ohhhh so and so was flirting with me, ewwww etc. etc. Not that I'm particularly friends with my boss, but he has never made me feel like I took crazy pills or stepped into a time machine and ended up back in 6th grade. So yeah, they're smart and capable, just maybe not mature or emotionally intelligent enough to handle our department.",

And if I currently don't have the skills I have the capacity to one day get there.\n\nObviously I'm not good at many things but I don't consider that imposter syndrome. It's not imposter syndrome when you just actually suck at something but you can acknowledge it and work on it to get better. \n\nI actually frequently have the very opposite experience of imposter syndrome where people would first meet me and immediately assume that I'm not good at the things that are literally my best strengths. Like I can see the bias they harbor and how they immediately underestimate me from the start, which as I've learned can often work in my favor. Their mistake really. \n\nAlso the older I get the less I care for people's opinions, which helps.",

Of course not, but that's why I'm in school. A lot of it is because there's a culture of communicating in my department and program and because my lab and advisor are great. If I had a shitty advisor and an overly competitive program, I don't know if I'd feel the same way.",

I have had a few moments where it just hit me, \"woah, I'm actually here, in grad school, being a grad student like the other grad students, that's wild!\" but it wasn't that I felt like an imposter, just that I was marveling at how far I've come. \n\nI think the fact that I don't feel like an imposter is because I'm just generally more grounded and confident in myself as a person. I'm not plagued as much by the what ifs and incompetence I felt during my undergrad and first few years working. I was out of school for almost 6 years before starting a masters this year, and I grew up a lot during that time. I know what I'm good at and bad at, I'm better at accepting criticism, and I don't feel like I need the friendship of the other students, I'm more ok with it if they don't like me. Now, to some extent I still fight against those negative impulses, I still have periods of nervousness about a project or worry about building good relationships, but they don't drive me like they used to.",
