  "title:": "How many LORs is too many (per prof)?",
  "text": "I'm applying to six different Canadian schools (MA and MI programs) and I'm going to be asking my potential referees for LORs next week. How many is a reasonable number to expect one person to write? Do profs change the content much from school to school? Or is it normal to ask a prof to write 6 (possibly slightly different) letters? \n\nI know it's their job to do these things, but I feel like such a burden. (Most of the schools I am applying to expect 3 LORs, if you were wondering)",

My writers didn't have a problem with 4, but your writers aren't my writers.",

      "text": "I generally customize for each school, and most schools in my field have questions outside of just submitting a letter. \n\nThat said, I usually am fine with 6-10 schools for a given student, assuming they're for the same type of program so the customization needed in the letter isn't too intensive.\n\nMore than that, and I usually have a discussion with the student about how many schools they can reasonably apply for and why they're applying to so many.",
