  "text": "So far my labmate and I have just been naming them stuff like \u201cPilot study 1\u201d, \u201cPilot Study 2\u201d, \u201cBig experiment\u201d, etc. It worked out at first when we only had a couple experiments going, but now it\u2019s getting confusing. Anyone have a system for naming their experiments?",

      "text": "I'm in the social sciences so our experiments and projects are different, but in general my naming format is unique name \\_ task \\_ date. So for example, if I am writing a paper on social media and election turnout, it would be something like SMElections\\_coding\\_10.23.21. That way, I can easily group all of my specific tasks and documents for that one project into the same folder.\n\nWhatever method you choose, I would at least give each experiment a unique name. \"I'll remember it later\" is one of the biggest lies we tell ourselves lol",

      "text": "For my postdoc we would name the project - it would have a theme - and all the experiments would fit that theme. Sometimes we would go with an oceanic theme - like Pacific or Pisces - and name experiments after tropical fish. Other times it would be celestial and things would be named based on the mountains of mars or moons of Jupiter - so Europa #1-3, Callisto #1-5, etc. We really didn't get too imaginative after that. The point is you immediately know what the experiment is related to by the project name, and experiment names mostly let us distinguish between specific experiments and replicates.  Always made sure the #1 experiment had the full rationale written out - saved me a lot of time when preparing for lab meetings and publications. Separate lab notebooks for projects can help too.",

Keep the details in long form in your notebook where you have plenty of room to describe what you're doing, and just use the data file names to tell you where your notes on the experiment can be found. This system has saved me a lot of trouble over the years,  and its adaptable to basically any software system you're using to save files.",
