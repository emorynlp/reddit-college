  "text": "It\u2019s my first semester in my schools graduate program for aerospace engineering. We are only allowed 2 C\u2019s\u2026 I used those 2 C\u2019s already in 2 classes. I\u2019m just disappointed because I thought I did so well in the last exams and thought I understood everything so well but I guess not. No idea what\u2019s going to happen when I try to request a meeting (again for the third time of asking) about my future.",

      "text": "Like someone else said, getting C's in grad school is equivalent to failing because usually programs have a GPA requirement of 3.0 each semester. Your profs know that, so they must have given you these grades with care (most graduate profs do their best to give most students at least a B in consideration of the program requirements). Don't be hard on yourself, bc grad school is tough, but definitely ask your professors how they felt about your performance--ask them if they saw any clear pitfalls you made during the semester. They should have some opinion, if they were willing to give you a C. Next semester, be sure to go to office hours early and often, pretty much once a week. Also study textbooks ahead of each lecture, and ALWAYS do psets with other students in the class.",

I\u2019m a first year student and a lot of second years in my program have told me that the first year is way harder and not as exciting as we have to learn all the fundamental knowledge to build on. I\u2019m doing ok in my program but definitely struggling mentally to get through - I feel so clueless all the time \ud83d\ude05. Good luck fellow baby grad \ud83d\udda4",

Some are currently talking about how a prof hasn\u2019t graded anything until the end of the semester which is technically today.",

      "text": "Grad school isn't easy. Depending in the type of program you're in, it can be like drinking from a fire hose sometimes, and you often feel like you're just doing work just to do it and not really understanding it.\n\n\nOther times you'll have a class that you breeze right through. I wouldn't look at you any different because of your grades thus far. I would also bet it's difficult to go through an entire program with no setbacks or significant emotional events.\n\n\nThere are many pieces of advice each of us could give, but I'll simply say this: you made it this far, so you obviously belong. Don't forget that and use the same work ethic and desire to get better at your discipline to find what works for you.",
