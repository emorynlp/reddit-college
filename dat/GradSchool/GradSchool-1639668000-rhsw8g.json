  "title:": "How can I be more competitive for Biostat MS?",
  "text": "I graduated with a Neurobiology B.S from a top state school (gpa 3.5). But my last 2 semesters I had to withdraw due to health reasons. I have since taken some public health classes and math classes online (diff eq, linear algebra). Got A\u2019s in everything so far and I think it shows I am improving academically. I plan on taking probability, a statistics course and a modeling course next year. I have no research experience and I currently have a job that uses SQL from time to time. I am not sure where I stand as a candidate for a Biostats MS. How can I make myself more competitive?",

      "text": "For most biostats MS, you will have to pay for tuition and might not have a chance to get a stipend from TA or research. (Depends on the university and how much funding they have available.) So, the MS programs are not *that* difficult to get accepted to, at least compared to PhD. From the info you gave, it sounds like you are already competitive. Make sure to keep getting A\u2019s in your stats/math courses. You can put class projects on your resume too. Good luck!",

              "text": "No, I don\u2019t think so! It\u2019s unusual for undergrads to get real research experience anyway. If you have class projects where you have a dataset, explore it, analyze it, produce figures, and write up results, that will be great. Especially if you can get comfortable in R or maybe SAS. Also, I think your job sounds pretty legit, and that\u2019s an advantage too.",

Good grades there will help you get in but you will be at a considerable disadvantage. You need to know how to program in either SAS or R. Beyond that, good grades in linear algebra and calculus will help as well.",

              "text": "You should check with the programs you are applying to if they use mostly R or SAS. The two languages are pretty different. My current program is entirely in SAS- I do everything in R regardless but I did run into some issues with replicating SAS results.\n\nYou want to be familiar with the basic tests and how R handles regression modeling. Manipulating data frames and matrices is key as well. A key skill is understanding how to create figures. The basic tools are pretty straightforward, but for advanced figures you will want to use the ggplot package, which has a bit of a learning curve.",
