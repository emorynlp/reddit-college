  "text": "We spent three months out of the lab. At the start of the quarantine, my boss was all \"Everyone should do whatever they need to do to feel and stay safe\". And as we went back to work and things edged on...It has become \"Get back to normal.\" Actually, not even \"get back to normal.\" More like \"Make up the time you've lost.\" My PI is generally a good mentor and a reasonable boss, but the pressure he's putting on us right now to be productive is even more when things are normal. And things AREN'T NORMAL.\n\nWe've had two COVID positives in our lab of 12 already. All of us put into 2 week quarantines twice already during the not even three months we've been back at work. We're about to bring undergrads back into the lab from a university population that's trending over 5% positive for asymptomatic individuals. We're in a city and at a university who is doing as little as possible, generally shoving their heads in the sand as a way to deal with this pandemic.\n\nMy anxiety is extremely high. Everyone's is. And that's because this is not normal. We can't get back to normal because this is NOT NORMAL. I know everyone is tired of the regulations and the distancing but at least where I live, this is the worst it's ever been. So forgive me if my productivity level is a little low and I'm not going to be able to \"make up\" the three months I've lost. Forgive me if I'm not \"back to max capacity\" by October. I, all of us, just need a little compassion, need someone to acknowledge that this isn't regular life. Because it's not, and I'm so tired of people acting like it should be.\n\n/rant.",

      "text": "Really rough time in the lab right now. You fears and upset are totally valid.\n\nI did notice that you said your PI is usually a good mentor and pretty reasonable; also that they were sick at some point. It seems odd that a generally decent mentor would do something like this. Are they pre-tenure? Is there something happening higher up at the Uni that has your PI concerned? \n\nMy worry is that the Dean or Chair has told faculty at your uni that if they don't meet their publishing and grant requirements that might lose their funding, which would mean that graduate students would lose their funding. We always hope that our faculty will manage to keep uni politics out of the lab, but they are human too. And often prone to fucking up when freaked or stressed out.",

          "text": "I agree, there's definitely something else going on here. My PI has been tenured for a decade and is generally very highly regarded in the department, but it's possible there's some pressure coming from higher up. I'm wondering if he's dealing with the stress of the pandemic by hyper-focusing on work and is passing that on to us. I told him that my mental health was suffering, just to make him aware, and he threw in \"I expect everyone to be back to normal by October\" in his response which isn't like him. Don't get me wrong, he's not a perfect mentor and tends to kind of unpredictably add or remove pressure from the lab, but he's usually a bit more sensitive than this. I am considering bringing it up to him because I'm not sure that he's totally aware of how much pressure he's putting on and how severely it's affecting everyone in the lab right now.",

I'd look at the profiles of current academics to get an idea of what I needed to do. I'd ask visitors if they had any advice, or there was anything they wish they'd known. But all the career advice current academics give is just worthless now. \"Go to conferences\". \"Visit the US twice\". \"Publish your first paper before the end of your first year\". Well, that isn't an option for us anymore, and no one really seems to know what to do about it. \n\nOn a more daily basis everyone is saying that it's okay and that we're not falling behind, but then it's like they remember there's some deadline we were supposed to meet or an assessment piece and suddenly the pandemic doesn't exist and it's all \"why are you so incompetent?\". They're trying to be flexible *within* the system that already exists, and it just isn't working. They're treating this as though it were a short, 1-2 week break that we could (and should) have caught up on. But it isn't 1-2 weeks. It's 6 months. It's ongoing. We haven't caught up because the emergency is still happening.\n\nThe only consolation I've found in all of this is that we're going to be a part of a relatively small group of people who were doing their PhDs during the pandemic. The chunk of people who graduate over the next ~5 years (being very optimistic, I know) will certainly have had a very different PhD experience to the norm. Maybe that means something. Maybe one day this will be an interesting footnote in your Wikipedia page, or something you reminisce over to your kids or grandkids or nieces and nephews. Maybe you'll recount it to future students who are struggling, to demonstrate to them that even if it feels hopeless, there's going to be a path forwards. Maybe it'll help them to know that their professor/boss/mentor struggled once too.",

Have you read anything about Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs in terms of how people are responding to the pandemic? I'ts basically the idea that it's very hard to focus on high level needs (which relate to productivity and self-actualization) when your basic needs (safety) are being threatened. This isn't a \"pick it up and push forward\" situation, this is a situation that taps into ingrained psychological patterns that make it very hard to just pretend it's normal. \n\nEveryone responds to stressful situations differently, and I know that not everyone is as affected by this as I am (my boss included!). But many of us are, including most of my coworkers. Saying that everyone can just push through really isn't helpful, because everyone can't. We're doing our best, but it's not simple to just \"achieve normal\" when things are so incredibly off kilter. \n\nTo your last point, I can say with 100% confidence that I will never look back on this hellish year and wish that I had been more productive, because I understand that the world and my city are in a dark place right now and I'm willing to meet myself where I'm at instead of beating myself up about not forcing myself to work past my capacity and ending up in a mental health breakdown that would have affected me for years to come. Not everybody is like that, and it's fine, but it's also okay to be struggling.",

As researchers we are exploring the edges of knowledge and writing papers to tell our colleagues what we find out. An advisor is supposed to mentor their students so they can eventually do their own independent research. It is unfortunate things have become super competitive and paper driven because many societies have decided they don't like funding research unless we're on the brink of war.\n\nAlso there's quite a few pieces of research (e.g. [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carmen_Sandi/publication/264297142_Stress_and_Cognition/links/5b1f5d85458515270fc48b5e/Stress-and-Cognition.pdf)) that show that stress above a certain level negatively impairs cognition and memory formation, which would hamper one's ability to produce great work.",
