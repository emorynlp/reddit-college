  "text": "I need to get this off my chest because I'm so stressed right now and this seems like a somewhat healthy source of catharsis.\n\nI'm taking my written qualifying exam this week (right now). I have 72 hours to answer a bunch of questions from my committee members. I've been stressed about it for months. My partner knew this and decided to go out of town to stay with their parents so they wouldn't be in the way. I had planned on working at home because I share an office at work and a wall with my advisor that I can hear her through very easily when she's in meetings.\n\nSo on Monday I got my exam, and at about the same time I start hearing a bunch of noise from the apartment above me (hammering, metal clanking, drilling, stomping, etc.) I live in Florida and our building was supposed to have storm impact windows installed back in July, but due to a lot of delays they didn't start until last week. So I go down to management to ask if that's what they're doing, and if so how long they'll be in that apartment. They are in fact installing windows, \"but\" they tell me \"they'll only be there a week!\" A week! Great! Only a week! Only the one fucking week I need some fucking quiet! Super! Love it! I'm having such a good time right now!!! They'll be gone by Friday? Oh! Super! How convenient!\n\nI have reached peak stress today. My answers are due at 4 (I got an extension to make up for some classes I had to attend). I have notes for all of my answers so now I'm just writing them up.\n\nI'm sorry this is incoherent. I'm very angry and stressed.\n\nok back to work now!!!\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate everyone's recommendations, however I submitted my test yesterday around 4. What's done is done. I feel so defeated. I'm bummed that I didn't do my best due to extenuating circumstances. Had I known this would have happened I would have booked a study room at my school's library. Frankly I forgot that going out in public was legal again so this option didn't even cross my mind. oh well! onwards",

      "text": "That sounds like a nightmare of the grad school variety, alright. Sorry about your luck!\n\nBecause I am super sensitive to distracting noises, I have invested in noise-canceling headphones. \n\nIf you have any headphones/earbuds at all (and even with \"noise-canceling\" ones), it helps to turn on adjustable background noise. [This noise generator sounds like the beach](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/pebbleBeachNoiseGenerator.php) (don't worry--no fucking seagulls) and it helped me write a paper in noisy environments in the last few days. Find a sound variety you like, and then adjust the frequency sliders until you've drowned out all the noise around you.\n\nI forget that I'm listening to it, and I get into a more productive state.",
