  "text": "I have a really bad problem with self-sabotaging behaviour generally, but it\u2019s becoming a real problem with my PhD. I\u2019m in my 4th year of a (UK) PhD so I should be completely done by the summer, and I have *so* much left to do. I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I have all day to work and don\u2019t, I stay up all night when I don\u2019t need to, I can\u2019t concentrate for very long when I do work. \n\nI just want to get this PhD over and done with, why can\u2019t I do it.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your kind words and suggestions!",

For me the highest priority is forcing myself to sleep at a regular time so I can break the pattern. When I\u2019m not sleeping enough I get too tired during the day to do decent work, or to even force myself to work. I realized it was \u201crevenge procrastination\u201d and a mix of other anxieties keeping me up, so it\u2019s likely to be different for you. But the nice thing is it just takes me a day or two to get back to a regular sleeping schedule. Then I can start to add other strategies one at a time. And then I\u2019m in a little bit of a better place than I was a few days ago and that matters. I might not be as productive as I\u2019d like to be but at least it\u2019s not nothing. Try starting with sleep. Instead of 4am try 2am.",

Be open to working even when you feel bad. It is still possible to do quality work even when our feelings are not cooperating.\n2. If you feel so bad that you cannot work then try to engage with something else that brings you value. Do chores. Catch up on sleep. Make art. But don't avoid everything all at once.\n\nIf you can think of something that helped you overcome avoidance in other areas of your life then you should apply that here. If you are caught in a cycle of avoidance in other areas of your life, then it is probably time to see this as a bigger issue and contact someone who is an expert on avoidance and anxiety.\n\nI feel for you. Grad school is notoriously bad for mental health. I hope you find some relief soon.",

And I used to refuse to validate those emotions, and swept them under the rug; instead, I would focus on the behaviours that were holding me back (eg not starting work till late in the day, stopping early because of lack of motivation) and just bury myself in guilt. Which just led to even less motivation.  \nSomething that helped was acknowledging that there were emotions causing the behaviours (fear of failure was a big one) and accepting them, and focusing less on the behaviours themselves. And then, setting myself little tasks that I felt capable of during that time, and keeping myself accountable by telling other people my intentions.",

Like ask colleagues to do \"online work hours\" if you work from home, go to the office, try setting small goals with your supervisor or even see if they can help you out there. Some supervisors love asking for a 500 things without any consideration of what it means in practice, and that doesn't work for everyone. \n\nMy advice is this, 60% day is so much better than 0% day, small bits done are so much better than no bits done.

      "text": "I'm in this boat a little bit too. \n\n6th year. was doing great until Covid. Got a Fulbright to finish my dissertation, though I was sitting pretty. Travel got canceled. Therefore also didnt get the money.  All my interviews are in a language that i speak OK but not well enough to translate full speed hour long interviews in colloquial Tibetan by myself. Nearly impossible to find a reliable translator of this fairly rare language in the US during covid. Really fucked me. Applied to 5 grants and 30+ jobs last year. Didnt get a single interview. even for ones outside of academia. \n\nI've started to pull myself out of it a little. Here's what worked a little\n\nI really lost steam because (i know this will sound cheesy and performative) during covid i was so isolated and felt so selfish and self-centered. I taught in Tibet for 3 years before starting my phd and whenever things got rough during the fist years of my phd i could look at the pictures of my students and remember easily why i wanted to do a phd and my inspiration for doing so. Those kids had lives 10x harder than mine and worked their fucking asses off. They'd stay up all night in the stinky bathroom to study because its where the only light in school was after hours! Surely i could work hard enough to succeed, right!?\n\nBut covid cut me off from them, from the place, from my data, interpreters, purpose, everything. And everything was *there.* i dont really like living in the US, so being stuck at home was doubly bad. \n\nWhat's been working is simply digging deep to remind myself of the reasons I want to get a phd and finish this. I still truly want to understand how minoritized students get fucked in mainstream school and it's still important to me. Reading inspiration biographies of great tibetan saints has been very helpful in this regard! \n\nAnd the second thing thats been working is to break everything into *super* bite-sized chunks. The more desperate we get to finish, the more we want to just crush the thing in a single afternoon, the more overwhelming it seems. You aint gonna finish your dissertation by tomorrow. But i bet you can write one chunk of one argument of one section of one chapter by tomorrow. Rather than trying to get it all perfect on round 1, ive literally just started writing what i think is true. I'll deal with cleaning it up later. \n\nGood luck out there!",

Try to jump back in with a manageable set of small to-do list type items, just little things you can check off a list to feel some accomplishments. You'd be surprised how little things can add up, and once you're on a roll just go with it.\n\nThis too shall pass -- just try to do a little bit each day, and if you can do a little more than the last day, great. But at a certain point you'll realize you're just spent. That's when you take a day off, recuperate, and start small again. Repeat.",

              "text": "Dude I've seen plenty of memes with exactly what you're talking about\n\nIt's the dad meme (\"are ya winnin son?\") but instead of the kid at the computer the kid is on the ground saying \"I literally do nothing all day but I'm still somehow tired and burned out\"\n\nThis is fundamentally just a fact of existence for many people in the millennial-and-younger demographics. We're just worn out \\*from existing\\*. Don't beat yourself up because you're worn out and don't connect it to how productive you are.\n\nMy wife tells me all the time to let the 'fallow' moments (i.e. moments when I'm not feeling super-duper productive) just be fallow moments. Lean into them, and then when you're feeling productive, lean into THAT and just write like crazy. \n\nAnother analogy I have is in trail running. So, running on a track, the elevation never changes. You can figure out a pace that works for you and just jog at that pace until you're done. Running on a trail (i.e. in the woods, for like cross-country running) on the other hand, there's lots of ups and downs. If you try to have a consistent pace, you'll end up working really hard running up hills, and you'll tire yourself out faster. What coaches teach you is to work with the course -- let your pace slow a bit as you're going uphill (since it's harder on your body) and then go faster when you're doing downhill. \n\nThere's no perfect answer, just keep trying your best and be kind to yourself.",

          "text": "This is great advice. OP, i have been in and out of this state since the pandemic started. I went through a semester where i wrote almost nothing and threw all of my waning energy into the online course i was teaching. The spring was slightly better but my progress was extremely disorganized. What finally started working for me was limiting my work expectations to a set amount of time in the morning M-F. I got a summer fellowship that basically forced us to do that in a structured manner, but doing it for just a few weeks made it much more normal. From 9-1 is my work time (often i procrastinate so it turns into 10-1:30, but general timeframe) then i break for lunch. After lunch, if i can get work done i let myself do you, but if not, then that's ok. I take a walk, catch up on emails or trading, do a hobby.  (Actually having a hobby to look forward to in the afternoon after I'm done with work has been great for motivation.)\n\nYou'd be surprised at how much you progress when you commit to working for a few hours each day. Plus if you work every day, it gets easier to gain momentum and get in a zone to keep working in the afternoon. \n\nIn my experience, some days/weeks are better than others for progress. There are weeks when i get 15 pages of writing done with citations and other weeks when all i can do is free write or plan or even just reading. The key is to be kind to yourself.",

If so, I would recommend going to them and telling them that you're having some trouble, but you want some help coming up with a roadmap to get back on track. It's sometimes helpful to have someone else help you chunk up a task this massive into smaller, digestible parts. If you're not comfortable raising these issues to your adviser, reach out to your director of graduate studies to discuss what is going on; they should be able to direct you to resources that can help (ideally, I know graduate student support in academia is generally fucked).\n\nI'd also recommend, if you haven't, that you think about finding a therapist. Avoidant behaviors like the ones that you're describing (procrastination, lack of focus, insomnia or inability to sleep) are far more common among graduate students than the general population, and can also come on for all sorts of reasons. Just like you need support in your work, you also sometimes need support putting together a plan to deal with your mental health.",
