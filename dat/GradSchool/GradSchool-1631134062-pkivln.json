  "text": "I\u2019m currently a masters student and a I found a job that checks so many boxes for what I want to do professionally. They are asking for current references and my advisor would a great one. However, taking the position would mean 1) I'm leaving my advisor's employ a semester early and 2) finishing my masters remotely and adding a couple of months to its completion. What would be the best way to approach my advisor about being a reference and letting him know the situation? Has anyone done this before and what happened? Thanks for your responses.",

Explain why you want the job, what accommodations/changes you need, thank the advisor for their mentorship/ being a reason you were able to secure this job (a bit of cajole but you're asking for a favor after all), and then ask if they could be your reference.",
