  "text": "Planning on going back for my Masters's in economics this year, and am a little concerned about what the job hunt will be like once I got to the end of the program. As a result, I really want to hit the ground running when it comes to networking and was wondering if any of you had advice they could share as to how I should go about it. What are the groups I should look for, who do I need to talk to about internships? Any other insight you could provide would be appreciated.",

Multiple times a week they\u2019ve got webinar invites for informational sessions in a wide variety of fields. It\u2019s a big university too with tons of alumni in powerful positions in various fields. We have access to an alumni directory where if I know a company\u2019s VP went to my school I can just look up their personal email address to talk to them about career options. It\u2019s an unbelievable difference from my undergrad institution.",

      "text": "This is late but I'll weigh in.\n\nI'm a geology major, for reference. Networking is very important. I don't what it's like for economics, but for geology (especially those who are interested in mineral exploration) there is at most three degrees of separation for everyone I meet. \n\nTo give you perspective, I've gone to three or four conferences in the past year. Before that, I really hadn't been to any professional or academic conferences. I had the opportunity but they always conflicted with my schedule. Not this year, though. \n\nI went to the first conference and met a bunch of really great people. After that first conference, I saw a ridiculous number of people that I had met there at the second conference. At the second conference, I met a bunch of other people, and then at the third conference, I saw a bunch of people from the previous two conferences, and *they remembered me*. I'm still looking for employment but I have been pointed towards a lot of companies that are hiring by the people I met. \n\nIf there are professional or academic conferences go to them! Meet people, go to the bar, strike up small talk. Get business cards and even if you only talk to someone for a few minutes, add them on LinkedIn. The worst thing that happens is they don't add you back on LinkedIn or they're \"out of business cards\". \n\nIf there are any professional organizations, join them. If they have mixers or monthly meetings, go to them and meet people. If you join a local organization and there is some sort of regional conference, you are practically guaranteed to meet some of the people from your local org.",
