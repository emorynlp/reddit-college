  "title:": "Any recommendations for international development graduate programs in Europe?",
  "text": "I am from the US, have a bachelors in both French and International Studies, above average student. I've worked in the international non-profit setting for the past three years and am at the top of my career ladder without furthering my education. While there are some Ivy League programs I have my eye on for graduate school, the reality is that I want to focus my career on working internationally and not be in the US. Also, I am financially independent without familial support so whatever I do is on me to pay off, and I'm not keen on paying $60k+ a year again. So, I'm seriously considering applying for grad school in Europe. I know that the US workforce is sometimes resistant to international degrees, plus I would consider getting a PhD later on, so ideally I would be going to a school which would be more well-known to Americans.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for programs or universities I should check out? If you are enrolled, how do you like it? I work in public health (MNH) right now and I could see myself continuing with it, but I have also considered things like anthropology, migration studies, public policy, development studies...I'm really open to suggestions and options! Countries I am considering, in order of preference: Germany, France, Poland, UK.\n\nThank you so much!",

      "text": "Grad school in Europe is generally consecutive, so you'll have to make sure your undergrad qualifies you for a given program. It's generally a lot stricter than in the US, outside of other anglophone countries like the UK. This may be listed on the program's website or you may have to contact a program that interests you to check. Is your goal to live and work in Europe after, then? In that case you'd also have to consider how easy it is to get hired as a non-EU/EEA national in a given field. Right now your list of options is really long and no one can really help you narrow that down (as choosing a field is a very personal thing, especially because grad school is intense), so looking into programs and figuring out what you really want to do is really important.",

          "text": "I know that working in the EU is generally a very difficult objective as an American, and jobs are scarce in that regard. So while I can see myself living in Europe for an extended period of time beyond graduate school, I wouldn't say that it is my objective. In an ideal world I could work remotely and live abroad, but I'm not about that digital nomad blogger life so here we are lol\n\nMy list is pretty long, yeah! In my field I think that having more generalized degrees are common, but it is the experience that comes with obtaining that degree which matter more. So internships, proximity to volunteering opportunities, etc are more important to me than the actual area of focus. Also just crowdsourcing ideas and experiences!",

              "text": "You could potentially take advantage of post-study visas, but some countries are easier to move to a work visa after that than others (on your list, Germany is probably the easiest, if you can get a job offer). Working remotely and living abroad is only legally an option in a handful of countries on a short-term basis. Most digital nomads do so illegally and it's not something I recommend.\n\nGeneralized degrees may be more common in your field, but the whole point of grad school is specialization, so your specific research/field interests actually become very important. If you have to write a thesis, you may be expected to have an idea for a topic as well as a faculty advisor prior to applying and even if the master is internship based, if you want to do a PhD afterward, you'll need to be doing that specialization.",
