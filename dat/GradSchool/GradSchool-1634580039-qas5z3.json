  "text": "I want to apply for a masters program in International Relations, but I\u2019m not sure if I should do so this year or next year.\n\nI\u2019m about 27 credits (9 courses) shy of completing my undergraduate degree in Political Science. I have a 3.8 GPA at my current school and I completed 12 credits (4 courses so far) through this school. Due to a career in a separate field, I was forced to put my studies on hold for about 1.5 years. Now that I\u2019m back on it, I\u2019m doing great, but my GPA at my last school was not high (2.5 GPA). \n\nThe difference in my GPAs is because I feel like I have more time to concentrate on my studies outside of work and I\u2019m not so worried about my finances. Before, I was doing a lot and that led to my grades dropping. I sacrificed my grades to get into my current career and now that I\u2019m about 2.5 years in, I realize that I actually hate my job. \n\nMy job offers an educational leave so I plan to use that to pursue my masters. I have just over a year left at my current position before I can leave and most of the grad school programs begin in September. \n\nI have been thinking this over quite a bit and I just need a fresh perspective or some suggestions on what I should do.",
