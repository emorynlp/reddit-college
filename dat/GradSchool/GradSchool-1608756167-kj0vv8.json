  "title:": "In the most gentlest way possible: No, you are Not too old to start grad school!",
  "text": "ETA: I know that my experiences are purely anecdotal and that many graduate cohorts are different from mine! I wanted to share my experience as one example of age-diverse programs. I also do not mean to offend anyone by my use of \"older\", I couldn't think of a better word unfortunately. Bottom line, any age is a perfectly acceptable age to further one's education. I appreciate everyone's contributions to the post, and thank you so much for the awards! <3\n\nI want to preface this by saying that this is not in response to any one post, rather the plethora of posts I've seen this year about people asking (among several things) if they are \"too old at X age\" to apply for grad school. I'm also definitely not the first to comment or post about this. **TLDR: No, you're not \"too old\". If you want to apply, then apply!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSociety has a funny way of portraying education in a linear, progressive fashion. You graduate high school, get your Bachelor's (or your country's equivalent), get Master's, then PhD/other professional degree if your intended career merits it. Boom, boom, boom, then you become a researcher/professor/etc. and make *all* the money. (*laughs in humanities*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth is that *very few* people actually follow this direct progression in their education. At my undergrad institution, the MA and PhD program of my field has a diverse group of students. There were folks in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, people who already worked full time, people with families. My current institution's PhD program (the one I'm in) is mostly composed of people in their late 20s and 30s. Some are married, some single, some married with kids. Many are international students with MAs from non-US institutions. Students come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. There are only two people, including myself, who went straight to the PhD program from undergrad. We are the *exception*. If anything, older students are in a better position having more life experience, figured out the US tax system, and generally know how to \"adult\" better than younglings like me. Not to mention, older students who have also done a Master's have had the opportunity to better focus their research interests and get a feel for graduate school before jumping into a PhD program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigher education has no age limit. Not one single person will care that a 30, 40, 50+ year old is in their class instead of someone in their 20s. If your age is the only thing holding you back from submitting those apps, take it from this sub: ***submit those applications***.",

You don't have to go to grad school in your 20s, get married, or have babies. Home ownership isn't all it's cracked up to be either. You are the one who has to live your life, so if the American Dream checklist doesn't work for you, don't sweat it.",

Otherwise, I feel much more prepared, matured and wiser entering graduate school in my thirties. Don't regret it at all! As other people in this thread have mentioned, don't let age define what you are set out to do, as long as you reach your academic pursuits/goals at the end. You will feel accomplished with the motivation/dedication and really that's all that matters.",

I do not know anyone else in my cohort who is as young as me when applying for a PhD, neither do I know anyone outside of my academia circle who is doing the same thing. It is not usual for people to do their grad school early. It was just in recent years that there has been an influx of students doing it young because of the opportunities provided by universities. Our government has been ramping up scholarships in recent years so I think that explains the younger age when enrolling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what is the average of of users in Reddit but I'm going to guess it's 15-30. Please keep this in mind when you see postings about grad school applications here. Most of the elder people I know who are doing their Master or PhD do not have any idea what Reddit is.\n\nI thought this quote was fitting of the post here.\n\n\"Do your degree/master/phd, because in a few years, you will get older anyways with or without your qualification.\"",

I know I have to pace myself, start somewhat early and communicate clearly, whereas others rely on a burst of last-minute energy. It's definitely a different vibe. I know I was just like that back then, however in \"my day\" group projects were not a thing so no one knew it but me. ;)",

No one is going to judge you for being older and in my experience, professors appreciate older students because they can bring a lot of maturity and experience (not even research experience, just experience with life, having a long-term job, setting boundaries, acting professional, etc) that the bright-eyed 22 year olds coming straight from undergrad are not going to have. I'm very glad that I had real work experience before starting my program, I don't think most people realize how much of an asset that can be.",

It was a mix of emotions stretching from the  people in my cohort filling me with their youthful energy at times to them just making me feel ancient at other times.\n\nIt's doubtful you'll be the the oldest student on campus, and you'll likely find it a blast to be there.\n\nI'll contradict one thing OP said, not all faculty appreciate older students, especially at the undergrad level. On one hand, some have trouble with being the same age, or younger, than their students. Also, some professors have only known academia, and the broad skillset/experience non-trads bring with them can be intimidating for younger professors. On the other hand, older students can be difficult to manage because they sometimes think their age grants them something. This is especially true at the undergrad level where some courses are set up to keep young people who haven't learned to follow through yet accountable. Then, there is the older student who tries to take over every discussion (\"well, in the real world...\" or \"As a mother/nurse/ranch hand/ vet assistant, I feel...\"). Don't be that person,  and also be flexible and patient. \n\nI enjoyed college much more in my 30s than I did when I was 18.",

But the point is that nobody cares how old you are in grad school, and almost no one is even going to notice.\n\nIf this is something that really bothers you, I don't think it would be difficult to seek out a program that has more students your age.

I have colleagues who taught high school for years, worked in publishing firms, worked in industry, and who completed MAs in non-US institutions. Their experiences and advice have taught and helped me so much already. If anyone else has cool things to add about how older students have enriched their grad school experience, please comment so we can hopefully encourage more people who are worried about age + grad school to apply!",

          "text": "I just finished a master's program in theology, and each of my classes had some older people (60+) auditing the course just for fun. The insights they brought to our discussions was incredible. In one class on Christian history, we had a woman who had been arrested as a teenager at a Dorothy Day rally, and in a class on Christian Ethics a former priest turned psychologist who had been at Selma on Bloody Sunday.  While they weren't formal degree seeking students, they were able to bring so much real life experience to the subject matter.",
