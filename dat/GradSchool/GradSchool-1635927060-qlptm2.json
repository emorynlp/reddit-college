      "text": "Typically, Master's programs in Canada all require either a bachelor's degree (sometimes a 3-years, sometimes 4-years, sometimes in relevant area, sometimes in any academic area) OR a certain amount of undergraduate study plus extensive professional experience. Programs that allow for study plus field experience to serve are typically professional programs geared less to academic inquiry and more to professional practice. \n\nWith all this being said, I don't know of any programs in Early Child Care and Education that allow for this. But this information is clearly stated on the websites for each program under the application process/admissions requirements.",
