  "text": "To be frank I wasn\u2019t ever considering gradschool up until this August, and I have barely a 3.0 gpa so my professor (who is trying to be my graduate faculty mentor) is urging me to take the test seriously. I\u2019m deadset on going to gradschool after graduation this December, but I have no clue what\u2019s est to study or even how the questions look like and my test is next month. Thanks for reading!!!!",

The range is 25th to 75th percentile scores for applicant students\u2026\n\n148-157 verbal\n147-156 Quantitative\n\nMy question is, are these even hard numbers to get? Like the only frame of reference I have for standardized test is SAT obviously, but with these numbers I have no clue what\u2019s the score cap and what\u2019s borderline not grad school potential scores. Like is a 160 like top 75th percentile scorers in the world? Is a 145 average for a gre? Sorry for the long nonsensical kinda question but yeah\u2026",

I don't work for Magoosh of course, but worked in test prep for many years and still direct a nonprofit centered on helping students prepare for grad admissions as well as being university faculty. \n\nDo confirm that the GRE is truly required. More and more programs are going test optional due to (1) demonstrated inequalities perpetuated by standardized tests, and (2) their lack of demonstrated predictive power for success in grad programs.",
