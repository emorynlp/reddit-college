  "text": "That because of school (and in my case work on top of that) you actually are as busy as you say you are and it's almost impossible to make plans.  But no one actually believes your schedule is that crazy until you make plans under duress and then wind up disappointing them because you have to cancel or change the plans.  And only then do they understand how crazy things are timewise right now?\n\nIn particular I have two friends, one of whom has a masters, who have made it clear that my unavailability makes them think I don't like them when I'm just doing everything I can to get through the end of the semester. Also I have a husband who DOESN'T make me feel like that and is very supportive but in terms of making time outside school and work there's one more priority that isn't them.  And now I probably sound like a jerk...",

I haven\u2019t been able to maintain as many close friendships though because of the fact that I do spend a lot of weekends working or just catching up on sleep and self care. Occasionally I get pressured to do stuff by friends and then I end up feeling more stressed because of it.",
