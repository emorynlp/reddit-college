  "title:": "Being a woman in <male-dominated field> is exhausting",
  "text": "My TA evals had two comments: \u201cshe could be more prepped, or could have answered questions with more authority\u201d and \u201cmany of the male students in the class were extremely rude to her causing her to (very understandably) become flustered.\u201d\n\nOkay sure, the first part is fair. It\u2019s hard to prepare daily hour-long material from scratch and have it be interesting/useful. But how do I answer questions with more authority? Is it like, a tone of voice thing? And now I have to be conscientious of that next time I\u2019m in front of a classroom because apparently I don\u2019t answer questions with enough natural authority. \n\nI appreciate the second comment pointing that out. It\u2019s true, there were some guys who were pretty rude, but it didn\u2019t bother me until just now because now I guess it (understandably) bothered a lot of people in the class too. Which is like, okay, cool, now instead of just ignoring people\u2019s bullshit I\u2019ve got to stamp it down. Will I be seen as a bitchy ruthless human being? Hm. \n\nI held office hours, I held extra office hours, I answered emails quickly, and I had decent attendance in my sections. I had students (all girls) ask me if they could meet with me one-on-one for better help understanding the material. (The other TA - who is a really nice guy - wasn\u2019t approached by anyone for that. Oh, also in case you\u2019re curious, my TA evals were lower than his but I\u2019m not taking that personally since he\u2019s objectively more comfortable with the material than I was.)\n\nAnyways. I worked hard to be a decent TA, and my ratings were like, *just* barely over the absolute middle of the scale, cool. I know I shouldn\u2019t take this as a lesson to not give a fuck about helping my students later - I mean, why teach just for the evals?, but, well, it\u2019s tough to realize that I can\u2019t ignore my gender when I teach. Now I\u2019ve got to teach and be more authoritative and get male students to respect me, or at least shut up?? Of course, maybe a male version of exactly me would have still gotten those comments. Regardless, this story is the tamest of gender-related stories in my field (if even), and I\u2019m afraid of my existence as a woman becoming more difficult and putting me in more objectively unfair situations if I stick with academia. It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m tired. I wish I were stronger and better. ",

      "text": "Teaching evaluations of females are lower on average. Students are just as biased as the rest of the population. I am pretty sure that some voice and body language exercises could \"help\" you, but it has such a bitter taste to it to tell a female she should, in essence, act more masculine. Authority should not have any place in science. What these guys apparently need is not a TA, but somebody teaching them respect, as the parents failed in this regard.",

      "text": "I would recommend practicing your lecture before hand. I would say this for anyone that becomes flustered. Just a run through once before can be enough to know what you\u2019re going to say and how. \n\nI actually have only taught labs and did 15-20 minute lectures at most, so a full lecture would probably need more time. \n\nI personally tried to walk that line between friendly and approachable - made small talk before class started, and tried to be a little personal, like remembering who had a dog or similar (but nothing controversial) - and firm when being disrespected and demanded attention *during* class (especially while I lectured). I only had a student or two end up complaining about me as a result, and when I defended myself or told someone to pay attention in class, or even (sadly) to stop bullying someone I had the respect of *their* peers, so they would listen. \n\nI went out of my way to quickly learn everyone\u2019s names as well, and I tried to pinpoint what each student struggled in to offer them more personalized advice during their lab section. \n\nWhen I was an undergraduate, TAs that approached *me* like this I really appreciated, which is why I took this approach myself. \n\nThere are other stances as well, such as being distant and firm without any friendliness. You will garner respect, but as a woman, it usually comes with a reputation of being a \u201cb-tch.\u201d And then being *too* nice also makes people question your competence. It\u2019s ridiculous, but I know all to well what you\u2019re describing and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re imagining anything. It\u2019s a very real subconscious bias most people carry, and walking the line between these two things are difficult to identify and then do. ",

She\u2019s a prominent member of the 500 Women in Science movement (which is now far greater than 500). The talk focused on gender biases in STEM, and was fantastic. \n\nAll this is to say that her social media and publications are a good exposure for foggy old men in research, and does a great job of introducing gender discrimination to male students in a positive and engaging way. I think you\u2019d be interested! She\u2019s still one of my favorite follows. (I\u2019m also applying to her department, though a different focus. Her influence was a decent part of my decision to apply).\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m sure many students developed a respect for your efforts and pursuit of success in teaching. Don\u2019t let it go, and don\u2019t let some less-open members of my gender group make you second guess your worth and role in academia.\n\n\u270a",

      "text": "There's one prof whose lecture I sat in on, and she exudes authority. I had a whole class to analyze how she did it.\n\n1. Body language. She did what you're not supposed to do, which is used closed off body language. She crossed her arms, leaned against furniture and crossed her legs, held her head just a tad higher than she needed to, and kept her face tense. This plus her soft but clear tone of voice just didn't brook any disrespect. She was occasionally funny and she was kind, but she was the kind of professor you would be scared to mouth off to. The energy in the class was palpably deferential. Think McGonagal.\n\n2. Looks -- she had a buzz cut, and while she wore dresses, they were plain, dark colored, and draped well. Think MM LaFleur's line of dresses. She wore boots very often. \n\n3. Student interaction -- she called on students by name if participation wasn't going well. She had every moment of the lecture planned, and she made students interact.\n\n4. She made her preferences requirements. If she preferred an essay to be organized a certain way, it was a requirement. She had an off-limits topic list. She made the class bearable for herself by simply forcing them to not do the things she wanted. She had required office hours for essay revisions. If there was a requirement for a paper and you didn't do it, she wouldn't accept it.\n\nMale professors and lecturers have authority just by walking into the room. Women have to magic it up. That's just how it works :(. \n\nI do things slightly differently. I'm still very new to teaching, and my first semester I had horrible authority problems. I threw out all the funny or personable touches on my syllabus, wrote in a very harsh late policy, and came right out of the gate on syllabus day hammering hard the no late policy and the plagiarism policy. \n\nThen I relaxed a little and made my clear nerdiness my appeal to authority. If I joke about how much I love grammar and go into little side rants about the literature and theory I enjoy, it intimidates them a little bit. I wear a carefully curated wardrobe, lots of blacks and mostly neutrals. I don't wear anything that reads feminine. I have huge tortoiseshell glasses and over-sized sweaters. I chug coffee while lecturing. I work hard to make the impression that I very qualified for this job even when I feel like an idiot. \n\nIt's going better than last semester, but I still have some work to do. ",

      "text": "Authority can literally be the timbre of your voice. Decades ago, at the very beginning of  my teaching career,  I was monitoring the students loading onto the buses. One of the drivers, an 85lb petite woman, was struggling to get her passengers settled so she could drive away. She kept asking them to be seated in a verrrry soprano. I stepped aboard, dropped my voice an octave below my usual range, and bellowed a single word-\"SIT\". The bus rocked on its springs from all of the fannies hitting the seats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not going to manage a basso profundo but if your voice creeps up a half an octave when you are hesitant and unsure, it, your voice is giving you away. With practice, these tells can be masked and you can stop giving yourself away. If this is the career that you are committed to, an afternoon or two with a voice coach might not be money thrown away.",

You can imagine the falling look on the scout leaders faces when a girl met them at their van with a \"Hi, I'm your island mate counselor for the week!\" However, I quickly turned that around when undoubtably a snake would make an appearance on a tour of the base and island, resulting in me jumping in there and catching it even if the male counselors would run the other way. This turned their negativity into respect, and I would get stellar reviews by the end of the week.\n\nEven though it sucks that you have to work harder, go find that snake and catch it. \n\nAlso, the fact that I often didn't take my sunglasses off until the last day or so might have aided in the intimidation factor, but I don't recommend that ploy for the classroom.

The end of the semester evals went something along the lines of \"I dont think she knows the material.\" \n\n\nThe one thing I learned about those types of students who try to reduce you by questioning you just to degrade you, and try to break down your confidence are students who are the lazy students, and may not even be smart enough to pass the course. So they are looking for someone to blame for their inevitable failure of the class. \n\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that most, if not all, of those students never make it past their freshmen year. \n",

But our behavior can reflect subconsciously biased attitudes, and that is a problem, especially because teaching people to let go of subconscious bias is very difficult. Often, when someone is confronted with information that suggests that they subconsciously hold negative attitudes towards someone because of gender/race/etc., their first response is to get defensive: \"I'm not sexist, why are you trying to make this my fault?\" And nobody said that you were sexist. But a great many people hold particular views about what \"authority\" looks like, who belongs in academia, what a \"real\" professor should be, and these are beliefs that typically harm non-white and non-male teachers. There are some informative articles linked in different comments throughout this thread that indicate that there are systemic biases at work in academia. Read them.\n\nAddressing individual behavior is not enough.",

If it doesn't work, invite them to leave the class and come back next week and give them a zero for the session.  ",

I used to be a Lecturer and found that it wasn't until the 3rd or 4th time I taught a course that I felt comfortable.  As in, I knew the material well but also knew the common student questions and how to tailor my answers more individually.  But even then I still felt nervous at times.  For some of us, that feeling of worry self doubt just shrinks a bit and doesn't entirely go away (yay imposter syndrome!).\n\nBeing in a gender-skewed field can be tough.  I had originally planned to be a grade school teacher, but as a man it was hard being in all female groups and dealing with the jokes of how men can't raise children or how i felt my opinions were treated as less important.  While I eventually changed majors in undergrad for other reasons, it helped to talk with the few other male education majors and have a support group to vent too and work things out with.\n\nI'm now in a computer science PhD program and know there are woman support groups.  Maybe reach out to one in your field or join one in a similiar field or even one in CS.  Anecdotally, the CS women's groups I've met are friendly to non-cs students.",

I'm actually not in a male-dominated field but I TA for a required course and teach an intro to gender course as the instructor of record. I generally have a few students who are men who try to mess with me. For example, I've had a couple over the years ask me out in front of the class as a clear way to fluster me, as you've said. I get a couple of evaluations that say I'm \"intimidating.\"\n\nThe truth is, I am a little bit intimidating on purpose, so it definitely doesn't bother me. I am kind and I am sympathetic to them, but I don't let them mess with me. I set boundaries and I stick to them. I turn around a lot of their trying to fluster me on them by asking a lot of whys or for them to explain what they mean.\n\nMy advice is to take the constructive from the evaluations, and fuck the rest. I put all my nice evaluations on a document and that's what I focus on. Do what feels comfortable for you and find your own groove. Don't be more authoritative if that's not who you are. Be honest with them. Tell those students that their behavior is not appropriate and is disrupting other student's learning. Your job is to teach the students, not to please them.",

The older student likely sees themselves at more of a similar time of life thus 'peer' and yet respects your expertise and dedication.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite math teachers who taught me a lot is about a decade younger than I am.  I think very highly of her both as an educator and as a mathematician, but it is occasionally a little odd to talk socially and remember she's that much younger. Most mature students learn to handle the cognitive dissonance pretty quickly.",

You don't need to prove to anyone that you have the knowledge, you're already in the front of the classroom. You have already proven it to all the right people, if your students don't recognize that then they're missing out on valuable information that could help them, and they'll learn over time who knows what they're talking about and who doesn't. \nAnd again, if they're the same age or older, they probably are an expert in another field or aspect of life. You give them new knowledge, but they understand (often) what it means to have expert knowledge and how to get there. \nIt's super frustrating to have people questioning your authority in a classroom, and obviously I'm not in the room with you, but in most situations I've experienced like this the teacher is afraid of losing authority and gets defensive, when they could embrace those people who see themselves as peers and teach them better by speaking to them as equals. Because we are all equals. While they're near the questioning authority line, they haven't crossed it, and their minds won't be changed by brute force or arguing. ",

They are in a class to learn from my expertise in a subject. And if I were learning from them I would be doing the same - I would recognise that they know more than me and that we are on uneven ground. I agree that we're equals in the sense that we're all human and we all have our separate strengths, but in this particular case, we are not equals, and maybe that power imbalance is unfair, but it exists. \n\nI likewise understand that, ultimately, whether or not the respect my expertise is irrelevant: if they choose not to listen to me, to not learn from me and to fail their exams and not be able to continue on with the program then it is their fault and their responsibility but it's to nobody's detriment but their own. But that's not the point of this thread, nor was it the point of any of my comments. The point was that it's frustrating to be continually challenged and undermined in the classroom and to feel like it's because of factors outside your control - such as gender, as in this particular case, though race and age can also, obviously be a factor. \n\nIt's frustrating because it's like a tiny little needle-prick every time I say something definitive and a student responds \"Well I guess we'll never know!\" When we do know. Because I've told them. It's frustrating when a student begins a rudimentary question (that we've already covered multiple times in class) with \"I'm not sure if you'll be able to answer this, but...\" It's the pervasive sense that no matter what I do, no matter how many times I say it, no matter how I say it that they will not believe me because they don't fully believe that I know what I'm talking about.

I personally always find it more pleasant to talk to someone who\u2019s attractive, or well-kept, even if they are not of the sex I\u2019m attracted to.\n\nI\u2019m not here to say sexism doesn\u2019t exist, because it does, and always will (be it favor male or female), but maybe it\u2019s not so good of an idea to always blame situations like this for sexism. It\u2019s so convenient that it became clich\u00e9. We are all a bunch of people with postgraduate education; surely we are all aware that social phenomena like the one you mentioned are much more sophisticated than just sexism?",

So why should anyone trust your experience in determining what is or isn't sexism, given that you've never been on the receiving end?\n\nBlaming \"victimhood mentality\" attempts to put the whole burden for the experience of sexism on the people who experience it. This is extraordinarily ignorant and, frankly, shitty of you.\n\n\"What if the same happened if you were a male\" - the question is: does it? OP, and other women responding in this thread, are suggesting that there are systemic and structural issues at play here that mean that women experience this at a much higher rate than men do. Individual behavior cannot solve systemic problems.",

Do you also think that just because a person is white and male, he must be privileged?\n\nThe answer to the question is: it does. Because there are many other factors that can come into play. A simple one could be racism. If the OP were a black male and the undergrad were a white male, then in the scenario that the students were racist, they could favor the younger undergrad because of his race.",

                              "text": "There are two major forms of discrimination - personal and systemic. Men can and do experience personal bias in many respects. But it is very, very rare for men to be the victims of systemic bias in academia. Look up the case of Dr. Ben Barres for an interesting example - Barres was a trans man who, once he began presenting as a man, was seen as being much more competent. Nothing changed about his research; only his outward gender presentation was different, and yet he was told that his research was better than his sister's (\"his sister\" being him pre-transition). Why are you so invested in convincing the OP of this thread that the problems she has experienced are not due to student bias?\n\nI don't think you really understand what \"privilege\" in this context means. But I'll give you the definition I'm using: \"privilege is when you never need to ask if your gender/race/sexuality/class is causing people to perceive you negatively, for reasons beyond your control.\" And having talked with many faculty and TAs, both men and women, I can tell you that I have heard extremely believable anecdotes about experiencing sexism from probably 80% of the women I've spoken to, who range in age from mid 20s to 60s. This is true of women who have been teaching for decades. A professor I worked with last quarter has been at the same institution for 40 years and said that she does not feel the situation has gotten any better since she first started teaching.\n\nMy program has many people who are concerned with fairness and equitable treatment, so it's common for TAs to talk about this with each other. And quite consistently, male TAs (approx age range of mid 20s-50s) say that they have never experienced the forms of doubt, dismissal, and even hostility that is commonplace for many women in the program.\n\nAnd it's true that other identities can equally cause people to be falsely perceived as less competent than their peers, I never denied that. The excellent article [\"Women of Color in the Academy: Where's Our Authority in the Classroom?\"](https://gws.arizona.edu/sites/gws.arizona.edu/files/Women%20of%20Color%20in%20the%20Academy.pdf) addresses exactly this. But the influence of race does not in any way take away from the influence of gender in academia.",
