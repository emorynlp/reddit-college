  "text": "Anyone else facing heavy drug consumption/abuse during grad school ? Does it harm you ? Does it help you ?  On my case I\u2019ve been consuming weed almost daily during my almost 2 years of PhD , and I\u2019m afraid I might have been sluggish , stupid , lazy & unconcerned due to this drug and my level of consumptions . My drug intake increases when approaching deadlines and I have pulled out some miracles during doing high af all nighters , but at what cost I wonder .\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your comments <3\nI did not expect such positive vibes and so many personal experiences . Really great full ! \nI want to mention that I also consume pills for ADHD and anxiolytics, so THC might be getting rough with those guys over there :)",

During the beginning of the pandemic, I started drinking a lot more and had to intentionally cut down because being hungover in the morning and starting to crave a drink around lunch was affecting my work. \n\nNow, I sometimes have some weed or a drink if I'm working late, specifically when writing. If it gets the point where I have cravings during the day again, I'll stop. I don't think it makes me perform my best intellectually, but sometimes it's just a case of mediocre work being better than no work. \n\nBut everyone's different. I guess if you think you may be consuming too much or too often, you might be. Do you feel like you can cut down? Would anything get worse if you did?",

      "text": "After pretty heavy use in college, I smoked pot every day for about 2.5 years of my PhD - primarily for anxiety relief, because I hated the side effects of SSRIs. That mind sluggishness that comes the day after smoking a shitlload REALLY helped with my racing thoughts and hyperactive brain. I also smoked for relaxation and to cope with the daily struggle of PhD life (it was also a ton of fun initially). It got to the point where it began to severely affect my quality of sleep and mental health, which resulted in my quality of work declining significantly. I stopped smoking and started seeing a therapist bi weekly and psychiatrist, where I was prescribed some new drugs that ended up working better than anything I've ever taken.\n\nApproaching the end of my PhD, I ended up getting a sweet job offer for a national lab in US. After submission and consideration of my SF86  (document for security clearance) post defense, the offer was rescinded due to my prior extensive use. \n\n\nQuick digression - if you have any desire to do anything defense related or where clearance is required, stop using pot immediately. The federal government gives ZERO fucks that it's legal in your state (sadly). The system is EXTREMELY antiquated. My pot use is a problem, but motherfuckers get hammered and make stupid decisions and get clearances... A drunk would definitely be a bigger threat to security then a recreational pot user- End digression\n\nAll that being said, I enjoyed my time with that sweet, sweet devil's lettuce. A ton of fun. We've had great times. Listened to some great music. Watched some amazing television. Experienced some extremely sketchy situations. I will say though that after almost a year of not getting stoned, I feel so much clearer, aware, and motivated.",

The consequences of lying to the federal government. Lying can result in jail time and/or fines. With this, you will have a felony on your record, which may result in challenges with finding another job. The feds aren't dumb - they will ask appropriate questions to the right people. All it takes is one fuck up from one person, whether it be family or friend.\n\n2. Integrity is huge for me. Lying makes me feel disgusting, and absolutely consumes my mind. Especially as someone who suffers from intense anxiety.\n\nThe consequences alone make lying not worth it. If you want a job with the feds, I would recommend abstaining from drug use for more than a year to prevent any hiccups.",

But I can assure you, you\u2019re definitely not alone.\n\nI\u2019m an older student and now that I\u2019m back in grad school, it\u2019s kind of jolting how much my classmates talk about using alcohol or drugs to cope with \u2018stress\u2019. They mention it at least once in every conversation we have together, like it\u2019s a given that grad students turn to substances to cope. The crazy thing is that most times it seems they only need them to cope with anxiety related to their procrastination habits, and not the work itself.\n\nIn truth, whether it\u2019s an issue all depends on the substance and what you\u2019re getting out of it. If you\u2019re using CBD oil every now and then to manage anxiety, that\u2019s one thing. If you\u2019re consuming weed to the point that you think you\u2019re high every time you go to class or complete an assignment, that\u2019s definitely a concern. It sounds like you also have an issue with procrastination. It might be worth looking at how your marijuana use might be contributing to that. Procrastination amps up anxiety and stress by 100 easily, meaning all of that stress and anxiety can be avoided in another way. Alcohol is another beast. I won\u2019t even go into it.\n\nWhat helps you manage your anxiety and task levels day-to-day? And more importantly, what can you do in your daily life that *prevents stress from happening* in the first place? \n\nFor me, it\u2019s keeping my space (home and office) tidy and clean by doing a little cleaning every day, setting aside time to spend/play with my family, planning what I need to get done week to week ahead of each minor and major assignment, eating healthy (most of the time), exercise, and trying to limit interruptions while I work. I don\u2019t always do these things, but I\u2019ve been able to ingrain them into my life enough that they usually pick back up again quickly.\n\nTLDR, no you aren\u2019t the only one. But it\u2019s worth picturing how your life (and what you\u2019re getting out of you\u2019re degree) would be like without weed. Is weed helping you become the person you want to be? Is it helping you to prevent sources of stress (not just manage them)?",

I'm also just a lowly masters student but I did last 2 years in undergrad with a 3.9 and high as hell because I was so bored and 'ovrr it'.

I've accepted I'll likely abuse a substance because I go hard, so I must do these silly things like pack tiny capsules in my volcano, not a big bowl (if I got stuff to do). I also definitely refuse to work full time and do school full time. There's benefits, there's downsides. It's just life. Shit breaks; people die.\n\n\nEdit: formatting",

I would even do it when I knew that I would regret it.\n\nI was addicted, and now I'm not. I don't know what maturity is exactly.\n\nSeveral factors helped me escape the addiction. I became more concerned about the unknown long-term physical and mental effects, instead of just rationalizing it as \"just weed bro.\" I also started weekly talk therapy to deal with other issues, not my addiction directly. But therapy helped me become more aware of my own patterns, and the various lies I would tell myself.\n\nStill, despite those factors, I relapsed repeatedly. I don't mean the occasional slip-up, I mean falling back into full-blown every-waking-hour THC consumption. The one thing that finally allowed me to break free for good was a simple realization: that weed doesn't do what I thought it does. **It doesn't expand my consciousness.** At least, not when I do it all the time.\n\nThe thing that kept me coming back to weed was not the desire to chill out and go to sleep, because weed never effected me that way. It was the desire for a mild *psychedelic* experience. I thought that weed made the colors brighter and music more beautiful. I thought that it stimulated my creativity, and allowed me to step outside myself and see reality more objectively. Because that's what it used to feel like when I was a teenager. But now, I realize that it actually does the opposite when you use it compulsively, excessively. I feel so much more alive than I did during the eight years that I was addicted.\n\nThanks for your question. I'm probably going to copy and paste this comment into its own post on /r/leaves now.",

Maybe there's a lot of lab/department/university variation there, but in my experience, I can't think of many labs at my university where it's be a big issue. Also, if it's of note, at an R01 in US doing cognitive neuroscience research.\n\nEdit: point isn't to invalidate your experience. I just mean don't be ashamed.

Hell, my friend at NASA got a letter saying \"Hey weed might be state legal but its federally not so don't smoke weed.\"\n\nSo yeah, you can engineer hypervelocity weapons which turn people into red paste, simulate new atomic weapons to annihilate people 10% more efficiently, or create AI tools which aid the panopticon of agencies keeping tabs on people.
