  "text": "I asked a former internship boss for a letter of rec and they said yes but they asked me to write the first draft and they will add in \"nice things and extras.\" I understand why--they are very busy and being a year since my internship, they've probably had a dozen other interns. \n\nMy question for this sub: should I write a first draft that's detailed & accurate that they can subtract or add more adjectives they'd live or should I write a template-styled first draft that allows for them to put in their words such as \"(My name) impressed our staff with their \\_trait a\\_\\_, trait b\\_, \\_\\_trait c\\_\\_.\" I'd still describe my duties and how I contributed as an intern but literally leave blanks for personal characteristics they perceive of mine because it feels strange to put specific compliments in their mouths.",

I wrote a \"draft\" of a letter of recommendation for a professor when I applied to grad school and they read over it to check that everything was true and then just added their signature/name but that was the only change they made.",
