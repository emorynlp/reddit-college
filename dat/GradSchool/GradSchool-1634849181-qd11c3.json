  "text": "I\u2019m in the second year of my PhD and I feel like the respect I\u2019ve had for my advisor is gone. I\u2019m exhausted of always being around his arrogance and how little it seems like he cares about not only me, but some of the other students who are working in his lab. I feel like this has caused me to lose some focus in my research and school. I like what I\u2019m doing and only have a year and a half left so I\u2019m committed to finishing this. I am curious if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you have done to help yourself out.",

I kinda only talk to them during our scheduled meetings and i make sure to get direction from a lot of other people. But it\u2019s reeeeaalllyyy hard but you just gotta keep your eye on the prize",

When I mention that I\u2019d like to speed up my progress, she tells me to slow down and \u201cenjoy the down time\u201d. I send her things to review two weeks before we meet (per the timeline she gave) and when we meet, she says she\u2019ll need some time to digest the data. She starts most meetings by talking about how busy she is and how I\u2019ll understand \u201cwhen I get a job\u201d. I worked for 10 years before starting my PhD.",

Hell, even remotely would be ok. If not, then I would leave. Even with 1.5 years left. Take a semester off to work on your own.",
