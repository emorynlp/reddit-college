  "text": "I\u2019m planning on getting my masters in psych online, and although I know it won\u2019t be as difficult as a STEM field, I\u2019m worried about my current work schedule. I work as a DSP for individuals with IDD, but my schedule is 3pm-11pm Thursday through Monday (with the chance of getting mandated every shift)\u2026.I haven\u2019t had a weekend off in like 6 months and I\u2019m so burnt out. I plan to start grad school in January, would it be a good idea to drop to part time? We\u2019re so short staffed here I don\u2019t want to risk losing my job.",

HR told me that once I get my masters there\u2019s a position I could potentially have BUT they\u2019ve been pretty sly on making promises they can\u2019t keep. I\u2019m trying to move out of my town ASAP which is why I might bite the bullet, go part time and live frugally, and just get it done ASAP. I\u2019m looking into the possibility of taking some summer classes too to see if I can get it done in a year and a half",
