      "text": "Usually, the grad admissions process will require you to submit *all* transcripts from both undergraduate and graduate work, so they will see both. Your question implies that your master's degree GPA is better than your bachelor's. If that is the case, the admissions department will see that as improvement, which will help your case. Sometimes they only care about the GPA for your most recent degree, which also helps your case.   \n\nOne question you will likely need to answer, though, is \"Why do you want a master's degree when you already have one?\" If your first one is, say, an MS or MA, and you are seeking an MBA or similar, then it's easy to argue that you have the subject skills and now you want to grow your business skills to advance your career. On the other hand, if your first master's is in a similar field (like you have an MS in physics and want one in chemistry), you'll need to present a stronger case for why you're applying. In any case, good luck!",

I explained that my undergrad GPA was not stellar because I didn't have focus and discipline when I was 18-22, but pointed to my excellent GPA when I worked full-time and went to night school when I was 27.",
