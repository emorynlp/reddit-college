  "text": "Hey, all! \n\nI started my MA in English Lit a few weeks ago and a professor has put out a CFP and I'm wondering if I can submit something I wrote in undergrad for a grade to a conference? A few of my professors have mentioned, just kind of in passing, to reach out to any old professors if you want to use a paper from their class in any sort of context in graduate school. \n\nThis paper I wrote was written a year ago and at an entirely different school. Is it still wise to reach out or should I just submit it?",
