  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI started the first week of my MSc and I just got the iPad Air4 for lab work, readings and MCAT studying as well. Does anyone have any recommendations for apps to install that you've found useful in grad studies? (Ex. annotating and marking up articles) Any insight would be helpful!!\n\nThank you :)",

I know there are a few other apps that work very similarly - Notability & OneNote - but GoodNotes works well enough for what I need to use it for.",

Tried OneNote and hated it because my highlighting moved if, for example, I deleted a picture or something. \n\nNotion (web & desktop app, too) is great for organizing and relating notes, assignments, etc. You can sign up with your student email and get premium for a couple years iirc. Pages and databases are also shareable if you need to do group work (only share what's necessary to avoid plagiarism).\n\niStudiez is an easy way to keep track of your timetable and assignment/task deadlines if you need support in that area.",
