  "text": "Hi All, \n\nI am in the process of exploring graduate programs, and I would love to have an advisor or consultant to run things by. For example, will I be a competitive candidate for the program based on my educational/professional profile, how to craft my personal statement, resume, etc. \n\nThere are so many different options out there I am a bit overwhelmed. If any of you have a suggestion on how to go about finding a consultant or had a positive experience with a consultant, I'd love to hear!\n\nThanks!",
