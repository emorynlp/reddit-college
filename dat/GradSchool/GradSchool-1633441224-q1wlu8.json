  "text": "I work as a security officer and just began my MPA program. I\u2019m a bit discouraged because the majority of my peers seem to already work public admin related jobs and I feel out of place / \u201clesser\u201d than them, admittedly. I\u2019m worried that the degree is going to be useless if they\u2019ve already been able to land these types of jobs and I haven\u2019t been able to.\n\nMany of my friends that went to grad school didn\u2019t have to work \u201cnormal\u201d jobs during their program as they were still living at home or supported financially by parents mostly, so that graduate assistantships paid the bills.\n\nLooking for anyone that worked these types of jobs- security, customer service, food service, retail, bar tending, etc- while completing their graduate program. I\u2019m not sure if I am really as much of an outlier as I feel or if it is fairly common.",

      "text": "I think it\u2019s more common than a lot of people think. I self-funded the first year and a half of my PhD with shop work, and for a short time with a data entry job, too. Sometimes the funding just doesn\u2019t stack up and you need to bite the bullet and get a job purely for the money. As a bonus, I\u2019m now excellent at time management \ud83d\ude02\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the value of your degree based on other people. They\u2019ll have different circumstances as to how they came by their job; they may have been in a more junior position for years, or are required to study for an MPA as part of their job.",

I worked as a cleaner and high school exam supervisor during my masters, and did mostly waitressing in between masters and phd. Getting jobs is always more about who you know than what you can do, unfortunately.\n\nThe good thing is that you will be able to make contacts during your degree that will help you  land that sweet sweet white collar work, so don't hesitate to reach out to people and bug them!",
