  "title:": "Question about my lowest homework score being dropped",
  "text": "So my professor posted an announcement saying that for our final grade of the class, he is removing the lowest score on a homework assignment for each student. In this case the homework is out of 20 percent. By him doing this will the final grade get fixed and go up? since he is removing the lowest score I got on an assignment which should take away from the final grade before the removal of the lowest score on a homework? This is in Canvas btw. If so will it go up by 20 percent or half or what. It probably will go up though but not sure\n\nI have a 58 percent now as my total grade for the class because of me getting a low score on my final exam and I was wondering if you think the fact that he is dropping the lowest homework score will bump my grade up to a 60? The lowest homework score I got is out of 20 percent like all the other homeworks.",

      "text": "It depends on how many points the homework was worth. The percentage score doesn\u2019t make a difference. You could get a 2/10 on the homework but if there are 500 points total for the course it won\u2019t go up much at all. \n\n58% = 290/500\n\nDropping the 2/10 homework:\n\n288/490 = 58.8%\n\nWhereas of there were 100 points total for the class it would have a bigger impact:\n\n58% = 58/100\n\nDropping the homework:\n\n56/90 = 62.2%\n\nIf homework is weighted different in the final grade then it has even less impact.",
