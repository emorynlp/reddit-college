  "text": "My Masters was excellent. I won an award for brilliance. But my PhD has been nothing short of one misfortune after another.\n\nIt got off to an alright start, but I never got on with my colleagues. They bullied me to the point I didn't even sit with them in the cafeteria anymore. That really just set the whole shitshow that has been my PhD in motion, really.\n\nI really didn't like the project I was assigned. It was very dull. But I got on with it. The theory was very interesting, but my day-to-day experiments were just such a slog. I came home every day miserable, but I got on with it anyway.\n\nThen came covid. \n\nMy lab shut down in March 2020, and it was shut for months and months, during which time I like many reverted to a teenager. No longer was I a lab rat, I was the house maid.\n\nThe lab re-opened in August, and I started to get back into it. \n\nJust two weeks after I got back into the lab, my father passed away very suddenly. I had to rush back and suspend my PhD for several months. For 7 months, I stayed at home completely isolated, once again the house maid. During this time, I developed severe mental health issues, including severe anxiety and depression from all the isolation.\n\nWhen I FINALLY came back to work in April, I was totally out of the rhythm of working, having panic attacks most days, and in the end I just couldn't show up to work anymore. But still I kept trying to muscle on.\n\nBut my mental health has just kept deteriorating, and I've been missing more and more days, sometimes not going in at all for an entire week.\n\nToday, my lack of progress really caught up with me. Hard.\n\nI had the most AWFUL meeting. All seven of them just looked at me with great contempt and disappointment. They outright stated they were really not happy with me. My performance was awful, and I had no report to present. This is what really pissed them off. They also got upset with me for not replying to certain emails.\n\nIt was absolutely awful. Every second of the meeting was awful. I could feel them staring into my soul. As the meeting finally came to a close, my boss was just shaking his head. They all looked gravely concerned.\n\nI'm going to get fired, I just know it. A few months ago I had another meeting that went almost as awful, and I tried to resign after receiving a very concerned email from them. But they convinced me to stay, so I didn't resign.\n\nBut now I'm going to get fired. I just know it. From how unbelievably awful awful AWFUL that meeting went. I mean he was literally shaking his head! How badly do you have to fuck up for that?!\n\nMy whole PhD journey has been shit from almost start to now. My mental health has rapidly deteriorated from all the SHIT I've been through in my personal life throughout, and now it's crunch time and I'm going to get fired. Fuck me man they should've just let me leave when I resigned. Now I'm going to get fired and have no reference and no fucking future. Who in my prestigious field is going to hire a guy that was literally fired from a PhD?!\n\nFuck. I feel today marks the end of my career and I had better find another purpose in life.",

It sounds like your department knows this. Do they know how much you have been struggling? If you feel safe sharing that with them, now might be the time.\n\nAlso, see if your university has mental health resources. You need support right now and they will be able to at least get that support system started. \n\nYou had a bad meeting, it happens. You probably aren't going to be fired. It's going to be okay.",

If you reach out to them be sure to mention the daily panic attacks and the death of your parent specifically. Both of those are giant red flags that should motivate them to help.",

      "text": "Sounds like you have shitty lab mates and a shitty professor. I agree it's unlikely that you'll get fired. They'd have to make everything official and then you more or less hold up the shit cards you've been dealt recently and no university with a functioning brain would let them fire you for fear of public backlash for treating you like shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides absolute worst case scenario being fired is not such a big deal, you just phrase it a bit more eloquently on your resume. You say withdrew due to dispute. Being a PhD isn't a traditional job it's more than fair to not call it getting fired. Then you can tell your tail to any potential employer or another potential supervisor if you had to change things up and start under someone new. 98% of people are going to look at you more favorably than your former lab mates. Yeah you'd have to share a lot more personal details with a potential employer/ PI, and that may make you uncomfortable, but it's not the end of the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso to help through commiseration/ advice for turning things around. I had a bad meeting with my supervisor last year, she was upset with how long things were taking (She had assigned me stuff outside my field and I was having to learn stuff completely unrelated to my studies). She sat me down on the floor with her dog and I could tell from her tone that she was trying to give a you're a good student, I'm not angry just disappointed speech. If you can manage it in those scenarios the best thing to do is to lean into it and HARD. Be like yeah I'm also super upset with how long these things are taking, I'm not happy with my progress, I've been dealing with X, Y, and Z, and things have been taking me WAY more time than I'd expect. Pulling this with my supervisor the talk actually turned into a bonus, don't expect that if you're not good at acting, but leaning in makes it REALLY hard for someone to cast blame cause it forces them to acknowledge their responsibilities to you. Your supervisor bringing that up in a group was horrifyingly inappropriate and not at all okay, even if you were in the wrong, which from your description you certainly aren't. Leaning in effectively defangs criticism cause it forces collaboration into the conversation and really makes it difficult to blame the person for the perceived short fall.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless it will all be okay in the end, regardless of how it washes out.",

Their peers being frustrated is reasonable, but angry not so much, at least in my eyes. I'd hope that if someone in your group project had a parent die, them being essentially useless wouldn't be such a stick in the side.\n\nLike I understand the perspective and if they were refusing to communicate the issue, or lying about the teams responses (The team has tried to work with them but they've shut that down, the team tried to welcome them but they shut that down) then they're an asshole. But if they said their father died, and then the team didn't look at the lack of performance as primarily a mental health issue. Then I flat out don't like the team, they should be working with OP not against them to help them get back into their work.",

              "text": "Yeah... no. I vehemently disagree. If someone in your lab isn't pulling their weight, they're gonna get kicked out reasonable right. Hell NO,\n\nThat's what being a decent person is about, this isn't a grade school, you don't get pissy cause things aren't going your way. If someone isn't pulling their own weight you talk to them, figure out what's wrong. They got into the program same as their lab mates. If your team mate is going through an inordinate amount of family shit you give them a pass, you help them get back on track, you don't dismiss that as not your problem and say well you're clearly not doing your job. We're not school children, being a decent human being is about accommodating the horse shit life throws at people some times, cause we hope they'll accommodate us when the horse shit flies our direction. Even if they don't share unprompted, as soon as you notice something that concerns you, they should have asked OP about it \n\nYeah OP should have had a conversation with their supervisor well in advance of the meeting happening to try and get back on track, find a plan that worked, go talk to a therapist, they don't take no blame. But the duty ultimately falls on the supervisor to deal with situations like this in a prompt and professional manner. From my reading it wasn't a committee meeting, but instead a lab meeting (At least from my reading), so regardless of anything else, even if OP was fully to blame dealing with that as a group is not discipline, it's not feedback, that's fucking bullying to group up the rest of the lab against one individual. And if it was a committee meeting, a decent PI should be at least somewhat aware of what's going on and address this sort of issue LONG before the committee meeting, having a conversation in private to address the issue. \n\nYeah if there have been attempts to discuss this issue with OP that aren't listed here then I take back everything they're shit abusing reasonable understanding and trying to play the victim. But from the sounds of it, their lab mates never really wanted them around, made no attempts to integrate them into the team, then when they had deaths in the family ignored that fact, ignored signs that their team member was struggling with mental health issues, did nothing, then proceeded to gang up and berate them. This is at a minimum completely incompetent management of the lab, at worse malicious negligence against OP.",

Please reach out to your doctor, university mental health resources, your therapist, whatever you need, and then please document this with your university\u2019s disability office or equivalent. The accommodations you need to do your work are the same as someone wearing glasses in a classroom. They\u2019re not a big deal, and you may need them to get your work back on track. \n\nIf you need help finding a therapist, I\u2019m happy to offer advice. If you want someone on the phone with you while you call student mental health services, PM me. I\u2019m very serious about that. The first steps to getting help can be hard. \n\nEven more than staying in this graduate program, you deserve to feel better. I know you love what you do and you\u2019re dedicated to it, but always remember that *this is a job*. It\u2019s not who you are, it doesn\u2019t define your worth as a person. I mean, I leave these comments on threads not because I care about grad school, but because I want people to get help when they need it. \n\nIt\u2019s also not a personal failing that you\u2019re dealing with this. The last couple years have been tough generally, but you\u2019ve really had a hard time. Of course you\u2019re struggling, who wouldn\u2019t be? I am so very sorry about your dad.  \n\nUltimately, maybe this lab isn\u2019t the right fit for you, or maybe you need some time away to work on your health. If that happens, *that\u2019s okay*. I think if you had a friend in your situation, you\u2019d tell them that. You\u2019d love them the same, support them, and wish them nothing but success. Remember to treat yourself with the same kindness.",

Sounds like maybe it would be healthy for you to step away from the lab at the current time. If you think you still want to continue the work in this lab, perhaps you can request a leave of absence due for mental health reasons? That could get you out in front of the firing you are worried about and give you a chance to get back to being productive once you are in a better place mentally. Today does not mark the end of your career, it is a bump in the road. And i doesn't sound like the group is very supportive of you, scolding you for lack of progress rather than asking you what's going on and how they can better support you. Please take care and best of luck.",

      "text": "When I finished my undergrad I was pretty burned out from stress and overwork (probably not to the degree that you are at the moment) so I had no ambitions for graduate school at the time. Strangely enough, I found getting a normal 9-to-5 job  and just working 8 hours a day and going home to relax and sleep for a couple of years to be incredibly therapeutic. I think that after academic pressures, sometimes just being a working stiff can be great.\n\nIt sounds like you could use some time off from academia, but I very much recommend that you don't just stay at home to recuperate. Idleness and isolation can (as you've learned) be incredibly damaging. I'm no therapist, so forgive me for overreaching here, but it sounds like you could really benefit from a low pressure (but not \"no-pressure\") environment and a regular routine for a while.\n\nBy the way, after a couple of years of just working I gradually found my ambition getting rekindled. This took the form of starting to read nonfiction books and trying to expand my mind in my free time. Eventually after a total of 4 years off of school and with a good chunk of my student debt paid off and a decent savings account, I went back for my PhD (which I just finished a year ago).\n\nGood luck and hang in there!",

Dealing with a loss, what sounds like family trauma, and grad school related things seems like it has taken a toll on you mentally and your mental health is extremely important. Grad school isn't going to do you any good if your mental health is shit by the time you graduate. \n\nIf you do get removed from the PhD program, it doesn't mean you won't be able to find a job. Where you live would determine how much info can be revealed about that, but in the US it's not much else besides \"this person is/is not eligible for rehire\".\n\nAs others pointed out, the way you write this post seems like you struggle with anxiety. If so, I'd strongly encourage you to contact your student's mental health services. I struggle with anxiety too, and when everything is a catastrophe when you're in anxiety-mode, it is extremely hard to think straight.",

You\u2019ve been through a lot and a PhD, much less a masters degree like I\u2019m doing, introduces a lot of stress and takes a lot out of you. \n\nBut these tough programs do require that people who are taking them have a relatively sound mind.

I fell asleep on zoom, in a grief counseling support group session. I also experienced bullying from the other social workers, boundary testing, and racism. \n\nNot only are the expectations of higher education rediculous, but when you intern, work, and are juggling real life it's tough. You went through grief, bullying, a sudden change of life. It's okay, and you're human. I know that you probably will ruminate about it, frequently. Well, because that's what I did, I could not stop thinking about how mortified I was. I fell asleep on Zoom because I was burnt out and was experiencing hypersomnia. \n\nGettkng fired was also mortifying, but I was glad to be out of that place. I think the most important thing is having an open and honest conversation with your preceptor, to see what your next steps are. \n\nIs there a way to have a mediator present while you speak to your team? \n\nJust know you cant control what happened in the past, but you can learn from your behavior and correct it. You are not solely a PhD. You are a person, a human being. \n\nAnd as a therapist, who went through something similar. I genuinely urge you to take care of your mental health. I know ruminating and self doubt are a bitch, but you will eventually get through it. Be honest with yourself, and know when you may need to step away to take necessary self care.",
