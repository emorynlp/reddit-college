  "text": "Hi there, \n\nI was hoping I could pick everyone\u2019s brain here for a little bit. \n\nI\u2019m a mechanical engineer that graduated with my bachelors last year. I did some research during my undergrad, but didn\u2019t get a chance to publish. Over the past year I\u2019ve grown tired of working my corporate design engineering job so I\u2019ve been actively applying to PhD programs in mechanical engineer because I\u2019d like to pursue a career in research. I\u2019ve applied to 8 programs already and plan on applying to 4 more. I haven\u2019t been the most active person when it comes to reaching out to potential PI\u2019s at prospective schools ( I haven\u2019t emailed any professors ). However, I received an email from a professor at one of my top schools within a week after I applied, with him stating he\u2019s interested in me working with him and would like to set up a meeting to discuss during the first week of December. \n\nI\u2019m reaching out to everyone here to get a sense of whether an interaction like this is common so early in the application season. I personally feel like I\u2019m not mentally ready to be \u2018interviewing\u2019 and would also not like to commit to a specific school before I\u2019ve heard back from all of the other schools I\u2019ve applied at. At the same time, I understand that this is just a conversation and I don\u2019t really have to commit to anything yet. The email just really caught me by surprise and I\u2019m trying to make sense of it all.  \n\nAny advice/ words of encouragement would be appreciated. \n\n\nThanks, \nConfused Engineer",

      "text": "This is very common and highly encouraged according to my mentors. Lots of PI's are typically happy to talk to prospective students at any point in the year. A first call might just be establishing whether your research interests overlap, and the professor may want to see that you can demonstrate some research competencies. But every interview goes both ways so it often with the time to prep several questions about their working and mentoring styles to see if they are offering what you want as well. This is useful info for everyone early in the process when no commitments are already on the line.",
