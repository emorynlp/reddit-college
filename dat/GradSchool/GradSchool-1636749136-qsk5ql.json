  "text": "I feel like I have an issue where I overestimate my ability to push myself and underestimate the time something will take, and that\u2019s left me constantly feeling like I\u2019m a disappointment to my advisor. For context, she asked if I had a draft ready for her to review last week. My brain processed it as \u201chey I want this draft now\u201d, and I panicked and said I would have it ready in a week, despite the draft needing considerable amount of work. \n\nFast forward to a week, and the draft is not yet ready, and i ended up asking her for more time. She was understanding and said yes, but it just left me feeling so inadequate. Does anyone have any tips to stop setting unrealistic tasks for oneself, especially when you feel a pressure that might not even be there?",

I am really bad at understanding how long tasks will take me, it\u2019s not just in academia but in other aspects of life. But it definitely causes me problems in academia, to the extent that I often feel like I\u2019ve let myself down and let my committee down. I often feel like I\u2019m not a good PhD student and that I wasn\u2019t cut out for this lifestyle because of how bad I am at setting realistic goals.",

      "text": "Try to think about all the little sub-tasks that are involved. Like making figures. Sometimes it takes me more than a day to make ONE figure. Then inevitably my advisor will ask for multiple versions or edits to that one figure. That's multiple days per figure.\n\nIf I have to run some analyses on new data, that will require setting up my environment in Rstudio complete with packages, data, and self made functions from previous work that will be useful. That can be a whole morning. Then I will inevitably spend a good chunk of time trying to wrangle the data into something actually useful. That could take multiple days. Then there's the many draft figures I'll make to try to show results in the best way possible. Honestly, could spend a week or two on just that. \n\nMaking figures is my favorite part, okay lol\n\nThere's also lit review. Setting up my LaTeX doc for the manuscript. Setting up a bib doc. Editing the stupid thing. Figuring out how to do one specific task with some software I rarely use can take a few minutes to a few days, depending on the available documentation. \n\nI started my gradschool journey over-promising output for my advisor. I would say stuff like \"I'll have a draft ready next week\" and next week would come and I'd say \"I made this figure isn't it nice\" and they'd say \"could be better\" lol. Now I just say \"I'll work on that this week and send you updates as I go\".\n\nAll that is to say, take small steps forward whenever you can. Focus on the small. Promise small. Promise vague. Don't think too much about what the end product will look like, just keep moving forward. If your advisor is wise, they already know you over promised and are allowing you time to calibrate yourself to your work speed. Don't over think it too much. And keep them in the loop on any progress if you can.",
