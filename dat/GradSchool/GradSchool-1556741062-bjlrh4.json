  "title:": "Something completely different - I received funding to create the world's first PhD quilt! It's a visual and tactile representation of the diversity of research undertaken at my university.",
  "text": "[The quilt](https://i.redd.it/2c7tt46i7lv21.jpg).\n\n\n**You can see close ups of each block [here](https://www.kent.ac.uk/graduateschool/news/pgexperience.html).** If you click on the block it will take you to a research summary from each PhD student.\n\n\n\n# The research behind each block\n\n|    |     |     |\n|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|\n| DNA is well known to self-assemble to form the iconic double helix structure; peptides also self-assemble into beta sheets and alpha helices which form the foundation of protein structure. We aim to combine these two moieties in the search for new materials with properties which are as yet unseen outside of nature.|      The mission of the Graduate School is to lead and champion the strategic development of provision for graduate education and research at the University of Kent.|     Many wildlife species like the pangolin are threatened by the wildlife trade. I try to figure out how we can get people to stop buying wildlife products such as rhino horn or pangolin scales.     \n| Barred grass snakesare widespread throughout the UK, being a familiar sight in many gardens. I'm working to understand the population dynamics of the UK's largest snake.|   I aim to examine how the Transatlantic alliance through the NATO has responded to the Arab spring, particularly to the security threats that emanated from it, as well as what this response is telling us about the future of the Transatlantic security community in the face of this chaos.|     Cosmetics are often overlooked as a form of forensic trace evidence. I want to see how reliably I can discriminate between cosmetic foundation samples, using Raman microspectroscopy.     \n| I map how wildlife and people use Mount Kenya and what the future could look like, using these to help understand how different parties would be affected by future environmental changes.| Illegal wildlife trade is increasingly moving online, but for enforcement, identifying these products is like finding a needle in a haystack. I intend to develop tools that will help automatically identify elephant ivory being sold from the images used to advertise them.|  There is a long history that thinks of practices of needlework like quilting in reductive binary categories of traditional vs subversive, or the feminine vs the feminist. My research tries to complicate these binaries by focusing on needlework practices as a form of meaning-making in personal and collective forms of feminist activism.   \n|  Synthetic Selection of Enhanced Therapeutic Aptamers. The project will develop a novel method for the discovery of modifications which increase aptamer binding efficacy. The known aptamer that will be modified binds to EGFR, which in cancer cells is the protein that causes cell growth and division.|   Drawing upon the poetic language of Melville\u2019s iconic novel Moby Dick, I aim to transform his work into a prose poetry collection utilising found poetry techniques and my own experiences with the sea.|   The Tizard Centre is the leading UK academic group working in learning disability and community care. The Centre is named after Professor Jack Tizard (1919-1979) in recognition of his contribution to development of community care.  \n\n\n# Background to the quilt.\n\nI wanted to provide an opportunity for PhD students to explore alternative ways of communicating their research. I've been quilting for a few years, and create [textile portraits](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bd9b39efcf7fdd57b545dc9/5bd9b7bcaa4a9938caf16d5f/5bd9f1e870a6adca41db6e31/1541009948825/IMG_20181024_154307.jpg?format=1000w) of endangered species to help raise awareness and funds for them. I've found that quilting is both a really fun pastime, and a great way to engage different people in my work.\n\nI put on workshops where PhD students could create a quilt block that represented the core concepts of their research, then took them away and sewed them up into this!",
