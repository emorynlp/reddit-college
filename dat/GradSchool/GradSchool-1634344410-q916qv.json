  "title:": "I am ashamed at how much reviewing my advisor has to do on my writing. How can I improve?",
  "text": "I am in the middle of submitting my first proposal. It's a short document, but I am appalled that between the first few drafts between me and my advisors, they have rewritten so much and added key points that I can't believe I could have missed. \n\nMy advisor told me to carefully look over my text vs. their reviewed text and understand why it is important. When I do this, I think \"DUH! That makes so much more sense, in such a concise way!\" and I am literally ashamed that my writing was so poor in comparison. \n\nI never considered myself a terrible writer, and I know in grad school, writing varies wildly between papers, abstracts, proposals, etc. I just wasn't expecting SO many corrections in my work. \n\nI am writing another proposal early next year, and would really like to improve my writing, so my advisors aren't faced with such poor quality writing again. I know I can read papers, but I'm not sure how available proposals are online for my specific field. There are also writing hubs at my school, intended to help graduate students' writing skills, but I have no experience with these. \n\nAny tips on how I can improve my writing?",

      "text": "Keep looking at their feedback! It sounds like you have a great writing mentor in your supervisor. You could talk to them about their suggestions. I go through 20+ drafts of articles and grants and that is with coauthors and collaborators. You probably are a good writer. It is just that know you have entered a new level of writing. Nothing you write from now on will be perfect or without room for improvement. Sooner than you know it you will be able catch the points you\u2019ve missed yourself and your writing will be much better. It just takes time!",

      "text": "I have a similar experience, but my PI has been an academic longer than I have been alive so they have so much expertise, knowledge, and experience writing papers that they provide extensive feedback to help me improve. I would much rather have tons of comments from a colleague critiquing, refining, and point out logical inconsistencies, than someone who says \"this is good!\" and have it be rejected by a reviewer. \n\nIMO, it's not about being a terrible writer, but one who is inexperienced. Everyone, including your adviser, was similarly inexperienced at one point. Even if you were to go to your university's writing center, your adviser would still probably tear up your paper because folks at writing centers are not familiar with every discipline's norms, literatures, and experimental procedures. Try to view extensive feedback as a gift--they are interested in helping you become a better writer and are pointing out very specific things to help you do that. Also try to think \"why did they suggest this?\" and try to see what they saw in your writing that caused them to leave a comment. I have one PI who is an extremely critical reviewer, but all of their comments make sense and add value to the paper and trying to understand where they are coming from with their comments has helped me tremendously.",

      "text": "It sounds like you're struggling with both content and style, and trying to fix both at once is really hard. For the next round, perhaps try outlining for content & structure first and getting your advisor to sign off on that, and then separately work on turning that into prose.\n\nA lot of universities also have writing centers and/or grants offices that have resources to help you improve your academic writing of all sorts. Pedagogy resources might have something helpful here, too, in terms of professional communication skills. You might be able to get one-on-one time with a tutor, but, if not, writing support groups consisting of similar-stage graduate students that help each other out are quite common.",

      "text": "I find that this is pretty common for most of the undergrads/grads/postdocs that I've seen over the years. Honestly it just takes practice. But you can get an idea of how to improve your writing by looking at your PI's writing style (publications, grant applications, LoRs, etc). You'll ideally combine their style with a voice that is uniquely yours and improve. I wouldn't feel too terrible about it, do what it seems you're already doing and try to find your mistakes and actively improve. I think many people underestimate the utility of re-reading, re-editing, and re-writing your work and strongly recommend that you do this often.",

Especially with first drafts.\n\nThe key thing with writing is to start early enough, so you can polish the language and structure before the deadline.  Almost every writer\u2019s first drafts suck to some degree - just focus on what works, learn the lessons, and keep moving.  Nobody hit you and your advisor need ever see the crappy drafts.",
