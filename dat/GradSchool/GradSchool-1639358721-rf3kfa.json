  "text": "My dream is to study abroad in the UK and I want to start narrowing down my list of schools that offer master\u2019s or PhD track programs that specialize in either Gothic, Romantic, or Victorian era literature. It would be amazing too if the same school had a complimentary program that focused on women\u2019s studies, because ideally that\u2019s what I truly want to study: the combined evolution of female authors and the role of women in literature in the gothic, romantic, and Victorian eras. Does anyone know of any schools that are particularly strong in these areas that I should look into applying to?",
