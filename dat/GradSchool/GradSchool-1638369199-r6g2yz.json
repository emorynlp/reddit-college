  "title:": "Value in both an MBA and CMIS Masters?",
  "text": "Completed my undergrad 8 years ago and have worked professionally since. Currently working at a university in IT and am using tuition waver benefits to begin my MBA. End goal is to eventually end up in high tier administration/director positions.\n\nStarting with the MBA with a managerial specialization since it feels the most versatile. We'll see how I feel at the end of it, but planning to get a CMIS (STEM MIS hybrid) with a project management after I complete the MBA.\n\nI guess the two questions I have are....\n\n\\-Would a CMIS degree alongside an MBA provide anything more than some extra opportunities?  \n\\-From a learning perspective, taking the CMIS program should improve my managerial skillset?\n\nAnyone ever do both an MBA and MIS degree and have experiences they could share?\n\nThanks!",
