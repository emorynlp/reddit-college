              "text": "So those things all have different requirements. The engineering courses you might be able to become a career switcher and do the masters while you work. Math and science you will need to do the masters first so you can get your initial license. Or you might be able to just take a licensing test if you do the engineering first. Teaching community college requires either a masters in your content area or a masters in anything and 18 graduate hours in your content area. You need to focus in on what you want to teach so you can work on the right courses.",

Therefore, I would like that to be something I can start working towards. I will more than likely be working on a masters while working to have that in my back pocket if I choose higher Ed teaching, and work on licenses after that. But I will be giving it a lot of thought as to which pathway I want to take. Thanks!",
