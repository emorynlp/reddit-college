  "text": "On the ICS domain for UCI, there 2 pages expecting different things from the Personal History Statement. \n\nThis ICS page([https://www.ics.uci.edu/grad/admissions/Prospective\\_ApplicationProcess.php](https://www.ics.uci.edu/grad/admissions/Prospective_ApplicationProcess.php)) asks for this:\n\n    Statement of Purpose (Required):\n    A statement of your personal, academic, and professional goals, as well as why and how this program will help you to achieve these goals.\n    \n    Personal History Statement (Optional, but highly recommended):\n    Your personal history describing circumstances that have contributed to your successes and/or challenges encountered during your academic and/or professional career.\n\nThe MCS page([https://mcs.ics.uci.edu/prospective-students/admissions-requirement/](https://mcs.ics.uci.edu/prospective-students/admissions-requirement/)) asks for this\n\n    PERSONAL HISTORY STATEMENT demonstrating your writing and communication ability.  The personal statement should include:\n    A personal history describing your previous professional and academic achievements.\n    Your purpose, including your personal, academic and professional goals, and how and why the MCS program will help you to achieve these.\n    STATEMENT OF PURPOSE providing a statement of your personal, academic, and professional goals, as well as why and how the MCS program will help you achieve these goals.\n\nNot to mention that the 2nd point for PHS and the only point for the SOP is the same line copied again. XD\n\nHas anyone managed to get in touch with them to talk about this? (And ask for their dealer's number?)",
