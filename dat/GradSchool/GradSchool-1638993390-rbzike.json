  "text": "Hi guys! So I have been looking around schools that offer Art History Masters online. Open University is an option but I recently came across Warnborough College Ireland. The reason I feel somewhat interested is because of how interesting their courses are! So much to learn. However, I do want to have a career in academia and as far as I am aware, this college does not seem to have a reputation in the academic world. Anyone have advice or insight about this college?",
