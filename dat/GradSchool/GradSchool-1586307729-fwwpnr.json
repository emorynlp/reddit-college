  "title:": "Got a Huge Scholarship to My Dream School!!!!!!",
  "text": "Hi r/GradSchool! I have some amazing news: today I was awarded $24,000 in scholarships to attend my dream institution. If I can get the graduate assistantship I applied for, then I can go for free!!!!\n\nGetting partial funding may not be that big of a deal, but I am literally stoked. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to attend this institution because I\u2019m out of state and the tuition is extremely high, but these scholarships make it affordable. I enrolled in my courses today and I couldn\u2019t be any prouder, especially as a first generation college student!\n\nWhat are some of y\u2019alls accomplishments during COVID-19? I\u2019d love to hear some more great news to brighten my day during these crazy times!",

My reviewer feedback was actually really constructive and I submitted to this journal in part based on positive comments on the conference version of this paper from one of their senior editors, so I'm pretty hopeful about the revision.\n\nAnd finally, I was emailing with one of my profs (who I'll be writing a thesis under next academic year) about trying to get started writing book reviews and she offered to try and throw some my way from my institution's journal (which is pretty atypical for people in my particular program) and offered to make a couple big name introductions for me if possible.\n\nSo all in all, some pretty good things so far.",
