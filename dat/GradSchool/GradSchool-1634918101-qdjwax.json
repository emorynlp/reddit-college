  "text": "This is not the first time I\u2019ve encountered the type of Professor who very standoffish and sarcastic, but I am really struggling with it during this already super crunched semester. It\u2019s a long story but basically I noticed some of our assignments on the course website didn\u2019t have clear due dates listed and also some assignments had incorrect information / no information on them. I brought this to the Professor\u2019s attention on several occasions but each time they suggested I needed to kind of \u201cgrad school up\u201d and think critically about it. I don\u2019t know what there is to think critically about when it comes to incorrect or missing information. They really doubled down on everything being my fault and not theirs. I know for fact several of the other students have reached out to them about how the lack of info makes completing assignments really difficult. \n\nI reached out to my advisor about it but they were not helpful and said I had to work it out with the Prof. This Prof seems to have bully mindset and sent me a 3 page email about how everything they did is clear and how everything I said was wrong (at midnight one night) It is both unhelpful and these convos are wearing on my mental health. I haven\u2019t been able to complete some assignments and don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to them anymore. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for dealing with this type of Professor? I feel really stuck and don\u2019t have anyone on my side. I don\u2019t really care if they fix the mistakes anymore I just want to get through as best I can.\n\n[edit typos]",

      "text": "This is tough because you have very little power here. You're right, that prof's behavior is completely unacceptable. I wouldn't threaten to go to the grad school admin just yet, because that's not a collaborative approach and it will give you an \"I'd like to speak to your manager\" vibe. Save that for the last resort.\n\nIn your position I'd try again, but really focus on getting the specific info you need. Meaning, point out specific issues with specific assignments as they approach. \"Assignment X says it's due on day Y, but that doesn't make sense because <reason, very briefly summarized>. Could you confirm that that's the actual due date?\" \n\nIf he literally won't answer questions like that, *then* update your advisor and talk to your director of graduate studies or maybe department chair. The most actionable complaint you can make to them is that he won't clarify the assignment info. His poor attitude is also an issue you could bring up, but many profs aren't comfortable intervening in issues like that.",

If they were trying to be sarcastic in a humorous way, it'd be more understandable, but vital information about assignments and deadlines isn't the time for that sort of humour. Ultimately your adviser wouldn't have much influence over the behaviour of their colleague, so I'd send a final e-mail to the professor in question outlining the issues you have and that if these issues aren't addressed, you'll be going to the graduate school administration about your concerns.",

If it's something stupid like formatting, then I can see how that would be something you should figure out but your professor handled it unprofessionally and unacceptably. It really doesn't take any effort to put an announcement or a line in the syllabus saying \"all assignments are to be in APA format, 12 point Times New Roman font, single spaced\" or whatever. \n\nI could see being annoyed if the due dates are on the syllabus, but if there is no information about assignment *instructions*, and this information is not provided in class, how are students expected to get that information? Unless he's expecting you to channel your inner Sylvia Browne, all assignments should include clear instructions. \n\nIf the professor is not providing students with enough information to complete the assignments, that might be worth going to the department chair about. Being a grad student does require critical thinking. It doesn't require being a psychic.",

In most of my classes, assignments were due by class time the following week. If we had class on Tuesday, it would be due next Tuesday, never Friday. \n\nSo weird.",

For example, your peers are potential collaborators and this professor is not. By acting this way, the professor is disqualifying themselves from ever collaborating *with you*, and that is ***their*** loss. If you can frame the situation this way then I think you will have an easier time \"dealing\" with this person.\n\nKeep working with your classmates. If you and your classmates are all roughly on the same page with the material then hopefully your professor won't pull anything weird with the grades. If the professor decides to grade unfairly it will help to have more students that can attest to that.\n\nSorry you have one of these sarcastic/unhelpful professors.

My advisor, myself, and another student wrote a 3-year grant proposal with an early-career tenure-track professor who was (at the time) very disorganized and overly-demanding of his students. But he\u2019ll likely get tenure. \n\nAfter several months of frustrating, hours-long meetings, the other student on the grant blew up and said the quiet parts out loud. It was super unprofessional but I totally empathized. Honestly, I think the younger prof had never been challenged like that (great PhD bona fides and prior top industry experience). \n\nOur advisor (full prof, ~2 decades in the dept.) met with the younger prof a handful of times to \u201ceducate\u201d them on their shoddy collaborative skills, wanton communication skills, and overall disorganization. After about 2 weeks, the entire vibe changed.\n\nTL;DR: My story isn\u2019t  directly relevant. The point is: having an experienced mentor in your corner can also be a mentor to other profs. A catalyst the exposes this need can effect change if the right degree of professionalism is communicated by the affected students to the difficult prof\u2019s (perhaps senior) colleagues (ie one\u2019s advisor).",
