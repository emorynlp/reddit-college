  "text": "I am sure this is normal, and no big deal but I am only in my first semester and I kinda already want out. I guess the reality of department politics, stupid cliques in the department and just feeling like I do not belong are finally kicking in. \n\nI am doing fine objectively doing well enough in my classes, doing great as a TA, talking to professors about joining lab groups and I have made some decent friends. Yet the small things like the department politics, bad behavior from professors and other students just make me so exhausted and make me feel already defeated somehow.\n\nI just keep thinking why did I do this to myself I should have just stayed home in England and not wasted everyone's time. I am sure what I am feeling is normal for someone in my position and I'll get over it.\n\nSorry for the mini rant or something",

The department politics and the reality that those sorts of politics will always follow me around if I continued down the chem PhD route are the reasons why I quit my program.\n\nDon\u2019t feel ashamed if you end up deciding it isn\u2019t for you, it doesn\u2019t make you any lesser as a person or scientist. If you decide to keep going at it good luck! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great!",

It's easy to idealize the PhD before entering it as a wonderful experience that doesn't have any negatives. Like it's going to be some kind of summer camp where everyone works hard, but everything is glorious.\n\nBe aware that these things can happen in the workplace, too.\n\nI would recommend focusing on the end run for the finish of the semester, as it's time to get started on that. You may feel different come later in December. See if it's meeting your goals of learning the discipline, rather than paying attention to the little things.",

As long as you're doing well with the feedback you get from your teachers and grade wise, and you're enjoying the work, don't let those little things get in the way of that.\n\nAlso, some of the people that form cliques during first semester are acting more like undergraduates who are prioritizing socializing. Those who are there for the love of the discipline and to do the hard work of a professional find each other in later semesters.",

That's a huge adjustment, and honestly I would expect that the first few months are probably pretty miserable for a lot of people in your situation. I'd give it a bit more time. If you can't cool and like-minded people in your department, hopefully you can figure out how to meet them elsewhere on campus or in the larger community.
