  "text": "I\u2019m a first year grad student in a small MA program. My cohort is me and 4 others; we get along fine enough professionally and during class, but I\u2019m definitely the odd man out when it comes to our social life. I am the only one not in the group chat (which I found out existed when they all laughed at an inside joke that I wasn\u2019t in on, being told that \u201cit was just a group chat thing\u201d). I am never invited to hang out and just today I found out that the cohort is having an end of semester party that I wasn\u2019t invited to either. I\u2019ve never been openly hostile towards any of them and have expressed that I\u2019d like to hang out with the group more. Should I just shrug it off and just try and hang out with my old friends from before grad school?",

My cohort is about 15 kids in Microbiology and Immunology, and I was part of a much larger cohort during my first year before we all went into varying departments...I def feel like an odd one out. Tried hard to make friends, be sociable, but nothing clicked much with anyone. Still trying to navigate this situation and looking for friends outside the program but that is also equally as hard. I'm wondering if it really is okay to continue a phd with out any friends and if the next 2 to 3 years of life are worth it. Social networks during hard times, especially any grad school degree, is so important.",

My cohort had a group chat and I didn\u2019t even know about it until the end of the first semester, even though the person who made it had my number. My guess is they still use the one without me primarily, but it\u2019s whatever. A couple people have literally stood right in front of me making plans for after class, not in an invitation way but in a \u201cwe don\u2019t care if you overhear because we just don\u2019t\u201d kind of way.\n\nMy solution has been being civil with my cohort, staying in touch with friends from undergrad, and making friends with the people in other cohorts! It\u2019s worked well for me. I\u2019m not as close to the people in the other cohorts as they are to each other, but it\u2019s better than just sitting around and feeling left out!",

I included everyone by making a chat and organized study sessions and social events at my house etc. we were all the same age. It was good until 2 of them started dating and it ended poorly. Fracturing the group. People took sides I refused so I hung out with both sides separately. It sucked. Probably not missing out on anything unless you want to go drink etc. \n\nNow in my PhD program I have done kinda the same thing. All levels of PhD people I have in a group me. Anytime you want to ask subject matter questions, vent, ask about a class or organize something it\u2019s there. Many people don\u2019t talk but you can @ so done if you want them to respond. You could try to organize this but again I don\u2019t gain much from it and have slowly distanced myself away anyway.",

Since you mention friends from before grad school I advise hanging out with them. That\u2019s what I plan to do if my cohort excludes me.

If they come maybe that\u2019s your in and if they don\u2019t at least you tried and have other friends.

I got used to it and focused on chatting with them on an individual basis.\n\nIf it bothers you, could you approach one of the group? Someone who\u2019s \u2018friendlier\u2019 that you could talk to one on one? Could you organise something and then invite them? That\u2019s what I did and it helped me figure out which individuals I could actually be friends with.",

At the end of the year, I found out that the same thing happened to everyone else in my cohort who were people of color or not men.... I ended up making friends with those people and shoved the memory of my first year in grad school in the back of my mind.\n\nNot sure if I have any advice for OP, but there are a lot of good things suggested in the other comments. As my therapist would say, forging relationships involves a little of give and take and sometimes you have to start with giving (e.g. Starting a conversation, inviting someone out, organizing an event). But if your efforts aren't reciprocated, then it might be best to accept the situation and socialize elsewhere - whether if it's with grad student interest groups or associations, students in other departments or with local people the community.",
