  "title:": "MBA vs Masters in CS as a Finance graduate",
  "text": "I'm a Finance graduate and I was thinking of doing a tech related masters like MS in Computer Science or Data science or data analytics. Would it be too hard for me considering I didnt take CS for undergraduate? Would the Masters already start at advanced topics? And how would it compare to getting an MBA in Finance or Data Science?",

      "text": "there are bridge CS MS programs offered but you will have to take some fundamental/core courses in those programs - the ones i\u2019ve seen offer about a year of foundation coursework then the 2 year master coursework. for non bridge programs, they will usually expect applicants to have completed certain classes. in short, you can get into MS CS programs but you\u2019ll have to get your fundamentals first. MS DS programs tend to be cash cows from my knowledge but still look into it if you\u2019re interested, just know most DS roles will require a PhD. I do not know much about MBA programs or Finance programs but the subject material is vastly different from CS and DS so not really comparable.\n\nEdit: what is your goal OP? you\u2019re asking about two totally different subject matters so I am confused but if i knew more then maybe i could be more helpful",

              "text": "well, I actually worked within finance (internships, now i\u2019m in tech) and getting an MBA really won\u2019t necessarily get you in, especially without work experience - this is just what I know based on the colleagues, mentors, and friends i know in the finance industry. however, I would still look further into this because you obviously need a job but MBAs can very expensive so you can\u2019t make that decision lightly. if you\u2019re trying to break into the tech industry then you\u2019ll be saddened to know a lot of people are struggling to get entry level jobs because the labor shortage within the field is mainly for experienced workers but obviously it\u2019s not impossible to get in. since you don\u2019t really have any background in it though, i\u2019d suggest taking a few entry level courses before jumping into a masters (even if it\u2019s a bridge program) because you can at least see if you like it. a lot of people declare cs majors and don\u2019t finish them. Whichever program you decide to pursue, with the lack of experience, I\u2019d suggest trying your best to get into a really good program - especially with the MBA - to make it easier on yourself. best of luck :)\n\nNOTE: please take this with a grain of salt as i do not know everything and can only speak on what i know from my experiences and what i\u2019ve read/seen, definitely do your own research too :)",
