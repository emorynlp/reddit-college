  "text": "On the job market, which is already a psychic hellscape, and one of my cohort mates who has always been a consummate grad student and is applying to a lot of the same jobs as me is getting a million bites, interviews, requests for more material, and even position offers. \n\nI'm trying my best to remain supportive and happy for them, but it's also extremely depressing that I have gotten one bite, that didn't pan out. \n\nHow do I keep engaging as a decent person while also protecting my own mental health?",

      "text": "You can do this by not comparing your success with theirs. It really won\u2019t help you in any way other than to bring you down like how you are feeling right now. If anything, you should use this opportunity to ask ask them what they\u2019re doing different and even ask them to review your resume to see how you can improve. I always find it helpful to not compare my success with other people\u2019s success and that everyone is on a different timeline. Their success does not mean you are failing!!! It just takes a little longer and a few more tries for you and that\u2019s totally ok!!! Best of luck!",

People doing better than you do so 100% because of luck and being privileged enough to have had better oppertunities than you to bulk up their CV. Meritocracy is a convenient myth for those who benefit from the system as is.",
