  "title:": "Should I enroll in a grad school if I'm confused",
  "text": "A little bit about my background. Im a cs undergrad final year with a decent profile and was planning on doing mscs in the states. But idk if I want to do CS for the rest of my life. Idk if feel this way because my undergraduate degree was a below par in terms of education or if I have genuinely lost interest. I don't really have an alternative I'm interested in. Im reluctant because of the massive debt I'll accumulate in grad school. Should I go through with grad school. Am I just overthinking. Are grad schools and a career in CS rewarding and fulfilling.\n\nIf you've done a ms in CS please let me know how your life was during grad school and how it changed after it graduating and how long it took you to repay your student loan. Thanks in advance :)",

      "text": "If you have a bachelors in CS, there\u2019s not much need for a masters - in CS, a masters is just like a bachelors but almost all electives. CS masters are mostly for people who had a bachelors in something else; if you want to do the \u201cnext level\u201d, you\u2019d want to look at going straight to your PhD. This is a great link my advisor sent me that touches on the subject and talks about the difference between a CS masters and PhD in the third question:\n\nhttps://idleprocess.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/why-go-to-graduate-school-and-how-to-get-into-the-program-of-your-dreams/\n\nI have the opposite advice of the two other posters - I took a few years off of school and had an INCREDIBLY hard time coming back. It can be really hard to adjust to a smaller income once you\u2019ve been making real money for awhile. I always recommend to people that if they\u2019re going to do it, they do it now",
