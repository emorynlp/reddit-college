  "text": "I cried about it like a child yesterday. I really didn't care for my undergrad graduation because it did not mean a lot to me. I worked so hard for this degree and I feel like no one cares. I just wanted people I loved to be proud of me. Everyone I invited pretty much bailed. I am a big girl, I got this degree for me and I'll get over it but damn it hurts.  \n\n\nEdit: I just logged onto reddit to see all of your wonderful comments and I am just overwhelmed by the love and the support here. Y'all are wonderful human beings and thank you for making my week a thousand times better.",

A handful of family members have legitimate excuses (sick kids), the rest just either didn't want to wake up or don't give a shit. It's kind of strange they didn't come when it was just a 2 hour drive. We all went to my cousins' various graduations that were 8-10 hours away. But who am I kidding really. They haven't given a shit in years, they won't give a shit now. I just tell myself that I earned the fuck out of my degree, it was all me, and none of them. They might've told me I'd never be anything in life, but look tf at this.",

One my dearest friends who had promised to attend cancelled and didn't even tell me/she just left for another country for a month. I am incredibly proud of myself and happy. I honestly didn't think I would be upset - it is unlike me. I take pride in being independent and not asking for much from others. This was a very challenging year for me. I lost some family, I had some serious health issues, my relationship got seriously shaken up, career plans fell through - I managed to stay strong. But something about this, not having anyone there to be proud of what I accomplished in spite of everything, just really hurts. It hurts more than everything else that happened. It makes me feel like no one if my life cares and my happiness is not priority. Maybe it is an overstatement but I just wanted one day to celebrate with people I cared about. One day to be happy.",

I'm not even fully done my thesis (defending in two weeks), but I still feel a little depressed when I'm on campus seeing all these people with friends and family driving in to celebrate with them. \nSo yesterday, instead of waiting to mope around today, I decide to go with my ungraduated colleagues and drive up a mountain. We didn't make it to the peak because of a sinkhole in the road, but we got a great view on our way up, we watched the typhoon-like rain from the car, and chatted about philosophy. We reflected a bit about the last few years I was here, the accomplishments and struggles and it did make me feel better. It was definitely not the destination but the journey. We kept on driving to the shore and watched the wind turbines , took some \"graduation\" photos, called it a day. I definitely made some unique memories even though no one really close to me was able to come to my actual graduation. I didn't even expect to go to a mountain the day before my ceremony. But I'm glad I reached out, changed my plans, and made the day my own.",
