  "title:": "Considering whether I want to continue from MS to PhD",
  "text": "I finish my MS in the spring in a branch of ecology/plant bio. Recently, my life changed in a few ways and I've been considering whether or not I want to move on to a PhD. \n\n\\- I'm 26 and I'm getting engaged soon. Graduating at 31 with my PhD (if I go straight there from my MS) and then doing a postdoc AND having kids at some point after my 30s seems... daunting. I wonder if I need to choose between family or PhD as a woman. I don't have many role models. \n\n\\- I come from an arts background and 6 years ago transitioned to the sciences. I dreamed of this moment in my life, but when I started my MS it all went downhill FAST. It's a combination of lacking a strong pre-existing support network, still dealng with a variety of mental health issues, and a good level of not relating to my emotionally-distanced white male advisor. \n\n\\- As a result of the above, I just.... don't feel excited about what I do. I avoid talking with my peers because it inevitably brings up research. I just wish we could hang out together and talk science but not about our projects, but fat chance of that. \n\n\\- Burnout may be affecting my decisions pretty heavily. I wondered recently after I had to pull an all-nighter the other day if I quit the arts because I was just burnt out and didn't know how to manage my stress due to the same reasons listed above. I'm concerned that I may be considering switching careers yet again due to the same reasons. \n\n\\- Often, I look at data and I experience little to no excitement about it. I know I'm exited about plants and landscapes. I'm not so sure about data. I don't know if it's the way I was introduced to research but even when I started I was already dreading the entire process, lol. \n\n\\- I feel lost in what I do, regardless of what it is, because I'm constantly looking for community and personal connection in doing my work and I end up not really finding it and looking outwards. This was true for when I was in science and in art, I like to outsource my relationships to other communities for some reason. When I started here during covid, I underestimated how hard it would hit me because I never put the dots together with how much my relationships matter to me/keep me from burning out. When I couldn't form any during covid, I just... face planted. \n\nSo. If any job is hard for me due to personal reasons, but I also have ambitions and goals and stuff, how do I progress? Is academia a good choice for me or should I try to stay away from high-stress environments? Should I take a year off, and if so, what might I try doing? Are there science jobs that might help me to find my place in a community if it's with people who I relate with better? How else could I achieve the goal of having my own group of people that does something related to protecting/studying nature, if it isn't within the academic realm?\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "text": "got my phd diploma in the mail today, actually. as i opened it i had the thought \u201cjust because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should\u201d and that\u2019s kind of my opinion on terminal degrees. thankfully it wasn\u2019t a benchtop degree, it\u2019s on the education side of medical education, so it was a little easier to live my life while completing it. if i had needed to go into the lab (almost did a cell biology phd instead) i doubt i would have finished it. \nmy two cents:  if you already feel this burned out and like you\u2019re staring down the phd years potentially ahead, don\u2019t do it. especially if you want to devote a lot of time to your future kids. the more you put on your plate, the more you\u2019ll start resenting the things that keep you away from them. I was excited about my degree until i finished data collection, and then i spent a year in complete misery finishing up. if i had felt like that at the beginning (as it sounds like you feel now) i wouldn\u2019t have made it. best of luck!",

      "text": "Hey, we're in the same field. \u270c\ud83d\ude09\n\nKeep in mind, you can have children all the way up until age 50 depending on when menopause happens for you. Late 30s/40s isn't too late to have children if you're stressed about timing family with doing postdoc work. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like you're either burnt out or feel pretty medium about your field. I recommend not pursuing a PhD if that's the case. I've always been told that a PhD in ecology or botany is only really helpful for positions as a professor anyways. Not to say there aren't jobs that exist that require a PhD unrelated to academia, just that they're few and far between. I'd recommend looking for internship or seasonal work in your field while having a part time job if you can't find a career after graduation. To build experience and to also explore whether you want to do a PhD.",

NGOs, governmental research or policy, private research institutions, outreach, and consulting are some of the places people end up.",

To be frank your chances of ever going back decrease each year you put it off, but you sound burnt out and some time away might be good for you. As for the kids thing, I know it's possible to have kids in grad school, but doesn't seem like it'll be the easier choice. 31 isn't that late to have them, but it's a best case scenario that the timing will work out for you, and you could very easily find yourself in your mid to late 30s by the time your financially ready. It comes down to what's more important to you I suppose.",

That's no small feat, I hope you can feel proud of your accomplishment.\n\n2) Congratulations on your (pre)engagement! Very exciting!\n\n\nI'm not sure how useful my personal experience will be (and I don't mean to make this all about me), but...\n\nI finished my MS in August, and was technically also a year into my PhD (Geology). I am currently on a leave of absence because I just... couldn't do it anymore. Like you, I was burned out, tired, and stressed. So far I'm not regretting take a leave of absence, especially since I still have access to campus. I got a part-time job with my school's museum, so I can still stay connected to the university and my field of interest without the pressure of academia. My current plan is to try to respark my interest in my discipline by delving into literature. So, maybe you can look for something part time that's related to your field? Or even a job that's just on campus, to make you feel like you're still connected to the school?\n\n\nBurnout sucks, and grad programs are hard. I hope you can take some time to take care of yourself! Please feel free to PM me if you need to chat or just want someone to vent to. Best of luck!",
