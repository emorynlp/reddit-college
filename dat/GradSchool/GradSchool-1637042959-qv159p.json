  "text": "I'm a senior Biology undergrad looking at Biology/Evolution MS/MA programs. I haven't even sent any applications out yet and I'm already losing it. This whole process has sucked up so much energy and my heavy courseload, research, job, social life, and sleep schedule are suffering because of it and I have nothing to show for it.\n\nI'm tired of the song-and-dance of sending letters of interest to faculty that won't ever respond back. From about 20 emails and cover letters sent out, the only responses I've gotten back are that they're not taking new students next Fall. I've read so many papers, scoured through so many faculty lists and lab websites.\n\nI feel perfectly qualified for a Master's position, but I have no frame of reference and nothing to compare myself to with all this silence. I have a high GPA, I'm doing research, I'm a TA, I'm involved with several campus organizations, and I've done a professional internship with a very reputable local organization. *What else am I supposed to do?* Are other people *THAT* much more qualified than I am? Is this field really just 99% networking? Can I be this qualified but ignored because I don't have an \"in\"?\n\nSome of these labs have such high requirements for even *thinking* about joining. Everyone has their own exact format in which they want an email sent to them, with different qualifications for CVs or cover letters. Or to even be seriously considered you needed to do their *exact* research in undergrad. I thought higher education was about learning *new* skills?\n\nI'm at the point where I'm considering a non-thesis track, but I've heard from professors everything between \"they're good for job skills\" to \"you'll be shooting yourself in the foot, you can do better.\" If I can do better why doesn't it feel like it?\n\nI want to go right into grad school, but for after that I don't have a perfectly clear idea of what I want to do. I already know I'm staying the hell away from academia. I like the idea of the NPS, USDA, NOAA, or something along those lines. I always figured I'd get experience and figure out what exactly I like, but available jobs require experience or a graduate degree, and apparently graduate degrees require professional experience as well. I feel like I need to have a five-year-plan, which is ambitious considering I don't even know where I'll be next year or what I'll be doing.\n\nI am so exhausted of this song-and-dance. This whole process feels unnecessarily pretentious and complicated. Maybe I'm just bitter about having bad luck trying to pin down advisors, or the pandemic has *really* screwed up the sciences and everyone else is scrambling around while labs have shortages of funding and gap-years are ending. Either way, I feel lost, confused, and hopeless, and I'm not even miserable about *being* in grad school like everyone else here.",

Unless you\u2019re sure you need a specific degree for the job you want, grad school has a heavy opportunity cost that may or may not be worth it. \n\nYou might be better off getting a job as a researcher or field assistant and get a feel for what you want your career to look like, sans school.",

          "text": "Agreed. Not to be a buzzkill but if these are already significant barriers for you, then grad school might not be for you, at least not right now. The grind/adversity one will face will significantly outweigh the challenge of getting in in the first place. If anything, this process is purposely daunting, likely to serve as an inherent filtering mechanism to weed out people who may not truly want to do this. \n\nI don't say this as the depressed grad student who posts in this sub about how much they hate their PhD program - mine has been largely positive, and any negatives have been opportunities for growth. It's just that the experience is objectively challenging and design to be so. So if the challenge of getting your foot in the door is already this soulcrushing for you, perhaps you should heed that advice and take some time to get a research position somewhere and figure out if you really want to do this, because if you don't, it will show.",

              "text": "Honestly, even beyond this being an indicator of whether grad school is a good fit or not, to me it's just pragmatic. \n\nGrad school is a huge opportunity cost financially that doesn't always pay off. It's also rather soulcrushing (see all the posts in this forum), or has a strong potential to be. \n\nPutting yourself through that if you don't *need* to may not be the best use of your time. Wait until you're sure you need a graduate degree and you're sure what you need it to be in.",

      "text": ">This whole process feels unnecessarily pretentious and complicated.\n\nThat would be the wrong take on it. It's *super* competitive, with way more qualified applicants than there are openings.\n\nI would suggest that you share a sample of your contact email, cover letter, and CV with your major advisor. See if maybe there is something in the way that you wrote them that might be creating a red flag. Sometimes it can just be a matter of the wrong tone being used.\n\nThat being said, I also agree with the other posters. This is the easy part compared to how hard you'll have to work in grad school. And if you're not sure exactly what you want to do after grad school, it might be better to work a year or two first to get a better feeling for the field and what your long-term goals would be.",

      "text": "Don't assume that you're more qualified or smarter than other applicants. At the top level of graduate admissions especially (and to some degree at every level), there's a certain amount of luck involved. These institutions get such a flood of incredibly well qualified applicants that they just have to turn away lots of really bright, well prepared, technically qualified applicants. I was applying last year and pretty much everywhere said they had a record number of applicants. Stanford had 10,000 applicants for a program with less than 100 seats for instance.\n\nIt sounds harsh, but frankly, you and I are nothing terribly special in this regard. We may have done some academic work we're really proud of that we think is really badass, but there's thousands of students like us. Professors are very busy with their own jobs, then they get inundated with cold emails. Even emailing professors at my institution whom I have no prior relationship with usually takes a week or two or more to get a response, and occasionally not at all.\n\nFor some more actionable and constructive feedback however, I had some luck in finding potential advisors by asking other professors. Ask your undergrad professors if they have any suggestions or know anyone that lines up with your interests. Those professors you cold emailed that said they're not accepting new students this fall, ask them if they have any suggestions of other scholars to reach out to that may be of interest to you. That's how I ended up finding some scholars who have become very instrumental to my work.",
