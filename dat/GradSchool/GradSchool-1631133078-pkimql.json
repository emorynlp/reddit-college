  "text": "I\u2019m so proud of myself today. It\u2019s been about a month into the semester after being gone all summer doing an internship. I was so depressed and anxious all summer and the last month that I made the idea of going to the lab and running samples a huge deal in my head. Every day I would tell myself I need to go but I just couldn\u2019t drag myself out of the house to go. I literally went in, pressed two buttons, sorted out my samples, and then left. Talk about anxiety making a mountain out of a molehill. This is a huge step for me starting back up and getting things for my research going. I know what all I need to do, it\u2019s just so hard to get myself to do it sometimes. Any one else feeling stuck like I did?",

Like eventually I have a ton of stuff to do but I don't know why I keep acting like I need to get it all done in an afternoon. It's literally not even possible even if I weren't overwhelmed??\n\nGood job, Op. I think I'll go back to the lab on Monday (the next day I have more than half an hour) to sort my samples.",
