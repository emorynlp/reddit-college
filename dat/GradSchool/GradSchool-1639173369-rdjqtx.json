  "text": "I have no idea if What I\u2019m feeling is common for 2nd year PhD students or if it\u2019s just me. I\u2019m sure my major imposter syndrome isn\u2019t helping. It\u2019s so much more stressful trying to manage multiple things. \n\nI feel incredibly stupid. Some days are better than others, but this last part of the week has been especially tough. I received edits back from my PI for a draft of a review. He\u2019s a sweet guy and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean any ill intentions, but they took the little confidence that I had. \n\nI know I\u2019ll bounce back from this, I just didn\u2019t think that it would impact me this much.",

      "text": "Unless you're a certified genius (and maybe even then too) it would be odd if you didn't have imposter syndrome. The more we learn the more we realize just how much there is to learn (and how much we dont know) and that sense of accomplishment from obtaining an undergrad degree seems irrelevant and petty. The upside is that you realize just how much you don't know; instead of being a fool who thinks they know as much as people who have 10+ yrs of experience in their field. And the fact of the matter is that a panel of professors assessed you and found you to be worthy of being in their grad program, many others who applied were not so fortunate.",
