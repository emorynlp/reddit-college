  "text": "Hi! I applied to micro/immunology PhDs for fall \u201822. Most of the programs say that interviews are in late January, early February but don\u2019t say when you would hear if you have an interview. \n\nI am a bit of a planner and hate having no idea when I would hear. So if applications were due December 1st when did you hear about if you got an interview or not?",

Look up the specific programs you applied for and there will be historical data on interview notifications.\n\nI'm in a different biomedical field, but I received interview invites in the first two weeks of January for the Dec. 1st deadline with late January/early February interviews a few years back. It wouldn't suprise me if the timeline has shifted later a bit because many programs are still doing virtual interviews, which require less turn around time for things like hotel and travel.",
