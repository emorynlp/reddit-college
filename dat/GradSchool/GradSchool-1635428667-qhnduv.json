  "text": "Dear fellow postgrads, I just wanted to share this with you guys and well hopefully someone has an advice for me.\n\nMy group members are not proactive (for multiple modules), I sent them messages in the group chat and I tried reaching out to them in person but they were not present in class (online option is available because some students are still not vaccinated). The groups were formed randomly, I do not have any say. It makes me sad seeing my other classmates meeting up for group discussions and such, while I am stuck with my silent group. When I started the program I wanted to make the best out of it, but given this situation, I feel like the experience is limited in a way. I still hangout with other more proactive classmates, but group projects take like 50% of our time, so during this period of time my buddies are with their groups while I am mostly alone. This leads to the next part that the projects are not started until like 2 weeks or less before the deadline. In this short amount of time available we (my group and I) will scramble to put things together and submit just right before the deadline. Obviously the project is not well researched, there weren't much reflection in the report. Suffice to say the learning goal is only partially achieved, we are doing the work for the sake of doing it. I do not know the grade of the project yet since we are in the middle of the semester. PS: Projects are mostly case studies.\n\nBeing this unlucky makes me kind of depressed. What can I do? How can I improve my overall grad school experience? I would like to have some constructive relationships, like having a group of like-minded people and progress together. Doing this alone is just hard.",
