  "text": "Hello fellow grad students & those who made it!\n\nI'm a bit tired of trying and need a way to refresh my view to get out of apathy, I hope you could provide me some guidance.\n\nI feel I had a long and roundabout way to get to this point, despite I know from having talked to international postdocs etc, that I have it really great in the States. But I'm tired of trying that I want to give up.\n\nI put in enough efforts to finish my share of a couple of collaborative involvements, and almost wrap up 1 subproject and preliminary experiments on the other 2 subprojects of my own. I felt motivated but ever since my advisor revealed to not support my attempts at fellowships, I can't see a balanced give-and-take anymore, especially when my advisor criticizes me for a few things (which are valid points) but also threatens to take the subprojects away in reprimanding (which I don't feel are valid), all the while my subprojects are important part of grants that they are crafting with to apply.\n\nI am being dramatic but my mind just wonders to \"my cohort are trying and getting these fellowships, and if I can't even try, surely I can't compete in academia, and I'll just stay in the clinics anyways. Screw this PhD\" I'm tired.\n\nTired of putting night hours, weekend hours, only to see my peers look down on me because of my lack of output or awards.\n\nThe collaborative projects didn't lead to any publications (yet --positive thinking here) and I'm having trouble motivating myself that I'm blocking my own progress by not writing the manuscript for one of the sub projects.\n\nI know to continue the PhD it won't be a cakewalk. I feel I'll need to work hard just to get by with a mediocre one, or work exceptionally hard (as I had done all this time just to get here) to get an OK one.\n\nAt one point I thought I learned to pull myself up past the things thrown at me to get here, but I don't think so anymore as I'm drawing blank.\n\nHow can I reclaim my positive mindset I used to have?\n\nEDIT: I guess I was holding a massive self pity party. I'll keep this as a reminder to self not to make this kind of post. Any advice would still be appreciated, but I guess I'll just chug along for the time being.",

      "text": "You say you have lost your positive outlook because you feel like you are falling behind. Just to say it here, you probably aren't falling behind, there are a ton of grad students who have 0-1 publications in their 3rd or 4th year depending on length of program. Also, most students don't have fellowships. That's just an undisputed fact. Most academics weren't fellows during their PhD. You are comparing yourself to the most productive people and saying you are falling behind when I haven't heard anything that might suggest that. You are working on three projects in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. If anything, it sounds like you are working too hard. \n\nIf your advisor is unwilling to help you apply for fellowships and threatens you when you make a mistake, it sounds like you have a toxic advisor. I am going to say this as clearly as I can because people so often can't understand it: If you have a toxic advisor, it is not only okay, it is absolutely imperative, that you switch advisors. If they won't help you with a fellowship app now, are they going to help you get a post-doc fellowship later? Will they write you a good letter for a position? Will they do anything to help you succeed? Will you actually make it through grad school if you don't have a supportive advisor? It will never hurt you and will often help to switch advisors during grad school. A good advisor's research may not look exactly like yours, but they will be willing to help you develop the research that interests you anyway. Please please please consider this moving forward.",

          "text": "Thank you, and I appreciate the thorough reply. Perhaps I am indeed asking too much of myself, but the NIH F grants had been given out rather generously in my program (roughly 40% have been awarded in the past 3 years or so), so I definitely felt I should have at the least tried.\n\nI also appreciate your feedback on my mentor-mentee relationship, and sometimes I wonder if I will even get a proper letter of support after finishing.\n\nThat said, I must admit I was allowed the 3 subprojects because my advisor let me after all (perhaps I am gaslit, but I am truly appreciative of that).\n\nThe main concern / dissatisfaction I am identifying is that as a less established researcher, when push comes to the shove, they would pick their career advancement over mine, which is very human nature so I can't fault that. I joined thinking my success would be theirs and their success mine, but it didn't turn out to be.\n\nHence my current goal is to just lie low and allow their success to be mine as well, until I get that letter, and never look back since I won't have a future in academia.\n\n(The director of my program is understanding of my advisor's behavior, and that spoke to me that perhaps seeking another advisor is not warranted because objectively perhaps I do indeed suck, so I am saving that option until we cross the point of no return).\n\nAgain, I truly appreciate your feedback.",

              "text": "I'm going to push back a little to this for couple reasons: the director of your program wants you to stay for reasons that have nothing to do with you, too. Their whole job is to make sure the boat isn't rocked, so that might not be the best person to go to. Also, your advisor putting more work on your plate isn't exactly a huge win, and you shouldn't view it like that. If your advisor wants you to develop as a scientists, they will give you opportunities to do so, but they won't hold that over your head as a possible punishment. They will help you to develop knowing that you *aren't supposed to be* a fully developed scientist right now, otherwise you wouldn't be in grad school. They would be understanding of your lack of knowledge and help you to get from A to B.\n\nYou should be *very* critical of your advisor if they aren't providing you with learning opportunities, opting to solely provide you with work and failing to give you room to make mistakes. It is really hard to see this while being in the situation, but please please please consider how you might react to this 5-10 years from now and how this relationship could hurt, not help, your career goals whatever they end up being. Your future bosses, inside and outside of academia, will look to your advisor to know whether to hire you. You can't escape that. You can make it so you aren't just being taken advantage of with someone who doesn't actually see your future as important to them.\n\nLaying low is not going to help your career goals either. Consider how best to use your time now, and whether working with another advisor could be much more helpful for you as a person and a scientist now and in the future. \n\nedit to add: Them picking their career advancements over yours may be human nature, but it also is a very very very bad trait of an advisor. And your success WILL BE theirs, too. If they are so shortsighted not to see that, don't give them the time of day. Rant over.",

      "text": "I think to some degree, it's important to remember that research is your job - it's not going to feel great 100% of the time. There are a lot of annoying things you need to do (like writing up experimental sections, applying to grants, etc.) that feel like they're getting in the way of the things you enjoy doing (designing and executing experiments, etc.).\n\nThe thing is that you're probably never going to feel super positive about doing those annoying things, but you need to do them anyway. The most productive graduate students/postdocs I've known aren't even necessarily super passionate about their work (I'm sure they are, but it's irrelevant). Rather, they always worked on the correct \"next step\" even if it was something they found annoying. No dodging writing something up by working on a side project, no spending time unnecessarily fiddling around with an analysis when they should have been making figures for a grant application.",

          "text": "Thank you. Those are very good points, especially the latter. After all I do get a W-2 form. I'll try to keep my head down and work through this.\n\nI will however stand up for myself on this front **for the last time** that while it is my implied duty to perform experiments (which I have very well) and other associated process (which I will), it is also an implied duty of my advisor to train me. Otherwise they should have opted for a technician / postdoc (even postdoc has a training component implied), but we all know why (below).\n\nMy advisor broke my trust in them that they'll let me learn and grow by writing fellowship grant application, by blocking opportunities for me to try. It's been demoralizing to not even have thrown my hat in the ring, regardless of my chances. It goes both ways.\n\nI got no white lies left to tell myself to keep working hard, because I know that all I do at this point is make my advisor's junior-faculty level CV look better with a few publications and a training track saying they trained an MD PhD student.",
