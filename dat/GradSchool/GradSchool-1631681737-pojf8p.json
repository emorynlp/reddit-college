  "text": "I recently was accepted to Northwestern\u2019s part time MPPA program. Although the MPPA program is not ranked. I\u2019m curious how good the program is, or why it\u2019s not ranked. I\u2019ve read a bunch about it obviously on NW\u2019s website, but I\u2019m concerned about it\u2019s non-rank. I\u2019m not someone super obsessed with rankings, but it worries me a little. TIA for any insight anyone can provide!",

I haven\u2019t looked at northwestern per se but some programs with public affairs or mppa are clearly more liberal and might not be as hard\u2026 a lot more geared towards potentially a PhD than a professional program \n\nBut it does kind of show that a program has alumni more likely\u2026\n\nOne issue with mpa along with mba is sometimes alumni connections are what get you in\u2026 unfornately.\n\nThere\u2019s a big stigma especially in local government and even nonprofit that \u201cducks pick ducks\u201d and that if a manager sees a resume with a similar college they may favor that because they went through the same rigor in comparison to a school they don\u2019t know.",
