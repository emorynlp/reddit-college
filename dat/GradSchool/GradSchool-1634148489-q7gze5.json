  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI hope you don't mind posting my story from Engineering PhD to building a Bank.\n\n**We want to change the world -> I heard this way too many times.**\n\nA few years ago, I was a PhD student at University College London. I was working on how blood flow affects inflammation of blood vessels, an important topic for Aneurysm and Atherosclerosis treatment.\n\nThe schedule was tough. I was at work 9am-8pm, seven days a week looking after my cell cultures and developing software for our analyses, all in the hope that my efforts would improve and lengthen lives in future.\u00a0\n\nYet I was just  about scraping by.\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, I had friends working similar schedules at banks making many times my salary. And what did they need when they were sick? The medicine produced off the back of research people like me were doing! It didn\u2019t feel quite right.\n\nStrangely enough, it was a visiting pharmaceutical rep who clarified things for me. He was at the lab to try and sell us equipment, but all I really remember from his visit is this: In passing, he told me, \u2018If the big banks donated 1% of their profits to scientific research, cancer would be cured today.\u2019\n\nOf course, there is some simplification to this statement. It was part of his sales spiel. But there is also a core kernel of truth - there is banking and corporate money out there that could easily be invested into STEM research, but instead it goes straight into private pockets.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem fair to me at the time, and later, once I had finished my PhD and moved on to a career in Fintech, it made me furious. Why was there this rift between what scientists make, and what people working in tech and banking make? And if more money went into science, couldn\u2019t breakthroughs be made faster?\n\nI was acutely aware of the many issues, medical, environmental, social, that could be solved by an injection of cash into the underfunded world of STEM.\n\nSoon, I got sick of being angry. I had to change things. And I was in a position to do so. I could combine the source of money, a bank, with Science!\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s when Science Bank was born.\u00a0\n\nWe can\u2019t change what all the big banks are doing (not yet at least), but we can create a new model for a mission-driven bank that gives back to science.\u00a0\n\n**Science Bank is going to make a stand. We\u2019re putting research over bonuses.**\n\nHow does a normal highstreet bank operate?\n\nWe can take a look at Barclays as an example.\n\nBarclays Bank made a net profit of \u00a34.3 billion in 2019. Most of this went to shareholders and bonuses, as well as making huge stock buybacks. But if only 5% of these profits were instead invested in scientific research (an investment of \u00a3218 million), the UK\u2019s STEM research funding would be increased by a whopping 6.3%. Breaking that down to brass tacks, Barclays could sponsor up to 726 research projects per year.\n\nCan you imagine the kind of breakthroughs that might lead to?\n\nBut we stand out because we have a mission. We\u2019re here to advance society by investing in science, technology, and ultimately help build a sustainable future.\u00a0\n\nEvery year Science Bank will accumulate an investment pot derived from our revenues and customer contributions. The investments will then be distributed to various research projects by our scientific committee, which will consist of 20 academics of high stature in national academies.\n\nWhat does that mean for our customers?\u00a0\n\nEvery one of our customers will feel secure in the fact that they are doing good with their money, even when it is sitting safely in a bank account.\n\nOn top of that, they will be offered the chance to own shares in any companies that emerge from the research we fund.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the long-term draw. In the short-term, we offer our customers unbeatable usability, excellent customer service, and state of the art data visualisations that will allow them to see how they use their money in a whole new way.\u00a0\n\nWe also plan to add unique cashback opportunities with tech companies and universities, the ability to invest in a broad spectrum from startups to stocks to crypto, and lastly offer accounts in stablecoins that will enable almost instant currency changes.\u00a0\n\nThe first step, though? Building Science Bank. Which we hope to do with your help.\n\n[www.science-bnk.com](https://www.science-bnk.com/) \\- Subscribe and support.  \"We will add the \"A\" once the banking license is approved, until then we are a card provider.\" Subscribe and support!",
