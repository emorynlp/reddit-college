So instead, I focus on building my own personal website and work on updating all of my accomplishments and goals there. It removes the \u201csocial media\u201d aspect of publicizing your accomplishments and greatly benefitted me mentally by having my own domain and going to there frequently to avoid imposter syndrome on LinkedIn.\n\nWith having a personal website, you can also form a smaller community of professionals that actually will support your growth. I personally linked my personal website on my summary on LinkedIn because the ones who don\u2019t care about my work will not visit my website. The ones who do will make the regular effort to check on my progress and development as a professional.",

Most of my connections are strangers I reached out to and I've found LinkedIn incredibly helpful in this way. Gotten so much amazing advice from amazing people.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that impressive individuals don't need to post on LinkedIn to prove their worth - their work speaks for itself. The most intelligent and capable people I know have a succinct LinkedIn page and only really post about recent developments in the field they're passionate about - rarely of their own accomplishments unless it's truly exceptional.\n\nPoint is, a talented person doesn't need to post about their accomplishments because they don't value external validation to make themselves feel special, they already know they are. LinkedIn is just a pissing contest and it's hard to find genuinely accomplished people on it.",

But the reality is that everyone has their own timeline and each event (good or bad) happens for a reason. I try to steer away from LinkedIn because I don\u2019t see a lot of posts that show people who also fail. While sharing successes are great, I do wish I could see more authentic posts. I deal with this by reminding myself that I\u2019m not like those LinkedIn people because 1) we\u2019re different and 2) our goals and experiences are different hence why each event happens at a specific time. I also don\u2019t have the app so it helps me to not check it :)",

And that\u2019s how I was able to apply for grad school which is something I never thought I would do!
