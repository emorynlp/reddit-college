  "text": "I\u2019m 20 years old and I relocated entire my life to attend graduate school and I took 12 credit hours this semester. 3 credit hours more than the recommended amount. Anyways, I had a 3.8 GPA when started grad school, now I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to change.\nAs many of you would know, anything below a 80% is not accredited to graduate school grades. In all four my classes I\u2019ve earned C\u2019s on them. I feel like a complete failure and I just want to give up on grad school in general. How do you y\u2019all cope with not passing a course? Should I retake the courses again? I dont know, I just need advice on this and what should I do next.",

Are you absolutely certain of this for your program? \n\nBit of a bizarrely specific case, but I'm completing a dual MS where one program requires that 80% baseline, and one doesn't. \n\nA C in one isn't ideal for GPA minimum requirements, but still counts. A C for the other doesn't count for the program.  \n\nYour first step is to figure that out one way or another for sure. If I were in your situation, I'd start with the registrar's office (I work in university admissions and have to ask them weird questions, they tend to know this stuff), and if you don't get a clear answer or want confirmation, ask them to direct you to your college department and ask there.\n\nA set of Cs isn't ideal GPA-wise, but that should let you know where you stand in terms of program progress.",
