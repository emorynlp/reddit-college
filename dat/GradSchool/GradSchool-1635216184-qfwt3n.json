  "text": "So this is more like a rant. I\u2019m only 5 weeks into my first quarter as an English PhD and it\u2019s literally making me realize I\u2019m completely clueless and not even in the good, ignorance is bliss kind of way. \n\nI have NO research background. I\u2019m a first gen college student too from a low-income immigrant background. And I only a gist of what I want to study with seminars that are super unhelpful because they\u2019re not in my field. I know I have time to discuss what I can research with my advisors who are (thankfully) very kind. But in my seminar courses I feel like an idiot. Everything I\u2019m saying and doing is at an undergrad level I\u2019m sure because I\u2019m the only one without an MA in my cohort. They\u2019re all using words I\u2019ve never heard of, honing in one their interests and I\u2019m just like teetering on the edge of nothing. My discussions aren\u2019t really substantive and even my discussions board posts feel like there\u2019s a silly nobody posting an optimistic comparison of critical works we read without tying back anything to what we\u2019ve discussed in class. \n\nA small part of me thinks it\u2019s because what we are talking about doesn\u2019t interest me\u2014for example, I\u2019m doing a book history course and we talk about archival work that I don\u2019t really care about. A huge part of me thinks it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the thinking skills to be argumentative and thoughtful.  My book history class leaves me EXHAUSTED by the end of it. My only happy thought  is (once again) I\u2019m the only 1st year with no background in research and I\u2019m surrounded by upperclassmen, so of course I\u2019m going to feel like an idiot who can barely read. \n\nI\u2019m flailing and imposter syndrome is just beating me to a pulp. I\u2019m so worried that I have nothing to write for seminar papers and even if I come up with something that my writing will be total rubbish. I don\u2019t plan on talking to my advisors about my feelings because I know they\u2019ll say \u201ceveryone feels this way\u201d and \u201cbut we chose you to be here so clearly you belong!\u201d I DO plan on going to the writing center to get help for my papers. \n\nI also have book lists and do my own preliminary basic research on interests I want to focus on. I also take it easy and just get back into the mode of critical thinking that kinda died because of a gap year between COVID and my acceptance to the program. I know I want to stay in the program until they kick me out lmao so I\u2019m not going anywhere but it\u2019s been rough. \n\nAnyways sorry for the rant. I hope others who feel like me get a sense of solidarity I guess. And I welcome any advice from people who once were in my place.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t overthink it! If you\u2019re not interested or you\u2019re not good at it, it\u2019s likely just because nothing is easy at first, even if you do have a research background. I can look back on myself as a first year and remember how clueless and stupid and out of place I felt and how I never imagined myself feeling the way I do now, like I know a lot and am figuring out what I like and what I\u2019m good at. I work in an interdisciplinary department and my interests are pretty specific so I\u2019m bored, uninterested or straight up lost in so many seminars, but over the years I\u2019ve gotten better about being able to get something, even the tiniest thing like what a good title slide looks like, out of most talks - not intentionally, just with time. I\u2019ve gotten better at reading papers, forming questions, having original ideas, etc., all things I was really insecure about during my first year. \n\nThere\u2019s also a lot to be said about understanding what you don\u2019t like, what you\u2019re not interested in, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and which skills you can improve. A lot of my non-interests and the things I\u2019m not good at have stayed pretty consistent over the years, but there are lots of interests that I\u2019ve honed in on and skills that I\u2019ve improved (and picked up). I don\u2019t feel inept or dumb for still not knowing things or not being as skilled as my peers, but it\u2019s helped me realize what my values are, what will make me happy in a career, and what kinds of jobs I\u2019m absolutely not interested in, whether because they bore me or because they require skills I don\u2019t prioritize. You can\u2019t be good at everything! I\u2019m not suggesting you give up on having good technical skills because you\u2019d rather work in communications, but think about what aligns with your values and interests and keep in mind that these things will change with time. I still feel like an impostor when my colleagues go on about their work or just seem really interested in what they do or what others do or are more passionate than me, but I\u2019ve realized that I *do* have passions and skills but they don\u2019t align with the majority of my colleagues and that\u2019s fine. \n\nTry keeping a running list of the things you\u2019ve improved in - how long does it take you to read a paper compared to your first time? Did you manage to formulate a question during seminar? Did you learn something new? Did you find a new interest? I also suggest talking about this with your peers and/or a counselor if you have one available. Lots of people are either faking it or are just good at presenting themselves as well and successful (even if they\u2019re not intentionally hiding their impostor syndrome) so it\u2019s good to be in touch with how others are really doing",

          "text": "Hi! Thanks so much for your reply. I\u2019m definitely writing a ton of notes and keeping track of what I\u2019ve found very interesting in the topics that otherwise are completely outside my area of interest. I plan on sending emails to upperclassmen in my field to touch base with them. My cohort is pretty chatty but they\u2019re so vocal about their interests and research and never worry about their writing that I pretty much figured they\u2019re a few steps ahead of me. Bad thinking on my part for sure. Thanks so much for your insight again!",

      "text": ">I\u2019m so worried that I have nothing to write for seminar papers and even if I come up with something that my writing will be total rubbish.\n\nYou're on the quarter system in the US? Then you have 5 weeks left? \n\nIf so, you want to talk to your professors *this week* and figure out your topics for your seminar papers. And if you wait to get in touch with them, you might miss their office hours this week.\n\nIn graduate literature seminars where you have one major paper, the expectation is typically that you put way more work into the papers then you ever did as an undergrad. \n\nAnd the writing needs to be better than anything you ever did in undergrad. Best to give yourself at least a couple full days just for fine-tuning a solid draft, editing it, and proofreading it.\n\nNow once you start immersing yourself in research, thinking about your topics for your papers, and taking notes, then you'll start to develop more confidence. \n\nBut don't wait anymore. Use your professors to help you get started. And if they're not asking for rough draft submissions during class, you can ask at this meeting if you can meet with them again in a few weeks to discuss a rough draft.",

          "text": "Hi! Thanks for your response. I usually do everything ahead of time to give myself chances to double back and read things I didn\u2019t understand or rewrite. Which is always lmao. I have a gist of what I\u2019m going to write about for my courses. It\u2019s getting my writing to graduate level work that\u2019s going to be the kicker which is why I\u2019ll go to their office hours or the writing center. They haven\u2019t really talked about what they want yet. Both said \u201cpapers 15-20 pages or projects\u201d but in their syllabus and class they said they\u2019d give us more info later so it\u2019s pretty tough to get anything written if they don\u2019t have a plan themselves. But I should definitely chat with them more now like you said. I\u2019ll definitely take your advice. Thanks again!",
