  "text": "Title!\n\nI feel like whenever I read a paper, no matter how many notes I take (I use obsidian), I can never remember what I actually read. But whenever I'm in lab meeting with my other grad students they're able to cite with ease findings from other papers and link it to our work. Or my PI who has an almost photographic memory on papers (citing the author/journal mid conversation)",

      "text": "You don't. At least, you don't read a handful of papers and expect to recall their every detail with photographic detail.\n\nRead in quantity, with regularity, and at speed. Learn how to skim a paper effectively (abstract>conclusion>intro), and use this skill to peruse a great breadth of literature, only stopping to do deep dives on the ones you find truly interesting. Consider setting up an RSS journal feed and make a habit of keeping up on it. Immerse yourself in the literature of your tiny subfield and eventually you will start to see patterns. You'll begin to recognize authors by their techniques and unique approaches. You'll start to develop a holistic understanding of the state of work in your field. And one beautiful day, there'll be a heated discussion in lab meeting and you'll realize you have pertinent literature details to contribute -- not because you tried to memorize them, but because your brain soaked up ambient science like meat in a nice marinade.",

Gotta say, it has been very useful advice.\n\nYour goal is to understand the topic not the paper, the paper/a paper/any paper  is only a tool, a stepping stone in that direction. Your PI probably remembers the gist and the zinger of the paper and not the excruciating details and also it is easier to remember papers and their authors when you meet the authors in person. ( Does your PI go to a lot of conferences and seminar and is s/he active in networking?)\n\nWhenever I read something I do it to find a specific piece of information. \n\nFor example,if I want to add something to my experiment design and need direction on that then I find something as close as possible to the task at hand, find the information and move on with my life. \n\nI only keep in mind the the structure of the current input and current expected output of the step in my experiment that I am executing. Hell, I barely remember the output of the previous step and will have to look it over if that need arises.\n\nI can only comment on my own field and YMMV depending on a million factors.

That makes it easier to recall who did which paper.",

The information just flows past in a continuous stream and mostly vanishes.  In order to get anything into long term memory, you have to process it somehow. \n\nOne of the most effective and accessible ways to do this when you're studying is to explain it to someone else (even your cat, or the wall) using your own words.  It helps to break your reading into chunks-- subsections or paragraphs, depending on how dense the text is. \n\nYour notes can help you do this. Summarize the main ideas of each section in your own words, using just a few sentences. Then use those notes as a reference to teach someone else the material, even if you're just talking out loud to a poster. Good luck!",
