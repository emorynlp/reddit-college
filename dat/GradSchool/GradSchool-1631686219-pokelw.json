  "title:": "Any STEM TA's seeing a severe lack of math knowledge in their students this semester? I'm at a complete loss.",
  "text": "This semester, I'm a TA for my university's differential equations class. It's my first semester as a TA, and I am really shocked at the lack of math skills in a lot of my students. It's almost as if they completely skipped calculus and went straight into this class.\n\nThe mistakes I am seeing in my student's work is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I'm seeing students getting completely wrong answers for simple derivatives and integrals, students not remembering basic calculus/algebra rules, and students not remembering their unit circle/parent functions. I'm spending more time in office hours teaching students how to take the integral of e^(-t) and the rules of logarithms than helping people with differential equations.\n\nLast week, I gave them a quiz straight from their homework and was essentially a calculus 1/algebra 2 problem, and the average was a 4.8/10. I'm really trying to give students points for their work, but often the work is so wrong that I can't give any credit besides a single point for attempting the problem. I also had multiple students leave their quiz blank. I glanced over their quiz they just took (again, a problem taken straight from their homework), and it's looking like the average will be worse this time.\n\nFor those who taught stem classes before (especially before the pandemic), has it always been this bad? I don't remember it being this bad when I took this class in 2017, and the students I've previously tutored didn't do this poorly. Could the year and a half of online learning have something to do with it? Are the standards really this low, and I never realized it?",

      "text": "Not exactly relevant to the question you're asking, but I would swap STEM for more field specific terms.  I do not study mathematics, I don't use mathematics in this sense, and what you're saying here I wouldn't have a clue.  I'm definitively in a STEM field.  Maybe I'm being touchy.  But overall, probably the year of distanced learning has negatively impacted learning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess part of my point is, are the students taking the class supposed to explicitly know this knowledge outside of them being a STEM field?",

      "text": "Honestly, I was the \"no math\" student when I started my Masters. I went from a biology major where knowing Calculus 1 was considered great, to a CS major that was expected to know and understand Calculus III. \n\nHonestly, my experiences being taught math in HS and University were abysmal. I ended up hiring a tutor for all four years of HS, because my math teacher couldn't be bothered to teach (he refused to read our textbook, and said he did not want to be there). When I got to University, my professor was knowledgeable, but his favourite phrase was \"you should know this already\". As I'm sure any math professor knows - if you don't follow one single step, then you won't be able to understand the rest of the problem. When I went to him for office hours, he just screamed at me for not understanding \"basic polynomial math\" - it doesn't inspire confidence. \n\nI think it's a mixture of programs like Matlab, PhotoMath and Chegg, but I also think some of the blame lies with poor math education starting from the post-secondary level.",

          "text": "I appreciate the input. Math always came easy to me, and I was fortunate to have great teachers along the way, so it's nice to hear experiences from people where it was not the case. I definitely agree that the math education system is failing students in the US, not just because of experiences like yours, but also what is expected from students in general.\n\nIt's good you brought up about the phrase \"you should know this already,\" since that can cause microagressions. I'm not trying to cause that, and I know that I basically said that phrase in my post, but the reality is that they really do need to remember their calculus if they want to succeed in this class. I also agree that positive feedback is the best way to get your students to improve, so I guess for now I need to keep encouraging my students to push through and remind them of the calculus concepts they need to know.",

The scary part is when they truly believe what they have done is actually legitimate math and try to argue with me that they deserve full marks...",

I'm truly scared for how their first midterm will go if the work is this bad already.",

      "text": "How does your university teach calculus and below? For example, I never really learned the unit circle. I was introduced to the idea of it in high school, but was taught to derive the trig identities from the Pythagorean theorem and the quadrants. My mathematics education was a lot less memorization and a lot more derivation. \n\nIn calculus at college, it didn't matter how we got the angles/identities we needed, so long as we got them. So consider how your university teaches all this and try to align with them.\n\nThat said, math is easily forgotten. Having the summer off could be enough to forget stuff. I made it through college without really knowing logarithm rules. They're not as intuitive as everything else and honestly are only really learned through sheer memorization. When I really needed them for a graduate class, I spent an hour watching Khan Academy videos and was set for that particular class.\n\nDo you give out a table of integrals and derivatives or have one you can point to at the back of the book? If you handhold less, they'll have to do more of the work themselves. Memorization comes from doing it themselves. You might also have a tutoring center you can send them towards. If you do all the work for them in office hours, they have no incentive to change anything. You should guide them through the problem, not do it for them.",

I will try to get them started and ask them \"what do we do next?\" But often the students will either have no idea what they're doing or get the basics completely wrong that I feel like I have no choice but to go back and explain those parts again. They take very detailed notes from lecture, but they don't understand what exactly they're looking at. Like you said, I can understand if a student doesn't immediately remember how to do a partial fraction decomposition, but the stuff they don't remember is way more basic and fundamental than that. \n\nMy undergrad institution had pretty much the same calculus and differential equations curriculum, and the student body demographics are pretty similar. When I took calculus and differential equations in 2016/2017, I saw averages of around 60-75%, and when comparing my work to classmates, I saw work that was very good, minus some mistakes here and there. Now, the work is far below that mark, and the presentation of their work is, at times, incoherent. I really think that the online learning has something to do with this.
