  "text": "I had a huge assignment worth 8 % of my grade for one of my classes. I thought it was due this Thursday and I went to submit it on what I thought was 2 days early to realize I was 4 days late.  No assignments are accepted past 3 days.  The damn thing took me over 10 hours of work for nothing, and now I\u2019m getting a 0 \ud83d\ude43.\n\nI need to maintain a B to stay in my program, and now I need to get 100% on everything from here on out to make it. Even then I\u2019m not sure that will be enough. \n\nJust my general I want to scream emotion for today.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone for the advice. I reached out to the professor, fingers crossed I can still submit it.\n\nEdit 2: thanks to everyone, the prof is letting me do an extra credit assignment worth less points. If I do well on that, it will be the equivalent of getting a 70% on the real assignment. I\u2019ll take it!!",

My experience is more being on the other end of things - I TA a foundational course in my program, and the professor is always willing to work things out for the most part; a big component of the class grade is completing problem sets.

Taking even a fifty, which could also turn out to be much higher, is waaaaay better than eating a zero.",

In undergrad, I apparently forgot to attach the actual assignment or something and my prof emailed me after the due date asking about it. (maybe I uploaded an incomplete version? Idr) I took my laptop to his office and showed him the complete assignment and the time stamp of the last edits. In grad school, I thought the final paper for a class was due the last day of the semester and got an email a few days before (when I wasn't quite done) from my prof checking in on me, asking if all was well. I apologized, explained I had the due date wrong, and got it to him the next day. Not every prof is gonna be so chill, ofc, but you probably have a lot of leeway if you're honest and upfront and have been a good student so far. Let us know!",

If it was questionable, I'd accept the assignment submission as a maybe and make a determination to see if a sincere effort was made. If a problem student came to me with this story, I'd tell them it was their responsibility.  \n\n\nIf you contact the instructor and this ends up working, you cannot do this again.
