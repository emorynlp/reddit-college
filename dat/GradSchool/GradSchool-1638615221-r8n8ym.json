  "title:": "[need advice] help me finish my thesis in 2 months!",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my final year of my masters degree and should\u2019ve been submitting my thesis next week but due to fear of failure/ not wanting to be seen as I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing/ being unrealistic with how much I could accomplish in a set amount of time with other study commitments going on at the same time and also general covid burnout I procrastinated and didn\u2019t ask for help. I want to work hard on it for the next two months over the holidays and submit come February. I know I need to just start writing, break down the chapters I have to write into small achievable tasks but I\u2019m dreading getting back into just because of how much work I have to do to get to the end. Please help.",

      "text": "First of all, I totally understand your feelings. They're the exact same feelings I have that cause me to procrastinate. It sounds like you know what you need to do. My advice is to start with the objective stuff. Write out the methods and data analysis plan first. Start with whatever piece feels most concrete. I get so overwhelmed starting with the background because there is just an endless amount I could include. But once you know what the important takeaways from the research are you can tailor your background to match them and avoid rabbit holes. If you could do one thing today, write the overall outline of what your dissertation needs to include. Then start hacking away at the pieces. Also having an accountability buddy helps a lot. I'm working on my doctoral dissertation right now and want to go hard the next two months and defend in February. If you want to do some virtual co-working sessions I'd be down. Feel free to pm me.",
