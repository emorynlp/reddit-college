  "text": "I'm thinking about doing a PhD in the UK, specifically applying to a program like Gates Cambridge. My PI said it's difficult to come back to the US for a post doc if I do a PhD abroad. I don't know where I'd want to live and work that far out, but wanted to get another perspective on this? Thanks!",
