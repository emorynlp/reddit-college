  "title:": "Struggling with TA Position",
  "text": "I just started a STEM PhD at a large state school 4 weeks ago. I\u2019m currently TAing a 1000 level course in my discipline (I took it myself in undergrad many years ago) and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being very beneficial to my students. I teach two small, group-work based lecture supplements (students show up for participation points in addition to the lecture) and two full labs a week, roughly 80 students in all. \nEvery week I think I understand the material (I\u2019ve done it all, haven\u2019t I?) , and every week I find myself forgetting key points or making simple mistakes that confuse my class (and embarrass me). I try to prepare to teach but always find myself doing it last minute, behind my own research and class work. I\u2019m currently rotating in a demanding lab (that I love) so my time is stretched more thinly than usual, but it\u2019s still not fair to my classes. \nI want to help my students succeed, but I\u2019m having trouble prioritizing my TA work over all the other work I need to do. Obviously the answer is to spend more time preparing to teach, but it often feels impossible when I\u2019m so overwhelmed already. I\u2019m worried that faculty and other TA\u2019s will think I\u2019m incompetent, and I\u2019m even more worried that my students\u2019 grades will suffer because of me. I\u2019m anxious and exhausted, and it\u2019s only week 4 of my first year. If anyone has any tips for lesson planning/alleviating the guilt and embarrassment of fucking up the most basic topics in my discipline, that would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Teaching and taking classes and trying to do research at the same time is ROUGH. I'm very proud of you for doing it. Remember you're being paid to TA now, it's your current priority. If your rotation lab doesn't understand that, think about if it's the kind of lab you want to end up in.\n\nI highly recommend you try and find someone else who's TAing the same class and prep together every week. It's more helpful than trying to do it yourself, and you can bounce things off of each other instead of trying to catch every detail yourself. Also, remember \"I'll get back to you with that answer soon, I want to take a minute to think\" is a valid answer to your students. \n\nI hope your semester gets a bit easier as you get into a system, but know the end is already in sight and you're doing better than you think.",
