  "text": "I just had an undergrad email and ask if I can come in to the school tomorrow (Saturday) so that they can go over the previous tests with me before they take the final exam. I have office hours Monday-Friday. I enjoy my weekends and use them as a reset. I don't get the mindset of some undergrads, they drive me nuts! Some apparently think I have a cot set up in my office, sleep there, and have nothing else in my life of importance going on.",

I've had friends in the very same situation who attempted that back in undergrad, or just think back to how finals period could be pretty stressful if that ever happened to you.\n\nThat being said, you have the option to refuse. You don't have to do it if you don't want to and you shouldn't get punished or shamed for it. Personally, I do it on a case-by-case basis, e.g. if that student asked me well in advance or he/she showed great difficulty in learning the material no matter and needed more office hours.",

A lot of times, students are extremely busy during the week. I knew one kid who was working, taking 18+ units (in a quarter system!), and was taking care of his grandfather at night some days during the week. I\u2019ve met countless students who were also taking a ridiculous amount of units while also working 35+ hours a week. \n\nDo you need to go in on a weekend to accommodate these students? Of course not, your weekends are your weekends and anybody who says otherwise is ridiculous. But to flat out ridicule or make fun of a student for asking is wrong, as you never know what\u2019s going on in that his/her\u2019s life and might just be asking out of pure desperation. \n\nI\u2019m just ranting because I\u2019m in my first year of grad school at my alma mater, and I\u2019m just getting to REALLY know my previous undergrad professors. And it astonishes me how out of touch some of them are about their students.",

It\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t have to go in on weekends, but it\u2019s also not that unusual for graduate students as a whole.\n\nThe student could have been asking without meaning to be a dick about it.",

I didn't downvote you but I can give you a sympathy upvote because votes are super meaningful. \n\nI just think it's intriguing that a student who hasn't e-mailed or come to office hours all semester asked if there's any way I could come in to campus on a Saturday and now wants help during finals week. I would feel differently if they emailed early in the week and we couldn't work something out during the week. Emailing at 6pm on a Friday asking if I can come meet him in the morning the next day just seems drastic to me.",

Then she asks at the end of the semester if she can still somehow make it up and we told her if she submitted the last report, she might be able to sign an incomplete contract and finish later. So a few weeks go by, she never submits a report, deadline for reports passed like a week ago, all of my finals are over, my deadline for grading has past, and I have to post final letter grades by Monday, and she emails tonight asking if she can somehow still finish things and get me to grade them. She's taken this class twice before and wants to graduate next semester... I'm like \"no, I've done everything I can for you. This isn't my responsibility anymore\" sorry, your experience just felt too familiar. You made the right choice. Enjoy your weekend. It's on them for not using your office hours",
