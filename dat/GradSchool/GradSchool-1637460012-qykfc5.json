  "text": "I have two close girlfriends, one I genuinely consider my best friend. I see her a decent amount; we have lulls where we don't see each other for two weeks, but that's it. The other girl I am close to was my best friend. She excludes me from hangouts in her main friend group, and honestly, it hurts. I am in a post-bachelors, but after I plan on applying to grad school, I will probably go for a Ph.D. I would love to make more friends in my Ph.D. I'm interested in physics, so I know there aren't as many girls, but they are there. Just wondering if meeting best friends in grad school happen to some people or is completely unrealistic.",

I have made very few friendships that go past work colleagues so far, but I'm also very bad at making friends or going out of my way to be social. My girlfriend has made several friends so far, some of which she considers some of her closest currently. You will have plenty of opportunities to mingle, if you put in more effort than me I think it's reasonably possible to make good friends.",

      "text": "I met a girl at orientation who ended up in several of my classes and we glommed onto each other because we didn't know anyone else. She introduced me to another girl in our classes and we quickly became a very close little trio. We don't have classes together anymore but we're all still very close and I'm confident they're going to be lifelong friends. Other than them, my whole cohort is full of wonderful people and we all help each other.\n\nHanging out at school between classes, especially if your school has a graduate lounge, is excellent for getting to know people. Group chats are also great but you have to be careful bc they can sometimes turn toxic.\n\nYou'll find friends :) I am NOT one to start conversations but I still found my people!",

It will require more effort and it\u2019s harder these days living in the new pandemic era but it\u2019s doable. \n\nYou will need to put effort. Ive made a ton of friends during my PhD and have 6 friendships that I believe will be long lasting. I made sure to join a good mix of hobbies and of those 6 grad school friends I mentioned, 3 aren\u2019t in my department and 2 of them while grad students, aren\u2019t even in STEM like myself.  \n\nWhat I did was go to university hosted grad events.. both campus wide and department. Made efforts to reach out to and get numbers of those who we hit it off well.. and within one week of that I\u2019d text to hang out. Often grabbing lunch together on campus and then going from there.",

With all the hours spent together in lab and the need to rely on each other through all the challenges of grad school, we became really great friends. She\u2019s now one of my bridesmaids. I\u2019d say in general it depends on how social you are, how much work you put into it and if you happen to find  people you have stuff in common with. I made plenty of other friends in grad school but none became particularly close (especially enough to survive past grad school) except for this one but I\u2019m not very good at making friends in general since I don\u2019t like to go out much and grad school made balancing a social life with my romantic relationship and my family hard enough without having to add in the complexity of friends. With her and I in the same lab however that allowed for a lot more time together than I would\u2019ve been able to handle if it needed to be in \u201coff\u201d hours.",

Although things can change because I have more core classes to take, I can see myself in a theoretical field such as theoretical physics or computer science. In some theoretical programs, you still do modeling/programming in a lab, but I heard that it can be a lot of independent work doing math all day in others. I love it, but if everyone is isolated doing math all day, it may be hard to make friends.\n\nedit: it was supposed to say I'm sorry that you haven't had much luck! damn Grammarly lol",

The department where I am now is cliquey, and students rarely interact with those outside of their research group/area. As the only CS student in my research group, and as someone in a niche area, those circles basically never include me.",

I'd probably make friends with people outside those areas, too, but they spend a lot of time with their groups, so it's not as likely. Maybe you'll meet someone along the way; I wish you luck :)",
