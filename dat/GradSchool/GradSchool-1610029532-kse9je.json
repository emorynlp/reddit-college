  "text": "There is so much going on in US & World politics. My friends think I want to talk about politics and government all of the time because it\u2019s my area of focus - which is understandable. I mean I didn\u2019t go into field *not* interested in how government operates or wanting to affect change meaningfully. \n\nBut holy shit. I am overwhelmed with news. It seems major political events are happening all of the time lately and I am not processing things quick enough. People treat politics as a a dinner discussion but I engage with it for my career. It feels inescapable now.\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t have any implications on my career. I just don\u2019t know how to set boundaries for something that is so interwoven into my life.",

      "text": "I'm in a political science adjacent line of research and there's never a point where I want to talk about it. I often lie about my research interests because if I'm honest about what I study, random people seem to take that as an invitation to offer their two cents. I've been stuck in an Uber ride where the driver just went off about politics after I told him what I did, and I had those kinds of experiences so often I usually just make something up now. My parents also have politics on TV for at least 12 hours a day (literally). When I watch TV, it's Forensic Files, the First 48, or My 600lb Life.\n\nI always hated political science because it's the least political of the social sciences and I think more often than not is just a forum for over privileged white heterosexuals to talk dispassionately about a system they created to benefit them. Those of us who belong to marginalized groups have to live with the consequences of these systems, and therefore talking dispassionately is not often practicable when polices or systemic structures impact our ability to enjoy equal citizenship in this country. I don't really think it would have much implications for your career. I follow several political scientists on Twitter who say some very forceful things on social media and nobody really pays any mind to it. \n\nAs far as setting boundaries, my general practice is whenever someone brings up politics, I just politely let them know I'm not interested in talking about politics since I study it for a living and find it exhausting. If they keep bringing it up, I become more firm and less polite the longer they continue to disrespect my request.",

If anything, being too eager to opine is a risk. You can set boundaries by directing the conversation towards your particular sub-field, or simply saying that you don't feel like talking about work.",

This is my field, so I am responsible for speaking and acting professional when discussing it, regardless of circumstance.\n\nIf someone asks me about politics, I am going to give them a clear, accessible answer, but that is explicit and gravitational. If they aren\u2019t understanding a concept, I\u2019ll teach them. However, I find that most don\u2019t want to be taught: they mistaken me as a political and policy specialist who is an appropriate sparring partner for them to debate their minimally-researched theories informed by NBC or Fox, orient it almost exclusively around their country\u2019s politics, and then get mad when I tell them they are wrong in their methods while trying to walk them through how to find minimally biased information. \n\nI don\u2019t say no, since it is my job to be able to reach out to all kinds of people and facilitate communication. The minute someone asks me about something in politics or policy, however, I am now working.\n\nFunny thing is I study theory and European integration - all that I know from the U.S is through studies of theories of democracy, populism, and socially sustainable political economics.",

Whenever I've tried to go in depth with underlying political theory, people lose interest very quickly.  The average \"dinner discussion\" isn't going to involve subjects like how the polis can seek a particular vision of the good, the state of nature, names and context within the political sphere, etc.  This difference alone might be the boundary you are needing to implement, as hard as that might be right now.

A lot of people (I) have absolutely no care for the political philosophy underscoring their positions and (II) fail to recognize there *is* a political philosophy (or at least general philosophical idea, an inarticulate conception of the good and/or ethical position) producing their position in the first place. \n\nI don\u2019t think they are necessarily worse for this; it just is the case that some people do not study these things, but it makes conversation a lot more shallow than often desired (specifically when discussing with those uninterested in exploring these ideas in further depth).",

                  "text": "Absolutely! I would check out the articles available in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for an introduction to various topics. They are in-depth but also written in a manner accessible to all students (IMO). \n\nFor example, there are introductory articles on [liberalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/), [distributive Justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/) and [conservativism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/) (to name only a few). If you scroll to the bottom of article/entry pages, it leads to other entries on related topics. \n\nLinking more will be difficult because I\u2019m using my iPhone, but I would also look at some stuff pertaining to public justification and social epistemology because, at least in my view, they are pretty relevant to overlapping cultural and political debates at the moment. \n\nFor actual texts, I found the following immensely helpful:\n\n- An Introduction to Political Philosophy, Jonathan Wolff (2016)\n- Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction, Will Kymlicka \n- A Theory of Justice, John Rawls (although for someone who just wants a cursory glance at the philosophical positions, I think part one, chapter one, \u201cJustice as Fairness\u201d suffices! It is an enormous book. If you want to see arguments going the opposite way, Anarchy, State and Utopia by Robert Nozick is written against Rawls and provides strong arguments in favour of a minimal, libertarian state. \n- For contemporary moral philosophy, I would look into the work of Nomy Arpaly and Pamela Hieronymi (especially her work on forgiveness).\n- Finally, I think grasping the distinctions between deontology, utilitarianism and consequentialism is beneficial for any politically active citizen. \n\nAlso, sorry once again if the formatting is wonky, links are strange and/or names are misspelled as I am typing on the bus! :)",
