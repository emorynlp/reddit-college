  "text": "My cohort are quite nice and friendly. But there is someone who openly discuss their grades as if they\u2019re the top of the class. I felt really bad because this individual stated that he had the highest score on a test we were given (as told by the prof in an email sent to them). I felt really bad because my other colleague didn\u2019t do so well on their test. I felt it was quite unnecessary to brag about grades like that in front of a bunch of people in the same class. This person tends to brag about a lot of things, and I lowkey feel like they want to make others feel bad about their academics. \nHow do I deal with someone with this behaviour?",

      "text": "Let's give them the benefit of the doubt as maybe they don't mean to come off as rude and it's more about making themselves feel great because that's all they sadly have to boost their own confidence. Some people are just not aware of what's ok/\"taboo\" or not to talk about as well.  I know a girl like this. She was always talking about her super fancy family vacation and clothes in front of underprivileged students that were struggling to pay their tuition. I made her privately understand that others around us are not in the same situation and usually we should not talk about money in front of strangers for those reasons and she stopped talking about this kind of stuff. She just did not grow up knowing any different, so sometimes a nice little intervention can go a long way. \n\nSo Just like I did with this girl, I would recommend approaching this situation very carefully to not make them mad at you either by using a general tone, not making accusations. You could tell them in person \" Hey congrats for your grades! I know you are very proud of them and you should be but I think it would be best if going forward we all kept our grades to ourselves unless someone explicitly ask for it. Others in the class are not as fortunate as you and are struggling with school. Hearing others mention their really nice grades can be very demoralizing and difficult to some. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation I appreciate it\"",

      "text": ">How do I deal with someone with this behaviour?\n\nComplete indifference. People like this really like the attention and recognition, whether it is motivated by narcissism or low emotional intelligence. I've found the best way to deal with these types of people is total blas\u00e9 indifference to whatever accomplishment they are bragging about that day. It's not your job to educate people on how they should act in social situations and I think at this point in their life they should know better than to be a braggart. If they don't, that's their problem. \n\nSnooty McSnootface: \"Professor McProfessorface said I got the highest grade on the test!\"\n\nYou: \"That's nice. So anyway, Susan what were you saying about what you had for lunch yesterday?\"\n\nAlternatively, \"Neat\", \"Cool\", or \"Okay\" with no follow up at all. \n\nIf you want to be super petty, you could say something like \"Congratulations! I'm sure you had to study really hard\", but if this person is a narcissist they would probably use that as an invitation to brag some more about how little they studied and still got the \"highest\" grade.",

My experience with these people is they probably have been getting away with self indulgent, instant gratification bad behaviors for awhile with (seemingly) no consequences but they are almost certain to piss someone off with them in grad school, probably multiple people and probably not just grad students.
