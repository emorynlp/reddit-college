  "text": "hello, do undergraduate grades matter when applying for PhD program abroad when you already have master's degree?   \n\n\nIm currently a third-year molecular biology undergrad who's already fed up with this remote learning setup, which makes me want to not give a shit about my grades anymore and instead, focus on learning our lessons, learning new skills, and discovering what really interests me. I might wanna pursue a master's degree here in my country first while building my resume at the same time before trying to apply abroad once a graduate. I fear that undergraduate grades may still matter despite having a master's degree already and have learned many skills.",
