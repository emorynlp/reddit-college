  "text": "All the grad students just got an email today that the guy who is easily the best teacher I've ever had, and I've been in school a long fucking time, was denied tenure. He is pretty much single-handedly the reason we have good methodological training for grad students.\n\nI'm just so angry and sad about this. They really don't care at all about teaching, do they?",

It literally doesn't have a weight if you are not causing too much problem. Even if you fuck that up, you can make it up by having better publications. I think this is the way it should be; their job is pretty much doing research while teaching occasionally. Also, there are many Nobel laureates who had been notoriously bad teacher all their lives and prioritizing teaching would get rid of these people at the beginning of their careers.",

Hell, I dropped one of my majors in undergrad in part due to the absolutely garbage level of teaching going on.\n\nI think there's a lot of problems with how academia is currently structured, with people who would rather be doing research being forced to teach and vice versa, but the way it is now, I think it's incredibly unfair to students to not factor teaching ability into tenure decisions.",

I mean, I remember the first year of my PhD which was absolutely the worst year of my life with all the coursework and everything and some of the professors were not helping it by their unreasonable expectations.\n\nHowever, in undergraduate teaching, especially in US, I think professors who are more concerned with research and slacks teaching for this reason are usually extremely nice to students. They teach at a very easy level, they don't really expect much from the students and they are also pretty generous with grades. So, yeah they may not be teaching much but in my experience (in 4-5 schools that I am familiar with), they don't really cause a problem.",

While classes are less about grades in graduate school, they are more about developing skills that you need to be successful as a researcher. If an instructor is not able to effectively communicate those skills to the future generation of researchers, then they are not of much use to anyone.\n\nI also feel that tenure decisions are too political, which imo makes it as bad as high school. At least in high school, your bullies did not get to decide the future of your career. If you're denied tenure, what else are you supposed to do? ",

But outside of Harvard and MIT, most top R1 research universities have a list of criteria for tenure these days. \n\nFor example, at my school/department (in medical science) the general guidelines is 1) bring in 2 major grants (totalling at least $1 million as PI), 2) publish at least 2 articles per year in decent journals, 3) fund and graduate at least 3 PhD students, 4) don't fall more than 1 standard deviation below the average for student evaluations scores, 5) serve on a least 1 departmental committees, and 6) don't have any employment misconducts. \n\nMy understanding is that these requirements are pretty much universal for getting tenure in my field and I assume your field has its own (probably similar). Being a excellent teacher usually isn't one of the criteria unfortunately, you just have to not be a bad teacher. \n\n",

He was given a 2 year adjust position in our dept.  and did amazing. When he applied to be a full-time lecturer, the graduate students wrote a letter to the chair going into detail over how great he was as a teacher.\n\nTo be fair, in my field it is generally really hard to go back into academia after a long break in industry, but he never got hired, and now he's off doing something else and they're STILL interviewing for the position.

All the grad students in our department and a ton of the undergrads made this huge fuss (I was one of them, I just can't think of a better phrase) about how not only should both these profs have renewed contracts but they should both be at least associates by now. They've both been here at least 7 years (the husbands been here 11) and should be tenure track.\n\nThankfully the school renewed both their contracts but honestly they deserve so much more.

The disdain for teaching is strong at R1 institutions, especially when teaching is perceived to get in the way of grant writing and research. Some faculty lose sight of the fact that teaching is (or at least should be) at the core of any academic institution. ",

Hired a TT prof and he got his wife a TT position as a spousal hire, which caused a ton of faculty resentment.\n\nHe was a good prof and good researcher, but his wife was extremely popular and a great professor and she also brought in a bunch of grant money. He got tenure. She did not. \n\nIt kinda worked out...she told me she hadn't wanted to leave her old position anyway, and they were taking her back as an adjunct until she could find a TT position again.",

                          "text": "Short answer is that tenure is like a really long probationary period of 6 years for assistant professors. A few places like Harvard and Yale have an even longer tenure track of 8 years, and you get \"promoted\" to untenured associate rank in the middle, but that's an outlier. Until recently, Ivy League schools almost never granted tenure to junior faculty. Usually they would jump ship to lesser but still prestigious schools after a few years.  Also a little different based on fields; I'm just referring specifically to humanities like History. \n\nIt's not THAT unusual when seen in a few other worksites like a law firm (entry-level associates work atrocious hours for a few years until they \"make partner\" at the discretion of senior partners, or are asked to leave) or even the military (after a certain point, enlisted personnel have to be promoted to the next rank or are discharged). Basically, think of it as an \"up or out\" policy. \n\nAs for why? In academia, a lot of it has to do with the power and value of tenure itself. It is still, essentially, a job for life unless you do something stupid or the university goes bankrupt. It affords you tremendous freedom to do research without fear of job security (theoretically). And, as such, the department, the college, and the university want to make extra, super-duper care in deciding on a momentous decision like tenure, since they would be stuck with you for the next 20-30 years. Tenure is a rare and valuable privilege and makes up for the relatively low salary humanities faculty receive. \n\nIf after six years, an assistant professor does not produce sufficient research then they are terminated. Or to be more precise, given a terminal year. That's it, game over. The reasoning is that they already got six whole years to be productive scholars and didn't publish. If we grant him or her tenure, how do we know they won't end up as what we in the biz call \"deadwood\" or permanent associate professors who never publish anything again and just \"coast\" to retirement, not bothering to go up for full. Not saying this is completely fair or accurate, but that is the perception. Of those denied tenure, many try to stay in academia by applying to lower-ranked schools, It is traumatic but not necessarily the end of the world. Most do fine. \n\nBy the way, \"tenure\" and \"promotion\" are technically separate but almost always go hand in hand. If a junior faculty member is granted tenure, he/she is also promoted to associate professor. There is one more major promotion left to full professor status, which requires usually a book or something on a new project. But that is lower stakes compared to tenure/promotion. \n\n",

Normally it's third-year review where the department and college does a trial-run to see if the candidate is making good progress toward tenure. Sometimes, third year review can result in an action plan to firm up certain issues before the mandatory tenure review. A few rare instances, a candidate can be dismissed if they show absolutely no progress or even likelihood for tenure. \n\n> why tenure to begin with\n\nSee my response to another comment on this thread.

          "text": "Similar thing happened to the former head of my undergrad university\u2019s teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) certificate degree program. It should be noted that our literature and linguistics professors were all under the \u201cEnglish Department\u201d because the university wasn\u2019t that big, and our lit and linguistics programs were especially not big.\n\nShe was Chinese and had learned English to a practically native level. Aside from one other professor in the College of Education, she was the only one I was aware of (I either took ed-related classes from her or the COE professor) with background and research interests in language acquisition and/or TEFL.\n\nShe was removed as head of the program and replaced with someone who specialized in 19th century American Literature. I still don\u2019t know why because no one would tell me. I would\u2019ve never been able to receive my certificate degree - and probably never would\u2019ve pursued my current career path (for fear of not being qualified enough, which is laughable in retrospect given how deprofessionalized TEFL is currently) - if it weren\u2019t for her.",
