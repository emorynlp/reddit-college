  "title:": "Should I switch from a thesis-based MS to a coursework and capstone-based MS?",
  "text": "Greetings all. I am currently pursuing a thesis-based MS in Biology at Arizona State University. I am half way through a 3 year program, but due to mental health issues that stem from the project and struggles with my advisor, I'm highly considering switching into a coursework and capstone-based MS. I know that the C&C MS isn't as \"valuable\" as a thesis-based MS, but I don't see myself doing academic writing as a major part of my career, so I don't think I necessarily *need* the thesis. Additionally, since I have almost all the credits knocked out, switching to the C&C-based MS would mean I could graduate next semester, in May of 2022, but sticking with the thesis-based MS would take at least until May 2023...\n\nI've gotten mixed feedback so far. Some people tell me to stick with the thesis because it's more valuable and I'll be better off because of it. Others are telling me to prioritize my mental health and graduate sooner with the C&C MS, that way I can get out into the field and do what I enjoy. I don't want to leave my advisor hanging, but the only thing that's been improving my mental health recently is thinking about how graduating sooner with the C&C MS means I can start applying for jobs that I actually enjoy. The thought of being stuck behind a computer screen for the next year-and-a-half to finish the thesis makes my stomach turn to knots, and I have the thought that \"I just want to get out into the field already.\"\n\nWhat should I do? Should I stick it out, struggle through my mental health issues and challenges with my advisor, and get the more valuable thesis-based MS? Or should I \"take the easy way out\" and switch into a coursework and capstone MS which, although less valuable, means I can finish earlier and start applying to jobs? Would love to get some help and advice here.",

If nothing else, it helps with dissertation anxiety. \n\nI remember several people who had not done a thesis for their masters who were very worried about doing the entire dissertation process because they had no idea what to expect.",

If you just want a paycheque and would be easy to hire with a course-based degree, a thesis isn't worth it to you anyway. As with most things, you need to articulate the goal before you can make the best decision for you.",

You'll definitely want one to work in ~~academia~~ but I'm pretty sure that for kids, it's not nearly as important. Can anybody else weigh in on this?",

I also was facing another 6 months to 1 year to finish my thesis, or like you I could graduate the next semester. Been job searching and not 1 person has asked about my thesis or even if I did one.",

I feel like I'm in the same boat- I've invested the last year-and-a-half into the project, but I'm only half way through and am feeling so burned out. Stress and anxiety has been really high, mostly about trying to produce high-quality academic writing, but I don't really see academic writing as a part of my future- not really considering a Ph.D. either, I'd rather get out into the field as a wildlife technician already. I definitely don't want to disappoint my advisor or waste their time, but at the same time I have to do what's best for me... It looks like the capstone route would be the best option for me given my future career trajectory.",
