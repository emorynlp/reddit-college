  "title:": "Miserable all the time",
  "text": "Ive been working from  home since the start of the pandemic. I have about a year left in my PhD. \n\nFor the past year, Ive lost all motivation to do my research. Ive lost any interest in reading new papers, learning new things, going to new talks. I hate my current project . I feel like I make no progress. And that it's boring and trivial and not \"worthy\" of a phd. Like today, I worked all today andsomehow ehave nothing to show for it. And every day is like that. All the same. The days rush by and it freaks me out. But my supervisors seem happy and dont push me or give me new inspiration. \n\nIm so close so I feel like I cant quit. Plus I cant help that Id be miserable even if I quit. \n\nIve talked to therapists, no help. I have a support system. Hobbies. Pets. \n\nIs this just burnout? Should I just stick with it? Maybe in a postdoc I can switch fields..",

      "text": "You definitely can switch fields in your postdoc.\n\nNo matter how important/unimportant your dissertation research is, at the end you get that paper that says \u201cPhD\u201d, and then you can go do all of the things (like postdocs) that you can only do if you have a PhD.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be the best or most important piece of scientific work you do in your life - it just has to be the first.\n\nSo go get it done, graduate, and move on to better things!\n\n\u2026and if you haven\u2019t already, you might consider treatment that affects your brain chemistry to help get you out of the place you\u2019re stuck in. Antidepressants prescribed by a doctor, or if for some reason you can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to try them, then intense cardio exercise may also be of some help. All of this PhD stuff will be easier if you don\u2019t have to fight your own brain while you\u2019re doing it.",

      "text": "The last almost 2 years have been draining.\nI wouldn't evaluate anything based on this period in time. It sucks, but it's not representative (we will hope). For you, it's the research, but almost everybody I speak to in and out of academia tell similar tales.\nWe never meet. Nobody has done anything interesting. No stories to tell. There's no response anywhere. We. Are. Bored. \nThen we look for something to blame, and since all we have left is our work, that's what we blame. \n\nI think the only thing we can do to avoid depression is to just accept that this period is an exception, and that whatever we are feeling, only means that it sucks living through a pandemic. It's not necessarily a reflection on the other things in our lives. Or on whether or not we are successful. It's just very easy to think it is.",
