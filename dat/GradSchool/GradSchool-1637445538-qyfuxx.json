      "text": "When you're choosing a recommender, you want to choose whoever knows you best and can speak best to your readiness (personal and professional) for graduate study. You want someone who is familiar enough to speak to both the strength of your work, your seriousness in pursuing it, and qualities you have that will make you a good candidate. Who's in a better spot to do that?\n\n\nBasically, what you *don't* want is a lukewarm letter from someone who can say \"they did well in my class\" but nothing beyond that. Your transcript already tells a committee that, and the point of the letters is similar to a work reference, in that someone else is telling the committee what it's been like to work with you and why they should pick you now. It's even better if you can have each of them come from a different angle. For example, I had one faculty I had a lot of coursework with, one I'd worked with for a while, and my advisor who could speak to my trajectory and mindset. If one of your folks can bring in an angle the others can't, that's worth considering.",

The final versions with the professor's feedback?\n\nIf so, you would be able to refresh their memory by sending them a copy of those papers when you seek a recommendation.\n\nIf they were humanities papers, then this might be a good choice because your professor could attest to your ability to write papers and your critical thinking skills, which are extremely important in a Literature MA.  Many or most of your classes are likely to be paper writing. No tests.\n\nWhat class was it? What kind of papers did you write?",
