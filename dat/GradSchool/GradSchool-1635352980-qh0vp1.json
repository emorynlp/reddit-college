  "title:": "Frustrated over an R&R and feeling like I misstepped as a co-author",
  "text": "Sorry this is a long one. I'm on an interdisciplinary, inter-institutional research project and I first was brought onto the manuscript in question in its final stages. It's led by another GRA I work closely with, and the PI wanted me involved when the manuscript was already written. The GRA asked that I just do grammar edits and clean the reference list, so I did and I got last author.\n\nNow like 8 months later after a rejection at one journal we got an R&R at another. To address the reviewers comments, the GRA assigned everyone specific reviewer comments. I got assigned several very high-level reviewer comments, as in they suggest what would be extensive changes to the manuscript's theoretical framework and require additional literature review. The comments are also very unclear as to how the reviewer thought these concepts should be applied, or in some cases, what they even meant by the concept in the first place. For example, one comment I was assigned just refers to a quote in the manuscript and says \"[concept]?\" Another comment I was assigned suggested we look at a chapter in a book since it covers the issue of interest in the paper, but the reviewer didn't say which chapter and a quick look reveals the *entire book* is about this issue. I still tried to synthesize the most relevant points, but that's the type of comments I was working with.\n\nI am very unfamiliar with 1) the literature used for the manuscript, 2) the manuscript itself since I had no involvement with the research and writing to begin with. So I've felt very uncomfortable making the large changes/additions, especially when it's not even clear what the reviewer actually wanted to see us do in the paper. I voiced this concern to the GRA (lead author) and they said it was fine for me to just write up summaries that they can use to write into the manuscript for the time being. So that's what I did. The lead author repeatedly said what I was doing was very helpful and fine in emails and in meetings over the past month.\n\nWe had a deadline to submit the revisions, so at the end of the first week I asked if they wanted me to start incorporating what I've found into the manuscript. I received no response. From that point I only heard about progress in team meetings and they said things were fine, but we had gotten an extension on the revision. \n\nLast week I received an email from them asking me to better explain one of the articles a reviewer suggested we reference. This came a day before they said they were going to send out the draft for final team review. So that night after class I worked on it but again, I was unsure how to incorporate it into the manuscript itself since the methods were a little out of my area of expertise. I sent my summary the next morning with a quick note to the 1st & 2nd authors about thoughts I had for how it could be used/questions that the 2nd author might know how to better answer. Again no response.\n\nThen in this week's team meeting my PI suggests we discuss troubles we've been having, and the 2nd author mentions that collaboration has been difficult with this manuscript bc \"people\" aren't adding what they find into the manuscript, just summarizing them in the shared comments doc. There is no question that \"people\" is me,  since I was the only coauthor doing that bc the 1st explicitly told me to!! They also said people should offer to help on the manuscript instead of waiting to be asked, which felt pointed even though I reached out to the lead author at least twice and received no response. (This might not have been said directly bc of my actions, but the first point left very little room for doubt to me)\n\nI'm very confused and frustrated. I was assigned the most abstract comments (even the lead authors admitted they had no clue what the reviewers meant) on a paper I had very little familiarity with to begin with, told that I could summarize the literature without writing it into the manuscript, and that what I had done was helpful. Then I received little to no answers to my questions or offers to assist further. \n\nI understand that the lead authors were busy with the rest of the manuscript but I still feel like I'm being evaluated as not meeting expectations that weren't communicated to me. Am I missing some piece of collaborative writing etiquette?\n\n\nETA: changed some words for clarity. Also to note, as I did in a comment, that this was a double blind review. Reviewers weren't addressing comments to me, rather the lead author delegated responding comments across all co-authors. I have no insight as to why I was assigned the comments that I was.\n\nAlso, thanks to the people who pointed out that technical edits rarely merit authorship. I agree, this is advised against in my field in particular, so I've reached out to my PI about removing my author credit.",

Next the first author should be addressing the vast majority of reviewer comments unless other authors covered specific sections of the research. \n\nYou are not qualified to address reviewer comments if you didn't even work on the research. I would talk to your PI about how this is being carried out.",

          "text": "My thoughts exactly. I never thought I qualified for authorship but I didn't feel confident enough to say so at the time the manuscript was first submitted. I did not volunteer on the manuscript earlier bc I was never interested in it.\n\nI work from the same data (focus group transcripts) as they used in this manuscript, but they developed an entirely new codebook for thematic analysis just for this. So I'm not familiar with their findings at all.\n\nI'm worried about this reflecting poorly on my ability/work ethic to my PI so I probably will being this up to them this week. Thanks for your thoughts.",

I can't imagine assigning reviewer responses to coauthors.

          "text": "Yeah this was very different from my experiences coauthoring outside this project, but this particular journal and reviewers also just have an unusual format for responding to submissions.\n\nApparently the reviewer comments were originally shared with the lead author through a Google docs copy of our manuscript w/ their comments literally being comments in the file itself. One reviewer made extensive grammatical edits which I found unusual. I thought normally editors handle that, plus the original grammar was not wrong, they just did not seem to like some of our word choices.\n\nOther coauthors were asked to help with comments relevant to their expertise and what they contributed to the paper. I think I got the short end of the stick in that regards, just being handed the comments the lead didn't want to deal with themselves along with some \"participation points\" for me.",
