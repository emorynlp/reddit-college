      "text": "Depends on your research area. In general companies have a hard time filing senior engineering roles. So if you have experience on top of the PhD I think it should be easy.. without experience you so be competing for these jobs against people who are proven.\n\nPhDs can price you out of certain jobs, but in CS the pay is high enough that, that really isn\u2019t a huge concern.. the major issue is if you become overqualified for entry level, but under qualified for senior level.",
