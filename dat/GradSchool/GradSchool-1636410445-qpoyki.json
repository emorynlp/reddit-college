It's driving me mad",

I'd just assume you are entrenched in your work and don't want to chat with me...I wouldn't make assumptions or think you were a \"weird loner.\" If you ever *wanted* to make friends, just strike up a conversation. Ask folks in the office if they wanted to grab drinks or snacks Friday afternoon.",

I can tell you that most of the time that I'm in the office, I'm just thinking about what to eat for lunch or the 879 items in my to-do lists for the day. I have more silent office mates and I co-exist with them peacefully. I do not look down on them or think negatively of them.",
