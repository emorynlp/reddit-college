  "text": "I\u2019m in my first term of an online MBA  program. I knew better than to think discussion boards wouldn\u2019t carry over from undergrad, but here I am again miserable as fuck over these damn things. Had to do three initial posts tonight. I\u2019ve been done for over an hour and I cannot calm down. \n\nI\u2019m really enjoying the content of my classes. My professors are engaging as they can be for an online class. They leave helpful and detailed feedback. My international management professor even got on my ass about straying from the rubric, and since then I learned from my mistakes and have been receiving better and better grades on my weekly essays. My marketing professor emailed me personally to thank me for my hard work. I have a solid A in both classes and the term ends next week. I was hoping this program would be more challenging than my online undergrad where you\u2019d get a B for spelling your name right in the 100 & 200 level classes (not literally but you get my point). 300 & 400 level were a definite step up but not particularly challenging. Tbh the marketing class is a much greater workload but the professor is not a challenging grader. The international management class has been quite challenging, the workload has been a motherfucker and I\u2019m proud of the A I\u2019m earning.\n\nBut these fucking discussion boards literally make me want to punch a fucking wall. My blood is boiling. This shit is so fucking tedious to keep doing every week and then having to yeet 2 peer responses for each one, it\u2019s fucking mind numbing and no one, including the professors, read the \u201crespond to your peers\u201d posts. I haven\u2019t had the balls to test the theory of the professors not reading the peer responses by posting random bullshit because I respect them, but I do feel like I could copy and paste Gucci Mane song lyrics and no one would know. Anyway, I\u2019m sorry but ranting about this made me feel better. Sorry to anyone who read this entire diatribe.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck discussion boards",

      "text": "I always use discussions to gauge my understanding on the readings. Granted, I am not in an MBA program, but I usually found that my peers are quite astute and give me a different and sometimes better perspective of the course content.\n\nI think you should try to change your perspective. Doesn't look like the discussions are going away, but the way you react to them is within your control. I totally understand... busy work sucks! But try to change the perspective anyway.",
