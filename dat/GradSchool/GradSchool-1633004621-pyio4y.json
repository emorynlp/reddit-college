      "text": "Basically no. You can of course avoid abstract algebra (I can somewhat sympathise as I didn't do well in algebra either), but you can't avoid proofs. I do applied math and for example, my first-year project was on a problem in computational statistical physics, i.e. very applied. However, it was also very analysis-heavy and involved a lot of proving bounds on the bias and variance of estimators. \n\nAlso, don't be fooled into thinking that applied math == no theory or proofs. The distinction between pure and applied is a bit artificial and there is a lot of interplay between the two. In more applied math, we often rely on results from researchers working in more pure or theoretical fields, so that requires having the necessary theoretical background to understand those results. \n\nAlgebra may not be to your taste, but how much analysis have you done? Something analytical like probability, analysis of pdes, or numerical analysis might be more to your liking.",

For that probably you should look at other quantitative subjects (physics, engineering, quantitative finance, etc.), where the focus is to use math to get things done, instead of a PhD in math itself.",
