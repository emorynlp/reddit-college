  "title:": "Unable to learn in online class",
  "text": "I\u2019m considering withdrawing from my current program (I really only enrolled to pick up a new skill or two) due to online class being extremely difficult for me to learn in. I feel like nothing is explained, and being expected to navigate new programs and concepts that aren\u2019t outlined in the homework (with extremely limited office hours) has made it feel impossible to learn. \n\nI miss being able to work with my classmates in-person, and meet each other for seminars all together. Has anyone else left school due to remote learning? I feel so stupid.",
