  "title:": "Is this okay to do / allowed? Taking a class during deferment??",
  "text": "So, I was accepted to a doctoral program for Fall 2021, but I decided to defer until Fall 2022, partly for financial reasons and also partly for medical reasons (needed a surgery that my health insurance at my current full time job covers). Anyway, so I deferred. For my program, I know for sure that a few of the classes are online / distance learning classes (not just for covid, but all the time). \n\nSo, I am wondering if it would be okay / allowed for me to take 1 or 2 of these courses during my deferral, because I'm not technically enrolled while I am deferred. I want to take 1 or 2 courses to get it out of the way so I don't fall too far behind or anything. I am sure I can afford 1 or 2 classes right now. Also, I want the brain stimulation and motivation while I continue to slave away at my current job until Fall 2022.\n\nDoes anyone know how this works or if it's generally allowed?? I want to ask here before actually emailing my professors. Don't want to come off like an idiot if this is some big no no that I just don't know about.",

You could speak to your graduate program co-ordinator, they will likely have better information for you. Your professors may allow you to 'audit', just attend the class, but not doing homework or tests.",
