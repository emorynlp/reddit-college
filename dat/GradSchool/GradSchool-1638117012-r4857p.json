  "text": "I asked a professor in September for a LoR for schools with deadlines in December/January. We\u2019re not that close but I\u2019ve been in two of their classes + have done research with them + am a teaching assistant for one of their classes. Two months later and I haven\u2019t heard from them at all. I emailed the person almost a week ago and still haven\u2019t heard anything \ud83d\ude05 should I just give up and pretend like I never asked for a letter? I wonder if they don\u2019t want to write me one anymore because there was a slight miscommunication with the grading for the class where I\u2019m a teaching assistant \ud83d\ude2c \n\nwhat should I do y\u2019all? I already asked another professor for a LoR but it\u2019s too short notice to get one for my December deadlines.",

      "text": "They probably just got busy and have it on their to do list, but keep forgetting. If the deadline isn\u2019t close, it\u2019s likely on the bottom of their to-do list and they are busy right now wrapping up the term. Shoot them another email and probably go ahead and arrange for another recommendation from someone else just in case.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a college Instructor and I wait until winter break to write all of my recommendation letters with Dec/Jan due dates, regardless of when I received the request from the student.",

          "text": "Ah but one of my deadlines is December 1st, so I thought maybe they would reach out by now. Since they haven\u2019t I decided to apply to another round of applications for that school with a deadline at a later time. Do Professors ever reach out to the student when they notice a deadline approaching, or is it common that the student should always be the one reaching out? I feel like I bother them with my emails.\n\nAlso, how close are you to your students that ask for a recommendation? I\u2019m worried that I was out of place by asking that professor, but since I\u2019ve done so much throughout the years with them I thought it would be ok.",

              "text": "Definitely send them an email today. In the subject line say something like \u201cUrgent: Dec 1st deadline for recommendation\u201d. In your email, you could go ahead and include some items to that you\u2019d like for them to highlight in the recommendation or even a mock recommendation letter, so it\u2019s less of a burden on them to write. You could phrase it as \u201cIn order to save you time, I\u2019ve included a summary of the work we\u2019ve done together and why I feel that I would be a strong candidate for the program if you\u2019d like to use that as part of the recommendation.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m an accounting instructor, and when I was leaving the firm that I worked at to transition into higher Ed, the partner at the firm had me write the first draft of my recommendation letter from him and then he came back in and made edits. It was a surprisingly helpful exercise for me to articulate my strengths/skills and it saved him a lot of time.\n\nStudents should be the ones reaching out, since the professor likely isn\u2019t tracking the due dates for the recommendation letters. It doesn\u2019t bother me AT ALL if a student reaches back out with a reminder.\n\nI have students of varying degrees of closeness request them. I\u2019m always happy to fill them out and take it as a compliment that they chose me to be a reference for them. However, it is helpful if they provide me additional context of what they\u2019ve accomplished and the items they feel would be useful for me to highlight in the recommendation.",

      "text": "Can you clarify something? You say they never got back to you\u2026 did they agree to write a letter and then never got back to you, or did they never even get back to you to confirm they\u2019d write a letter in the first place?\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, then I\u2019d reach out to them again. Someone who agreed to write a letter may feel enough guilt at not having done so that they\u2019d sit down and write one ASAP and have it ready by that December 1st deadline. You\u2019re never going to be able to reach out to a new recommender to have a letter ready by that deadline. \n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, then you\u2019re out of luck. Ideally they\u2019d have just told you know earlier, but you should have reached out after a week or two back then and not waited until now. I don\u2019t know if this is what happened so I won\u2019t belabor that point, but yeah if that\u2019s the case then don\u2019t expect a letter from them and frankly you may need to defer to a later deadline or even wait until next year to get a letter because most people won\u2019t write one with only a day or two heads up. \n\nIf this is someone you work with, you should talk to them in-person if at all possible.",
