  "text": "I failed my first exam as a graduate student. I cried literally all day after seeing my test score. I felt very sad and discouraged, especially after seeing that other people in my cohort received almost perfect scores. I have already questioned whether or not to keep pushing.. though I\u2019m still trying to find ways to pick up better study habits. How exactly do you all study? What works for you? I normally go over lectures/listen to the professors recordings, then create my own study guide. It\u2019s just so difficult trying to retain every bit of information\u2026 it doesn\u2019t always stick to me.",

Passed the class (actually got the required minimum of a B, but they defined B as above 75). I dunno if you are MA or PhD but if the latter your GPA doesn't matter that much. Really only for stuff like NSF fellowships or things like that. I'm sure it takes me 4x as long to analyze my data in SPSS than a stats wiz, but the data does get analyzed eventually.\n\nYou probably do need to change how you study and change your workflow. You're in grad school, it would be crazy not to keep your study skills progressing. I'm a thousand times more organized now. I use the heck out of oneNote and Zotero. When I read I breakdown main points of articles into spreadsheets based around topic or project.",

I just get really bad test anxiety lol. You have a great approach too, thank you for sharing. The class I\u2019m struggling with has so much detail on every slide, so I could do what you do and break them down into main points.",

Classify each question by type- definition, if-then, identification, etc. When you review your answers you should be able see a pattern of what kinds of questions you\u2019re missing, then you aim your study habits on answering those question types where you\u2019re weakest. I realized this technique during my first quarter of grad school and never forgot it cos it definitely kept me from failing/quitting. Good luck!",

My family gets annoy with the way I study, but I don't care. This is the method I found effective and I can't change it. Highlight those details, so that you won't get confused from studying it again.\n\n*Make sure that your study guides are made of hardcopies (e.g. writing some notes as reviewer, book). Studying your study guides digitally is distracting for me, so I recommend to study in hardcopy ones.",

I'm assuming it is a lot of genetics, biochemistry and chemistry. If that is the case, I suggest using Anki. I'm in a biological science field and the way I memorize details and patient cases are to create scenarios or simply write down questions in anki and then go back and study it a few days later. Active recall really helps instead of reading through slides and listening to lectures again",

I am, and always have been, an extremely visual learner, so lectures are my worst nightmare. I also can't use a computer to take effective notes- I had to hand write everything (even to this day)! After taking active notes in class, I would study by essentially rewriting said notes in different colored ink, and did it a few times, then wrote it all out by memory (and color). By doing that, I not only truly retained the information but when I took the exam, it triggered the colors I wrote in and made it easier for me to recall. \nAlso pay attention to distractions - it's easier said than done. Studying was always the time I realized just how dirty my place was and how much I needed to clean! When I have to focus, noise-cancellation goes on, phone goes in DND mode, and I set small goals to achieve. \nKeep pushing! It takes time, but you will figure it out. Best of luck!",

Why does it happen? Ask questions. Make studying part of your day instead of a chore that you have to do. Enjoy every subject you study, even though you might not really enjoy it.
