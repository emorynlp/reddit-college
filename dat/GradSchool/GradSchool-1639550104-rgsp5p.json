  "text": "Oof so I am in a design grad program and I had to take an incomplete for my studio this semester so I can finish my work. Fair enough, I didn't have deliverables. But holy cow, my mental health (and physical health!) is so terrible right now.\n\nI'm in a long distance relationship with my husband while I'm in school, and boy oh boy nobody is handling the pandemic well (nobody includes my university, my college, my department, my studio instructors, and me). I started my program in fall '19, and after things fell apart in spring '20, I took a leave of absence. I'm glad I did, because my program did not make a graceful transition to remote work, and remote work is very challenging for my brain. But man, this semester... everything has sucked so fucking much. Instruction has suffered. Student camaraderie/studio culture has suffered. Professional elbow-rubbing has dropped to zero. We are using all the heavy duty layer management software: autocad, adobe suite, arcgis, sketchup. I should probably learn other programs too (and I will eventually) but right now the information is just like drinking from a firehose and I don't have time to teach myself more programs at the moment.  Instructor responsiveness has dropped significantly. TA availability has dropped significantly. I was just not able to provide the final project deliverables, and two days after the final due date, at the suggestion of my instructors, I took an incomplete.\n\nI am home now with the husband, and I have more time to finish the work, but I am literally about to have a mental breakdown. I've had so little sleep in the past month. I've lost 10 lbs (not in a good way). My anxiety is super high. Tears are so close to the surface, all the time. My right hand (the mouse hand) is in constant pain and I am having tremors, presumably from all the left-right clicking. The left side of trapezius (the back muscle that goes from your neck to your shoulders to your mid-back) is falling asleep whenever I sit down at the computer. The husband, god bless him, just doesn't quite get it, and is understandably frustrated that I am preoccupied. All I have wanted for the past two months is to be able to just get a normal amount of sleep, have enough time to actually cook dinner instead of heating up a tasty bites, one guilt-free day with the husband, maybe start a knitting project, maybe a couple of yoga classes. I've probably had 3-4 hours of sleep a night for the past 6 weeks. I am still in this hellish gauntlet. I like my program, and I don't even mind using the software or doing the tasks, but the experience this semester has just been that of going into debt just to teach myself Autocad with youtube videos. I want the degree, don't want to be in academia. I like learning but this is like being in an abusive relationship. I would absolutely not stay in a job that required me to stay awake on autocad all night.\n\nIt doesn't help that I'm so incredibly broke. Can grad students qualify for food stamps? I would be so frugal and grateful and healthy.\n\nThanks for reading my venting. I know no one owes me anything but  I am about to lose my shit. :(",

      "text": "As someone leaving the design field after 14 years... please take several whole days off and let yourself rest. You literally cannot continue to push like this, burnout is so real in this field and as a grad student. Add all the other stress and omg. I've been there, it sucks so bad feeling behind while simultaneously exhausted and emotional.\n\nAs a start, give yourself permission to do absolutely nothing for an entire day, better if you can do 2 whole days in a row. Let the husband know you need this and allow yourself that time to do whatever you want. Sleep, watch TV, do something creative that's for you and not school... just anything that's entirely for you. It's the only way to start to get out of the burnout cycle.",

The left side of trapezius (the back muscle that goes from your neck to your shoulders to your mid-back) is falling asleep whenever I sit down at the computer.\n\nNot sure if this will help, but I was having all kinds of RSI problems on the right arm from heavy Adobe suite use.\n\nI now have two mice set up for my computer, one on each side of my keyboard. Windows lets me have them both plugged in and recognizes both of them.\n\nI take a break with my right hand for 5 or 10 minutes every hour and use my left. \nNot only does that give my right hand a break, it causes me to shift my posture. So it's better for my upper body as well.\n\nAlso get up and stretch every hour.\n\nHand grip strengtheners have also helped me, because they work the fingers and the forearm in the reverse from gripping\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07Q4VDYMT\n\nThis was recommended to me by a physical therapist.\n\nTo agree with the other poster. Sounds like you need to take a week off. Try to sleep well. Make sure you're getting good exercise everyday. And eat right. Give yourself a break.",
