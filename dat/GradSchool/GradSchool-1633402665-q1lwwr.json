  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nIf you have any stories about a time where you thought you were absolutely fucked with your research, and there was a positive ending afterall, I\u2019d love to hear \u2018em. \n\nI\u2019ve been building a very intricate experiment for the past five months, and tonight I planned to iron out the last little details to finalize my IRB. Basically, it all comes down to what trials get randomized and repeated. The last little detail is essentially one line of code, and it seems that the code can\u2019t be placed where it needs to be. \n\nThis is for my thesis, and data collection is supposed to start this month.\n\nAnyway, if you have positive stories, I\u2019d love to hear them. Please and very much thank you. \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "I\u2019ve got a somewhat positive thing going on. Basically, we\u2019re constantly growing rice in a growth chamber, applying drought stress to them. For the first 6 months, it was going great. Our plants always grew well, and our method for inducing drought made it extremely reliable and consistent.   \n\nThen all of a sudden the plants started dying. We would plant more, they would die. They would grow for few days then shrivel up, and the ones that did make it past the first few days were yellow and wilty. There were no signs of fungus, insects, or any pathogens. Tried switching up the soil we used, the water, nutrients, humidity, sterilized the seeds, etc. for months. Didn\u2019t matter, they would die, despite being prepared and grown in the EXACT same way as before. We were at our wits end so we asked the tech staff to help us and they recommended \u201cbaking\u201d the chamber (basically crank up the heat for a few days so any pathogens would die).  \n\nEven though there wasn\u2019t any evidence of contamination or pathogens, the baking worked. Our plants now grow beautifully :) Though it\u2019s worrying that we have no clue what happened and if it could happen again...",

          "text": "Yeah, keeping plants/crops alive is a pain I wish on no one...unless you're purposely killing them. Towards the end of my experiment, when collecting crucial data points, I had to deal with a bad case of spider mites. We tried everything to control them but hosing them with water every time I went to collect data was the best 'solution'. The greenhouses were so run down though, we were taking a lot of chances growing stuff in it. Other student researchers were not so lucky and lost a lot of wheat samples when the winter storm hit last year, because the structures couldn't stay heated properly.",
