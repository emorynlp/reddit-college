  "title:": "Do grad schools take into account circumstances for GPA?",
  "text": "Undergrad GPA: 3.4. Currently working at a FAANG. 6 yoe in total\n\nBack when I was an undergrad, my family was funding my education. I was maintaining a 3.8 gpa during that time, as I had to only work part time to support myself. Unfortunately around 2014/2015, things got really bad in my homecountry, and my parents were not able to continue funding me. This required that I do both full time school and full time work for the final year, which dropped my GPA to 3.4. I did the best I can to maintain it above 3.6 but was unable to.\n\nLately I have been wanting to get into a grad school (ideally top 50 schools). But I know my chances are low with that GPA.\n\nDo grad schools take into account such as circumstances if you can show them proof?",

It is a completely acceptable gpa. \n\nYou\u2019ll find the further you get away from undergrad, the more programs looks at your overall application picture. It certainly varies by school and program, but overall you\u2019ll be competitive.",

I had a much lower GPA and applied for public health programs 10 years after working and ended up getting into all 4 schools I applied to (all 4 top 10) and I was worried that was too narrow. \n\nI think you should cast the net wide. Also if you are really worried you could consider taking 1-2 classes which will show your ability to do graduate level work in a program etc. \n\nI would call and talk to an admissions counselor though in the grad program. That is what I did.",

I had ducking awesome work and volunteer experience, very good gre, and what I thought was a strong personal statement. I had applied 2 yr prior without the good personal statement and volunteer work so clearly it mattered a lot more than my gpa did\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to apply. Rejection stings. But you won\u2019t get in if you don\u2019t play the game\n\nAlso, was accepted into a competitive (10-15% acceptance) doctor of public health program with a 3.5 gpa in the MSW program. Again, great work experience, strong statement, networking, and did what reviewers recommended after I was rejected the first time.\n\nBe awesome and don\u2019t sell yourself short",

      "text": "There is always some low-end GPA cutoff that the admissions board won't even look at your application, but that cutoff is 2.8 to 3.0 more often than not. The average GPA of grad admissions is always going to be high because the majority of people that want to go to grad school are people that did well in school. It's much rarer to want to do more school if you struggled.",
