  "text": "I'm a pretty verbose guy. I talk too much, my jokes are too long, and my biggest problem with assignments wasn't meeting the minimum word counts, but not going over the maximum.\n\nIn my program, every writing assignment had to be submitted electronically so that it could be scanned for plagiarism. The online submission portal also calculated the word count and page length, and reported those details to the professor.\n\nOne evening while discussing this system with one of my professors, he commented that it still didn't stop students from attempting to cheat. I asked how that was possible, and he told me a few examples that I found hilarious and, at least in some cases, pretty ingenious. Here are a few of the things he has seen:\n\n* One student went though his/her entire paper and increased the font size for every single punctuation mark. All the words were in the required 12 point Times Roman, but the periods, commas, and apostrophes had been increased in order to fill more space.\n* By default, most plagiarism checkers don't check quoted passages, because... well, they're quotes. My professor caught a group of students surrounding their entire papers in quotation marks, so that the online scanner skipped the entire report. In a +1 moment, the color of the quotation marks had been changed to white, so that they weren't obvious.\n* Multiple students have been caught padding the length of their reports by adding words to the end, again changing the font color to white, and then changing the size to 1pt. \n* My personal favorite was a paper that was too long (a student after my own heart!) so the student decreased his/her word count by taking screen shots of entire paragraphs, deleting the words, and replacing them with the pictures. This fooled the automatic word count, but not the page length detection. So close!",

      "text": "If you teach at a school with Greek life, be aware that some fraternities and sororities have test/paper banks. I discovered this in a class I TAed because the test essay prompts were changed slightly from previous semesters, and there was a small group of students who  wrote answers that addressed the prompts from the previous semester. It wasn't difficult to make the connection upon learning they were all in the same fraternity. That's why I always change my assignments slightly from one semester to the next.\n\nOn a related note, word/page maximums and minimums only work well if they are appropriate to the assignment. A lot teachers just pull them out of thin air. If students are adding fluff, maybe the minimum is too much. Look at A papers from past assignments as a guide to word/page counts.",

Students who do this type of thing typically wait until the last minute, because if they were having problems meeting page count they could have contacted the instructor. I do think page minimums are a bit arbitrary though, but in the classes I teach we use maximums since we emphasize simplicity in communication. I think that makes it even more egregious when my student manipulated the size of all the periods in order to meet page count, when the assignment was only 3 pages double spaced.",

On the other, the more sophisticated the level of writing that is expected by the instructor, the less things like minimum length make sense to me. Can an instructor definitively say that the subject they assigned can't be adequately or eloquently covered in 4.75 pages rather than 5? I think it builds better student habits at that point to just write a good rubric and mark highly any paper that meets of all of those criteria regardless of length.\n\nThat being said, a mature student who had this concern could respond by writing a really solid essay and if it came up \"too short,\" turning it in with the note to the instructor politely defending their choice and offering their work as evidence.",

I think that's actually good. It might not be educationally appropriate for middle school or early high school, but by college I believe that discomfort reflects a real learning opportunity to form their own judgement about what makes a good and comprehensive piece of writing.

I think at the undergraduate level a lot of the student's writing is simply not there enough to pull off a 2.5pg answer to a 5pg prompt. But saying 'its too short' can sometimes be useful shorthand for 'you really need to expand on some of these ideas' within the context of broader comments. Id also say that, for me personally, I see it as a bit of frustrating laziness. Most of the students are able to squeeze out 5pgs. They might be shitty, but they all do it. A 2.5pg paper, especially when its bad, sends me the message that 'Hey I dont care about this class and Im not going to do the work, but please dont fail me.'",

Do they think it will help them in their career?   \n\n\nIn my program, there's a serious issue with people using paid sites like Chegg and Coursehero. People will submit papers and discussion posts that they purchased. I'll admit, I have an account on one of these sites but I would never submit a paper from it. I use them as a reference to understand if my thought process is valid. I will read what someone else wrote to get ideas for how I can expand my research or to make sure I understand the prompt. I see it as no different as two classmates reading each other's papers. I would never copy and paste, nor would I even use the same quotes or sources. What people don't realize about these sites is they're written by students. It's not guaranteed to be correct and I've seen papers with false information.",

But it A: didnt touch on any of the other readings (red flag for a compare and contrast essay) and B: was so far off the field that it didnt even come close to answer the prompt question. Like, most students at least make a fig leaf of an attempt. Most students can \\*at least\\* restate the question. This essay was basically talking about the aesthetic structure of a poem while ignoring the pretty obvious content question we were asking.",

      "text": "Meanwhile the only instance of cheating I've seen so far in my students - that's obvious, anyway - was when a student just copied and pasted an entire journal article on their paper topic as their paper and assumed we'd think that they wrote it. Like, you're a first year student, aside from the fact that the professor and I had both read the article in question and knew it, that's some pretty advanced writing for a first year.\n\n-\nI did realize recently how incredibly easy it is to actually write the same thing as someone else though, so it made me think more critically about cases where students are assumed to be cheating (or outright accused of it) because they have some of the same sentences word for word in their papers.\n\nI realized this because I was asked to give a speech at my city's Pride Week flag raising this past week. There were a number of speakers and nobody coordinated their speeches beforehand, nobody knew what information would be overlapping or anything -- which was fine, consistency in the subject matter was great. But when one person was speaking, I noticed that she said two sentences *in a row* that were *word for word* what I wrote in my speech. Not a single word off, it was *exactly* word for word what I wrote.\n\nGranted, we're both academics who specialize in this sort of content, so perhaps the reason there was that we simply are used to making the same sorts of arguments. We're probably influenced by many of the same scholars and sources. However, it showed me that two people can write something totally separately and still somehow use the exact same wording -- I'm gonna have to remember that when grading.",

Turns out I was right. Most first years dont realize it, but plagiarism is super easy to catch. Like unless youre copying from a previous students work, most essay questions are so specific to readings, content, and the course that its hard to just copy+paste the right answer in (at least for me in History). And then even if you could find the right pieces, most students are such bad writers and proofreaders in an underlevel course that its immediately obvious.
