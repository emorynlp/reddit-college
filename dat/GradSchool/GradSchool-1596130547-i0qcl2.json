You passed, so you should take that to show that just like you, none of your faculty care about any mistakes made along the way. (Believe me, they (we) all made a ton of mistakes in grad school, in research, in teaching, and in academic \"social\" relations. So don't fret any of that by any means.)\n\nCelebrate well. Get together with family and friends (safely, of course) and make it a night to remember. \n\nAgain, hearty congratulations. Best wishes for a wonderful future.",
