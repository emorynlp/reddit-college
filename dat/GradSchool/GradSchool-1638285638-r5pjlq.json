  "title:": "Is it bad that my decision to do a PhD is being shaken up due to a recent breakup?",
  "text": "So yeah I'm a little wary to talk about these things with others because I kind of feel like a high schooler, but I recently got out of a long-term and serious relationship with my GF of four yeras and it's gotten me shaken up a bit. I'm a master's student who recently defended his thesis and was scheduled to apply for PhD programs this year, but I'm just not sure anymore.\n\nTo be really honest with myself, the reasons to do a PhD were because I wanted to do research on the state-of-the-art things, but also largely because I wanted to immigrate to where my GF is. I'm from Korea and she's largely settled down in the US.\n\nWe broke up a few weeks ago and now I'm not even sure what I'm doing anymore. I still love research but frankly I don't know if I need a PhD to pursue that, also given that I don't want to be a professor. I also recently got an internship offer from a large research lab (it's a research lab run by a very large corporation) and have been having thoughts that it might not be bad to work there for a bit.\n\nHas anyone here felt similar before? Not sure exactly who I can open up to this about so I'm posting here. Thanks.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s high school-ish or bad for a major life event to effect other decisions. It makes perfect sense that the cost-benefit analysis for choosing a potential path would shift dramatically after the breakup of a long-term relationship. \n\nWhen you\u2019re in a serious relationship, the relationship plays a large role in informing major life decisions, so if you leave the relationship, those decisions are likely to change.",

      "text": "I would really recommend talking to a therapist if possible. I went through a bad break up right before I started my PhD. I started questioning everything in my life (including the PhD). Talking to a therapist really helped sort out my feelings. Ultimately I decided to do the PhD and am now a year in. \n\nI really feel for you, and I hope you take time for yourself to heal!",

      "text": "Life happens, and indecisiveness is pretty common! You're right, a lot of PhD's have the intention of becoming professors, but a lot of fields (especially STEM) have options for PhD's outside of academia and could be a great career choice. For example, in biotech there's a sort of career ceiling without a PhD. Someone with a BS or MS could work their way up to a role that a PhD enters into, but there's a lot of hoops to jump through and doubt from colleagues solely because of the lack of a PhD, and you might hit a ceiling in the more senior career positions.  \n\n\nTake a look into job sites for careers that you're interested in, including senior roles you may want down the line. Compare qualifications in the job postings with possible salaries on glassdoor. If there's not a great demand for a PhD for the career paths you want, you absolutely don't need it for your career.",

          "text": "I second this. Before applying to PhD programs this year, I interviewed at a reputable pharmaceutical company for a well paid role. In the end I turned it down to refocus on applications because I spoke to a Director  who plainly told me that a PhD is necessary for higher roles. Im older than most PhD candidates already so taking time to work in pharma and considering applying later is not really a great option for me, personally. I realized I was uniquely position now to apply but may not be after a couple years in pharma and it would also be harder for me to transition back into academia.",

So in that respect you\u2019re in a good position given you don\u2019t have a PhD to turn down etc. If I were you I\u2019d take the internship and put PhDs on the backburner. You don\u2019t have to say never - just not right now. You can always come back to the option later anyways.",

I just couldn\u2019t carry on as the fact that I was doing the PhD in a different country was major contributing factor to the breakup. \n\nWas it a good decision? Hell, I don\u2019t know- probably not as now I won\u2019t have a PhD from that uni. But on the other hand, at that time, I couldn\u2019t continue there.  So whatever you do, think it through and try not to regret the decision you make either way. It\u2019s not the end of the world (seems funny to me that I am writing this).\n\nStay strong!",

At a large corp you will not be respected or entrusted with \"real\" research if you don't have one. \n\nDefinitely worth thinking through things, but if it's easier to drop out of the PhD program rather than trying to get re-admitted (especially if you're funded) it may be worth starting and seeing how it goes for the first year. If you decide it's not your thing, you can always pivot to something else.",

He broke up with me in June right when I started to prepare and it left me reeling. I didnt really get much of an explanation besides us being different so it also made me wonder if it was my decision to do a phd that contributed. Relationships are just as important as your career and you planned alot around your GF. I would say to take some time to look at your motivations for a PhD and whether they\u2019re more about her or you. You can also apply and make that decision when/if you get in (if you have the funds to spare). I think if you love research and want to keep advancing; its a good idea. I, for one, realized that my love for research helped me deal with my breakup even while I was devastated. So for me its worth pursuing because it opens alot of doors to growth and access to fields besides the ones Ive experienced as a technician.",
