  "text": "I\u2019m applying for microbiology PhD programs right now and two of the schools I\u2019m interested in have a dual degree PhD/MPH that sounds interesting. \n\nI\u2019m ideally hoping to go into infectious disease research with a focus on virology. I do however love the field of public health and enjoy the intersections between the two fields. I know a phd program is stressful enough on its own and that I of course could just try to take some public health classes as electives but I was wondering if anybody here has enrolled in a similar program and if they could share their thoughts?",

      "text": "I would really consider how the MPH would benefit you. In grad school, there is a lot of leeway to study things that are important to your career path (or, at least, if you pick the right advisor there is room). I would bring up your interest in infectious disease with any potential advisor and see if they are willing to let you spread your class load between micro classes and public health. You will also learn the skills you need in grad school to teach yourself how to work in this intersection. Most scientists rely heavily on stats but very few get a masters in stats. They take classes on statistics and teach themselves how to use statistics as they go.",
