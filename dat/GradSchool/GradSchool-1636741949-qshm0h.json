  "text": "If this post is not okay for this sub, I understand. I am in the ADHDacademics sub, but it seems dead.\n\nBut at this point, I feel like, due to my ADHD and depression combined with lack of a good advisor, I have failed to finish my Master's degree. I finished my coursework in two years and have been stuck on my thesis writing ever since. I'm now working full time and live almost two hours from campus. My advisor retired, but is still trying to finish off what students he has left. But he is difficult to get any help from. I find it impossible to do this on my own without any direction, and unfortunately due to the advisor I chose, that is where I find myself. So, what that means, is I have made very little progress since leaving campus \\~four years ago. Every time I reach out to my advisor, it takes weeks for him to get back to me and then I make a tiny bit of progress and then get lost again and basically ignore it until it is time to register again. I literally don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing to get this done. \n\nTo give an idea, my school publishes a thesis template, schedule, and extremely detailed instructions on defending. My advisor never told me this! I recently happened to be searching through the school website and came across it on my own. That moment was like a light had been switched on and I was able to make a small amount of progress, filling in the template (and seeing how the schedule says this should be done in semester 2). I would never expect an advisor to baby me or hold my hand through thesis writing, but making me aware of these things IS what I would expect from an advisor.\n\nEach semester I awkwardly email the department to add me to the graduate study course and pay my tuition on one credit hour. And tell them THIS is the semester I will be finished. And then start the cycle again.\n\nI feel like I can't keep emailing my advisor and telling him I am stuck. I understand that it is not his responsibility to MAKE me work on this. I know that a big part of this is executive dysfunction. But I honestly do not know what to do.  This is as much of a rant as anything. I don't know what kind of advice I am expecting. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Should I just quit or somehow bs my way through this? At this point, I wish there was a way to graduate without a thesis, but my school does not offer that option.",

Yes technically your advisor traditionally fills all these rolls, but it's entirely acceptable ask for support from others in your department.",

          "text": "I do have a committee, but I've actually only talked to them really when I did my proposal defense right before leaving campus. Another thing with my thesis is that it is something that apparently no one at the school is really familiar with - I was not aware of this when I started. I was under the impression that one specific committee member was familiar with the methods and he is not. \n\nThe only person I can think of to email is the department chair. He wasn't department chair when I was on campus, just a professor. He was very helpful in the two years I was there, but obviously I have never tried to use him as a primary resource. Do you think it would be okay to reach out to him with my issue? I don't want my advisor to look bad or anything either... I mean he is a very nice guy and I think just over advising work, ready to be retired. \n\nAlso, another perspective on the committee member who should be familiar with part of my methods. In 2019, I was desperately trying to contact him from probably February to June. Never got a response. Finally asked someone else in his department if he was ever around and, surprise to me, he was apparently doing field work in Mexico and completely out of reach. That he was truly unable to access email in all that time... I don't know. Seems unlikely. But that is what I was told. He finally got back to me when Fall semester started up again.",

He's not getting paid to do this. It sounds like he did this as a favor for students so they wouldn't have to seek new advisors.\n\nNow some students don't need much guidance. And this situation might have worked well for them.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like that's you. Four years to complete a Master's thesis is on you. Not on your advisor. So you have to figure out how to make this work.\n\nTalk with your other committee members. Maybe one of them would be willing to take over as advisor. If not, talk with the director of graduate students in your department. Maybe they can find somebody for you.",

      "text": "I hate to hear stories like this. The university, department and your advisor all have a duty and obligation to not allow you to drag this out.  A masters should not take more than 3 years.  You are approaching PhD level time commitment here.  Go to your Advisor, your thesis committee members, and your department head individually and get a plan to get you graduated in the next 3 months.  And when I say get a plan together I mean they need to come up with the plan and all agree on it not you.  Put them accountable for coming up with the plan and hold them to the 3 months timeline.  Don't settle with them putting it back on you.  And this should not be an unreasonable ask.  At the end of 3 months you should have your thesis submitted, acceptaded and signed with your diploma in the mail.  Don't settle for your thesis committee or advisor offerring with anything less.\nGood luck.",

      "text": "Does your program have a Director of Graduate Studies? It could be worth checking in with them about your situation, especially if you're able to meet or Zoom. Maybe if they see where you're at and what is/isn't working, they can make suggestions for things to do moving forward.\n\n\nI also agree with the other user mentioning that other committee members may be more helpful. Even if they don't know your methodology, they may be able to help with things like available resources, breaking your project into manageable chunks, giving you some external motivation/accountability, and things like that. It sounds like your advisor hasn't given you that, and I'm sure that's playing into your struggle.\n\n\nLastly, and I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, are you in a good place as far as managing your ADHD symptoms? It may be that the thesis is a sticking point until you've got something like meds and/or coaching to help with things like executive dysfunction. I know it's easier said than done, but that would be a thought I have as far as the mental health component here.",
