  "text": "I'm in my 6th year of a PhD, will be done in the next 1-1.5 years. My advisor is great - when my mom died 2 years ago, he let me have 3 months off to spend with her, and just overall he's super helpful and I couldn't imagine another advisor. I love my work too.\n\nThe other day, I had my weekly meeting with my advisor and he just kind of.... blew me off. I'm wicked stressed because we have a biannual deadline coming up so was trying to catch him up on all the work I've been doing, and he just was very short with me and said it wasn't worth his time. Later, like the solid guy he is, he e-mailed me and apologized, said he was stressed about classes starting etc. I greatly admire him for e-mailing but also... no one suddenly starts thinking that their students aren't worth their time when they're stressed. Stress just makes the thought-to-word conversion more likely to happen,  you know? I don't care that he said that or acted like it, I only care that he thinks it. \n\nAnd y'all, it has got me messed up. I'm too dumb for this program, I know it, and I don't particularly care as long as I enjoy it and I don't get the boot. Knowing that my advisor kind of agrees I just... I don't know. Not quitting or anything, not doing anything about it except for ranting on a random subreddit, just want to shout it into the void. Thanks for listening.",

      "text": "I'm sorry you had to go through this. Grad school can really mess you and your self-esteem up big time. But, fwiw, I don't think your advisor particularly thinks you are not worth his time. He was maybe referring to just the update itself, that maybe it isn't as urgent as it actually is? It's just that the stress got to him, made him a bit more aggressive that he wasn't calm enough with his choice of words.\n\nJust my two cents but based on what you wrote about your mentor-mentee relationship with him, I don't think he meant it the way you supposedly perceived it. He seems like he's a person with humility. God knows this quality is not the most common trait found in academia (at least in my experience), especially when you've been in this environment for a long time.\n\nPlease know that you're worthy of where you are right now. You wouldn't reach this point if you weren't. The effort you're putting into your work shows in how prompt you are with delivering your progress reports. You can do it!!!",
