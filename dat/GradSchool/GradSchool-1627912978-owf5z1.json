  "text": "Is anyone else experiencing existential dread considering the state of the world/environment lately? I felt so hopeful for my future but in the past year I\u2019ve started having thoughts creep in that make me wonder if it\u2019s worth it at all. I ask myself what the point in putting myself through grad school is if we might all be living in chaos in the next decade? \n\nI am usually a total optimist, but it\u2019s become more and more difficult as the months pass. I\u2019m going into an MPH, if it matters.",

It ebbs and flows.\n\nIf the world is doing awesome, you\u2019d feel that you\u2019re wasting your precious time in grad school instead of capturing the success of the world. If the world sucks, you\u2019re wasting time that you should be doing something to safeguard your future self. If everything is chill, that\u2019s not really Earth these past couple decades but you\u2019d still feel like you\u2019re not sure of what you\u2019re doing will be helpful, useful, or get you a decent job.\n\nIt\u2019ll happen regardless.\n\nThe only thing that really matters is just to keep on moving.\n\nI was on a high profile NASA Mars mission but chose to leave the project and advisor due to reasons. I\u2019m at square 1 (\u2026 sort of). I\u2019m highly confident in the reason why I entered the PhD program though b/c I love it and it\u2019s good for humanity. This belief (and a solid support network) REALLY help me just continue moving forward no matter what. I still get the \u201cwtf am I doing? It\u2019s all wrong\u201d feeling regularly, but that\u2019s normal and I keep on chugging until it\u2019s back to being awesome.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve said that, don\u2019t let anybody tell you that you HAVE to stay in grad school. Recognizing a bad move before a ton of time has passed is important too. Just make sure you\u2019re making a rational call rather than being influenced by temporary \u201cI suck, this field sucks, I\u2019m wasting my life\u201d kind of feelings.\n\nGood luck pal :)\n\nP.S. your advisor can make things wonderful or absolutely god-awful. Make sure you try to build a healthy relationship with them. They can also be a solid support and help you when times are tough.",

But that doesn't mean we still can't enjoy life or find meaning.  \n\n\nI think something I learned is that ultimately a lot of things are outside of our control, but that doesn't mean we still can't \"fight back\" and not feel helpless. Us continuing our lives and making the best is a way of gaining back control and reclaiming whatever is lost due to these large systematic effects. Not only that, but the future hasn't been determined yet. It may be a very optimistic view, but I do believe there's still a lot we can do as individuals to try and change things in the future, not just for us, but for people who will also come after us.

You might be consuming too much mass media, they just about always frame things negatively. If your having dread about the future, cutting down on that is a good place to start. I personally couldn\u2019t be more optimistic for what\u2019s going come. The innovation in science, medicine, technology, space, etc continues to get better every single day. Even renewable energy has just recently become more cost efficient than fossil fuels. The best is literally yet to come",

It\u2019s a reasonable and healthy response to an existential threat. \u201cI\u2019d kind of wonder why somebody wasn\u2019t feeling anxious,\u201d she says. \n\n[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191010-how-to-beat-anxiety-about-climate-change-and-eco-awareness](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191010-how-to-beat-anxiety-about-climate-change-and-eco-awareness) \n\nThe MPH puts you in a good place to do meaningful work and make a difference. But the question is whether it feels meaningful to you, and whether there is anything that would feel more meaningful to be doing (either instead or in addition). \n\nHave you read Learning to Die in the Anthropocene? It's not as morbid as it sounds\n\n>But the biggest problems the Anthropocene poses are precisely those that have always been at the root of humanistic and philosophical questioning: \u201cWhat does it mean to be human?\u201d and \u201cWhat does it mean to live?\u201d In the epoch of the Anthropocene, the question of individual mortality \u2014 \u201cWhat does my life mean in the face of death?\u201d \u2014 is universalized and framed in scales that boggle the imagination. What does human existence mean against 100,000 years of climate change? What does one life mean in the face of species death or the collapse of global civilization? How do we make meaningful choices in the shadow of our inevitable end?  \nThese questions have no logical or empirical answers. They are philosophical problems par excellence. Many thinkers, including Cicero, Montaigne, Karl Jaspers, and The Stone\u2019s own Simon Critchley, have argued that studying philosophy is learning how to die. If that\u2019s true, then we have entered humanity\u2019s most philosophical age \u2014 for this is precisely the problem of the Anthropocene. The rub is that now we have to learn how to die not as individuals, but as a civilization.  \n>  \n>The biggest problem climate change poses isn\u2019t how the Department of Defense should plan for resource wars, or how we should put up sea walls to protect Alphabet City, or when we should evacuate Hoboken. It won\u2019t be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize there\u2019s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our new reality.\n\n[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/)\n\nGood luck",

It's about finding work that you feel good about and that provides you with a sense of meaning. To look at the larger state of human existence in search of a plan that won't feel like a \"waste of time\" is probably a pointless task. Maybe try to not be so focused on outcomes and instead pursue projects that bring you meaning and a sense of purpose through the work. If the journey is the goal, rather then the destination, and learning/sharing knowledge is the objective then there's no such thing as wasted time or effort. Make the journey count and do what you can to bring light and goodness into your tiny corner of the world during this short blip of time that you get to spend in this existence.",
