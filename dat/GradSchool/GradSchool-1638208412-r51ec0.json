      "text": "I can\u2019t speak for Canada, but in the US applications are due in fall/winter if you want to start the next fall (mine were due late November - early January 2020 for programs starting August-September 2021). I started working on applications, contacting faculty, and arranging my letters of recommendation the summer right before the applications were due, and gave the GRE in late October (which I think was about the last date I could have done it with my deadlines.) Does that help answer your question? I\u2019m not quite sure what sites/programs you\u2019re looking at.",
