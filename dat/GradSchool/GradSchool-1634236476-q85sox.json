  "title:": "Can I get into a PhD from MEng?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently at UC Berkeley doing my masters of engineering in Mechanical engineering, however there is no research involved. My undergrad was actually computer science in a different field. I\u2019m thinking of doing a PhD back into computer sciences instead of mechanical engineering because I don\u2019t find my grad classes super interesting. Is it possible to get into a CS PhD program from a Masters of Engineering with no research from a different field? It doesn\u2019t have to be in a top 5 school. I\u2019ve had enough of Berkeley now actually. I\u2019m thinking of a top 20-30 school now.  My country is in US",
