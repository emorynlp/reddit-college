  "title:": "GPA from 10 years ago hurting my chances, my current GPA of 2.57 is not good enough for any graduate program I apply for. How can I increase my chances if my more recent classes have really good scores recently semesters?",
  "text": "All my applications get denied because of classes I messed up when I was homeless 10 years ago. This is making my GPA at a nice disgusting 2.63 and its really not helping. Every page I send of letters of intent, it's like they just throw it out without looking at my reasons. Even though my last couple semesters I've had 3.2GPA's overall, it doesn't matter it feels.\n\nWhat's the point? I'm stuck in an endless cycle of submitting bunches of letters of recommendation and showing courses I have taken to improve myself, but all in all I feel like its all for nothing.\n\nI've been rejected from 6 different graduate courses related to Finance in the past 2 years. $700 in fees down the drain so far.\n\nPlease, any tips on successfully applying with such a low GPA? I've even mentioned non-matriculated but that doesn't seem to help.",

I had a ton of things in my life at a couple different times that caused me to have a lower GPA, probably about the same as yours. I was easily able to get into the program I applied for and now I\u2019m 3 classes from graduation and I have maintained a 4.0 while working full time. Here is what worked for me: I explained my circumstances in my application letter but in a way that was not a pity party or too much of a downer, I explained what is different in my life now, and I had two very strong professional letters of recommendation. I also did not apply to a sought after school, I applied to a smaller state school with a great program in my subject that is very affordable. I work in the field I am studying which is Higher Ed., so that also helped. \nGrad school is a capitalist enterprise, even at public schools. Apply to less popular ones that are looking for students and you are more likely to get in. \nBest of luck and I hope it works out for you!",
