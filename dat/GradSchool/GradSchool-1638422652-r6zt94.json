  "text": "I'm just a few days from graduation, and I have defended and basically have my thesis good to go.\n\nUnfortunately, my advisor has soured on me quickly. I told him I was interested in applying to another program for my PhD and he said he would support it and that \"other professors might get defensive, like 'you work for me'\" so I said \"Oh, if I said something rude I apologize\" and he said \"no, no\"\n\nAfter a conversation where he seemed finicky about signing my thesis based on extra work, I sent him the first screenshot. [https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H](https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H)\n\nHis final reply is really typical. He has long conversations with me and then faults me for being \"too meta\" when I legitimately sit with my mouth shut for minutes on end.\n\nThe thesis I worked on is something at the beginning of the semester (this semester, yes he had me start a new project even though this is my fifth semester of graduate school). I said I didn't want to work on it and he said he wanted me to do it anyway, so I did and didn't say anything more about it. I also said I didn't want to graduate this semester (because I wanted longer to work on the project) but he said he wanted me to graduate this semester, so I am.\n\nWell, cue second screenshot. [https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H](https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H)\n\nReally this came out of the blue. He asked me for something difficult and, because of a class project I told him about, I had less than 24 hours to do it before he got mad and I was completely unaware of the deadline. I usually put in a lot of hours and am his student that works the most. The first is just chock full of sensitive information, but essentially I followed the instruction of someone else at DARPA and asked a DARPA higher up to review my thesis in time (again, as the employee said) so it can be released (military release review), and he got mad I did that. I had already apologized (third screenshot) [https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H](https://imgur.com/a/UY5SF4H) and the email to the DARPA guy was very nice and professional. I had done so recently and he said it was good that I did that, and so I'm really surprised he's mad about that (in the part of the text that got deleted I said I would certainly not contact him again without his permission).\n\nWhat is the best course of action? How do I calm things down? Did I mess something up in my phrasing/emails/texts? Do I really need my advisor's recommendation to apply to other colleges, and if I do, would it be best to change advisors?\n\nI'm a controls engineer. I do have other options like going to work in industry (I have a standing job offer) but want to get my PhD.",

Make sure you let them know that it is a meeting for YOU, not a meeting about your advisor or to bash his behavior. What I mean by that is to focus on \"I\" statements. Example email below...\n\n\"Hello \\[department head\\],\n\nI am scheduled to graduate this semester and was hoping to meet with you about finishing my degree. I am also in the middle of a minor situation with my advisor and would like your advice on how I can better handle it since I am in the process of graduating. I would like to have this discussion with you because you might have another perspective that I haven't thought of yet. If possible could you keep the meeting between the two of us unless we decide to bring \\[your advisor\\] into the conversation too? I just want to facilitate my transition out of the lab in the best way possible. I've really enjoyed my time in the department and hope to continue having good relationships with all the faculty and students here. \n\nThank you,\n\n\\[your name\\]\"",

      "text": "So, if you don't have some blind spot that you're missing here, your professor is an idiot. My field is very tied to sensitive information and export control, and you do not fuck around with that. The government can come after your ass, both your institution and your personal self, with a vengeance if you publish something that you're not supposed to. If he fucks up, he's blackballed from just about every government grant at the very least. If you have the DARPA people telling you that you did a good thing, I have no idea why that would set him off. Everyone in the export control space encourages you to ask questions and to ask them often and I am sure your DARPA contacts are the same. They would much rather answer mundane or even stupid questions then have something get out.",

      "text": "I don't really know what's going on here, even with the selected screenshots you provided. Anyone with half a brain knows that PhD programs are really competitive, so unless this adviser is able to guarantee to you, in writing, that you will have a funded spot at your current university, then of course you're going to be looking to apply to other universities. If he gets upset about that, he needs therapy. \n\nI don't know how appropriate it is to ask people who are not on your committee to review your thesis. I've never heard of that before, but maybe this is normal for your field. Is the person you asked to review your thesis someone you've worked with and interacted with personally? If not, then it seems really odd that you'd reach out to them about something beyond their purview. If you have worked with this person closely, it's still weird, but I'm not sure it warrants the message your adviser sent. Your adviser seems to be a bit detached from reality if he thinks your graduation is a \"personal short term goal\". Why TF does he think you're in graduate school? Graduation is literally *the* goal. His project is less important than your graduation. If he's not able to effectively mentor students to the point where they are able to graduate, he should be fired so he can be allowed to seek employment in a more fitting environment. Otherwise, advising graduate students is literally his job. \n\nYou do not need your adviser's permission to apply to other universities if you have enough letters of recommendation from other people. I'd consider, however, not telling him which universities you are applying to though, in case he's the kind to hold a grudge. He seems to think your goal is to serve as inexpensive, exploitable labor for him to finish his projects, rather than a budding independent scholar. That's problematic.",

It contains sensitive information that the government needs to decide whether or not to publicly release (security related). He asked me to get it and knows I need it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You do not need your adviser's permission to apply to other universities if you have enough letters of recommendation from other people.\n\nYes, I have plenty, but don't I need my current advisor's recommendation? Wouldn't they attempt to contact him? I feel like they would notice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'd consider, however, not telling him which universities you are applying to though, in case he's the kind to hold a grudge.\n\nHe is and I already told him. Uuuuggh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He seems to think your goal is to serve as inexpensive, exploitable labor for him to finish his projects, rather than a budding independent scholar. That's problematic.\n\nI mean I agree, but like now what? I suppose if I don't need his recommendation then I can just move on.\n\nAlso, thanks for your help.",
