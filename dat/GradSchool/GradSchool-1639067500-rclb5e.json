  "text": "So I just finished my first term of grad school (yay)! It was all remote and so is next semester. However, I\u2019m maybe moving to attend in person classes for the remainder of my program which I have a year left of my masters. \nIdk I feel glum about having to possibly uproot right in the middle of my program. I\u2019m doing school from home so I\u2019d be moving to the city a couple hours away to have classes in person. Kinda wishing my school would\u2019ve accommodated remote year by year instead of semester by semester. Is anyone else in a similar boat?",

      "text": "Yes. My school is transitioning to one in-person class next semester, with the rest being online. I\u2019ll have to commute 2 hours for the weekly class. The following year I will have to move closer to the school for my internship. It\u2019s likely to be a lot of stress on top of the regular stress of grad school. Best of luck in your journey. You\u2019re not alone, we got this :)",
