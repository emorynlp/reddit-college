  "text": "I\u2019m in my first year of my PhD and have zero results after 7 months. I go in every Monday-Friday, first person in and last to leave. I spend all day and night thinking about how to optimise my experiments and nothing has worked. My supervisor hasn\u2019t really given me any advice other than \u2018keep trying\u2019\n\nI worked for a few years before grad school and I don\u2019t expect things to just go well, but nothing to show for 7 months of work is getting tough. \n\nIs this normal? When do you give up? I\u2019m thinking of stepping down to a masters or quitting altogether.",

      "text": "This is really normal. \n\nLearning how to get experiments to work is a central part of your training. If you don't learn in grad school and discover that you need to in your first job, your career in research is over. \n\nOne of the biggest predictors of success for PhD research students is the resilience to keep working on the problems when the experiments are not coming together. And to keep coming up with ideas to try based on learning more about how others have done similar things. \n\nSeven months is frustrating, no doubt about it. But is is not that unusual. Having a second experiment producing good data at the same time can help. It doesn't have to be an important experiment, and can use techniques that are well established in the lab. \n\nOne of the best tools for a scientist is knowing who to ask and how to ask to figure out how to solve these methodological obstacles. That comes with practice. Try it on people in your lab, people in the next lab, people in labs across the world. Other graduate students, postdocs and technicians are super valuable, but may take referral to find.",

I was really demoralised after that first year because my peers had papers in the works and heaps of data. By the end of my phd I was getting complaints from my committee that I had too much and it was almost beyond the scope of a single project. The important thing is to keep reevaluating and working on your project even when things are rough.\"\n\nHope this story helps.",
