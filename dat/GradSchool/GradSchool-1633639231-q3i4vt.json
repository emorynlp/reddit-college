  "title:": "Failed my first graduate exam. Now I have to get at least a 92% on the next two exams to pass the class. Help.",
  "text": "I received a 70.5 on the exam. Passing is considered 83%. \n\nThis is the most poorly structured class I have ever taken. New lecturer for every class session (class meets three times a week). Lectures do not mesh well together since a new person is teaching every time. Each professor writes a single question for the exam corresponding to their lecture. The question should be answered in essay format. Approximately 17 questions per exam. Three hours allotted. I should add that the subject matter is physiology (electrophysiology in particular). \n\nThe worst part is the exam is online since the grading is done by multiple people. I am much better at taking tests on paper. I cannot organize my thoughts properly when typing on a computer screen. I need paper to touch and something to physically write with to organize and edit my responses. I do not fair well when it comes to conveying ideas through typing. I am scattered and all over the place. \n\nI asked the professor in charge of the class if I have the option to take the exam in paper format. He said no. He said it was okay to write answers on paper and then type them in the end but he warned this may be time consuming (obviously). \n\nI'm nervous and scared I might fail out of graduate school. It's my first semester. This exam already blew my confidence to smithereens. \n\nAny advice and/or suggestions are welcome.",

      "text": "I don't know about the class, but I would encourage you to actively work at being a better writer on the computer. Preferring to write things on paper may have worked 30 years ago, but I can't think of any situation in which that sort of thing would be tolerated or accommodated nowadays. It's definitely a skill that can be developed, so there's no such thing as a \"bad at writing on the computer\" person. You may be less experienced, but that doesn't mean you're bad at it. I would start with things like notes or research ideas. If you have an idea for a research paper, practice typing it out electronically if your natural inclination is to write on paper. You can start with a little bit at a time, and then start to do more as you get better. It doesn't mean you have to give up pen and paper forever, but you're already great at writing with pen and paper. Once you're as skilled at writing electronically, you can use your preferred method for your personal stuff and leave the professional/class-related writing to the computer.",

I don\u2019t know your grading breakdown in the class, but if you need a 92% on the (exam + final?) gauge yourself and see if that\u2019s attainable. If you don\u2019t believe you can pull it off, consider withdrawing before the deadline. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m engineering so my experience in a research institution is most likely is completely different than yours. Thus, I\u2019m probably not much help as engineering tends to be curved even in the undergrad setting.\n\nEdit: Adding description (didn\u2019t mean to submit)",

That approach will serve you well as you master the methods and material to be a successful grad student. \n\nWhen you are a graduate student, you will be learning a lot from a great variety of people. Sometimes in the classroom, but a lot of the time other venues. Being able to learn in all those contexts is a crucial skill to develop during graduate school. You can't do that in just the first month! \n\nFor the electrophysiology content, a good approach is to understand how your low-scoring answers differed from the high-scoring ones. You can find that out from other students or from the professor who taught that lecture. \n\nBeing able to compose on a computer is another skill that can be developed Since it is considered a basic requirement for a lot of educated people, it is also worth mastering. \n\nIn short, there is lots to learn, but all normal things to learn as a grad student.",

It is a tough exam format but now you know what to expect and can prepare for that style. I do suggest speaking with the professor for feedback on what you were lacking this time and try to address that.",

If one essay on each exam hadn't been from a political scientist I had previously had for several courses a piece, I suspect I would have finished off with a D or F. How are you suppose to write on an essay question that is only based upon content from a single lecture--especially when it is a field you may have only had a single intro course in? Oddly there were no historians involved with the program, even though a historical perspective for studying any sort of issue is essential.",
