  "text": "Today we took the midterm exam. There were about 20 students in the testing room. I was so sick to see that certain students were cheating. They used phone taking pictures and sent them out to get the answers. They passed notes. They worked in group. I felt like they did not prepare for the test. Prof caught a guy receiving notes from another guy but did not know they were cheating. I feel like it is not fair at all. And they are graduate students but study nothing to get a degree. Should I email the prof?\n\nEdit: I emailed the prof. This is a group of students whose names I don\u2019t know. I just gave the Prof a heads-up so he will keep an eye on them on the final exam.",

It\u2019s not like it\u2019s required for a ton of careers like undergrad is. \n\nThe whole reason grades aren\u2019t a big deal in grad school is because schools rightly assume students choose to be here with a desire to learn.",

This could affect decisions the profs make in the classroom (e.g., will they ever again trust those students to take an unproctored test) as well as in research.\n\n* With 20 students in the room, no way they'll know it was you that reported them. Not unless all 20 of you hang out together frequently and you act weird when they say \"man, someone reported me to Prof X for cheating!\" Doesn't seem likely to me.
