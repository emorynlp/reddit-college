  "title:": "Grad students: Do you respond to supervisor emails or notifications during holidays or recess?",
  "text": "Today we don't attend our internship, as is one of the few days off we have. My supervisor respond to an old email today, also asking a question regarding clinical cases. I've been trying to set boundaries to achieve balance and personal time. I was setting myself to disconnect at least today. \n\nIn a way responding to her would be reinforcing that is ok to engage in holidays. Which I am trying not to. Yet in another, she is still my supervisor and on Monday I will probably either need to respond in case I didn't do it today or see the repercussion of \"accumulated work\". (As well that soon we will have evaluations at the end of the semester)\n\nWhat to do, I am trying to do the right thing yet responding to her don't know it might be.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?  Do you respond to supervisor emails or notifications during holidays or recess?",

I also disconnected my professional email from my phone. Having the notifications from work during your days off is just a way to add pressure and not really disconnect. No one has ever batted an eye when i didn't respond to an email sent to me friday at 22:52 before mondaya at 8. I have never batted an eye when no one has answered my saturday morning email either. Days off are just that: off. Don't let yourself be guilted into working on your days off.",

He's so passionate and loves his students he's so helpful. He would greenlight me this very moment if I asked. His dad is also sick, and I know he is with his family. So in my case I set the boundary(and thankfully I think most other student do too for themselves at least) because I want him to have that time, even if I feel like the invitation is open.\n\nAs for him reaching out during the holidays, I know for a fact he would, ONLY if it was in regards to sending me a job, because I have been searching very very hard. \n\nSo basically my advisor is perfect and I wish you all could have similarly wonderful advisors",

I try to keep important communication limited to business hours, but when something comes up, I'm okay using the occasional Saturday morning/early afternoon (before 2PM) to work, or just to send a quick response to someone. After that, good luck reaching me before Monday!",

I suspect partially because he set boundaries early on.",

It doesn't matter at all.  \nThere is no *obligation* to respond, but it is not *forbidden* to respond, either.  \nYou can respond or not and it doesn't matter. \n\nWhen I get an email and I see it, I might read it or not, and if I read it, I might reply or not, whatever I want. That's it. That's how you win the game. Do whatever you want. This goes for a holiday or not! Same-day is not a default expectation, and next-day isn't even a default. You can talk about it if it becomes an issue and someone wants within 48 hours but you are only willing to agree to within 72 hours, but otherwise, literally do whatever you want. Don't overthink trivia.\n\nOn the flip-side, when I decide to work on a holiday, when I send emails I don't expect others to respond. That would be crazy. At the same time, it would also be crazy for me to not send emails whenever I want on my schedule. Just because I'm working doesn't mean you have to work, but just because you're not working doesn't mean I can't email you. \n\nThat's the thing about emails: **they're asynchronous**.\n\nIf something is genuinely urgent, that's what synchronous communication methods are for, like phone-calls. You can easily gate-keep phone-calls by limiting who you give your number to. If someone doesn't have your phone-number, then they cannot call you for things so nothing in their life is something you consider urgent in your life.",
