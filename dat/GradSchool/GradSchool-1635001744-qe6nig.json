  "title:": "Afraid I won\u2019t ever get a peer-reviewed publication\u2026",
  "text": " I started the process in early 2019. Submitted an article to a journal, got 2 revise and resubmits, then a flat out rejection. The process was divided and they brought in extra reviewers because no one could agree on my paper (some reviewers seemed to love it, while others said it needed a lot of work). I tried to make the changes they asked for but everyone gave me completely different advice on where to take the article. They brought back the same reviewer for the 2nd revision, and it was clear this scholar just thought my work was terrible but didn\u2019t really give me advice on how to improve. They were also just plain rude about the process and spoke over me as if I wasn't reading the reviews they provided. \n\nAfter the rejection, I took a bit of a break to recharge. Then I fixed my article up again, and submitted to a new journal. I\u2019ve now been waiting 8+ months for them to even forward it to peer reviewers. \n\nMeanwhile, this paper has gotten me invited to conferences, has won multiple awards from my institution, and has been praised by multiple colleagues in my dept. and my field. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t get it published. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. \n\nThe process of trying to get things published is honestly so stressful I don\u2019t know if I want to keep doing this. To make up for the fact that I don\u2019t have anything peer-reviewed, I have a chapter that will be published in a book soon, but the publishers screwed me over so much they wouldn\u2019t even let me correct mistakes I knew were in it after they told me I would have time to do so. So the only thing I will have published is a POS that I'm ashamed of. And it\u2019s just out there forever for people to see (if they can manage to find it to read).\n\nAs someone with perfectionist tendencies I've been trying to deal with, all of this makes me feel so ashamed.",

It's easily several months past the time when it would be perfectly acceptable for you to reach out to the editor directly to ask about the status of your paper.  Definitely a non confrontational email, ask them if there's anything else that they need from you, etc.  But give them a nudge!  8 months is far too long to sit on the editor's desk.  In many ways a prompt desk reject is a better outcome for you than this stasis.",

      "text": "Yeah, I can sympathize. I usually submit to conferences (and will mostly do so going forward because of my field), and I\u2019m glad for that because the few experiences I\u2019ve had with journals aren\u2019t that good. \n\nSomething similar (revise/resubmit, followed by rejection by a harsh reviewer) happened for my second journal submission, we submitted to a new journal, and now I\u2019ve been waiting 6 months for the reviewers to get back to me. Is your work at the intersection of fields, or does it go against an existing theory? My third journal submission was rejected by high impact journals and now we\u2019re going back to medium impact journals. So only 1/3 journal submissions went somewhat smoothly for me, and this seems typical from what others say. \n\nTry not to be too hard on yourself. Are there other more short term projects you could work on, or projects that you could work on with others? I find the success of individual papers doesn\u2019t matter as much to me if I have multiple projects going on, I just think as long as the methods and science are solid, it will eventually get published somewhere reputable (even if it\u2019s not in the journal you want). I\u2019m less sure if this holds true in the humanities but I\u2019d be surprised if it doesn\u2019t. \n\nApart from other projects, I try to also just not put all my expectations on one thing in general. Like keeping in contact with loved ones, doing hobbies and reading etc. My academic work and whether or not it gets published is just one facet of my life, though it doesn\u2019t feel that way at times.",

I will say it's a pretty niche topic, but I think the subject matter is not something that those outside of the specialization couldn't understand and comment on. \n\nI'm working on my dissertation and developing another project, so there's definitely no issue with new projects! And many hobbies outside of my work as well.\n\nI just worry about trying to go on the job market with no publications. And I guess having this fairly bad experience with my first time trying to get published has kind of soured everything. I was pretty proud of and excited about this project at the time but every time I have to revise it I feel less and less invested in it. I guess I just have to be more patient.",
