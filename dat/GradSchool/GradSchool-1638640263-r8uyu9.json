  "title:": "Has anyone gotten a masters in one field and then done a fastracked phd in a related, but not the same field?",
  "text": "**Skip if don't want back story**: I think this subreddit has really humbled my opinions of grad school, but nonetheless I'm still looking into getting a PhD eventually (just finishing up my undergrad right now, but I like planning the general direction of my future so i can know what to expect and what experiences might help better pave the path to where I want to be). I'm feeling sort of conflicted because I'm interested in both applied linguistics and linguistics that don't necessarily relate to teaching languages. In Canada I've noticed that applied linguistics and linguistics have very separate degrees, ie. if you do a masters in applied linguistics it doesn't make you qualified to get a phd in linguistics. My ultimate goal is to teach in a university for somethign language related--I'm definitely interested in teaching english as a second language in universities but could also see myself teaching linguistics courses in the future too. So an ma in applied linguistics (most likely it would be course based in order to get the requirements done to qualify for the national tesl teaching certificate but ideally I'd like to do a thesis-based one) would allow me to teach esl classes in a university, but I can also see myself switching career paths later to become a more linguistics oriented professor and for that I would need a PhD in linguistics.\n\n**Start here if you just want the actual question**: I'd like to keep my options open for getting a PhD linguistics later in life. What I was thinking of is that I could get a masters in a subfield of my main interest and if I chose, come back to gradschool with the intention of doing a fasttracked phd in the more general field of linguistics. That being said, my professors have generally said they feel people who do fast tracks don't do well in their phd, but they also don't know anyone who'd pursued that method of getting a phd who already has a masters in a related (albeit specialized) field. Has anyone here had an experience like this? Do you guys think this is a viable plan?",
