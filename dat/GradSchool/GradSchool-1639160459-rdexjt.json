  "text": "I turned in everything for counseling program I am applying to. Turned in my letter of intent through email Wednesday morning and about 2 hours later The dean of the department emailed for a one on one Skype interview time and date. He said he had availability this coming Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning. I emailed him an hour later about 11:30 a.m. due to the fact that the interview dates are next week and he hasn't confirmed my date I am freaking just a little ( I know i shouldn't) but if I don't here from him by today should I call on Monday ? Or email .",
