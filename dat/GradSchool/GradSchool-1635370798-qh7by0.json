  "text": "I imagine many of you have heard of this and might have some opinion on it. \n\n2 very different questions that might spark some conversation: \n\n1. How helpful do you think the services they offered were? \n2. How does this service, and the prices they charge (usually about $150-200 per hour of assistance), *not* reproduce socioeconomic inequalities?  Am I missing something?",

      "text": "\\#1. Never used it. I occasionally listen to their podcasts. They can be...disheartening. They talk about a lot of the negative aspects of this career path. Which is fair, accurate, and needs to be done, but I find they really bum me out. \n\n\\#2 is a tough one. People deserve to be paid for their labor, so it is reasonable for them to charge for their time. $200 per hour is very reasonable for the kind of service they provide and their level of training. But, I see your point about how it makes their services inaccessible for some. I have no idea what the solution is.",

It's reasonably accurate and probably useful in the social sciences at an R1. \n\nIn my view, Kelsky is more than willing to give advice to folks in other fields (like the experimental sciences) or at other university types (LACs, PUIs) advice that is just really, really bad and would get someone dropped early in consideration.",
