  "text": "It's my first semester of my master's. I have two 20 page papers due this week. For some reason I'm so overwhelmed by the task that I can't bring myself to even really start... I haven't even finished the outlines yet. I am wasting time, putting them off because I think it just feels too daunting, but then I feel so guilty for not being productive. What helps you motivate yourself to get through periods like this to ~get shit done~ ???",

      "text": "If there's one good thing about prelim experience in my department, it's that it teaches you that a 20 page paper can be written in 8 hours, so this is totally doable. \n\nYou may have long days ahead given that you have two papers, but you can definitely do it. The best way to start writing is to just start typing without worrying how it sounds. You can edit and revise it later. At least for me, once I start writing, it's easier to keep writing. If I keep *thinking* about writing, I'll never start.",

      "text": "This is doable. Hard, and you'll likely only get a pass but whatever. First you need a good setting. I would lock myself in a solo study room at the library. Coffee and  a good walk/jog before hand.\n\nPresumably you've actually researched the topic? Read articles, thought about it?\n\nGreat. Start writing. Write whatever.\n\nIntroduction? Write a sentence that vaguely is a coherent thought. Not sure about your thesis - skip it. \n\nWrite literally everything you've thought about these topics. Aim for a minimum of 5 pages.\n\nSet it down and go for an hour long walk or run. Come back and read what you worked on first (oldest) think about what in that mass is the direction you want to go. Write another couple of pages. Switch to topic 2. Repeat.\n\nEdit the heck out of it when you get there.",

      "text": "Break it up!!!\n\nSplit the paper into sections! Say \"on x day, I will do this section.\" Then \"the next day, I will do this next section,\" and so on and so forth until you have a full first draft. Breaking it into pieces makes it a lot less daunting than thinking of it as one 20 page paper.\n\nI always start with the introduction as it sets the tone for the paper, but that's just me.\n\nAnother recommendation- for your introduction or any other parts that require references, find your sources first and implement them into the paper as you go along. Also add them to the references section as you go along so that its one less thing you have to worry about at the end. I find this much easier than writing that section (usually the introduction or discussion) and having to go back and find \"wait, which paper was it that I got this piece of information from?\"\n\nBreaking it into smaller pieces does wonders for daunting long papers. And you'll find that once you have one section done, it's a lot more motivating to keep going because you've already started and made progress.",
