  "text": "I'm a senior undergrad in biotech and I am at an impasse. \n\nDo I do a master's or a Ph.D.?\n\nMy goal is to work in the industry, hopefully working with a company that focuses on developing new treatments for disease. \n\nI've received opinions from advisors for both and I'm really not sure. A Ph.D. takes a lot longer but most are funded. Masters are shorter but finding funding is much more difficult. \n\nGiven my career aspirations, what would you recommend?",

I wouldn't recommend taking a funded PhD spot with the intention of mastering out, it feels skeezy and you're taking the spot of someone who was actually intending to complete the degree, being dishonest with your advisor, etc. Don't do a PhD unless either you really want to, or your job requires it.",

Pharma, biotech startups, CROs, etc. all have excellent masters- and PhD-level positions with advancement opportunities. What differentiates them is more so the actual role you will be performing. So, it sounds like you need to drill down and get a much clearer idea of what kind of role you want to fill. *That's* a career aspiration, not the kind of company you work for. \n\nIt's totally fine---normal, really---to not know this at your stage. Grad school isn't the default next step after undergrad. Many successful grad students first spend time in the workforce really getting a strong understanding of their goals, current skills, and so on.",

              "text": "I really had no idea what I wanted to do when I started grad school other than the vague idea of being in industry. Unfortunately, most people you can talk to about this (professors, academic advisors, other grad students) can't really tell you anything useful. Having been in industry for 3 years, I don't even know what all of the possible career paths are or what it is like at different kinds of companies. That is perfectly fine. Normal.\n\nBased on what I have seen on the hiring side in industry (big pharma), it is probably easier to get in right after a masters rather than right after a PhD (unless you go the industry post-doc route). You will be in charge of more projects and stuff with a PhD than a masters, usually. My current manager does not have a PhD but this person has been in R&D for a loooooong time.\n\nIn terms of doing a masters or a PhD, if you really love research, learning new stuff, finding answers via experiments, then go with a PhD. If you don't know, maybe work in a research lab for a year or 2 and then decide if you want a masters or PhD.",

If you were able to get hired directly out of undergrad, would an employer be willing to foot the bill for your master's on a part-time schedule?
