  "text": "I\u2019m almost done with my first semester of grad school and I haven\u2019t made any real friendships. I went to one girls apartment the first week as she was hosting a get together, and I have been to coffee shops a couple times to work on group projects, but I have no one that I consistently talk to. There are a few established groups that hang out together all the time. I feel like it\u2019s too late for me to randomly butt in to a group as I\u2019ve been pretty reserved all semester, but I really want a study group at least. Should I even bother? Would it be weird to randomly walk into a group conversation? Everyone is really nice and strikes small talk when I see them in the halls, I just feel like I can\u2019t relate to anyone on a deeper level.",

Same goes for asking the others who aren't part of a group. \n\nDon't think this is your only opportunity to make real friendships in the next 2-7 years (idk your program) though. Grad school is different than undergrad, it's like a job. Your coworkers could turn out to be friends or not. There's no reason you can't seek friendship outside of your program or the university entirely",

      "text": "I found myself on the outside of a friend group in the first semester and it made me feel pretty lonely and isolated. The kicker was when I was at a get together and I witnessed a whole group making plans for yoga together. It was all the girls there from my cohort except me. But things started turning around when I started focusing on individual friendships rather than trying to get into a group. I naturally gravitated toward people whose personalities fit with mine and I found meaningful friendships with these people as individuals. And then last year I met someone in a new cohort who I really connected with and they are probably my closest friend now. All the ladies in my own cohort were very outdoorsy active people, and I am more of an artsy type and not super athletic, so I just wasn't with my type of people at first. I would advise you to just be patient and try to form meaningful friendships with the people you click with most. Just because some people hang out as a group doesn't mean you can't see some of them one-on-one.",

It can feel pretty isolating, which is especially tough when you\u2019re trying to navigate grad school. I\u2019ve been there. My best advice is to keep putting yourself out there (as you\u2019re comfortable with doing) and you may end up forming some relationships.",

Asking someone about the course or if they know of any study groups that are meeting to discuss the coursework usually gets a convo going. Make friends with people from your research lab too. You can also make your own opportunities e.g. after a meeting say you're getting a coffee, would anyone like to join? etc etc. thesis all can help you get to know people a little bit better   \n\n\nI am an international student at my university and my group consisted of other internationals. Most of my close friends at grad school are from other departments. I never got into the groups from my own program, and that was okay too. Sometimes you vibe with people not form your department. And again, these things take time. You'll find your footing soon enough. :)",
