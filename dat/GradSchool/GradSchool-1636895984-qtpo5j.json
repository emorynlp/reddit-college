  "text": "Hi! I'm soon-to-be an exchange student coming to the States fall next year for grad school. I've been doing some research on master's programs in comms/media studies but am having some difficulties finding the right course. I'm looking for something similar to LSE's MSc Media and Communications program (US equivalent?) or Newhouse's Media Studies master's at Syracuse. MIT's Comparative Media Studies program also seems to be aligned with my study objectives but these are top-notch schools and I want to have alternatives. All the other courses I have found so far are concentrated in specific profession/fields such as Journalism or PR or media production while I am looking for a program focused on overall theories/concepts in media and comms.\n\nMy second question is \u2014 How's the thesis track different from the non-thesis track especially in media studies at grad school in the US? I understand the basics but I want to know more about pros/cons or personal experiences. I'm thinking about taking the thesis track as I'm currently leaning towards research/academics after graduation. Any advice on this? Please share your thoughts/experiences, I'd love to hear!",
