And the only reasons top universities get it easy is because they don't have to apply, they just ask. Typical grant funding acceptance is less than 30%, even within the top 20.\n\nAs for students, top universities have vastly more funds than lower for funding students. If they aren't giving a student money it's because they're accepting a student that doesn't really belong but they're willing to take their money. Lower universities *have* to pay to get sufficient quality  students.",
