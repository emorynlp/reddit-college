  "text": "I plan on applying for a school counseling grad program, deadline Feb 1st. I literally don\u2019t know anyone to get letters of rec from. I graduated undergrad in May of 2021 and of course I haven\u2019t kept in touch with any of my professors. Not to mention I didn\u2019t really do that well in Undergrad (I graduated with a 3.15 GPA). I feel awkward emailing my professors because I feel like it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in class that they probably don\u2019t remember me and would be offended if I asked them. I didn\u2019t really ever have any chill professors that I think would just do it, and I didn\u2019t really have a professor that I got close with (I was stupid in undergrad, I know). I just want to note that grad school was never originally my plan so I stupidly didn\u2019t really do anything in undergrad that would make me a good candidate for grad school.\n\nAnyone have any tips? I have a pretty relevant job right now so I could ask my boss except I have only been working for a month so far. Ugh. I feel so stuck.",

      "text": "You need to give them a reason to write you a letter.\n\n>Dear Professor,\n\n>I have recently made the decision to apply for graduate school and I am reaching out to you to request a letter of recommendation.\n\n> I took your course (ECON 201) in Spring of 2019 and received a B (87%). For me the highlight of the course was the final project where I designed a product and wrote a business plan. I not only enjoyed the project (and is part of the reason I decided to apply to graduate school!) but I received an A+.\n\n>I am attaching a current version of my CV and a copy of that final project. I plan to apply to three schools which require LORs due: 1/9/22, 1/15/22 and 1/18/22. If you are willing to write a letter I will supply your name and email and they will send you a form to fill out. I can also send you a reminder early January of the dates and schools.\n\n> Please let me know if you are able to write me a letter. Thanks again for being a great professor and I hope you have a nice break!\n\n> Best,  Outrageous.\n\n\n\n\nSo what this email does is remind the prof who you are. Reminds them of work you did. Does all the leg work (with CV and a piece of work you have done) for them. You also give the dates and what you are asking of them. And it is polite.\n\nTip: Don't ask anyone you got less than a B grade in. Don't ask anyone outside of the field you are applying (there letter will be irrelevant). And don't ask anyone in a course you cheated in. Because I can't believe students do that.\n\nIn the event that no one responds and you get no letters you can also take a course as a post bac in the field you want, tell the prof your intention is to prepare further for grad school, ace it, and ask them for your letter.",

I asked tutors I barely knew because I also decided to go to postgrad way after undergrad, so I didn\u2019t bother making strong relationships etc. Make sure you send them an updated CV so they can see the relevant things you\u2019ve done (eg your current job) and highlight to them any particular grades etc you think would strengthen your application",

      "text": "I don\u2019t really have advice on letters of rec from professors, but I would reach out asap. You could also ask any of your supervisors from applicable work experience. I recently went to a grad program in school counseling, and I got only letters from my bosses at the schools I have worked at as a teacher. I also had a much lower gpa, so I took  the GRE and used that to supplement my application. Not sure how your prospective program works, however I think that most of the weight of my admittance was based on my personal interview with the department head - they didn\u2019t really care about my bad gpa and I currently have a good gpa in my masters classes.",
