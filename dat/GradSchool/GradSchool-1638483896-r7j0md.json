  "text": "So I ask this question because I am studying a Masters of music performance, with a specialization in opera. I was given a scholarship to attend grad school for free, and was also given an $8,000 and $2,000 scholarship on top of that as well, so I do not have to worry about work while I am in school. ( I live in Western Canada just in case anyone thought that it wasn\u2019t enough money \ud83d\ude05)   \n\n\nI am getting to a point where I am realizing that my future job prospects are pretty limited with a Bachelor's of music and a Masters of music. I am just about to finish up my first semester of four semesters, but I am seriously considering dropping out of the program and switching into a new program/attending a new university as well. I love music, and I love to perform, but I just can\u2019t feasibly see a way how I can support myself financially without my mom having to help me. I\u2019m fine for finances right now, but I know that I won\u2019t be in school forever, and I know that a musician salary is pretty touch and go, and can also be unreliable as well.Musician jobs are mostly granted through audition as well, and there's no guarantee of employment. (I do understand that most jobs don't guarantee you employment, but it's generally not as cutthroat as music). I thought about doing a Masters in communication and journalism studies, to enter that field of work and work as a PR rep, A publicist, a writer, or a communication specialist for a company. I know that it\u2019s probably not the most easy field to find a job in, but it definitely has to be easier than being an opera singer.  \n\n\nI tried to talk to some of my teachers about potentially switching programs, but I feel like they want me to stay in the program, so I don\u2019t know if asking for their opinion is even useful or helpful? Is anyone else in a similar situation, is anyone else thinking of doing a career switch to a different masters degree? I would love any thoughts or suggestions, or stories",

      "text": "I think even with a masters in communication, it would still be hard in the employment aspect. I\u2019ve heard plenty of people getting jobs outside their degree. I guess the real question is will your masters in communication be covered as well? If it is, I see no issue with switching. But if you have to take out loans to pursue a masters in that route I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be worth it\u2026 :/ even if you graduate with a masters in music, I\u2019m guessing you could transfer skills you have now to other jobs like research and writing.",

      "text": "I work in communication.. It's a career that is highly experience based. I have colleagues who have degrees and experience in journalism (like myself), some have MAs in other fields like history or literature, some come from IT backgrounds, political science, economics, teaching ... You get my point.\nA music degree could work. \nBut what you do need to get, is work experience. I'd say complete your degree, but also try to get some comm gigs. Freelance or volunteer for music festivals, write for music publications, etc.\nIn communication you work in some kind of industry, unless you work for an agency,where you touch upon several different industries. But having a background from the music industry as well as doing comm work would be incredibly benifitial if you want to work in the culture scene. You would probably even be able to use your opera /music expertise and skills in combination with the comm work. \n\n\nI wouldn't recommend studying communication in order to get into communication. Work experience is a much better way to spend your time and effort. What you need is to be a fast learner, and it helps to be  good with people, effective, and a half decent writer.",
