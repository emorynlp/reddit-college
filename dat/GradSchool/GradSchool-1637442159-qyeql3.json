  "text": "I am applying for an American graduate school program as an international student.\n\nThe university accepts application fee payment only via credit card (through quickpay).\n\n I am facing some issue with my credit card right now for international payments as the payment is declined each time.\n\nHowever, my international payments work fine for the same credit card though PayPal. \n\nWhile i fix my credit card issue with my bank, is it possible in some way for the university to accept payments via PayPal etc. if I send them an email to the graduate school requesting that?",
