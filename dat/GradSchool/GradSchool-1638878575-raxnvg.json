  "title:": "Hate applying for grants/scholarships",
  "text": "I have a stipend for my MSc (marine biology/aquaculture) and I\u2019m working on projects that are already funded. I am applying for grants/scholarships on top of this and I hate doing it. It feels like begging and I would rather just work for a salary. I also am not really interested in doing volunteer work, which a lot of them take into consideration. If I have to spend what little extra time I have working, I would prefer to be earning a salary as my stipend barely covers anything beyond tuition and rent. I am more interested in a career doing research with the government or industry rather than academia when I finish. With government or industry jobs do you have to get your own funding through grant applications or do they provide the funding for their projects?",
