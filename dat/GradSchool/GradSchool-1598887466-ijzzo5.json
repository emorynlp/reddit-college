I'm a little ashamed because most or all of my classmates havw gotten jobs at least using the degree we completed.\n\nI've been watching *Shrink* on the NBC app, and the protagonist graduated from med school, didn't get a residency, and resorted to doing free therapy in his garage to get licensed, while working at a grocery store at night. \n\nIt's funny to see those struggles depicted on television, and to identify eith them to an extent. I wondered what you guys were up to, and how you were feeling.",

I now have a full time job as an analytical chemist doing LC/MS, but my field of study is biology, neuroscience, and biotechnology. Ultimately it will make you a well rounded person and someone employers will be asking YOU to apply, good luck!",

I haven't had to get a \"just to get by\" job, and I'm grateful, but I can't have my pup with me right now and I don't really have a workspace anymore. That's hard.\n\nThe worst part of job hunting is the continued uncertainty about what my future will look like, where I'll live, what my financial status will be - all of these things are low-grade, near-constant stressors. I'm trying not to let it weigh on me, to take the time as a blessing, to work on projects and learning I've put off due to school, to reframe it all. Some days I do better than others.\n\nI hope you're doing okay as well. I've worked minimum wage jobs to get by in the past too, so remember: you're still the same amazing person you were when you were in school. Don't let the inhumane grind of hourly shift work degrade your sense of worth.",

      "text": "I started my current job 9 months after finishing my PhD. I definitely made it harder on myself because I moved back to my home state after graduating and only applied to jobs within about 50 miles of my partner\u2019s job. I started applying before graduating but didn\u2019t get my first real interview until I finished and moved. By the time I moved I only had a temporary position lined up. \n\nSo I spent the first 3 months in that temporary position doing tedious work for which I was way overqualified because I was hoping, and was led to believe, that it would at least lead to a post doc position afterwards. It didn\u2019t, and I spent the next 6 months unemployed. During that time I confirmed once and for all that I was done with academic and academic-adjacent research.\n\nI had moments of embarrassment and frustration, and occasional feelings of guilt for giving up on academia altogether and \u201cwasting\u201d my research achievements (publications and fellowships, including the NSF GRF). But honestly I didn\u2019t feel too bad about being unemployed for the most part. Though I also had other personal issues going on at the time, so it\u2019s possible my concerns about my unemployment were eclipsed by my preoccupation with the other issues. \n\nBut overall I did give myself leeway because job searching is so hard for everyone. I\u2019ve always thought that a big factor is luck in terms of timing and having an \u201cin\u201d somewhere, due to connections etc. I still believe that to be the case. Out of all of the jobs I pursued, the job I eventually got was not the one for which I was most qualified in terms of technical experience. Rather I was qualified and had a connection, and it just turned out that the other applicants were either clearly less qualified or were qualified but didn\u2019t have the connection I did.",

I know my PI would love a postdoc who was foremost a geneticist. Most people applying for postdocs come from a wildlife background and are great at modeling, GIS and fieldwork. To get someone who doesn't haphazardly fumble through genetics and can actual innovate would be amazing!  Ecologists are using molecular tools but have no idea the science behind it. It's messy. \n\nNot that we're currently hiring a postdoc, but wanted to put it out there to other molecular biologists that you could potentially look outside the biomedical field and you might be surprised what kind of jobs you'd find! Most positions in this field are posted on ECOLOG.",
