  "title:": "Is doing a PhD worth it right now?",
  "text": "It feels like the world is ending. The climate crisis is out of control and governments are asleep at the wheel. Governments are falling. Science is being rejected on a massive scale. It feels like the bad news is piling up at an exponential rate. I know this post sounds like a bit of an overreaction, and maybe it is. But even two years ago no one saw a global pandemic on the horizon. I don't think it is unreasonable to suspect other global catastrophes might get sprinkled into the mix in the coming years.\n\nIs starting a PhD right now given the state of the world a bad idea? Where will we all be in 4-5 years? I am in the field of environmental sciences and I want to do something that matters, but I worry locking myself into a grad program will result in me obtaining a degree that is essentially worthless when I'm done. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: thanks for the all the comments. I forgot to mention that I am currently a Master's student in this field. I like what I am doing and I could see myself making it a longer term thing. I think the comments have made it clear that I need to do some more research before I make any decisions. Thank you everyone!",

In my country, it's about 600 euros per year for full-time enrollment or 675  per term ( 2 per year) for part-time. It really isn't expensive compared to other courses and easy to justify a return from it. That is if you actually end up using it.   \n\n\nAnd something we discuss less often mental resilience. A PhD is no joke, it definitely takes a toll on your mental health and requires ridiculous resilience. Our department refers to it as 'permanent health damage' because rarely do you leave unscathed.",

      "text": "I mean, the future is largely unknowable BUT the sheer inertia of social and technological progress means nothing is going to grind to a complete halt for many years if ever. Depending on your field, you might even find an expansion of research and industries to help solve some of those evolving issues (global supply chain, resource shortages, energy storage and conversion, IT security, AI, etc.) Some things might become less relevant or more precarious to pursue as a career, but I'm incredibly doubtful there will be some cataclysmic event, complete social breakdown, or something like a genetic bottleneck.\n\nThere is simply too much energy in the flywheel that we aren't going back to a preindustrial barter society any time soon; short of a mass nuclear exchange between great powers or a gamma ray burst, climate change is something we'll learn to live with and develop technologies and social policy to help cope. Getting an advanced degree makes it more likely you're in the room helping with the cope rather than being on the receiving end, depending on what you're studying. In getting a PhD you're also, for better or worse, joining a relatively selective and elite group which makes emigration easier and broadens the potentials of what you can do. There will be pushback, its going to get worse a bit every day, but its important to remember that historically the last century was kind of an outlier. Most of human existence has been famine, war, suffering and riding that hedonic treadmill for moments of the good times. But dispite all that, it didn't stop humans from making art, music, machines, and building a rich tapestry of experience and valuable contributions which keep that fucking treadmill going.\n\nBe like Sisyphus and push that damn rock anyway, because the joy of existence is found in doing things you like and shared experience with others. Even if our standards of living are undeniably going to get worse on the average, that doesn't mean you should give up and stop pursuing things that are meaningful to you. In pursuing them, you'll find meaning and purpose.",

      "text": "From a practical perspective: the degree won't be worthless if you get what you want out of it. If you're worried that anything happening in the next few years will prevent you from getting what you want out of it, that's a valid concern to take into account. But your education or skills won't be worthless either way. Even if the specific roles you're looking for aren't as prevalent in the future, you will have skills that are.\n\nFrom a more personal/existential perspective: a lot of grad students I know (myself included) have been grappling with the idea that our work isn't using our skills where they're needed right now. While many of us are doing academic research that's pretty removed from application, we theoretically could be doing activism, or participating in policy, or physically contributing to a cause with urgent need (like in the medical field right now). If that sounds like you, it's important to consider whether you want to be doing a PhD \\*right now\\* vs. later on (you can always go back later if you decide to). Also, though, there's only so much we can do. If doing a PhD is what you want/need right now for yourself, it's ok to do that even if there's other places with more urgent need. The way I dispel that worry for myself is by doing science communication, since to me that seems like a place where a need must be met right now to restore confidence in and understanding of science.",

      "text": "here are the criteria that you should base your decision on:\n\n1. are you in your early 20's fresh out of college? if yes, you have time to spare and you might even benefit from waiting a few years. I wish I worked a job somewhere for a few years before starting. If no, maybe you feel pressured to start soon and that is valid. you might want to prioritize starting now if you're 29 or something. Doing a PhD around the same time that you'll be having kids and buying a house and dealing with your aging parents or any number of difficulties that arise in 30's might be too much.\n2. can you get a job that pays > 60k-100k a year in your field right now? If yes, maybe just do that for 2 years and get financially stable. A PhD is not going to pay you enough, even if you're in a lucrative field like CS. However, if no, then what's the point in working a job that isn't exactly what you want to do (assuming you want to get a PhD) just to make only slightly more than a PhD student does? \n3. I guess the final note is you'll probably be doing less traveling now than in a non-pandemic state so if you want to hedge your bets and wait and see if the pandemic is \"over\" soon, then you might be able to optimize for more travel. I started right before the pandemic and have never been to a single conference via a publication from grad school in person.",

      "text": "I'm doing a PhD because it helps me get the kind of job in research that I want to do. I'm not going to *not* do it because I might not get a job if society collapses or something. Not that I actually think that's going to happen, but even if it does, I know people who got their degrees in other countries whose governments collapsed who are still in the field or worked until retirement just like everybody else. Like what's the other option, letting bad stuff happen? Not doing anything I want to do because bad stuff happens?\n\nThere are reasons grad school may not be worth it. It may not be worth the time and money/lower pay if you don't need the degree for what you want to do. You shouldn't do it for prestige or because your family is pressuring you into it. Delaying until you can be in person is totally reasonable too because doing it online can be very isolating and difficult. But I don't think what you're talking about is a good reason to stop yourself from going. \n\n>But even two years ago no one saw a global pandemic on the horizon\n\nOk I mean yeah the general public totally underestimated infectious disease before covid, but there *were* plenty of people predicting that another pandemic would come around and fuck shit up because they knew we weren't ready for it. FEMA reported in 2019 that a pandemic would overwhelm hospitals and would test the US's pandemic response capabilities. I went to a talk by an epidemiologist at my school months before covid about why some diseases go global and she talked about SARS, Zika, swine flu, and Ebola. She didn't say, \"a new coronavirus is gonna fuck up our whole shit later this very year,\" but she talked about how a zoonotic disease spread by respiratory droplets that's deadly but not too deadly was her bet for a strong contender for a future pandemic. Now I'm not an epidemiologist, so I'm sure there's stuff I'm forgetting about the talk, but even though it might seem eerily prophetic, she was really just looking at those other cases and thinking about what could've been slightly different that could've made them devastating on an even larger scale. And yeah covid had those characteristics that people knew would make a disease a big problem. I'm sure she wasn't an oddball in her field who was the only one saying this. So no, it's not like this came out of nowhere and shocked the scientific community or even governments.\n\nPlus it's not like we just whipped up the mRNA vaccines out of thin air, people have been working on them for years as a response to future pandemics. It sure is a good thing those people went to grad school!\n\nNow I'm not trying to downplay the pandemic because it is a terrible thing to happen, many things could've been done better, and even one preventable death is too many... so obviously this isn't me saying why worry about covid etc etc. But our current level of medicine and understanding about disease actually did prevent it from being much worse, even if it wasn't perfect. \n\nAnd in terms of climate change, yeah it's grim and I understand why you're anxious, but again, what are we supposed to do, throw up our hands, say fuck this, and just let the planet go to hell? No, it's gonna be scientists, science communicators, policy analysts, etc that are going to prevent worst case scenarios. I study the evolution of an invasive species, so believe me, I know how frustrating it is to look around and see things are already not great and that there's no avoiding it starting because it's already started. It's also shitty to know a lot of people don't care or are even actively opposed to your field of study. But even though us individuals can't stop this stuff from getting worse, we can be part of a larger community and that community is going to be what moves us forward. Sure my invasive species is already here and I can't undo that, but my research can help inform people who do control and maybe we can prevent other potentially invasive species from being established.\n\nAnd you aren't being locked into anything when you start a grad program, by the way. If you decide it's not for you or whatever other scenario happens, you are allowed to leave!\n\nSorry my comment is so long, and I hope it doesn't come off as mean or anything. I'm really not trying to shut you down, but rather encourage you and reassure you that if you want to do it, you shouldn't let that kind of stuff stand in your way. It sounds like you really care about global issues and I think that's very important for research and actually making a difference as long as you don't let it overwhelm you. These issues aren't black and white and yeah bad stuff is going to be bad, but passionate people doing the work is going to be what we need to keep it from being worse.",

I often feel similar to OP, but you\u2019re also absolutely right.\n\nSure most of us weren\u2019t imagining a pandemic prior to COVID, but epidemiologists sure as hell were.

It\u2019s because of preparations by people like that \u2014 experts and scientists \u2014 that COVID wasn\u2019t worse.

I felt those skills were lacking in me, and my country in general, even before all of this happened, and that won\u2019t change because of current events: it\u2019s something structural, it\u2019s long-term.
