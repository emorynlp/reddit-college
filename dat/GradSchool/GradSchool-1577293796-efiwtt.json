  "text": "That is basically it. \n\nOften times posts get so vague that they aren't helpful to a lurker such as myself. The difference between a Ph.D. in the Classics and a Ph.D. in EECE is substantial - especially the consequences of dropping out of a program to enter the workforce. Is there a specific reason why people are so vague?",

The \"technology\" and \"engineering\" aspects of it conjure up programs like electrical engineering or computer science/engineering whereas others will see it differently. \n\nIt also doesn't help that there are many jobs with the word \"engineer\" in it that *probably* shouldn't have that word in it but still do so it can get fairly confusing. \n\nThen there's interdisciplinary studies, not something like pharmacoeconomics, but literally just interdisciplinary studies. Those conversations are probably the most interesting. \n\n**Person A:** What are you studying? What's your program?\n\n**Person B:** I'm doing a PhD in interdisciplinary studies. \n\n**Person A:** That sounds interesting, what's the topic or research question that you're exploring?\n\n**Person B:** Everything.\n\n**Person A:** *internal screaming*",
