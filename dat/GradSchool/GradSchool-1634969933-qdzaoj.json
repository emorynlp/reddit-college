      "text": "Whether or not you make a lot of money depends less on the degree and more about how you as an individual leverage that degree. \n\nYou need a career plan *before* you enter grad school. Not \"I want to make a lot of money\" but a plan for exactly how you'll use the degree. Most degrees are broad (even master's which are more specific than bachelor's degrees), so you want more focus than *just* the degree. Research high paying jobs and find the ones you think would be the best fit (that you'd like and would have some aptitude for) and find out what it would take to get a one of those jobs. After you've done that is when you should start deciding what master's degree to get.",
