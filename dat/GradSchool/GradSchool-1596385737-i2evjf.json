She just wanted them to get that sense of confidence and feel good, so then they could feel proud and be interested in their work. I think that's a pretty positive way of looking at it!",

              "text": "My first one took *FOREVER* and the first draft, though I thought it was well written, was garbage. The Post Doc (who was the second author) did some edits after me and it beautifully *sang* the work. He did that in a couple of days... I was gobsmacked.    \n     \nSince then I have gotten way **way** better and the process (especially rejection/revisions) has even gotten better. This is the suffering you have to go through to get to the other side, you'll get there dude! I play guitar and when you start you sound bad and write TERRIBLE cringey music when you look back at it later. Writing manuscripts is the same. You'll be better and the process will be easier than it is now, but you have to suffer through this to get there unfortunately.  \n   \nAlso, some good advice someone once gave me, for improving how you write as an academic is to find 4 papers that you really like. The way it's written, their word choice, the way the figures are done, etc. Just something you look at and say: \"I wish I could write like that\". If it's in your field that's better. Then copy it word-for-word onto a new word doc. Not copy and paste, but read each sentence and write it down. Re-plot each graph (use made up data if you have to, the data is not important here) and do each figure to learn how they did what they did. You do this for 4 papers and you won't help but pick up some stylistic cues and tendencies from authors you admire. Again, like playing guitar, you learn other's music and learn *how* they made those sounds and it can't help but influence how you sound.   \n  \nHope that helps and hang in there Cat (love your username btw :P )",
