  "text": "Hie guys I ama Masters student in circuit design. I have taken an honors undergrad level course for this term for which I had my midterm this week.\n\n\nI have test anxiety and in a cramped environment my brain as usual went blank and I did miserably. Though I am above average I am not really happy with the score and it can detrimentally affect my end grade. My homework marks fortunately are good so i am even more scared of the judgement I am going to get.\n\nI want some help from you guys \n1. How to make sure I reduce silly mistakes while doing numericals?\n2. What should I do about this low midterm marks? Should I talk to my professor about my ailment? How should i convince him to give me a chance?\n3. How should I increase my efficiency of studying and exam prep?",
