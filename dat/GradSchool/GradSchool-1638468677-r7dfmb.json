  "title:": "For anyone looking at Post-Docs, what do people think about the NASA NPP?",
  "text": "The NASA NPP:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's scientific goals.\u00a0 The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific connections.  \n>  \n>Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions in *earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space operations, and astrobiology*.  \n>  \n>Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree requirements. Please see current [eligibility](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/npp.usra.edu/apply/eligibility/__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!L1KVHqsLqZDJ_51wcdZ-5m-fm89WCh14FoZVw3_ZiRANxHsa8Qq_eRqpFyY4oLy9$) requirements.  \n>  \n>Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.  \n>  \n>Applications are accepted three times each year: **March 1**, July 1, and November 1.  \n>  \n>To learn more about specific opportunities and to apply, visit [https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/npp.usra.edu/opportunities/__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!L1KVHqsLqZDJ_51wcdZ-5m-fm89WCh14FoZVw3_ZiRANxHsa8Qq_eRqpF9VcMGJ5$)  \n>  \n>For further information and to apply, visit:  [https://npp.usra.edu/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/npp.usra.edu/__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!L1KVHqsLqZDJ_51wcdZ-5m-fm89WCh14FoZVw3_ZiRANxHsa8Qq_eRqpFw0MxltH$)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes $60k *without any benefits* actually sound like a good deal to anyone? I've seen the high COL area and \"certain specialties\" stipend and it doesn't look like it goes past $95k. Y'all, I don't know about you, but I'm about to graduate in my 30's and a \\~$60k stipend sounds like a shitty deal. Weren't we told in elementary school *in the 1990's* that with a PhD you should be making more than $100k+? Why does anyone still apply to this? **You're all worth so much more than this.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 1: wanted to note that the application requires a fully fleshed-out 15 page project proposal",

      "text": "It's super competitive and most people write their proposals with their prospective advisor - and even then, I know several people who didn't get it (and it says there health insurance is provided with financial assistance if requested). \n\nI know a couple former NPPs and a few non-NPP NASA early career employees, and in general it's a pretty good gig. The proposal can be used to submit to ROSES grant solicitations later and there are opportunities within NASA that non-employees can't access. It's always a trade-off.",

      "text": "The NPP program is really competitive and the pay does scale a bit with cost of living. I know someone with an NPP making around $70k. And it's only for 2-3 years, so it's not going to be your permanent post-PhD salary. \n\nLike the other poster said, it is normal for your proposal to be a collaborative effort between you and your prospective advisor. And the proposal is usually strong enough that you can easily expand the idea to several additional proposals that people will be thrilled to collaborate with.",

The industry job isn\u2019t going to pay you $60k to research whatever you want. They\u2019re paying you to make them money. Also benefits are provided by the host university.",
