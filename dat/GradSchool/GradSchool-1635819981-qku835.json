  "text": "I'll be applying for social science MA programs soon, and I found a few MA programs at prestigious universities with 1 year MA programs. Some of these programs are directly in my field of interest and still requires a Masters thesis. On the other hand, there are some that don't require a thesis; should I prioritize programs with a thesis? I have a strong background in research, so I would enjoy a Masters thesis program (although not doing it at all would be nice). \n\nAre 1 year degrees less desirable to employers? Most people in this field have a Masters or Doctorates,  so I'm assuming that what/where I get my degree matters more than anything. Are 1 year programs viewed as less legitimate or prestigious?",

Also, if you enjoy research I suggest you apply to a PhD and then leave once you get your MA. This way you\u2019ll be better set with funding",

      "text": "Okay so! \nI\u2019m doing a one year MA in medical anthropology and here\u2019s how it works for me (in Ontario) \n\nOne year programs are usually course based (6 courses for me over the fall and winter) with an MRP (major research paper - slightly shorter thesis without a defence) due at the end of the summer and two year programs are usually thesis based where the first year is spent taking courses (4 for the two year version of my program) and the second year is just research and thesis writing. \n\nGenerally, phd programs (in Ontario - based on my PhD applications so far) want to see either a thesis based masters, or an MRP based masters depending on the research intensity. Most MRPs will be lit reviews simply because students don\u2019t usually have the time to apply for grants or ethics approval to run studies. If you end up with a basic MRP like that, phd programs typically like to see evidence of intense research experience from elsewhere in your background. So, if you have a strong background in research, you do not need a thesis masters program to get a PhD. \n\nI\u2019m currently in a one year MA, straight out of undergrad, and I\u2019m already looking at phd programs for next year. Do I have intensive research experience? No. Did I do an undergraduate thesis? No. But I know how the process works. I spend most of my undergrad working for one of my university\u2019s journals and was editor in chief in my last year, and worked for a department head in knowledge mobilization of her research and organized her conference presentations. So though I hadn\u2019t experienced doing research firsthand I did know some of the ins and outs of how it worked. I took way too many seminars (rip my brain) in my final year and because of all of that independent work I was set up really nicely for grad courses. \n\nI\u2019m doing an MRP, but I started working on my research project before I was holding my undergrad diploma, my supervisor hired me as an RA and had the whole partnership with our community organization already sorted out and they already had a brief outline of the project and basically just needed a student PI to run the thing so when I got there it was all ready to go. I was able to apply for a grant and file ethics applications a whole four months before I started my MA. Because of this, I\u2019m doing a doctoral level project (according to my grant application reviewers) so my MRP, should be thesis length but still, no defence which I love. And I\u2019m doing it at the same time as a 150% course load. Do I have any free time? No. Do I wish I chose the two year program sometimes? Yes. Do I love my research and busy life. Yes (for now lol). I know it\u2019s not a rush and advocate for taking your time but is it cool to know I\u2019ll have a full on masters degree behind me at 22? Hell yes. (This program also turns into a PhD if I do well enough and I would go right into year 2) so is it also kinda cool that I might have a PhD at 25? Yeah kinda! \n\nSo tldr, phd programs don\u2019t care if you did and MRP or a thesis as long as you have the experience\u2026..employers on the other hand\u2026.if your employer is outside of academia, depending on the profession, some may advise against getting a PhD at all and DEFINITELY don\u2019t care if you did an MRP or a thesis. This is true for most professional industries. If your work is going to be in research then a PhD is great, but if you\u2019re going to work for the government writing policy for example, a PhD might even be a an obstacle in getting employed. For many fields there is such a thing as being overqualified. \nYou don\u2019t have to plan on a PhD right now though. Pick a subject you enjoy - if most programs you see have research attached like an MA in Anthro, or psych or sociology etc then do that. If you\u2019re thinking about a profession like public health or social work, those are mostly professional programs anyway that are course based and MIGHT have a research component. \nAlso don\u2019t do a one year MA because you want to rush through education - never rush through your 20s lol. Do it because you either know what you want to do and get into industry asap, if you\u2019ll be fully funded and enjoy the topic but don\u2019t know what you want to do yet, or because you don\u2019t want to do research. \n\nOne year course based programs with research (like my program) are usually not recommended because doing that many courses plus research plus working (usually as a TA) is just way too much. The only reason I\u2019m able to keep my sanity (so far) is because I don\u2019t have to work outside of my research, I don\u2019t need a TAship because I\u2019m fully funded by my grant, and I was an undergrad TA so I don\u2019t need that experience. I think I\u2019m one of two people in my department doing the one year as opposed to the two year program because they genuinely don\u2019t let you do it unless you have experience or proof that lets the department heads know you won\u2019t have a meltdown (I\u2019m not joking). I genuinely lucked out that my dream project was basically waiting for me and my grant was approved. I feel like my brain is at the gym every day I genuinely don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve been able to hold it together for the past two months. By the time I\u2019m done I probably won\u2019t remember anything because it\u2019s just moving so fast lol. \n\nI\u2019m SO sorry for the long rant lol I hope this helped at least a little! Feel free to msg me!",

Thanks for giving me some perspective, I have a lot to consider!",
