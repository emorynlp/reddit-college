  "title:": "Got feedback from my advisor that I basically need to work harder in all respects. I tried to work a little less and focus more my mental health this semester but this just shattered my confidence. How do you all manage ? What should I do?",
  "text": "I feel like I am below average or something. I worked hard my first year and did pretty well according to my grad coordinator who was my prelim advisor. Then fall 2020 I tried but wasn't able to so just took it a bit easy. I thought I'll make up in Spring 2021 but had some health issues and personal issues come up. In the summer I decided to focus and passed my written quals/comps. This semester I have been trying to find the balance between pushing myself  and taking care of my mental health. And while I haven't done as much as I planned to, I thought I did okay. \n\nMy advisor gave me feedback that I need to seriously buck up and work harder in basically all aspects. I mean, I know I have functioned at like 80 percent but there has been sooooo much to do all of a sudden with everything being in person. I had been getting the feeling that he was trying to push me forwarded which is why I asked him for feedback. He listed out the things he expects me to do and it just made me feel dumb and mot capable.\n\nI have been trying to go to yoga couple times a week and meet friends couple times a week this semester. I also have been cooking and cleaning once a week on the weekends. In the evenings, I switch off and watch comedy to unwind. These things have helped my mental health. \n\nI know I can work a few hours more in the week - 2 to 3 but I don't see how to work more than that. And what he expects of me would definitely require atleast 6 more hours per week if not 8. \n\nHow should I deal with this?",

      "text": "Working harder doesn't necessarily mean working longer.\n\nYou should try to do things more efficiently before you even consider working longer days. Working more hours can easily have a negative effect on efficiency so that you end up actually getting less done.\n\nI don't know anything about what you do, but you should ask yourself if you're doing to much exploratory analysis or spending too much time trying to get a comprehensive understanding when you read papers, etc. There's almost always a shift post-quals to much more focused work compared to the breadth that was emphasized during quals.\n\nSince your advisor has given you a specific list, that sounds like a great place to start. Look over the list and try to plan out the minimum amount of work you would need to do to accomplish those things. From there, begin making your own similar lists and thinking about them in the same way. Always look for things that you can pare out of your workflow when you see that they're not helping you cross things off your list.",

It's not easy since there's very few hard deadlines by default. There's lots of ways to create deadlines, though. Giving talks, publishing in special topic issues of journals, developing collaborations, and so on.",

I ended up taking an extra year to graduate beyond my initial timeline, but I was happy with the work I was able to do and in the end, I found a balance between prioritizing my mental health and the projects my PI needed done. \n\nAdditionally, look in to accommodations through your school\u2019s SSD department.

We\u2019ve been chatting in detail since, week by week what I should accomplish and although it\u2019s too soon to judge for sure, I definitely feel more productive because my PI actually knows what I work on now. \n\nI understand not all PIs are the same but I highly encourage you to talk to yours.
