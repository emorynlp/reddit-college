  "title:": "Feeling like my supervisor has something against me",
  "text": "I\u2019m on a clinical therapy internship working towards my doctorate in psychology and every supervision is constant criticism for my writing, I\u2019ve never received any positive feedback despite maintaining all of my patients the past 6 months. I have never not gotten my work done, I have taken all feedback that the supervisor has given me and changed my ways to implement that feedback. I\u2019ve never said I couldn\u2019t do something. But in every supervision I can\u2019t get a word in edgewise to voice anything I need to talk about or have concerns about. Most recently the supervisor emailed me about something and said \u201clet me know if this is something you can handle\u201d and that was just really offensive to me because I\u2019ve never shown that I can\u2019t handle something and they gave me the original feedback on a Friday and then this email on Saturday so I haven\u2019t even had a chance to make changes to the report. I\u2019ve emailed my practicum professor and am planning on meeting with them on Monday. I just don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 any advice on navigating this would be greatly appreciated!",

In that case, it is better for them to ask than to simply assume. And since you know you can handle it, then it obviously doesn't apply to you.",

My guess is he is just trying to be efficient and thinks you are great. And you are great! Hang in there! You can do this!",
