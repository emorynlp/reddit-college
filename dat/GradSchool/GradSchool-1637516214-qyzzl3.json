  "title:": "Life Science PhD peeps: is it a liability to exhaustively list every experience on your resume?",
  "text": "For context, the majority of my experiences (4/6) were summer internships and/or didn\u2019t result in coauthorship. At this point in my life, I have devoted so much time to research that I\u2019ve cumulatively spent more time in labs than as a college student (41mo against 39mo). While that\u2019s cool, I also feel like the \u201cratio\u201d of publications to time invested is less than ideal. I\u2019m torn about whether listing all experiences is a good idea or whether it would be read similar to \u201cjob hopping\u201d in the adult world (where people can\u2019t hold a job for long periods and jump around a lot).\n\nThanks for the advice!",
