  "text": "Basically the title, I've sent this person 4-5 emails (copy pasting so I don't think the wording should have varied between emails) over the past 2 weeks asking to meet her so I can ask some questions about course registration. Attempts to go to office hours/ask other people have led to all of them kicking me downstream to this advisor and not answering the questions. \n\nCourse registration is happening at the crack of dawn on Monday so I'm probably just going to ask my classmates for advice later this afternoon. Normally if an email was ignored once I'd chalk it up to stuff  being buried but 4 times???",

It's weird she ignored your emails. \n\nMy experience is that the first week or so tends to be somewhat in flux, so after you talk to classmates and do some of your own research, register for classes as best you can. Then if you have to drop one and enroll in another, it should be relatively smooth. I've had to do that a few times during my studies for one reason or another.",

Hopefully it won't come to that.",

Probably a good idea to register for classes that peers in a similar path are enrolling to on Monday just in case the classes fill up early.  I wonder if you could get a new academic advisor or maybe emailing them your updated course list could prompt a meeting with them?",
