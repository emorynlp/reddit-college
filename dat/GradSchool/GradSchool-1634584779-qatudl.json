  "title:": "Wondering about letters of recommendation for grad school",
  "text": "I'm currently applying to Louisiana State University grad school for an MS in Oceanography and Coastal science.   \nThe grad school application requires 3 letters of recommendation. I have 2 professors in mind, but can't think of another for the 3rd. Is it okay if I ask a former employer in an unrelated field for the third letter of recommendation? Or do I need to wrangle up another PhD to write me one? Thanks.",

      "text": "Mine was two prof and an internship colleague (not my supervisor, but the person I worked closest with day to day and could give a genuine reference). A PhD is not a requisite to write a LOR.\n\nNot sure on an employer from another field. You could also look at TAs you had or post docs though.",

              "text": "Glad to help. Also while do your best to pick people who will write good letters and also submit on time, do not stress over it too much.\n\nAt least one of mine was late, another (or maybe the same as the late one) was just a terrible letter: generic, had nothing to do with me in the text (I aced like 3 classes with him); short and nonsensical at points; forgot to fill out the 'ranking' form (e.g. 'x' is in the y% of students I have taught in regards to Z1,...,Zn); forgot to change the school I was applying for to the correct school.\n\nStill got in no problem. As long as the rest of your resume is strong and at least a couple of the letters are genuine, profs are understanding when deciding to accept or not and know certain things the student cannot control.",
