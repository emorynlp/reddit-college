When you are in a bad place, it can be hard to see the silver lining. But that doesn't mean that the person is somehow too entitled or too ungrateful. It simply means that they are dealing with things need encouragement and help. \n\nNow are other people also dealing with things? Yes. But each person faces their own challenges and they deserve sympathy and understanding when they voice them, especially for something that is a known issue within the community. \n\nThis isn't a phallus measuring contest of who is the most miserable or downtrodden. It's not a zero-sum game of how we allocate our sympathies. You can both empathize with the those who are suffering economically and physically in this pandemic and also recognize that others who are working still face the same challenges they have always faced. It's not one or the other. Implying that the latter should buck up and put on some macho pretense of everything-is-just-fine and be grateful because they \"obviously\" aren't suffering as much as the former is just plain BS. \n\nTo blame the whole \"anti-intellectual culture\" on a student who acknowledges their mental health challenges is cruel, unjust, absurd, and frankly uncalled for. Why don't you also blame the student for climate change while you are at it? I'm sure his minuscule contributions to humanity's carbon footprint is clearly responsible for what's happening too.",

The working and lower class (especially people of color) are the people who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Its not all lives are affected. Quit victimizing yourself while people are dealing with issues that are far more than the average grad student will ever deal with.\n\nStart showing empathy for the working class and accepting how privileged you are to be in grad school.

And neither are mental health issues faced by students (a long standing issue) something directly comparable to the current macroeconomic issues facing society. To directly conflate the comparison with BLM vs. ALM is just disingenuous and frankly offensive. By your logic, we should also stop worrying about the multitude of issues like climate change, the gender gender pay gap, and even systemic racism because...COVID-19! That's not how life works. \n\nNow that you are done accusing me indirectly of being a racist, like I said, it's not a phallus measuring contest. Not being a dick to grad students who feel burned out does not preclude you from also feeling sympathetic to those who are hard hit by the pandemic financially or physically. And this is not about \"victimizing\" oneself. It's about recognizing that one is not an unfeeling robot and reaching out to those who are feeling the same (you have managed to remember that this is a grad school subreddit right)? \n\nTo be honest, I find that compassion and sympathy is not something that you selectively bestow on those you find \"worthy\" but rather something intrinsic that you show to all. It's more a reflection of who you are rather than what you do. \n\nIn the end, I don't dispute that \"ivory tower syndrome\" is a contributing factor to anti-intellectualism. It's something that all scientists should be aware of and work to avoid. But at the same time, I object to using a populist perspective of \"intellectuals\" as a baseline for how we in the community should treat our own colleagues.",

FWIW I worked multiple minimum wage jobs in high school and college to get out with as little debt as possible. For years I've worked to be good with money and save as much as I can, I live with a roommate and keep a reasonable budget. No I don't have a family to care for, but I'm 25 and don't intend on having children anyways. By no means do I take still getting my stipend and being able to keep my job for granted. I won't deny the privileges I have or that I'm sitting in a better situation than many. Why do you think I chose to rant on here instead of to a more general group? \n\nYet none of this changes that half my extended family is not taking the pandemic seriously while a lot of them are immunocompromised or have a condition that makes them more susceptible. I have family and others I'm close to that have contracted COVID or have otherwise been affected by it. There are evidence based safety precautions not being implemented for political reasons, and of course I'm concerned about the consequences (including but not limited to economic, death, and less wellbeing) that will come from this. I don't feel like what I'm doing in school at the moment is a net benefit to society. But if all you still take from what I've said is that I'm complaining about having a job, you're purposefully misinterpreting what I'm saying.",

I\u2019m also just a first year masters student not in STEM, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. . .\n\nOne of my favorite types of stories to read are fantasy, and while a lot of \u201cliterature people\u201d may find it low brow, I think it has a lot to teach us about the human condition. My favorite fantasy series is *The Wheel of Time*. If you\u2019re familiar with fantasy, you\u2019ve probably read it or at least heard of it. It\u2019s considered one of the foundational works of the genre among *Lord of the Rings*, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, etc.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a fourteen long epic about the battle between the reborn soul of The Dragon - a powerful male channeler - and the Dark One. Pretty stereotypical battle of good vs. evil, at least on the surface. Now The Dragon (I\u2019m avoiding names to avoid spoilers) pretty much went insane and destroyed the world as they knew it after barely imprisoning the Dark One the first time. While the \u2018new\u2019 Dragon has no memory of doing this, it\u2019s been passed down through the world\u2019s mythology for thousands of years. This time around, when the battle with the Dark One comes again, he is determined to leave the world in a better state. He doesn\u2019t want to save the world just to destroy again. He wants a legacy. So, one of the things he does is establish. . . schools. You see, knowledge has been on a slow decline for millennia. Everybody hoards it, nobody shares it. He tours them every once in a while to see what the students invent. One of the most worthless inventions he sees is a wagon powered by steam. Pretty dumb in his mind when there are plenty of good horses around. . .\n\nSo during this climactic battle of good vs. evil where the world hangs in the balance, The Dragon is worried about small advances in science and philosophy and other subjects to leave the world a better place when he (hopefully) wins this battle and is gone.\n\nI guess the point I\u2019m getting at is right now the world is in a battle of good vs. evil. Maybe not quite as dire or climactic, but important all the same. And just because you feel like your work is unimportant (like a steam powered wagon, pft), who knows what kind of impact it can make on the world?",

              "text": "Definitely, a complete thesis is the best kind of thesis! And hey, I don't personally know a single person who actually likes their thesis when they sit down to write it. Anyways though, the advice I can think of are (1) to help you feel more productive and (2) honestly maybe dive into that social justice and covid stuff a bit more, like in a way to see how your talents could contribute?\n\nSo, for point 1 re:productivity\n\n\u2022Start literally putting together your thesis. Could be as simple as pulling up your institution/program guidelines to start formatting, skim through some other dissertations to get a feel for style and formatting choices that you like, start creating the table of contents, whatever! Or, if you've already published something, start reformatting that to fit withing the dissertation- these things genuinely take more time than you would think, and if you have to do them at some point anyways, why not now? And hey, then you'll have a \"dissertation_version1.docx\" which made me feel better anyways.\n\n\u2022For whatever experiments or analyses you've done most recently, put together some nice mock figures. For me, that can both help me feel better about the work I've done (seeing it in Figure form always feels more complete?), and I find those mock figures actually really helpful when putting together the paper.\n\nNow, for 2:\n\n\u2022Have you considered science policy fellowships like AAAS? There are opportunities for recent phd grads to apply their knowledge of experimental design, logical reasoning, and investigative skills, but to help shape policy decisions at federal, state, and local levels.\n\n\u2022Get involved with career exploration opportunity stuff at your institution. It might help you feel more motivated and optimistic to see other ways you can use your phd? I feel like so often we talk about career options in the binary of academia or industry, but there are actually a ton of other options - from jobs at funding agencies like the NIH (*and you might especially be interested in looking into their teams that support DEI initiatives?), to careers implementing training programs, to directly working with policy makers, to teaching and/or pedagogy work, to academic leadership, to so so much more. Sometimes my university does career related seminar or lunch series, I've participated in a career and mentorship-based journal club, most universities have some kind of career center, etc.\n\nTruly sending you my best wishes",

My research has nothing to do with COVID as well. It doesn't help that I've realized over the past couple years that I do not want to stay in academia, have the disdain towards benchwork that you mentioned, and that this is all just a stepping stone for me to get a decent job after grad school. I'm just so over being in my late 20's and doing troubleshooting, working on slow-ass projects, and not feeling fulfilled. I want a faster-paced work environment, interactions with and to serve people in my community, to teach more, work with kids, etc., and have just realized that my career will not and should not include any more pipettes, lab coats, and reagents.\n\nRecently, as a WOC, I've been instigated to think a lot more about race, my race, and my place in society as well. The things I could explain to my family. The things I am very privileged to have. The things I can do for other POC. \n\nWe have to just keep chugging along and get things done. We made it this far, we will one day be done with this chapter of our lives! Take it day by day and make sure to take care of your health first and foremost! Without that, you have nothing.

I'm not even in my late 20s yet but a lot of my friends are either recently out of or finishing up with grad school/law school and I'm ready to have a \"real adult job\" and not be a student anymore. I've felt stuck in a rut for a couple years now and while I am making sufficient progress its just not enjoyable or what I want to do long term. I want to be able to use my degree and knowledge to benefit others, and I don't see how spending the bulk of my life doing basic research in a lab is going to accomplish that (nothing wrong with that path in general of course, but for me specifically). What's the point of spending the rest of my life doing research if too many people are still scared of vaccines, refusing to wear masks, or denying climate change?\n\n\nI have lots of friends and family that don't have strong science backgrounds, and they trust me to help clarify things or find factual information. I'd rather use that influence, trust, and knowledge I have to help bridge the gap and make science more accessible and easier to understand, and to combat disinformation. \n\nThanks, best to you as well :)",
