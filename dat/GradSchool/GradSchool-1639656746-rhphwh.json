Think of it more as a long form CV where you want to talk about how you're a good fit for where you're applying, who you want to work with in said department, and what you offer the field.\n\nedit: I should also add that by 'ind epth cv' I mean it's more personalized and shows that you've done your homework on the program and that you've done your homework in general",

Speaking from personal experience, Texas is not a bad place to attend graduate school, but you want to make sure you get into a good program with good funding so you can pay your rent and support yourself.",

      "text": "First, as everyone else is saying, any more than two sentences about being interested in living in the USA and TX specifically would be too much. Unless you are specifically going to graduate school for USA history with Texas history as a specific subfield, it's just not that relevant to your purpose.\n\nSecond, having married a local TX boy and lived here for most of the last 20 years, Texas is not a monoculture and our media lies a lot about the place. Our cities are very cosmopolitan for the USA with large Asian, South American and Central American populations as well as smaller African, European, and Middle Eastern enclaves. One thing [King of the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill) got right was that there is a Laotian enclave in the Arlington-Euless-Bedford area and they are and have been citizens for a long time. [King of the Hill](https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) is great Texas anime and remarkably accurate to the area it was set in in the time it was set. \n\n  On the other hand, once we get out of the more urban areas the ethnic and cultural diversity tends to dwindle. There are legitimately towns with less than 500 people in them such as [Old Dimebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dime_Box,_Texas) which you can pass through on the backroads from Texas A&M to the [DFW metroplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas%E2%80%93Fort_Worth_metroplex). There's a whole lot of nothing within an easy half hour drive of TAMU and you will absolutely need a car to get anywhere.\n\n  This brings me to the point about size, scale, and complete lack of quality public transportation anywhere in the state. Some of the larger cities such as Houston, Dallas, Austin, Denton, and so forth do have small underwhelming bus services and some (very small amount) light rail. Outside of the USA 100 miles (161km) is a long way, inside an hour drive can be considered a long drive. In Texas, an hour drive is a perfectly acceptable distance and we just hop in the car and go, no big deal. I regularly drive at speeds of 70-90 mph (113-145 km/h) on the highway in the metroplex and still get passed. \n\n  Each of the individual municipalities and different types of road have different types of personalities and expectations. In Houston, you drive aggressive and very fast, even for Texas. In Austin, you take it slower and more politely following the actual traffic laws. In the DFW area, many traffic laws are treated as optional aside from intersections and making room for emergency vehicles. On country roads, if some one is up your tailpipe for over half a mile pull to the shoulder and let them by with a wave, they'll wave back and take off. Tractors on the road will do the same for you. \n\n****Note, no one, but no one fucks with school zones. You do 20 mph and you will like it and be polite as fuck to everyone. Be a dumb fuck elsewhere.****\n\nLastly, it's a big place and as with any human inhabited area there are good and bad things about it. I hope this isn't a case of built up expectations from media sources like [Paris Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome) and that the reality and your expectations match well. Your mileage will vary and you may find that you love it and want to live here permanently or you could decide that it isn't for you in the long term.\n\nRegardless, good luck to you on your applications.",

              "text": "It's more that the stories that get national and international attention are not actually representative of the reality people actually live with. Local media does not always lie, but it does gloss over and obfuscate sometimes. This is a problem that has gotten worse within the last 10 years in no small part to the local media sources being bought up by national corporations. \n\n\nA lot of fuss was made a few years back about one of the local mosques and extremist infiltration. Reality check time, the locals that actually live here and worship at that mosque had been calling the FBI on those jackasses for over a year iirc. The fact that it was reported repeatedly and every attempt by the mosque was made to get the authorities involved was not brought up in the national media, but it was covered in the local media. \n\nWe have a significant Muslim population and unless someone is hitting the xenophobia buttons again, it's no big deal. The xenophobia rhetoric plays best on the rural side of the rural-urban divide. Part of the difference is the local mosque is less than 10 min from my house and the local Muslims are my neighbors. It's a lot harder to hate people you actually know.",
