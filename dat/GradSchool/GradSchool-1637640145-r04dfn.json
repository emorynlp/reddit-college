  "text": "I know this sounds dumb, but let me explain.\n\nI am an international student.\n\nI am finishing my first-ever semester in an applied mathematics Ph.D. program in the US. Courseworks were not a problem, but I got one problem: work as a TA.\n\nIt started rough, and I even made a post here about it. After some kind advice, I decided to push through and made it to the end of the semester.\n\nHowever, my thought towards the TA work did not change. I still hate it, just like I did three months ago. I am not sure if I can do this for 5 or 6 YEARS, constantly hating on it. It has severely affected my mental health and even affected my coursework at some point.\n\nBut I love my topics. I don\u2019t want to quit my dream career just because of a side job. So I came up with the following plan.\n\nStarting from year 3, when the TA work significantly increases(because coursework is done), I request to lower my workload to half(to ensure a tuition waiver) and cover the lost stipend by taking a debt(planning $1000/mo).\n\nPros:\nLess stress and I can focus on my coursework/research. I probably can expect much better pay than dropping out. (I heard mathematicians are paid good and my alumni get decent jobs, and the director of the program said you can get a job unless you are in an extremely rare situation)\n\nCons:\n30k-40k of debt by the time I get the degree. I already have 20k debt from undergrad, so 50k-60k total.  If I cannot get a job in the US and have to go back home, it\u2019s a waste of money because PhDs are not valued in my country.\n\n---\nAm I being crazy? Is it worth it? Do you guys have any idea?",

      "text": "Wow. This is a lot. I'm highly inclined to say that this is very much not worth it, at least not without considering the several possible alternatives.\n\nFirst, in most STEM programs where your stipend is inherently tied to work as a TA, there is the simultaneous possibility of being partially or fully \"bought out\" of TA duty by being hired as an RA by your supervisor. This naturally requires both a well-funded supervisor and one who is willing to hire you. If you haven't committed yet to an advisor, it should probably be a priority to find someone who would be able and willing to fund you.\n\nMajor external fellowships are also a potential avenue to waiving TA requirement for pay. You would not be eligible for any of the major federal ones as an international student, but you should be eligible for many of the industry ones depending on the exact application area of your research. They are extremely competitive, but you also sounded pretty motivated to get out of teaching...\n\nThe other reality is that not all TA assignment are equal. Seek out a different class assignment next year and reassess. The nature of the work depends on the instructor, the course format, its size, its level, and so on. I've TA'ed 3 different university courses and for years with a community organization before that, and the experience is so varied that I can't possibly come up with a single answer for \"what is it like to be a TA?\" You've now have several months of experience TAing, but only in the one class---declaring yourself willing to go significantly into debt to avoid TAing in the future seems pretty premature.\n\nETA: I just checked your previous post about TAing. If the live interactions with students are a major issue for you, you may be able to swap to a grading-focused role in the future, especially in a department like math where there are always lots of problem sets and exams to grade in the large intro-level classes.",

          "text": "Thanks. I\u2019ve seen some people in my program getting an RA position, so I will try that. Never thought about an industry fellowship, so I will check it out.\n\nAs for an assignment, it\u2019s pretty much out of my control. We are automatically assigned to 2-3 courses right before the beginning of the semester, even if it\u2019s the one I have never taken as an undergrad. The only thing I can control as far as I know is workload.\n\nEdit: I will also seek the possibility of being a grader, but in my school, a large intro class is graded automatically, so it seems like there aren\u2019t many grader jobs.",
