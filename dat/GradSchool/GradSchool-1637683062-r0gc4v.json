  "title:": "[UK] My potential PI offered me a fully-funded PhD if if choose to continue research with him after I finish my masters. I don't know if I want it.",
  "text": "I do research in hepatology for a Russell Group school in the UK as a international student from the US. I'm currently enrolled in a masters program in clinical drug development at the same school the lab is affiliated with. The prof I do research for pulled me into his office and asked me about my future plans. I said I wasn't sure yet as I had no idea what I qualify for job-wise with this degree, but was open to options. He showed me some stuff detailing an upcoming project that he would like me on-board for, essentially doing clinical research for a new drug. He said he would be happy to offer me a PhD position in his lab if I was okay staying in the UK after I graduate and would more than likely be fully-funded (I guess the project is a big deal to the science world? he made it a point that \"china hasn't even gotten to it yet so we need to go go go\" and \"if and when we get funding, it's yours if you want it\").\n\nI told my family and they were more excited than me, and assumed that yes obviously I must take it! But I don't know. Everything I see about doing a PhD just seems absolutely awful and is the worst hell you could put yourself through. I kind of want to be done with school and get a job, but my family tells me that real-life is overrated and I'll regret this forever if I don't do it, especially if it's fully funded. I have an old TA from college who I still talk to and I asked him if he recommends a PhD, where he said he strongly discourages anyone from doing it, but then again it opened so many more doors for him and he doesn't regret it.\n\nI don't know if I could be in another country away from my family for 3-8 more years (how long would it even take??). But I can't apply to a program at home because I won't officially have my final grades until October 2022, and programs begin the month prior. So I feel if I want to continue, this may be my only option.\n\nIf anyone has any insight to how PhDs work in the UK specifically please let me know, I'm lost.",

This could be a golden opportunity but that still doesn't make it YOUR golden opportunity!",

      "text": "I am facing a similar situation except I am working while doing my masters online and would need to leave my job and move to continue with the PhD. I love my advisor so I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind but my original answer was no last semester. My advisor took it ok and just told me to let her know if I changed my mind, then has proceeded to check if I have changed my mind every few months, haha. The prof needs to keep in mind a PhD stunts your earnings (in my field masters is actually more profitable than PhD not including the sunken cost calculations) so you have to really want it. Might not be the right time for you. You can always get one later. However now that I have been working more closely with my advisor, I do feel like if I pass up this opportunity I will regret it. I love my current career but I would probably regret stopping working with my advisor more than leaving my current job. Your family is right, there are always jobs. Even if my current job is the best one I will have\u2026 Anyways no right answers, see if your advisor is supportive of you taking more time to make your decision.",

      "text": "Ok so first and foremost a science PhD in the UK tends to take about 4 years. It\u2019s a personal matter for you if you think you could be away from your family that long, and I don\u2019t underestimate the personal toll that would take considering you may not have much spare time to go home on your PhD. \n\nBut I also wanted to say - as someone who did have a bad PhD experience - take the bad experiences with a pinch of salt. People are always going to be quick to tell you about a bad experience, but I also know plenty of people who loved their PhD. Your old TA sounds odd in saying he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone to do it but also that he doesn\u2019t regret it and it opened doors. I think sometimes some people with PhDs want to make out like it\u2019s the hardest and worst thing ever so that they can keep on feeling superior that they did it. \n\nMy advice is forget what you\u2019re reading and hearing about other people\u2019s experiences and reflect on you. Do you, personally, enjoy research? Do you like writing? Do you get along well in a work capacity with this supervisor? If you\u2019re not sure what you want to do in the future, would a PhD open doors that actually interest you (I imagine with a PhD like that you\u2019d be very appealing to pharma or R&D for drug development type roles?) Obviously don\u2019t only accept it because you\u2019ve been offered it. But what I\u2019m reading is not that you hate research or you\u2019re not interested in the topic - you\u2019ve even mentioned applying for a programme at home, so it sounds to me more that it\u2019s that other people have put you off. For me that\u2019s a silly reason to write off an opportunity.",
