  "text": "I submitted my thesis which was approved by my supervisor, but then my second reader rejected it, saying it was too short. I replied that previous papers had been submitted which were the same length. This person forwarded the issue to the undergraduate chair who said the same thing--my paper was too short. When I pointed out previous submissions, they said it was due to spacing differences. When I pointed out that it was the same word count but they had 20 pages of appendices, they said that I couldn't \"compare\" my paper to theirs since mine is theoretical and theirs contained research (my paper is theoretical). They said I need to add a certain amount of pages within a very small deadline. I have a meeting with the ombudsperson of my university tomorrow, but I'm not hopeful. They only intervene in 3% of cases. What else can I do? Talk to the dean? This whole department has been problematic for years with things like this.",

The chair usually isn't involved in approving or overseeing theses. It's usually the second reader and supervisor who evaluate and approve the papers (no oral defense for this program).",
