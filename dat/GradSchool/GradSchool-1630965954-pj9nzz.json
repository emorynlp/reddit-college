  "text": "As a POC enrolled at a predominantly white university, I feel very lucky to not have experienced explicit discrimination during my graduate degree. In fact, in my country, I would say that active efforts being made towards diversifying the academ-osphere. That said, I've definitely heard about others who haven't been as fortunate. \n\nIf you're a BIPOC grad student, do you have a story about grad school relating to your race/ethnicity (100-200 words) that you would be willing to have read on a podcast (not linking for sake of Rule 8)? It can be good or bad - I think it's important to highlight both!",

With that being said, I also haven\u2019t tried to make my race a part of my graduate experience whereas some people are passionate about joining student orgs geared towards poc. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve noticed during my time in grad school is when people try too hard to be \u201cwoke\u201d and pc and it backfires. Especially when a non-poc tries to correct me or belittle me for saying something because they assume I\u2019m not poc. The look their faces when tell them is priceless (followed by a \u201cdid you just judge me based off of the color of my skin?\u201d). It\u2019s like a uno reverse card lol",

          "text": "I think your experience might be different than mine, and arguably many others. The three universities I\u2019ve gone to in my country are overwhelmingly white, especially in the department of health sciences. But even if most of those students are foreign exchange students, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make their experience \u201cless foreign\u201d or \u201cjust like white peoples\u201d. It\u2019s not as if all the foreign students got together and were like \u201cyeah let\u2019s all make the culture of the university align with our multiple backgrounds\u201d. Plus, you\u2019re assuming that the relationships that graduate students have with staff, faculty, undergrads, etc. are also precluded from race or ethnicity related influence. \n\ntl;dr it doesn\u2019t matter if most of your graduate body is  \u201cforeign\u201d, your experience may not be the same as a native of that country. Also \u201cBI\u201d stands for Black and Indigenous, respectively",

              "text": "Well prior to the start of the academic year, we all had to read \"How to be an Anti-Racist\" which was quickly followed by emails every other day about the \"BIPOC student committee\" which I seemed to be automatically appointed to on account of being black. This was later followed by emails expressing disappointment that I did not show up to any meetings discussing how we want the larger group discussion of \"How to be an Anti-Racist\" to go.\n\nThen when classes actually got rolling it seemed like along with the syllabus teachers were instructed to apologize how racist both they, the institution and the world at large are and that we should \"confront the discomfort\" of the reality that there is only one black person in the room (cue everyone looking at me yet trying to not look like they're looking at me).\n\nThen of course the others in my cohort felt compelled to tell me about how many protests they went to or how much they've donated to BLM and dragging me into discussions of how they've all been unpacking their racist ways.\n\nThen throughout the year we were analyzing stuff from African American writers where everyone seemed to put on a performance expressing how shocked they were that black people were treated in such a way... and if they honestly didn't know then ok, welcome to American history 101? But I'm assuming most already did know and that just added to whatever ongoing white existential spiral they were already in.\n\nThis also carried over to the summer graduate internship I got where their \"DEI officer\" held a huge meeting discussing all the quotas they want to meet. My bosses said on more than one occasion how glad they were to have me working for them instead of the \"annoying legion of blonde white girls from last year.\"\n\nIt was just a lot. And maybe some \"BIPOCs\" like all of this but I hate it. I think my race was directly alluded to by white people more in the past year than it has my entire life ten times over.",
