  "text": "I had a really hard semester due to a family emergency and it left me extremely burnt out (emotionally, mentally, physically). I'm currently in my first semester of graduate school but it's remote delivery. At the moment, school feels so distant and i'm starting to lose motivation or interest in it. \n\nTo heal from burn out, I've been giving myself time to relax and organized myself. I'm been trying to be proactive with my mental health but it doesn't feel like anything is working. I just want to stay in bed or just do anything except do my research. I already have one assignment that's late but all my professors already acknowledge i'm going through a family situation. Everything is settled now but i still feel like i'm dealing with the aftermath of everything. I'm not even sure if this is burnout now because i have energy. I just don't care about school nor do i have any motivation. I'm not entirely sure who i can talk to about this. While my professors will support me, I still need to do the work but i just really don't care.",

      "text": "Your professors are not and cannot be mental health counselors. They can be sympathetic, but they probably can't help you in this instance beyond that.\n\nIf you are incapable of finding the motivation, then talk to a university counselor. They may be able to help you seek a medical withdrawal. Regardless, talking to a therapist right away seems like an important thing to do at this point.\n\nOtherwise, try to convince yourself that there's only a little over a month left in the semester and push through it. If you still feel this way once the semester is done, then you can think about whether or not going next semester is a good idea. In case you need a semester to get your mental health back together.\n\nAlso, getting out of the house to work may help with your motivation. Go to a public library, a coffee shop. If you're near campus, go study there. Staying secluded at home can often excerabate feelings of depression.",
