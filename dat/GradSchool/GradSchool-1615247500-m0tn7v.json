  "text": "For 7 months I rotated in 5 different labs trying to find a mentor. I had PIs tell me that they don\u2019t know how I got into my program, and that the grants I want to apply for are a pipe dream for someone \u201clike me\u201d. I had one PI call me a slacker and many others insult my intelligence and ability. I watched all of my friends commit to labs happily for months before me. I experienced students tell others that I was the problem. Even my own program heads were questioning what was taking me so long. Almost everyone told me what I wanted out of a PI was not possible, that I was being too picky, that I needed to \u201cjust choose already\u201d.\n\nToday, after 17 zoom interviews, 5 rotations, and 7 months of searching while balancing some of the worst self-doubt and pressure to join a lab from my department: I found a PI who truly believes in me, supports me, and inspires me everyday. And I could not be more proud to officially join their laboratory. \n\nTL;DR Never settle\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the support/ awards/ kind remarks. I acknowledge the privileged situation I was in to be able to take so many rotations and speak to so many PIs. I wrote this in hopes to let people know that regardless of your situation in life you don\u2019t have to settle for less than you deserve. I settled in a horribly abusive relationship for many years of my life, and recently I have been able to prioritize not doing so in personal and professional aspects. I want those reading this to know it *does* get better. There is a light at the end of the tunnel: and it\u2019s yours.",

I am in my first year and we just finished our standard three lab rotations and there are still some who are in this grey territory of a fourth rotation and beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike you said, although maybe not as explicitly as your situation, but some of these PIs do see fourth rotation students as a red flag. It sucks. Maybe this can uplift some spirits on this side. Thank you!",

      "text": "This is really very field specific though. You're honestly privileged to be in a major where you can get into a program before getting a PI. We have to have a PI lined up already for admissions to even look at your application and you're often committing to their lab without having a chance to even meet them in person, unless you've been fortunate enough to have had an undergrad internship with them. Then it's very hard to switch labs after getting in because other labs have already lined up all the grad students they want and you've usually signed onto your PI's grant when you accepted which makes it awkward to leave",

I was so mad that I was even accepted in the first place when I couldn't actually find work! Sometimes it was money, but sometimes it was accusations or assumptions of not being good enough, passionate enough, hard-working enough. The list goes on and on. I eventually found a PI in a different department who really believed in me and was comfortable investing in me as a scientist (but I still eyed other universities just in case before deciding on this group). It was such a trying experience, but frankly now I feel invincible. Like, what can be worse than be nearly kicked out of your own department in your first semester \ud83d\ude02",

He is a perfect field match for a ton of research I have done before. The research excites, challenges, and motivates me. He is a kind soul that \u201cprioritizes fun in the lab\u201d and I have seen that first hand. He post Doc\u2019ed at a university I did years of research at, we worked with similar faculty, I cross checked all of them and they all have positive things to say. He believes in my goals, and is as excited to make them a reality as I am. He supports me taking classes and completing internships that deviate from the lab. We can talk for hours and have about life and research. He\u2019s modest but accomplished, has great funding. He is who I see myself becoming, and wanting to become. Those were the signs I found to be the most important.",

I would counter that the advice wasn\u2019t rotate until you find a fit. The advice was not to settle. And switching to a different lab later in your program is a great example of not settling!",

Definitely settled and decided to switch to a masters due to my PI. Glad I did because I couldn't live my life how acadamia demands. Settling isn't always bad. Sometimes it makes you realize what is really important to you.",

The devil and angel on your shoulders are telling you to strive for the highest and settle/get it done (which is which may also greatly depend on the situation).
