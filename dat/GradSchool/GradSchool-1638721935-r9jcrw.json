  "text": "Hey!\n\nSo, I have once been on an academic warning on the semester where COVID started. I was basically depressed because of the deadline and, as an international student, not being able to go home for a long time.\n\nI had a sub 2.0 semester GPA. After then, I have retaken all of the courses and am already back on track(\\~3.6/4.00 CGPA). I believe it's a good GPA as I'm from a top 20 engineering school in the world)\n\nWhile applying for a master's in ECE, I'm being asked If I have ever been on probation. It's not on my transcript now, and I don't think it's going to be on the official transcript I get after graduation. The school I'm applying to is a prestigious undergrad institute. But I think the master's program is a \"cash cow\" as it's not very selective and around half of the people who apply get admitted.\n\nSo, I'm here wondering if I should report the academic probation parts as yes or no.\n\n1. Some people told me If I say yes and a compelling SoP about why I did bad and how I came back on track after a difficult time, maybe it will picture my abilities positively to have perseverance. I'm not sure if this is how the commute looks.\n2. If I say no, I may have a better chance, I believe, but I have heard sometimes schools request for academic history from previous schools after getting admitted. I'm not sure how this works as I'm an international student with a non-US undergrad.\n\nSo, I'm hoping you can help me out with this. What would you do if you were in my position? It's much appreciated if you were in my position or know someone who was.\n\nP.S. I know it's morally wrong not to report, but I don't want my application to get rejected just because I fucked up on one semester, which I have already reversed.",

      "text": "You should include it. They will likely find out anyways, because often transcripts list probationary status for particular semesters, even if you weren't on probation when you graduated. It will look much worse to deny it and then have them find out later. Also, they look at overall trends, and the fact that you have improved since then will carry more weight in their eyes. Finally, every institution recognizes how hard spring 2020 was, so they should be more lenient that you had a hard time that semester. It may be helpful to explain the shortfall in a personal statement. Admitting and explaining will always look better than lying and hiding things.\n\nAnd your application is much more likely to be rejected because the school found out you lied on it, than because you stumbled during one of the toughest semesters this century, but recovered afterwards.",
