That's a red flag. \n\nFind out if they have set hours you have to be in lab or if you're productive can you keep your own schedule. Some advisors expect 6 day work weeks and that 70 hour weeks are reasonable. And they will say this to your face thinking it's how all programs are. This is unreasonable. Don't get sucked in. Your personal time is as valuable as your work is. If you're working 6 days a week because you're required to, you will burn out before you can finish \n\nHow often will they meet one-on-one with you? Do you want frequent meetings or not?\n\nHave the current grad students published papers? How was it for them to write the paper, how much help did the advisor give, how long did it take to assemble? \n\nReally think about your ideal work environment and try to tease out if this is the closest fit.",

              "text": "After you've committed to a school / programs you usually do rotations through multiple labs until you find the right fit. The thing I tell incoming students is that you have to ask the people in the lab what the culture / relationship they hold with the PI is. Is there fear or is there respect?\n\nI made a Google Sheet with labs that's research focus looked interesting to me. Then I asked my student mentor to vet the crazies. After that, I went to the lab websites, looked up the grad students in that lab and emailed them. There is unwritten code between grad students - thou shall not let thee suffer, as thou did. And they were honest. Some of them straight up told me, don't even bother approaching X, this sucks. But the people in my lab spoke nothing but praise about our PI so they made the choice easy. \n\nYou can worry about researching something that interest you deeply when you are in a post doc. During graduate school you require strong mentorship and guidance to help you become a critical / independent thinker.",
