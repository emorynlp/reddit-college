Despite going to much larger D1 schools for my masters and now my PhD, those feelings just aren't there.

I'm in an MEd program where I've tried reaching out to them for projects and to gather some pretty basic data and they just suck at either replying or giving clear answers. In fact, I've decided that when I look for a job after getting my master's, my undergrad institution will be near the bottom of my job search list.\n\nI did take a few weeks to completely adapt to the new environment, which definitely went smoother with a patient group of instructors and a bunch of others in my cohort hosting events after a while. If no one in your cohort is doing these things, you should. Host mini get-togethers, meet up at bars or restaurants, anything to get to know who you're sitting next to outside of class work.",

      "text": "I also think that it has to do with the pandemic. Most of us who are in grad school now were in undergrad pre-pandemic. Even though many restrictions are lifted on campuses (at least in the US) and most classes are in-person now, campuses just don't feel the same as before in terms of being spaces of spontaneity, robust social interaction, and regular interaction with professors outside of the classroom. This, combined with the fact that campus life is always diminished for graduate students compared to undergrads, gives me similar nostalgia (even though my grad institution is, in normal times I think, much closer to my vibe than the place I attended undergrad was).",

      "text": "I miss \\*being\\* an undergrad, not my undergraduate institution. Honestly, my undergrad institution sucked as a choice for me. Their physics program was really emaciated and I ended up screwing myself over by going there in a program where half the standard physics undergrad coursework wasn't even offered, forcing me to take a bunch of undergrad classes during my masters to make up for it before moving to my PhD.\n\nPlus, It was a small catholic commuter school and I was a closeted trans woman at the time. My social life wasn't exactly great  because of it, and the vast majority of my fun times and social bonding during undergrad actually came from summer internships and study abroad programs rather  than genuine campus connection and bonding. \n\nIf anything, I wish I had been an undergrad at a different institution, and honestly my grad institution is a \\*much\\* better choice for me than my undergrad was. \n\nBut yeah... I've told my therapist this before, but the problem with grad school is we have all the teaching research responsibilities of faculty, the coursework responsibilities of undergrads, and the privileges of neither. We are alienated from the campus and social life of undergrads, and don't have the status or financial security of tenured faculty either. It's a very socially isolating experience, and honestly I'd probably be in a much worse mental state if not for the intervention of my boyfriend who lives with me.",
