  "text": "So, I'm still intimidated by this whole idea of getting back into it - but I've made contact with my advisor to see if we can \"catch up\" on the last few months and begin the re-integration process. This was no small feat for me because my advisor's behavior toward me was one of the things that drove me to take an LOA. I think I am better prepared to deal with them this time around - but to be blunt - their mistreatment of me has had a lasting effect.  I know where I stand this time around though. \n\nOtherwise - I've made lots of to-do lists. This is at least helping me lay out what needs to be done, and start to prioritize. I think some next steps for me would be to sit down and work out a timeline for myself with reasonable goals. Key word being reasonable. I think this time around I'm going to set the bar a little lower, give myself a little more wiggle room, and more readily forgive myself if I feel that I could be doing better. I am really going to have to manage the amount of pressure I feel in order to succeed, otherwise I will burn out again.  \n\nI can't believe it's already December. \n\nPrevious Entry: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qzh4pe/a\\_return\\_from\\_loa\\_journal\\_entry\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qzh4pe/a_return_from_loa_journal_entry_1/)",

Just take one day at a time, and continue to remind yourself that your health and not getting burned out are more important than any of this shit. But for real, LOA was a game changer. You got this!!",

      "text": "Hi there! I am in the same boat, although I am not working during gradschool. I took LOA from October to end of March for 6 months, I am 5th year and, yeah, ABD. Currently I am still in rest stage. For this LOA I want to get rid of things and stuff which interfere with my PhD like get rid of home and electronic clutter. Yeah, I am keeping in touch with my advisor either, although they also were the resson I took LOA (they are toxic with 5 students leaving our lab)). Good luck to both of us, buddy!!!",
