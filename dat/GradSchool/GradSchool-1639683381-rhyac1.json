  "title:": "Do I have to go to a different school for my Phd?",
  "text": "I'm a chemistry undergrad at a highly ranked public school, both institutionally and within my field. I've heard a LOT about going to a different college for your PhD to get different perspectives if you want to go into academia, but I'm not sure if I want to go to a different college. If there are faculty studying what I want to study, and my program is highly ranked, it feels like going to a different university is a waste of everyone's time and resources.\n\nI also have no idea how to choose what school to go to if I have to go to a different one for my PhD. Like, ok I could go from the #6 school to the #1 school, but now I'm out of state and don't know shit. I don't see the point. It just doesn't feel worth it to go to a school that's far away if my home institution does so well. Like what is the actual point of going from Purdue to Wisconsin??? (neither is my actual school).\n\nThe only move I can justify in my head is going to a school in CA or NYC, but that's literally only because I think it would be fun to live there. And that doesn't feel like a good reason to do a PhD somewhere. help :(\n\nEdit: I do get the importance of having multiple perspectives. But i see this as more of a \"pro\" rather than a necessity?",

So what is *possible* you would be more competitive as an applicant somewhere else.",
