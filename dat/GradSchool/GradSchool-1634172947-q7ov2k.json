  "text": "So, I went straight from my masters to a PhD in this pandemic and I think I\u2019ve mad a horrible mistake. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I actually like research. I\u2019ve always been drawn to the idea of teaching, and I do love the science of research, but I haven\u2019t enjoyed the little work I\u2019ve done at all. \n\nI love criminology. I loved it. I feel like this first semester of my PhD is killing my passion for it. \n\nBeyond that, it\u2019s not the program. The professors are kind and supportive. The city I moved to is lovely. I would stay here if I quit without an issue. I am struggling to connect to my cohort, but there are other kind people. I know loneliness is a common issue in grad school, and I do feel very alone and isolated, but the program itself is not to blame in my opinion. I think this program actually tries to help students. So seeing that the program isn\u2019t the issue really makes me think academia isn\u2019t for me. \n\nI loved getting my bachelors and masters. I never questioned if the stress was worth it. I might not have liked taking tests or the crunch time for my thesis, but I was happy in the program overall. \n\nI\u2019ve pretty much been struggling with depression and anxiety since I can remember, but this PhD has taken all joy out of my life I feel. I can barely function anymore. I\u2019m weeks behind on my job duties, my house is a train wreck, etc.\n\nPart of the problem is that I am pretty sure I am autistic but being an adult woman, it went unnoticed. The problems are caving in on me in such a demanding program but I cannot get accommodations because I don\u2019t have a diagnosis or access to getting one(thanks grad student stipends being so small! /s) part of this impacts how I said before the program tried to help students\u2014 Autism is so misunderstood I do not feel I can rely on them to help with related issues even if I had a diagnosis. The only accommodations typically offered are for testing it seems, and more time for tests isn\u2019t going to make this better. \n\nI\u2019m tired, so tired, and I can\u2019t see myself doing this anymore. How do you know if it\u2019s just a bad couple of months/adjusting or if this isn\u2019t right for you?",

I ended up getting an adhd diagnosis from a psychiatrist at the school but they couldn't assess autism. I love my topic but now things are piling on and every little email feels like a huge task and I really have no idea what the hell is going on at any given time. At this point, I'm just leaning on the sunk cost fallacy and hoping I'll make it to the end \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
