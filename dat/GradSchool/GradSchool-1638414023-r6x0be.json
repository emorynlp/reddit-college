  "text": "I already met with people for the one program I applied to, and I was able to name-drop them in my statement of purpose, which I felt really looked good because it shows how involved I want to be with the school.\n\nI'm finishing up my apps to 2 other schools that I'm meeting with on the 14th and 15th, and I'm worried that if I apply now without name-dropping, it'll hurt my app, but at the same time, if I do wait, it might hurt my app because submission deadlines are the end of December, and I'll be cutting it close.\n\nWhat would look better: close to deadline, but more personal OR more ahead of deadline, but not as personal ?",
