  "text": "Hey everyone! I'm a grad student who has approximately 4-5 months to complete an MSc. From the very first day I tried to do my best and show results and progress on my research. But still I couldn't get enough good results to write a paper. I feel like I am stupid compared to my fellow colleagues tbh. Because they are doing well in their research projects. Really feels down sometimes. But I love my research area and almost everything related to it. Do you guys have any advice to my situation? \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "First off, I want to say your feelings are 100% valid, and that you are not alone. You are going through what is called \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d and it\u2019s very common in academia, especially if you have intersectionality with race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or first generation status.\n\nYou are not stupid, if you were you wouldn\u2019t have gotten into your program in the first place. Your colleagues probably feel the same way as you, but they present otherwise externally. Everyone goes through hard times with research, and you need to ignore the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d ideas of academia.\n\nMy advice to you is focus on what you have achieved, and follow your passion. I also suggest working with a mental health professional to discuss your feelings, as this can get out of control fast. For me, what made me feel better was watching videos and doing research about ways to combat imposter syndrome. I didn\u2019t know it existed, and when I found out I felt so seen- like when a word is on the tip of your tongue and you remember the word.",
