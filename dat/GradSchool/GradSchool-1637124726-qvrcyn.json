  "text": "These last few days I have been considering whether to go to graduate school. I've been considering this path for several years now, but I am beginning to feel pressed to make a decision soon, as I do not feel I have much time left to do it.\u00a0I am currently a junior at university majoring in social science, and will be a senior next year. I am interested in possibly applying to a history or biological anthropology graduate program. Actually, I would prefer to go to a program that would allow me to work in both fields, possibly as a historian of biological anthropology or evolution. But I do not think there are any graduate programs offering what I am interested in near where I live, so I would probably have to live on my own for the first time, which is an anxious thing, as I still have little experience with such things. Also, how can I pay for all the expenses for grad school tuition without the financial aid as students are usually given in undergraduate university? I'm not asking this question for an answer, but it is just one of many questions that make me hesitant to apply to a PhD program. The distance, having to do everything by myself at once may be overwhelmingly confusing, the payments may be too much.\n\nI am a social science student in California, who is a junior, becoming a senior next year. I am 22 years old, and almost 23. What are your suggestions? If anyone has dealt with similar situations, how did you overcome them? Were they too difficult? Am I little late to be considering this path? I still am not sure what field I would want to pursue, given the available choices I have.",

      "text": "PhD programs are typically funded, and includes a stipend for living expenses. The advice is that if a program is not funded, don't attend.   \n\n\nAs for timing, many people take gap years between undergrad and when apply to a PhD program to get more research or relevant experience in order to figure out if a PhD is even right for them, narrow down what they want to do in grad school, and/or work on making their application more competitive. So no, it's not at all too late for you to be considering this path, although depending on your situation you might just need some time post-undergrad to sort yourself/your application out before applying to PhD programs.  \n\n\nFinally, when it comes to PhD programs, generally people's advice is to not geographically restrict yourself since many programs have a competitive admission rate. So you have to be somewhat okay with potentially moving to a new city or even a new state. You could just choose to only apply to programs in a certain area, but you'll just have to be okay with the fact that you're significantly slimming down your chances of getting into a program.",

      "text": "1 - you\u2019re not too late and you\u2019re not on a time crunch. I didn\u2019t begin to seriously consider or prepare for grad school until my senior year of undergrad. If you\u2019re interested in research (which to complete a PhD, you will need to be), try to get some research experience. That will boost your admissions chances if you decide to go to grad school and will help you make a decision.\n\n2 - as the other commenter mentioned, PhD programs are typically funded by the university, including a stipend for living expenses. If it\u2019s unfunded, run away. If you want to do a terminal MA , funding is much less common, but it exists. There\u2019s also lots of fellowships and scholarships available. Check out grad.UChicago.edu/fellowships for a good database.\n\n3 - if you\u2019re serious about this path, don\u2019t limit yourself geographically so much. Good opportunities are relatively few and far between, you\u2019re going to hav to be willing to relocate probably. And as for living on your own, you\u2019ll have to do it at some point and frankly grad school can be a great time to do it. You\u2019ll have a built in social network and support structure from school, you\u2019re not making new friends from scratch.\n\n4 - you didn\u2019t ask about this, but I was once in your place, interested in a humanities PhD, and I thank god someone told me this. Just make sure you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. A PhD is primarily a vocational degree training you to be a professor, and not really preparing you to do other things. The other skills you learn along the way are incidental and there are cheaper, easier, faster ways to learn them. The academic job market \u2014 especially in the humanities and social sciences \u2014 is a dumpster fire and doesn\u2019t look to be improving at all any time soon. There\u2019s a very good chance that you\u2019ll finish a PhD and not be able to find stable long-term work. A friend of mine is a social science professor. They did a masters at a top-10 program in their field, a PhD at the top program in their sub field, and a post-doc at an Ivy League school. They applied for ~100 jobs and got two interviews. And that was before COVID, which has made the problem even worse.\n\nI\u2019m not saying to not do a PhD, but just make sure you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. To maximize your chances of finding solid employment after school, I\u2019d recommend you only consider top-10 or so programs. Google \u201cthe academic caste system\u201d to understand why. Basically a preponderance of professors all went to the same 10 or so grad schools.",

          "text": "Thanks much for the advice. I will keep the funding part in mind, if they don't offer funding, I probably won't consider the program. I'm glad to hear that the programs are typically funded. You might be right about grad school being a good time to get ready living on my own. I am mostly interested in gaining specialized knowledge in the fields and doing some research of my own, and most people doing this have a PhD, which is why I'm considering doing it. I'm not so interested in teaching.\n\nI can't believe someone with a PhD has trouble finding long term work, even if it's in social science, which isn't the most sought field.",
