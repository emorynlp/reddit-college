  "text": "Title says it all, I'm an online masters program in substance abuse counseling and I'm not sure of how to go about networking in an online setting. Should I send them an email, set up a private zoom meeting? I understand that professors especially in grad school can get very busy so while I don't want to bother them per se I'd like to connect with them more. Part of me wanting to connect with them is I need letters of rec for a fellowship I'm interested in applying to, and part of it is I'm genuinely interested in making connections. If anyone has any advice on the best way to go about this, let me know. Thanks in advance!",
