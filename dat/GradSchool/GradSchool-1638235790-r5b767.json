      "text": "I entered the PhD program a few years later in life than most of the others in my cohort. I had partied a lot during my \"youth\", but by the time I started grad school I had quit cigarettes for four years, and was having maybe only a beer per week on average. Hadn't smoked pot or done any other illicit drug in 4-5 years either.\n\nBut upon moving to a big city and joining a new community / social circle, where there was a huge drinking culture, I gradually started drinking more and more, which in turn reawakened the craving for cigarettes -- they go so well together! The social drinking, if excessive at times, was a fun way to relieve the stress of academia and to bond, commiserate and/or celebrate with each other. There were the parties of course, plus a few times a month 2-5 of us might spend 6-7 hours at the pub splitting pitcher after pitcher. Good times.\n\nBut I think I was the only one for whom this gradually became almost a daily routine even when I wasn't with others.\n\nThere were also a few occasions involving either cocaine, MDMA, LSD, or ketamine, but I don't consider any of those problematic because they were one-time only, plus none of those are physiologically addictive aside from cocaine.\n\nI finished the PhD in fall 2020 (needless to say 2020 involved even more drinking for me) and have managed to find a pretty good job outside of academia, but am definitely still struggling with alcohol, and am constantly quitting smoking or vaping for a month or two at a time before relapsing.\n\nI started using edibles to help with sleep during the pandemic, as a much healthier alternative to alcohol.\n\nWhat's helping? Leaving the academic career track and finding a 9-5 industry job has helped a little, as does getting back to the gym regularly. But I'm still working on all of it. I racked up tens of thousands of dollars in debt through drinking.\n\nNot that I blame grad school / academia for this; it was the combination of a certain culture and circumstance with my own vulnerabilities. The ol' diathesis-stressor model.\n\nAnyway, hopefully this comment reminds you that you are not alone -- your post did the same for me. All the best.",
