  "title:": "What are the best CS master's programs for career-changers that are NOT cash cows?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a Biology grad from a top 50 school with CS coursework that is equivalent to a minor. Decided that medical school wasn\u2019t for me, however, I don\u2019t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry. The CS-relevant coursework I have taken are Computer Architecture and Organization, DS&A, OOP, Discrete Math, and Linear Algebra. So pretty much a majority of the lower-division courses. \n\nI've been constantly hearing that many universities have graduate programs that are considered \"cash-cows\" and are just watered-down versions of undergrad or simply are not great programs for the unnecessarily high price tag. How do I look out to avoid these programs?\n\n**My main goal is to use the master\u2019s to fill in my CS gaps as well as use it as a springboard to get a job** (I live in the Bay Area). I am not too interested in doing a research-based master's and I mostly want to attend a program that will make me a competent software engineer since I wasn't able to major in CS during my undergrad.\n\nThis is my current list and I would love anyone's take or advice in terms of whether I should add or remove schools from here:\n\n1. **Stanford University (Biocomputational Track)**\n2. **Cornell University**  \n3. **University of California, Los Angeles** \n4. **University of Pennsylvania** \n5. **University of California, San Diego**\n6. **University of Southern California** \n7. **Columbia University** \n8. **University of California, Irvine**\n9. **Princeton University**\n10. **New York University** \n11. **University of Michigian**\n12. **UC Davis**",
