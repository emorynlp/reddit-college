Does anyone have any experience with them? It doesn\u2019t seem like a scam but from other threads I\u2019ve read on Reddit about it people seem to have mixed opinions on the actual benefit one gets as the fee to join is $75.",

I've heard of them but same to you, it was through their marketing team.\n\nI don't think I lost anything by ignoring them.",

They guaranteed the scholarship to me that's why I joined. I looked into the society you mentioned and they have no guaranteed scholarships and the few they have seem too competitive. Also, I paid a one time fee whereas this org has a recurring fee. Honor societies are only worth it for scholarships. In STEM fields (which is what I'm in), they have basically no value. I don't even mention my societies on my resume. Just used them for the $$$",
