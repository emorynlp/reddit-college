  "text": "2nd year grad student here. I just learned that I will be receiving a generous stipend of $900/ month in return for me TA-ing two classes. I have some questions about living on $900/month and was hoping someone could answer them for me.  \n\n\nWhat kind of Cat food tastes the best and is the cheapest? I was thinking of getting fancy feast but its a little big more expensive than other wet foods. Dry food makes me too thirsty so i stay away from it\n\n  \nWhat are some good free alternatives to toilet paper? There are a lot of dead leaves on the ground near my house but they're pretty dry. I was thinking of using snow but its been a warm winter.\n\nHow much extra income can I make as a male escort? how fat can an escort be and still find clients? Is being an \"escort\" technically legal?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated thanks!",

I did my reading at work everyday.\n\n-It is very easy to take all the TP and soap you need from public bathrooms at the university.\n\n-if you have the funds up front, a 50lbs bag of rice and a 50lbs bag of beans can last months. I bought eggs and hot sauce to go with it week to week.\n\n-Living like this SUCKS but you can handle it because you have to.",

It's doable, by living in shared spaces, and with extreme rationing, but all of that can get old fast. Moreover, at some point, you'd likely need a car (Public transportation in the US is non-existent), and the costs for that can add on too. My suggestion is that you actually look for specific costs of living in the specific cities your desired universities are located in, as they can vary.",

You will no longer have to worry about electricity, heating, water, and internet bills either. Use the department kitchen and fridge for your cooking needs. The only issue is you may need to find a shower, but you can probably use the campus gym's shower for that! And in case there are rules on campus that disallow staying overnight, just tell anyone who checks on you that you're pulling an all-nighter for research (which is probably true anyway)!\n\n^(~~This may have almost become a true story.~~)",

Asian groceries sell odd cuts and organ meats that are nutritious and cheap too.  If you want to go the vegetarian route, eat rice, beans and potatoes. Don't bother with salads and greens, they are expensive. Cabbage, cauliflower and few in-season vegetables can be good option or else frozen veggies. Don't buy snacks or treats and eat big meals!

Getting yourself into debt for a PhD is considered a very bad idea. But, different for a 1 year masters, people will just suck it up and borrow for that.

Use a bidet instead of toilet paper. Go to the dollar store for stuff like trash bags and shampoo. Use wash cloths instead of paper towels. Use a shaved bar of laundry soap with some washing soda (not baking soda) and borax instead of tide. Use wool dryer balls to speed up the clothes drying in a dryer or if you can hang clothes to dry on a rack in your room. Apply for food assistance. Find a food bank. Ask a charity for assistance.

You don't know their expenses or situation, and your response seems to be placing the success or failure of surviving on very little as OP's sole responsibility.

I'm not complaining, but I have noticed that TA positions that aren't offered as a funding package tend to pay less. I think they just give us higher pay because it looks better and makes us feel so lucky to give us a 6k scholarship and pay us $42/hour to TA than it does to give us a 10k scholarship and pay us $15/hour.",

There are some other days with random food leftover but I can't remember anymore.

He would clean his parents garage for $100 and then spend that money on a new video game or something for himself. Meanwhile, I was putting our rent on a credit card and tutoring rich Beverly Hills\u2019 kids in my \u201cspare time.\u201d I paid for the entire divorce and took the majority of the debt since he said it was my fault we were in that situation.\n\n$90,000 of debt later, I graduated, finished my postdoc, did a short stint as a Project Scientist and then finally transitioned to industry. Less than 3 years in industry, I was debt free.\n\nHold strong, it\u2019s worth it in the end! Find good friends. That\u2019s how I did it.
