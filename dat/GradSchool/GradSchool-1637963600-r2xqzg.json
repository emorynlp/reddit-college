It was not something I used often until joining the workforce (so many spreadsheets!).\n\nI think that younger people don't use it as much, because there are so many apps and tools available now, so they spend their time doing something else. It's a huge difference from using technology back in the 90s/early 2000s. Just because they're digital natives, it does not mean they have extensive knowledge about very basic tools. Some kids and teenagers even have a hard time locating files on their computers, and I'm talking about the ones who spend a huge chunk of their days using a computer! It's wild.",
