      "text": "Bad writing is what first drafts are for. But if you\u2019re dreading tackling the rewrite, one trick is to attack it in stages. First consider the overall structure: Is information in the order you want it to be? If not, move chunks around until it is \u2014 but don\u2019t rewrite them yet; just cut and paste. Then look at it section by section: Are there any big issues, such as your thought that you need to beef up your opinion and cut back on the history? Write those down. Then go after one section at a time, making the big changes first, like trimming the history, before smoothing out the writing. If you struggle with a particular sentence or paragraph, tag it and move on. You\u2019ll come back to those once the paper is otherwise complete.\n\nIt\u2019s the classic technique of breaking a big task into smaller ones.",
