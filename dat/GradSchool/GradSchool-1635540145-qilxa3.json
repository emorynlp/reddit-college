  "text": "Basically there was a miscommunication with my department. I didn't know that I needed to be presenting at the conference to get funding to attend. I found out less than a week before I was supposed to go, I was so excited. I have never been to a conference or traveled before.\n\nOptions for distracting myself:\n\n1. Go for a night on the town and get drunk with my colleagues\n2. Get drunk at home and do arts and crafts\n3. Read a book\n4. Write, write, write my thesis\n5. Work on pinning my insect collection\n\nI'm open to other suggestions as well.",
