  "text": "And I absolutely crushed it! I have a 3.98 for the year! I know grades don\u2019t really matter but still I like to pretend they do, it provides good motivation to really study the material. I can\u2019t really brag to anyone irl except for family but they don\u2019t even really understand what classes I\u2019m taking. Glad I made it through supposedly the toughest year and I\u2019m killing this PhD so far.",

One thing that I\u2019m having to remind my undergrads about when they plan to make grad school arrangements is that a ton of schools cancelled their 2021-2022 cohorts. Those choices were made (at the schools I\u2019m aware of) at the dept level btw. So, remember that when you apply you\u2019re competing with all the candidates who wanted to be in this one of this year\u2019s cancelled cohort and fresh grads/industry swappers. Plus, (depending on the program) you may be competing with candidates who are specifically interested in that program and have had a year to prepare their admissions packet.\n\nJust something to be aware of as you prep for this exciting next step.",

              "text": "Ooh thank you for this!! I'm applying to molecular bio/genetics programs, trying to get more into the bioinformatics side but since my background is mostly wet lab I figured I wouldn't get into a purely computational program. This is really good to know, I'm a bit older (33 when matriculating, IF I get in!) and I applied, unsuccessfully, 4 years ago. I see the glaring mistakes from my past app, I was all over the place with my research interests at that time, and I know I could have put in more effort to deliver a more solid application package. That being said, I have spent the last 4 years in industry working at a startup in NGS so I'm hoping that boosts my chances. I have secured 4 strong LORs, last time I had 1 strong and 2 profs who kind of knew me. I'll also take the GRE which I did well on before (I already have my MS from an Ivy League school which I don't know if that matters lol). Sorry for all the info but this is super helpful for me to gauge where I'm at, especially in competition with all the other students who will have dealt with the weird circumstances of applying during COVID. Anyway, thank you for that information! Please let me know if you have any other advice/suggestions, I'm very eager to get as much as I can in this process. Thank you SO much!",

          "text": "This might be unpopular but my strategy basically became stop going to class. There were so many hours taken up for lectures, sections, random additional commitments we had to go to. Because everything was recorded, I could watch at my own convenience at 2x speed, which freed up a lot of time. I would also rewatch all of the lectures a couple of days right before exams and would take extensive notes during these days. These notes were super handy for these take home open note exams. I also had a good cohort and even though we had never met in person we definitely came together and they were all a great help with problem sets.",

I agree with the lecture time being somewhat a waste, especially since we can watch things 2x and not have the natural distraction of slow pacing, redundant questions, etc. thanks again for your reply and best of luck in the remainder of your program! :)",

Otherwise at live lecture if I miss something and they keep going I might be lost for the rest of lecture.",
