  "title:": "Is anyone else surprised/concerned by how there don't seem to be time/communication boundaries in grad school?",
  "text": "I'm a career changer who did grad school pt. 1 a decade ago, and am now back for a different grad degree in something unrelated.\n\nIt seems like in my time away, grad school has changed such that expectations are more akin to a corporate job. I'm being bombarded with blackboard updates, new communications, and expectations to be making blackboard discussion posts multiple times a week outside of classes, in addition to the normal readings and assignments.\n\nProfessors will say one thing in class and then post on blackboard a different assignment and then change their minds, all the while expecting you to come onto the discussion board every other day to respond to your professor and classmates.  This is all while we are learning in person so I'm going to campus for classes every week.  It seems like there's no good way to draw boundaries and have times that are reserved for family/jobs/life.  You can't just say \"I'm going to post my discussion posts at X time\" and schedule it in because the discussion post requirements also include needing to respond to other students who may not have posted yet, so then you get to keep checking back.\n\nWhen I went to college and my first round of grad school, you went to classes, got your assignments, turned in your assignments during the class where they were due, went to office hours if you wanted to discuss something with the professor, and that was that.  Maybe an occasional email from a professor to change a class time or update something on the syllabus.  If you wanted to discuss more with your classmates, you created a study group.  If you had group projects, you figured out a time to meet and did that.\n\nWhy is this suddenly a nonstop communication fest where I need to be paying attention to and having classroom discussions multiple times a week outside of class? It's emotionally exhausting to feel like I have to be mentally prepared to be \"in the classroom\" all waking hours.  Does anyone have advice for how to manage this?",

If you\u2019re taking five classes that\u2019s two discussions per night on blackboard after class all day discussing the same things.\n\nWhy not leave class discussions in class and let students learn the material in the way that works for them outside of class?",

Responding to others' ideas just seems like the work that should be happening in classroom discussions where students can clarify if someone misunderstood or show that their views have been broadened or what have you.",

I don't think asking freshmen students to make a short pass/fail post is that onerous. Some students rarely speak in class and this allows them to participate in the discussion (overall participation is also graded on a pass/fail basis). It also tests their comprehension of a text and ensures they've actually read it. My class is a composition class so it's also an opportunity for them to write and receive my feedback. Class periods are so short and I'd rather use them for active teaching/lecturing or discussion. If it helps, the class is graded on a contract. If students submit all assignments on time (with one free extension), don't miss more than x classes without a good reason, and participate, they'll get an A. I'm not going to make this any longer re. my grading philosophy (in short - grade inflation is absurd; I'd rather they took risks and felt less pressure; I reward effort over prior education/experience which is often linked to socioeconomic status, etc). I recognise your concerns and have been in classes with the pointless busy work you criticize. But I don't think I'm guilty of that here. They have to sign in twice a week at predetermined times. They can write the posts in advance and can sign in even less frequently. And they're not penalized for the odd late or missed post.",

And to be clear I meant it seemed like something that could be completed by students before class and submitted at the start of class - not taking up class time. \n\nMy main point is just that all the goals you discuss seem like they could be hit by students turning in responses to you every week, without the added time and pressure of posting everything publicly for their classmates to see and compare themselves to, and then requiring classmates to go in and read through a bunch of their peers\u2019 responses on a weekly basis to try to find something to comment on. They would still get feedback from you by just submitting. \n\nI recognize it doesn\u2019t seem like that much added work to you but when you multiply it by five for five classes and then put it on top of normal readings/assignments/class attendance, the public nature and need to read and interact with classmate\u2019s posts while trying not to hurt their feelings or misstate anything, while also worrying what classmates think of your Post, amounts to more work/pressure than I experienced a decade ago, and I\u2019m just trying to understand if there\u2019s a benefit that outweighs that cost.",

Generally, my program at a competitive R1 has been regularly open about work-life balance, and encourages students and professors to avoid late nights and weekends as a norm. I have had professors that are more likely to email/ assign work that may be due outside of \"regular\" work hours, but in general I haven't seen or experienced what you have.   \n\n\nMy advice would be to bring this up with either the professor or the graduate director in your department in a tactful but direct way. If they are any good as colleagues (which is what you are, as a grad student), they will listen and maybe even take steps to address it.",

Was even out installing instruments at 3 am once, but that was in the Arctic summer (24 hr sun + jet lag).\n\nThe move to virtual and adding extra connectivity, e.g. slack, kind of sucked (though has benefits too). Fortunately my iphone 4 cannot even get emails so I can disconnect just putting my work laptop asleep.",

I have found that if I am not pretty hardline about setting and keeping a schedule, academia will absolutely suck me dry and destroy my personal life. To that end, I reply to emails during work hours only; and, this may sound draconian, but if I find that someone is treating email like instant messenger, I put some time between reading the email and answering. I check email in the morning and afternoon, and I don\u2019t have push alerts turned on, period! If there are forum posts, I choose three times a week to check them. I schedule everything, and stick to my schedule as best I can. I also judiciously skip forum posts if it won\u2019t impact my grade! \n\nBe assertive about protecting your time, and be open about it.

However, many of my younger students right out of school are so used to the instant availability of online communications that I get emails at all times of day and night expecting instant replies. Some have the audacity to email at 9pm and if I haven\u2019t replied by 9am the next morning they will email the coordinator (!!!!) and say I haven\u2019t got back to them. Because of this, I have actually just in the last few weeks set up an auto reply that says \u201cthank you for your email! I will get back to you as soon as possible. However, now that we\u2019re back in the classroom, please be aware that I am on email less frequently. If your query is urgent, please check the blackboard for your unit, it might be answered there for you. I also kindly ask for your understanding that I do not work past 6pm, or on weekends.

As a physics prof, when I first started 15 years ago, I gave my students problem sets of around 10 problems each week. These were taken from the textbook, and students wrote answers by hand on paper. Then online HW systems became available, and I started using them for my ease of grading, and for the students to get instant feedback and multiple tries. (Cost creep is a separate issue\u2026) Then after a few years of online-only HW, I realized my students were getting worse at showing the steps of the problems on exams. So the next year I gave them 10 problems of online HW, plus a weekly quiz with one problem (more work than online HW). But that took too much class time, so I switched to 10 problems online plus 2 on paper (switching the work of the quiz to work of HW). Then after a few years of that, I realized they didn\u2019t understand how to read solutions, so I made them evaluate each others\u2019 2 problems on paper, which was more work still\u2026 Then I said F it, and I\u2019m back to just 10 problems online HW, and they have to figure out the problem solving skills on their own. \ud83e\udd37",
