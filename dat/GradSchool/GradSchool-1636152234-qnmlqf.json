  "text": "Every time I get critical feedback or get rejected from a grant/scholarship/position my confidence takes a huge hit and I convince myself that my ideas and myself as a researcher are not worthy and not worth investing in. It makes it really hard to brush it off, make any necessary edits and try again. Instead I just get really dejected. I know this will keep happening the further I get in grad school/academia, so how do you keep morale high and maintain confidence in your work and your ideas?",

      "text": "I definitely relate to this struggle. For years, I worked hard to hide any \"flaws\" in myself and my work because I received critiques and rejections as confidence-crushing events. This system ultimately held me back, and I have since shifted from trying to be/appear confident to genuinely being compassionate to myself. From this stance, I can receive critiques and rejections while still readily supporting myself because I do not connect my self-worth as strongly to these external assessments. For specific techniques and an in-depth examination of self-compassion, I can recommend checking out [this research-based workbook](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Self-Compassion). The skills in that book are an enormous reason I was able to finish my masters thesis and rediscover the excitement and curiosity that is now fueling my search for a PhD program. Good luck, OP! Grad students often are not supported in being kind to themselves so its great that you're looking for a more effective way to treat yourself :) You deserve it!",

      "text": "My advisor once compared a PhD to an apprenticeship. You don't become a mason by reading \"*Masonry: Methods and Methodology*\" you do it by working under the guidance of an experienced master. And nobody in their right mind will expect you to be good at it from day one. Doing scholarship, writing grant applications, organizing conferences, etc. are practical skills with unwritten rules. You acquire them by trying and then learning from the feedback you get on your attempts. Grad school is your apprenticeship, postdoc is your journeyman years.\n\nI also struggle with confidence but reminding myself of this framing does help.",

I spent a lot of time reading papers and research done by my peers, especially those I felt were the smartest and most capable. I think if you do that and then look back at your own work you\u2019ll see you aren\u2019t really a pretender or dumb (etc). It takes practice, but I was finally able to see that some of my projects were really novel and could be useful/valuable.",

It\u2019s slow going, since grad school is kinda designed to take over your whole life, but having hobbies and a social life helps my self worth. So does getting super sick of grad school and adopting the \u2018done is better than good\u2019 mentality, haha. \n\nBest of luck! Remember, you\u2019re not alone and grad school (in my opinion) is designed to make you feel bad at your job. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the system. You got this!",

And if they question you you\u2019ll have a piece of paper to prove it. \n\nForever.\n\nHow can you not be confident? Like seriously. Purely by merit of being in the position to get critiqued at this level you are an expert. All that critique is doing is refining your understanding and presentation of that knowledge. And who cares outside of academia if the presentation is a little off? You think David Attenborough or Zac Galifinakis would care about comma splices while you marvel them with your intellect? Of course not.\n\nThat\u2019s how I keep my confidence, at least. Fantasizing about presenting my research to Zac Galifinakis.",
