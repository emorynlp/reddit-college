  "text": "PhD applicant here wondering how many current PhD students first approached their current advisors   \n or program with a specific dissertation research question in mind. I have a target intersection of several topics and have identified several potential advisors working in that subject I want to contact, but I'm wondering whether you current PhD students would recommend leading that contact with a specific research question already. I've heard some folks say not to worry about it because the faculty member will have their own research agenda I need to mesh into, but I feel like leading with more definition shows a little extra competency and initiative. Thoughts?",
