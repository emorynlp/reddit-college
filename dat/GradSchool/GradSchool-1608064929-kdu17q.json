  "text": "This is a thought I've been turning to a lot lately that has helped me out and maybe it can make some other people feel a bit better. Or maybe I'm just screaming into the void, not sure. A lot of times it's easy to feel unmotivated, especially during this pandemic and quarantine. Isolation, working from home, economic uncertainty, death..sometimes these things make feeling motivated and okay very difficult. The difficulty in motivating yourself can make you judge yourself for being \"stupid\", \"lazy\", or \"worthless\". Especially for perfectionists (like me; it's not a good trait). In these times I've found it helps to remember:\n\n**YOUR VALUE IS NOT BASED ON YOUR PRODUCTIVITY!!**\n\nEven though some people may make you feel like it is, including those people with \"perfect\" lives on Facebook who workout by fighting sharks at 3 am every morning or the thousands of blogs teaching how to optimize every aspect of your life. Or your own negative thoughts. No matter how \"lazy\" you apparently are, this does not change things. It doesn't matter how many attempts and failures at getting work done you have. You are valuable. Until you remember this, you won't regain peace with yourself and motivation, no matter how many motivational speeches you watch on YouTube. Be kind to yourself and start with the smallest possible goals and tasks.\n\nI half wrote this for myself but I hope it can be a good reminder to someone else.",

I used to have no self-esteem as a kid growing up, and it wasn't until I entered the workforce and earned respect from my employers and coworkers for being a hard worker that I started to believe I had value to add to this world.  Without a strong sense of self-worth, I operate like a bottomless pit of approval and validation seeking behavior.",

I know it's so hard, but you literally just have to realize people don't give a fuck about you (in a good way). They're too busy worrying about themselves. It's said so many times, but it's still true. When have you really ever sat there and did the Mr. Burns fingers, cackling about how someone you know is such a fuck up? Try just letting go of the care some time. Just try faking it. What's the worst that will happen? Literally nothing. Then you'll start to not only logically understand it, but understand it emotionally. It takes practice, like exposure therapy, but it will come. Some of it already has when you mention the respect from your employers and coworkers. Well, now you just need to take it the next step to its logical conclusion, which is instead of relying on that respect from your coworkers, you have to generate it yourself.",

For me, that *is* a productive day, for me, these things are valuable and worth it.\n\nIs doing them the most optimal way to get that shiny and world-changing research done? No, but why should you worry about that? There are, I hope, more important things out there for you, like your pets, friends, family, and hobbies.\n\nYour value is up to you, and what you value. Truth be told, nobody else cares.\n\nYet, publishing that shiny research could very well be the thing that you value the most, maybe you see it as wanting to leave an impact on the world. A majority of those in grad school here think like this (survivorship bias from being in grad school and in Reddit), they will probably tell you to go back to work. But if you value other things more, then go do that.",

          "text": "Yeah, exactly. You are correct, the definition is important. I more so mean being productive for just for the sake of it, maybe there's a better word I could have used. I'm assuming a lot of people who make it to grad school are perfectionists to some degree, so we judge ourselves harshly for anything less than perfection. If you are being productive by doing what you described then that's great. But we should eliminate absolutely any judgement of our productivity or output, because otherwise it's easy to get in a negative spiral.\n\nThis involves reevaluating what we consider to actually be a positive and productive force in our lives and focusing on the things that are easy and make our body feel good (like what you mentioned). From there we can build a work ethic based on doing things we enjoy and that feel good, instead of being based on our absolute output. This lets us start small without judgment to build healthy habits and momentum. For example, maybe instead of judging ourselves for not reading multiple papers everyday (and then procrastinating), define being productive as reading 1 or less and quit judging ourselves so harshly. Then build from there.\n\nThis definitely only applies to some people, but I feel like this mindset of value = output is very common in today's society (e.g. looking down on homeless people). As well, even more common in fellow graduate students.",

The difficult philosophical question is what else do we base our self worth on? I'm still working on that. At minimum, I think it's generally best to think of it as an intrinsic part of being human. If you love and are loved, then you know you have some worth. That's only one way though. If you are kind to people, I think that gives you some more.",

My parents (and me, too) worked in factories and factory farms. My mother developed a respiratory illness due to harsh chemical exposure. She became disabled from it and now works at Hobby Lobby, I think? There wasn\u2019t much work available in my community that offered benefits - just nursing (if you could afford school) and the factory, really. Most people were/are farmers. \n\nLiving check to check is hard work. Everyone in my family works (physically & emotionally) harder than anyone else I know because they had to to survive. I worked harder in high school and in college than I ever have in grad school - always had 2-3 jobs at a time to make ends meet. My health was terrible because I had to choose between skipping doctor visits or meals or whatever else, or I just never had the time to focus on my health. Sometimes I would buy a pack of smokes for the week because nicotine is an appetite suppressant and it was cheaper than paying for meals. There were a lot of nights I\u2019d just buckle and freeze &/or cry from the exhaustion and stress of it all. \n\nIt\u2019s not a contest, though. I work \u201chard\u201d in grad school in other ways. It\u2019s \u201chard\u201d intellectual work. But not living check to check is a lot less hard on my body/mind because I\u2019m not making basic survival \u201cchoices\u201d day to day anymore. \n\nAll that said, this seems like derailing, though. My point was about guilt, and the weird ways we deal with it. I don\u2019t want to argue with you about whether being poor is hard work or isn\u2019t. But from what it sounds like, the situation you described is not representative of what poverty is like for most people. I actually thought about it for like 10 minutes - I know zero people from back home in a low income bracket who have the benefits and work/life balance you describe. You\u2019re either missing something here, or you\u2019re not being 100% honest.",

Healthcare is already taken care of, the cost of education is 5000$ a year + living expenses (so no need for 3 jobs - student loans cover that), and far more jobs are unionized. \n\nI agree, it very well depends what you mean by poor. My mother makes half the median income in her area, a few dollars over minimum wage now that it's increased to 15$/hour - I consider \"barely above minimum wage\" to be pretty poor. Yet, she works 40 hours a week in a unionized job. When her position was eliminated a few years back, she was guaranteed another job within the same organization at the same skill level by seniority level. She ended up picking one that paid 2$ less an hour because it was less stressful, when she had that choice.\n\nPlenty of my friends and family have made that choice, over and over and over again. Between two options, one that pays more but requires increased responsability/productivity/moving to another area/giving something up, or one that lets them enjoy life more, they have picked the latter.\n\nIn contrast, I have 480 hours of accumulated vacation I haven't taken because my research projects just pile up if I use them. I've had to move every couple of years from university to university throughout degrees/early careers, with no friends and family in my new cities. I'm stuck on the US side on a pandemic and the border is closed, so I haven't seen my family in more than a year. My work hours are flexible, but they typically exceed 40 hours a week. I make good money now that I've been faculty for a few years, but for a long while I was making below the minimum wage/poverty line in Canada, and I had to live very cheaply. \n\nIf your definition of poverty is \"works at minimum wage in the US\", then yes, we've had very different experiences.",

Or -- maybe even more commonly -- issues like poor planning/prioritization can definitely cause people to spiral into depression and anxiety. This can be frustrating to witness because those are all skills you can get better at! For example, learning how to set and achieve goals is a skill in and of itself, but if you write off any dips in output as \"mental health struggles\" instead of even considering the dips as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement, I would argue that you are likely to go through life feeling frustrated and somewhat unfulfilled.

Here are some thoughts this convo sparked as well:\n\nTrying and being forced to fail over and over (for whatever reason) can eventually break something in you, especially if you have no allies paired with negative self-talk. This is where having had a supportive parent who believed in you at any point can give you inner strength.\n\nPeople don't have goals if they don't have a concept of a light at the end of the tunnel. You have to be able to conceive of success for yourself before it seems efficient on a visceral level to throw your scarce mental, and emotional and physical resources towards it. People believe in what they've personally experienced.\n\nOn the other hand, trying over and over, and then finally getting a break can give a drive to not waste the opportunity like no other. \n\nIt's hard to know how much we can take blame/credit for what we think we can do, and therefore how hard we try, and how much of that is circumstantial. But if we do get there, we should know that we can make a difference in other people's perceptions of what they can accomplish - just as other people have done for us - and pay it forward.",

I was responding to this bit: \n\n>most people [...] want to participate and add to society\n\nSome people are utterly unmotivated in participating and improving society. You don't have to go far looking for one - many people are advertising it. \"I don't care if wearing a mask saves lives, it's my right not to wear one, damn everyone else\" is not a popular sentiment, but I've seen it more than once.\n\nProductivity and altruism / civic engagement are two distinct concepts. In the above example, someone is not productive by wearing a mask. But they are \"participating and adding to society\".\n\nLikewise, a scam artist who makes elaborate forgeries can be very productive without \"adding to society\", it's just two things that have nothing to do with each other.",

It lies more on what do you define as work.\n\nFrom your question, do you work because you like what you are doing without any bigger reason? I do, I love and enjoy my work, I would do it even if I had to pay to do it, but it still is work.",

When I'm frustrated or just not feeling it a certain day, I often still have to work. If I wake up on a work day and think, wow I'd rather bake a pie but I have a work meeting to go to, I still go to the meeting. If I wake up and I'd planned to bake a pie, I skip it because it's not work - it's  100% for me and my enjoyment. You need some moments in life like that.",
