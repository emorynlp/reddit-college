  "text": "I just need to brag a little bit because I rarely get to. Yesterday, I found out that I won a national scholarship worth $60,000! I'm a first year neuroscience PhD student, and in my Master's, I wasn't able to apply for this scholarship because my undergrad grades were too low. I became to think of myself as a failure. It still hasn't sunk in that I got this. My work paid off!",
