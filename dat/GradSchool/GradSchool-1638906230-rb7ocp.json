      "text": "I can relate. I haven't been picked to pieces, but I have received feedback that has left me confused and puzzled.\n\nSenior academics and people who have had careers outside of academia, I'd be interested in your thoughts on this:\nI work at a university and am also a part time MA student at a different one. One of the things that took me a long time to get used to in my current job, where I write a lot of stuff (popular dissemination and other texts from the institute to a broader audience) in collaboration with the researchers or on behalf of the institute, was the \"never really good enough / never really finished\" approach to any written work. Or the practice of suggesting alternative arguments in the comments of the document, which would have caused a massive edit and rewrite - when I thought we were close to publishing. \n\nI'm a professional writer with 12 years experience when I came to the academic world, and I'm used to a process where done means done. \"Good enough? Ok let's get this out. \"\n\nI of course experience the same in my MA. I may deliver a paper that is well argued and well written (I have received good grades overall), and of course just within the required length. Then the professor would \"suggest\" something that makes me think - since I'm the student - that my paper is somehow incomplete without. But that would also make the paper into a different thing altogether, ruin my neatly constructed string of arguments, and/or require I cut out some of the stuff that's already there, due to length issues.\n\nI have gradually learned that this must be some academic \"habit\". I think a lot of academics feel like they've failed if they don't give feedback or criticism, whereas I come from a culture where it's more like \"yep, looks good, done.\"\n\nI value this, but sometimes the context is so different for the writer. Whether it is a non academic colleague who just needs a quality control to make sure the text has no errors etc, or the student who just needs to know that the paper is OK now.\n\nIn the long run, this of course fosters critical thinking, ownership of your work, confidence, independence etc, as you have to at some point say that no, I disagree, and this is actually good enough. I got an A on a paper where I ignored all those extra suggestions, due to lack of time. That was a bit of an eye opener.\n\nAt work, I've taken to argue against those suggestions that I find unnecessary, and I was surprised when the feedback usually was \"yes, no problem, just a thought\". A thought that could have led to a couple of days extra work! It's hard to distinguish between what's \"just a thought\" and \"this absolutely needs editing\"!\n\nI think this aspect of academia is fascinating.",

      "text": "Lots of great points in the comments, but here are some other things that others haven't brought up. \n\n1.) At the PhD level, the standard is where the current science is -- so student motivation is irrelevant to the professor for that standard. It's an extra thing that some profs work at or don't, if they don't have the time or the interpersonal skill set. They are recruited for their research chops/publication outcomes, and sometimes if there are significant problems in a piece, there are few ways to break that to a student in a way that \"enhances their motivation.\" \n\nAt the PhD level, students must provide their own motivation and not rely on supervisors. This is the standard for the admissions process, actually -- programs are less interested in students' interests and more focused on their ability to conduct a research program at the disciplinary level. This means a deep and pervasive source of intrinsic motivation that does not require vast amounts of external cheerleading. PIs/supervisors/advisors can encourage and try to build fire-walls around their students, but at the end of the day, the advancement in research comes through many many failures and the researcher's tenacity in not being deterred by those failures. \n\nIt really really sucks, but this fact is not designed by supervisors and it's inappropriate to blame them for the larger academic structure. For those coming directly from undergrad, this transition can be problematic, even for those student who had a sense of what they were getting into. The job description for the PI or the dissertation supervisor does not include motivating students and there's little in their other tasks -- getting students ready to be researchers at the discipline level -- that incentivize them to build motivation. The publication review system does not care about individuals' self-motivation. \n\n2.) Reviewers and faculty members, when reading potential publications, read based on its gaps -- gaps in the literature, the research design, the approach, empirics, and conclusion. If you've been working with your PI to draft a paper, there's only so much they can advise upon, because until the paper is fully complete and polished, its gaps are not as evident. So if you're working on a draft with a supervisor, it would help with morale/efficiency if you put together a full draft of a manuscript/project that you then dismantle and build back up. Working on a draft piecemeal (not sure you did that, but it reads that way) only means that you delay the big read, which is the close-read/gap check. This can take HOURS to do properly -- like a full workday for a 10,000-15,000 word document -- and so will take your PI a while to have the time for. So better to produce full drafts for your PI rather than to work on them piecemeal. The chunks should be full articles or papers, or full chapters of the diss where the gaps can be discerned. \n\nTL/DR -- The supervisor task is much harder than any student imagines. Many can be abusive, but many are actually doing what they are supposed to do. Enhancing your motivation is not on the to-do list -- this may suck, but it does reflect the industry and what your experience will be as a researcher. Nothing is ever good enough at the disciplinary level. We are all failures -- we just fail at different rates.",

Faculty have an enormous amount of work to get done, and rarely have time to deeply review partial drafts.  I usually ask the student to give me a completed draft before I'll even look at it, though I make an exception for students who have problems with their writing and need help in the planning stages.  \n\nAs for the criticism, reviewers are less kind than your advisor.  Don't take criticism personally.  The goal is to get a quality paper out, and that requires putting egos aside and looking at things honestly.  If you have factual errors in your paper, which you wrote about work you yourself did, then that's a big warning flag.  I'm not sure how you can successfully complete a project and interpret results that you didn't completely understand.  Or at least that would be true in a STEM field.",

My PI, for fucking once, sent it back with minimal edits and an overall positive impression.
