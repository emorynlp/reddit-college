  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a current master's student in chemistry but just applied to upgrade to a PhD student. My PI is having me apply for the NSF-GRFP. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed here.\n\nIs there anyone here who has applied and/or won this fellowship who would be kind enough to PM me and give my personal statement a read? I've gotten it down to 3 and a quarter pages and I just don't know where to cut anymore to get it to just 3 pages. I really need some fresh eyes on it!\n\nI'd also love any tips about applying to this particular fellowship. From what I've read its kind of a crapshoot, but I really want to make my app the best it can be anyway.\n\nAlso, my broader impacts are weak. I worked as an EMT all through undergrad and was on the frontlines of COVID- but that isn't exactly volunteering or directly research related. Plus my last year of undergrad was effed due to COVID, so there was really not much I could do in terms of that- you know, quarantine etc. I wrote about how I plan to start a vaccine outreach program, but its not a tangible thing yet. So how can I spin this?\n\nThank you!",

It's a very frustrating rule but if I remember correctly it could be an automatic disqualification. If you're saying that you're advancing to candidacy that's a different situation.",

Basically it is an overview of the next paragraphs and explains to the reader that this statement justifies why you are the best candidate to execute this proposal. \n\nThe next three to four paragraphs discuss each professional experience and some key skill that you learned that will be essential for your proposal. You should also highlight any outcome in each paragraph like a paper or presentation. \n\nThe final paragraph reviews the previous paragraphs and reiterates the intro in reverse. The final paragraph connects the outcome of the proposed research to broader impacts and also explains how the nsf grfp will advance your professional career.",

              "text": "Just to give some weight to my advice I have helped 7 people apply and 5 have won this fellowship. It\u2019s extremely important that your personal statement frame your proposal and basically sound like everything you have done so far has prepared you to this point. I see you are not getting this advice in some of the other suggestions. I really can\u2019t stress this enough. The proposal is a problem that impacts people, your idea to solve it, and the experimental design you will use to test your idea. The personal statement is a summary of your qualifications to execute the work. And their are other key element you need to weave in there. But this big picture is how your application should hang together. Your letters should relate to those past experiences and justify why you are an outstanding candidate. \n\nThe next piece of advice is up to your discretion. But in my experience it is true. I often suggest to my applicants that they should communicate to their letter writers that government applications tend to have a superlative rubric. Outstanding, excellent, good, average, poor. Which is a scale 5-1. The highest being 5 and outstanding. So they should be careful about what superlatives they use.",

Really work on beefing that part up if it feels weak to you now. Lots of things can be considered broader impacts, so get a bit creative. And being an EMT/dealing with medicine isn\u2019t unrelated to science. Try to connect your research with your EMT work somehow, or at least make connections between the skills.",

I was kind of prevented from doing too much outreach due to quarantine, especially since me as an EMT was a walking petri dish of COVID. I definitely highlighted that in my personal statement as well as my experiences on the frontlines of COVID-19. I also highlighted a plan to  form a COVID vaccine outreach program in the future in poorer neighborhoods in connection with my EMT work. \n\nI'm hoping that these circumstances will be enough to overlook that part and I have a very hefty sob story that will also hopefully gain some points.",
