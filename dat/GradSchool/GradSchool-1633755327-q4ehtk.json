  "title:": "Failed the first part of my midterm",
  "text": "First semester of a Masters in Environmental and Global Health - One Health concentration. I failed horribly the first part of my Epidemiology midterm, 25/50. The second part is a written part cost 30 points. I haven\u2019t submitted the second part cause I want it to be perfect and I can\u2019t stop crying. According to the syllabus exams cost 40%, 10% each part, 2 exams. My grade on that class went from 100% to 72%. \nI\u2019ve been wanting to do research but my advisor told me it depends on my grades for him to say it\u2019s okay to start doing research on the second semester. I also want to pursue a PhD on the same department and university. \nShould I kiss my chances of a good grade goodbye and my chances of research and PhD track?",
