  "text": "I'm in my first semester of grad school (for clinical mental health counseling), and I think I've identified my biggest struggle so far, which I imagine can apply to any program. I hate how, on some of my off days, I can't bring myself to be productive and just lack energy and focus. At the same time, I feel tense and worried and can't fully relax. Super frustrating!",

I realized that studying with my friends (who are in other grad programs) on zoom helps me alleviate my stress as we tend to devote a few minutes for venting and complaining about the workload before kicking off, I think this might work out for you.",
