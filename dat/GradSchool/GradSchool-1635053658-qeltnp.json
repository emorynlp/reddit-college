  "title:": "Worried I'll fail in my first semester",
  "text": "I'm just a few months into my PhD program and I'm scared one class is going to derail my life. After an abysmal midterm, I'm sitting at ~50% for the class and, if the syllabus is to be believed, that's a solid F. If I fail the course, it'd bring my GPA down below the required 3.0 average and my funding would get pulled. To make matters worse, this class is directly related to my research and is taught by my advisor otherwise I would have dropped it weeks ago. \n\nWhat's so frustrating is that I'm doing really well in my other classes, but it doesn't matter because this one class seems to be on track to screw up everything.",

      "text": "Talk to your advisor but I strongly recommend you drop the class (or withdraw) and retake it another semester. I had to do this once, I was going to fail and when I retook the class, I got an A. \n\nreasoning: 1) this is an important class directly related to your research, therefore, by retaking it, you can have time to study the base concepts so you're better prepared when you retake it. 2) gives you more time to focus on other classes and therefore do even better.",
