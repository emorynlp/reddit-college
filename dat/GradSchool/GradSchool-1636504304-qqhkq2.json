What are your your thoughts on the academia/research v entrepreneurship route. Have you guys ever been conflicted in the path to take your ideas?",

Taking the entrepreneurship route is more than just coming up with ideas. There\u2019s a lot more business/management/actually running day to day operations-type of tasks involved. From my experience (my cousin was the ideas guy, I did operations), you\u2019ll need to know a bit of everything, and you\u2019ll need a solid team. Even then, not all startups end up becoming successful (you\u2019d have to be like a unicorn). We dissolved ours after running out of steam.",
