  "title:": "My final defense is Tuesday. I keep yo-yoing in-between okay and terrified. Advice?",
  "text": "I've made it. Its time for the final bow. And I am both numb and terrified. \n\nI know I know my work, but I am still scared of public speaking even after multiple talks and defenses. I thought this one would be easy but even after practicing you can hear the nervousness in my voice. I don't know if it's just a public speaking fear or more the fear of getting asked something that I'll blank on or a basic thing I forgot about, but I'm struggling here. I know my committee isn't a super tough one, but I don't want to look dumb in front of them and have them reconsider this (I have passed my data defense and have a job lined up so the possibility is low but never nothing). I just don't want to disappoint them. Any advice would be appreciated while I continue to panic procrastinate and decorate animal crossing houses. \n\nThank you (and for those of you writing may the writing gods bless you like they did me with 5 all nighters and 150 pages)!",

      "text": "Unless your advisor is a monster, they wouldn't let you schedule your defense if they didn't already think you'd nail it.\n\nI defended six weeks ago, so I'm on the other side of this with a little fresh clarity and all I can say is to feel your feelings, then go over your presentation again.  Practice the words you'll say over and over.  It will make you feel kind of numb to the words, but that's okay.\n\nThe defense should be ceremonial.  Amy advisor letting their students get all the way to the endpoint without that being the case has failed in their duties, and that ain't on you.\n\nTake a breath.  Take a nap.  Grab a snack and a coffee or tea or water. Walk around your space for a few minutes.  Then practice again.\n\nYou'll be fine.  Nobody knows your work quite like you.",

It happened at my institution while I was working on my PhD (and I've heard about it happening at other places). \n\nWhere the student kept pushing for the defense, and was not implementing the feedback they were getting on their dissertation drafts. Finally, the committee just gave up on them and let the student schedule the defense. The student failed.\n\nBut that is a rarity.",

By the time you\u2019ve written some articles and shown your committee enough to where they think you\u2019re ready to defend before your next meeting, it\u2019s just a matter of jumping through the hoops and checking off the boxes.",
