Nobody on Reddit will be able to give an actual answer. \n\nJust tell them you are starting grad school, tell em how much you'll make (if anything) and ask about defferment AND forbearance. I don't remember which is which, but even if you don't have to pay them for a while, you don't want loans sitting their and compounding interest. \n\nGood luck!",
