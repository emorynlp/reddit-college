  "text": "Part of my fellowship requires me to teach for two years. As a humanities student, this is a part of my education I enjoy but I know I\u2019m not paid enough for. My program is ranked 2nd in the US but we still make under $25k/year with our fellowships. The college town I\u2019m in is expensive and I can\u2019t afford to live alone, let alone save much money. All students in my department get the same 5 years of funding. \n\nAs cohorts shrink in response to the pandemic (and the ever shrinking job market), my union will be negotiating a new contact this upcoming term. I have a feeling that despite the dwindling amount of grad students that our pay might raise marginally but not nearly enough to cover the increase in time, effort, and thought needed to do this work. I think the undergrad enrollment has increased over the last year.\n\nI\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t just happening at my institution but I\u2019m hoping that grad students around the country strike for better pay and working conditions. I\u2019m so worn down (my students are too) and I feel like I\u2019m an adult who can\u2019t get ahead because of grad school. I don\u2019t know I can afford to live on this poverty salary for another 3.5 years. It feels like it\u2019s holding me back more than preparing me to enter my field. \n\nWe had a strike last year but we made little headway. Regardless, I feel like the more grad unions that strike to demand better pay, safe working conditions, and other necessities may have a greater impact than each school individually. Are any other unions/grad students in a similar position? Or have heard rumblings of greater action?",

They\u2019re claiming that those funds are \u201cnot dependent on the performance of duties at the direction or control of the University or any other service rendered to the University.\u201d \n\nWhich is really fucking funny because I\u2019m a trainee, which means I\u2019m on a fellowship that\u2019s managed by the university.  I literally have work requirements by the university in the terms of the fellowship, including quarterly reporting requirements. They require me to make consistent progress toward my degree. \n\nThey also have said that the work trainees and fellows are doing are for their own academic interests and not directed by the UC\u2026tell my advisor that. Like if that\u2019s the sentiment then cool, I\u2019ll stop doing my required work and point to their statements. And when it comes to dissertation time I guess the university won\u2019t have any rights to my intellectual property. \n\nIt\u2019s certainly not as if me being a trainee means I don\u2019t need protection from harassment and a cost of living adjustment, those things only happen to GSRs",

They\u2019re supposed to follow the bargaining surveys, and it could be that majority support prioritized other things. But that\u2019s a shame because obviously some areas might not be seen as a problem to everyone, but for those who have the problem it\u2019s really huge to them. Students of color easily see the need to reduce police presence on campus, but I guess since they\u2019re a smaller portion of the student population their voice can be filtered out by majority. Same with student parents - they definitely need more support but the majority of students aren\u2019t parents and aren\u2019t going to prioritize that in the bargaining survey. They should weight some of the survey sections differently because of that, or at least make sure proper voice is given to all the issues so people can vote with more empathy. I usually vote for reduced police presence on my bargaining surveys because while I\u2019m not gonna be racially targeted, I would be fucking disgusted to see something happen on our campus, and I don\u2019t want anyone to feel unsafe. It\u2019s bad enough seeing the policing living in Oakland.",

Colleges get away with paying dirt because they have hundreds of student workers doing the work of admin people and researchers but paying minimum wage and offering no benefits in the name of \"experience.\" Striking for a week demonstrates your value. Look to the John Deere workers. They went on strike, rejected the first paltry offer, rejected the second slightly less paltry offer, stayed on strike for over a month (2 months? I forget exactly how long) and finally got a good contract at offer 3. \n\nI'm glad your school at least has a union. Now go prove it has teeth.",

Individual grad programs might have their own. Find out what they are paying grad students, and what the expectations are. \n\nIf your school is ranked #2, someone is going to care a lot about the ability to recruit and retain top students. If #3 is paying more, you have a really strong case.",

The university (or any employer) has no reason to move towards your side on any issue without the threat of a work stoppage or a major concession in another area. Universities are under no compulsion to make a logically-coherent argument or to justify things like making outside comparisons in one area but refusing to do it in another area to meet the extremely generous (to employers) definition of \"good faith bargaining\" in the US.\n\nQuick and easy negotiations are often a sign that union leadership and management are too cozy, and usually result in suboptimal contracts that don't deliver on membership goals. Fighting unions pack bargaining rooms with members to intimidate management, conduct slowdowns or sickouts during negotiations, take strike authorization votes, and increase the pressure to win major concessions, even if it means withholding labor. I'll take a well-organized rank-and-file union with member-negotiators over a docile union lead by a professional staff negotiator any day.",

However, neglecting the talents of good ones means you are missing.

I think interning during grad school is a better option depending on how much of a social life you are fine losing. \n\nI was paid about twice as much from being an intern while working 3/4 days a week than students in my cohert. I'd have to go to work then head to school, totaling up to 18 hour days somedays to finish my research. Weekends were at the lab in the morning until afternoon. It really sucked but I could at least afford to buy lunch if I wanted to without stressing. \n\nUniversities are built on the backs of graduate students and will continue to do so until they can't. I agree that striking is good but would many of the students leave their programs for good if they didn't concede? No.",
