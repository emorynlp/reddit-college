  "text": "I'm considering applying for a master's in physiotherapy after being away from university and in the working world for the last 9 years. \n\nOne thing I'm factoring in is the total debt I would have to take on in order to complete the program. By the sounds of it, I won't have much time to work on the side. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? What did you do to overcome or at least minimize the damage?\n\nEdit: I'm Canadian applying for Canadian Schools",
