Then you come out to the real world and nobody cares that you can memorize obscure religious texts and sleep on the floor, suddenly these highly-valued characteristics mean even less to the average person than your ability to juggle or ride a unicycle.\n\nGrad school is similar. Does the person ringing up your groceries care how many papers you've written? Does the bank deciding whether or not to give you a loan care whether you spend your evenings and weekends in the lab? Does the non-PhD you meet and date evaluate your potential as a partner based on how high-quality/prestigious the journals you publish in are?\n\nThings that really matter are things that matter to everyone. Are you a nice person? Are you honest? Are you helpful to others around you? Do you have a good sense of humor and not take yourself too seriously?\n\nEven if you fall short on some of the PhD-specific metrics, if you're doing OK on the big global important ones you're a good person leading a good life. Lack of publications could be a temporary problem that will eventually be corrected, or a sign of not being suited to this line of work, but it only tells you about you as an academic, not about you as a person.",

A productive, successful criminal clearly has a detrimental effect on society despite being quite productive in their affairs and would probably most often be understood to have a very negative worth to society. To be even more extreme, Hitler was also very productive yet has clearly negative worth.  \n  \nEven so, it is still true that Hitler's worth was directly tied to his productivity, in the sense that were he less productive than he was, he would have had much less negative worth to society! (or even had he been more productive in his artwork, it's even possible his worth would have been positive...?)  \n  \nWhat I am trying to get at is that yes, productivity alone is not very good at increasing your worth, but it certainly plays a role, at least in the utility that one provides to society. My opinion is that this utility we provide to society is a linear combination of some sort of vector or matrix which defines the directions of our belief system and personal values, and a vector of productivity, which defines how... productive we are in pursuing each of those affairs.",

Is a criminal less worthy of being human than the judge who sentences him, and so on. \n\nBeneath all that, there is the question of origin. Is a criminal a criminal because he wanted to be one? If I put two people in identical circumstances from birth will they behave intrinsically differently? If so, what creates this difference?
