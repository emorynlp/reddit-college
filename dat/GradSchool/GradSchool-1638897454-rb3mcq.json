  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI saw a post recently encouraging us graduate students to advocate for higher pay on a national level. I agree that we're underpaid. As adults, we're watching our peers hit their strides in their careers, starting families, buying their first homes, and we're... still writing papers, giving talks, playing with beakers, what have you. It's difficult, this journey demands sacrifices. \n\nAlthough I agree we're underpaid, I agreed to do the work that I do at the pay rate that I'm at. I agreed to it. You did too. I think that's because it's clear to us, at some level, that we're getting paid in other ways besides money. Clout is one. I get a very small, but positive reaction when I tell people I'm in graduate school. I get to be more picky when choosing romantic partners. Respect. People listen to us when we have an opinion without much pushback. It's assumed that we're to be taken seriously from the jump because of our accomplishments. Autonomy is another.  I'm not clocking in anywhere. At least in my lab, if we don't show up, no one would notice or care. I can work from home anytime I want, within reason. This is what makes graduate school worth it for me.\n\nWhat makes graduate school worth it for you?",

      "text": "Your post history confuses me. Are you actually a graduate student?\n\nI've found that virtually nobody cares at all about what I do as a graduate student. It's quite rare they ask anything about my research. I'm cool with that, but know that, generally, you are the only person who cares about what you do. You're in this for the wrong reason if you're chasing prestige. I tend not to raise the subject because I've actually seen others get depressed about their personal circumstances during the conversation. \n\nWe did all agree to the stipends we receive, and our tuition is expensive. I'm in total agreement there with you. For many fields, mine included, a graduate degree provides negative ROI. But it's a way to open up career opportunities that I think are much more interesting.",

          "text": "Thanks for snooping through my post history.\n\nI took two years after undergrad to do a post-bacc. I just applied for programs for the Fall 2022 academic year. Right now I'm supported by a stipend that a graduate student would normally have, I'm taking graduate classes, and I'm writing a final paper about my research that's due to the department by this Friday. Besides, all of my friends are graduate students. That's my relation to graduate school right now.\nup. \n\nI'm not expecting anyone to care about our research besides a very niche community of professionals. You might even argue that's a reason to pay us less. Besides, I didn't mean clout as in prestige. I meant clout as in having a one-up. \n\nI think it's interesting that you believe pursuing a graduate degree is a negative ROI. If you truly believe that, and presumably everyone does what's in their best interest, then what keeps you in grad school?",

              "text": "> Thanks for snooping through my post history.\n\n\nNo need to be defensive. I did so to understand your motivations for the post and to ascribe more context to it. Some of your verbiage and perspectives on graduate research suggest you'd be early in your studies; I think attitude and maturity change dramatically in most graduate students as they enter their final years. I didn't downvote your reply, too. \n\n\n> I'm not expecting anyone to care about our research besides a very niche community of professionals. You might even argue that's a reason to pay us less. Besides, I didn't mean clout as in prestige. I meant clout as in having a one-up.\n\n\nI'll concede that there is a small proportion of people, mostly older adults, that have viewed my status as a graduate student with (undeserved) respect. Your experience just contrasts with mine in the general case. We're all speaking anecdotally, of course. \n\n\nIt's a great thing to value what we do day to day. I caution that placing too much pride and self-measure in your work is a dangerous thing as a graduate student. You didn't state these things overtly, but I think the thoughts you expressed are suggestive of them. There will be a time when your experiments do not work, or your results are disappointing, or you have conflicts with your advisor. You may even (in decent probability) consider leaving your program. You may also see others succeed wildly while you do not -- after all, by definition, only a select few can live that experience. How will you feel when these things happen? Preparing for these eventualities will make your life much easier. It may seem like I'm reading too much into your post, but it set these alarm bells off for me. Please consider all of this as you start your experience in graduate school. \n\n\n> I think it's interesting that you believe pursuing a graduate degree is a negative ROI. If you truly believe that, and presumably everyone does what's in their best interest, then what keeps you in grad school?\n\n\nMainly what I mentioned in the last sentence of my response. The most technical and research-intensive positions are often reserved for PhDs, be it in industry or academia. My biological research focus has allowed me to completely change what I'd be doing in the absence of my graduate training. I'm actually quite happy as a graduate student, so do not think my critiques arise from disillusionment! Good luck on your applications.",

      "text": "All the reasons you mentioned are why people sign up to do a PhD and agree to the low pay. Eventually most people realize that the reasons you mentioned are false and this is why  grad students are bitter and should rightfully demand more pay. \n\nYou should feel fortunate if your graduate school gives you respect, autonomy, and a more interesting social circle. In reality most grad students get the exact opposite. You can't write a contract requesting more respect and autonomy but you can bargain for a contract asking for a wage that compensates you for the lack of it.",

          "text": "If someone finds their job too taxing to be worth the pay, I really hope they would find somewhere they feel appreciated and doing something that they're passionate about. I would say that to anyone in any field, not just graduate students. Most people spend half of their day working, it's not something you can slog through day after day and think it won't bleed into your personal life. \n\nI don't agree that writing a contract requesting a higher stipend to compensate for the lack of non-tangible benefits you receive from your position is persuasive. There's plenty of strings that could be pulled to justify a higher stipend. The difficulty of being replaced, working during off hours, no stipend during the summer months, mentoring students. At the very least, stipends should keep up with the cost of living. To be clear I'm not disagreeing that graduate students should be paid more, I'm only adorning your justification for the higher pay.",
