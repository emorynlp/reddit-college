  "text": "I don't know if this post with make sense here but I really need some advice. I have just graduated from university with a degree related to Languages. I loved my degree, it was very interesting but I don't know what to do with it like what jobs to apply for. The only \"concrete\" areas I know is translation or teaching and none of those two areas are for me. I applied for a Master's degree but I don't know whether I'll get in or not since there aren't many places left. I'm just feeling extremely loss and I don't really have no one around me to ask for advice. I'm fluent with four languages: my native language (i'm from an European country), English, French and Spanish.",

Being multi lingual will open many door even w/o a business degree. Apply for jobs even if you don\u2019t meet all of the qualifications. Most skills you are missing can be taught, your language skills are an asset! Do a search for bilingual jobs, apply. Amazon also has jobs for bilingual candidates. Let me know and I can send you a few. Don\u2019t be afraid to apply if you don\u2019t have all the qualifications. Barring a say 10 year experience qualification or the like your language skills put you in a good position.",

      "text": "It sounds like you lack any sort of real idea of what you want to do. This is a common problem both before and after undergrad (not so much during undergrad as students tend to just enjoy the \"here and now\" and not think about the future during their undergrad studies). With that being said, unless you an essentially finish this master's degree with very little cost to yourself, I would greatly suggest to not pursue the degree unless you can picture at least 1 path to a solid career after.\n\nInstead, go and work odd jobs and internships, explore what is out there in both fields related  to and not related to your degree, and make connections with people in these industries. Talk to the other students you graduated with and see what they are doing. You're only going to know what is possible when you see the larger picture.",
