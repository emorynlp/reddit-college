  "text": "In July, 2021 I left a grad school in northern Canada - a place I loved - to come home to the US because my teenage son had symptoms that were difficult to have checked out and treated there.  \n\nAs a single mom of two special needs teens, it took months to re-integrate ( we were in a bunch of temporary places before moving back into my house), setting up health care, seeing doctors, getting diagnostic tests, getting into a school, dealing with my tenant.  \n\n I received my M.A. thesis from examination in October, 2021.  I passed examination, had to fix several issues.  I sat down and started working on the issues as identified.  \n\nA week later, I received the epilepsy diagnosis from my son's neurologist. The diagnosis was shocking and took the wind out of my sails.  I then had to inform family and friends, there were more doctors appointments, there were issues with medications, etc.  Eventually, I had to stop drinking caffeine because I had developed gastric reflux from the stress and hectic lifestyle.  \n\nSo now I am uncaffeinated, still stressed from single parenting two kids one with epilepsy, and zero motivation to fix the issues that the examiners identified.  I am actively procrastinating. \n\nI need to finish this thesis so I can move on to looking for a job, which I desperately need. \n\n How do I get out of this slump? I usually motivated myself with large amounts of caffeine and while not ideal, it works.  Now the only crutch I had is gone.  \n\nI think I need some tough love as in \"you have been through a lot, but now you absolutely must rally again and finish that damn thesis.\"",

      "text": "Anything you do is better than nothing. You don\u2019t need to work on it for hours if you can\u2019t stomach it. Start by doing whatever you think will get you closer for 5 minutes a couple times throughout the day. If you can do more, good, if not, then try to get whatever you can done. When I get super demotivated, the hardest part for me is always feeling like there\u2019s so much that I need to figure out. But breaking it up to these short periods of time make everything feel so much simpler and achievable.",

          "text": "This is perennially good advice! I\u2019ve also gotten the advice to kind of \u201ctrick\u201d yourself into getting stuff done by doing a casual version of things\u2026 like saying, \u201cokay IF I was going to write a paragraph about this topic, what would I need to include?\u201d, \u201cIF I was citing this source, what would I say about it,\u201d etc., and taking these notes so that the writing gets half done already. This is helpful for me when the idea of writing or something is feeling intimidating, which is mostly why I procrastinate.\n\nETA: Good luck, OP!",

      "text": "Necessary disclaimer: The following is a ramble from a therapist-in-training and, as such, should be brought up with an actual licensed therapist to see if it works for you.\n\nIt already sounds like you've accomplished a lot and navigated many obstacles to get this far. You deserve to be lauded for that. Of course you don't currently have the motivation; many people wouldn't.\n\nThis may sound a bit semantic, but you don't need motivation. You need willingness.\n\nMotivation has several pitfalls, the greatest of which is it ebbs and flows.\n\nWillingness isn't easy either. It requires an examination of your values and how those values can translate to goals. It sounds like you want to finish this degree up so you can pursue other opportunities? Perhaps you value professional development? Or flexibility? The freedom that accompanies better pay? The ability to care for your loved ones (i.e., your children)? It helps to identify the underlying value(s) behind this goal. It helps you be willing to pursue the goal in a structured way.\n\nThis can sometimes turn into motivation, but usually you'll have to rely on scheduling more than a quick dose of intrinsic motivation. I have found that including time for me to be intimidated by big tasks as part of the schedule helps me stick to it. \n\nYou only have an hour a week, and you spent that hour simply reviewing your materials and getting your bearings? Great, that would've needed to happen anyway, and you're now one step closer.\n\nYou can do this.",
