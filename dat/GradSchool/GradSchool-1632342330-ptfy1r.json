  "text": "So I recently had my delayed graduation ceremony and met up with an old lecturer who supervised my dissertation. It was nice to see them but we sadly didn't get the chance to catch up.\n\nI was considering maybe sending them an email- do you think this is a good idea? I'm sure they'd love to keep in touch since they taught me for 3 years.\n\nSimilarly, there was another lecturer who sadly left and they helped me to apply for my post-grad degree and served as head of department for the duration of my degree.\n\nThe bottom line is- do lecturers appreciate hearing from former students? I'm in the UK by the way",
