  "text": "I\u2019m a senior bio major and I\u2019m pretty lost right now as to what career and type of program I absolutely want to go for (I\u2019m split between biochem and neuro). I have the general idea of continuing into industry after getting a degree as well as the general focus I should have within said programs to get there but I\u2019m both still unsure what I want and I\u2019m also just not sure if I\u2019d be considered to be prepared enough. \n\nDo I need to know or at least have a good idea of what my thesis will be? With neuro I\u2019d really like to work on neurodegenerative diseases, autism, etc. as well as drug development in that field but I don\u2019t know what research to do for that path. I\u2019ve got a good idea of what classes to take but not the research itself. The same goes for biochem where I\u2019m honestly even less sure what I want to do outside of general drug development and disease research. \n\nI\u2019m going to be talking to advisors and professors in the next couple days about this to get a better idea of what to do, I\u2019m just less embarrassed to ask here than with them.",

      "text": "Hey so just a thought, why not do both? There are many proteins/molecules involved in neuro and you could easily apply structural bio/biochem/drug design to those things. I'm actually in a lab that focuses on the biochem and structural biology of proteins involved in neurobio.\n\nAs far as preparedness, I think everyone is different. I worked in a lab during my BSc but definitely did not feel confident in my abilities before I applied to do a masters (which is why I chose to do my masters instead of applying directly to a PhD program). Though I have a broad sense of what I'd like to do further down the road, I do not yet have a set project or thesis and am still learning lab techniques (started a month ago). Some people I know published in undergrad. In the country that I'm from, it's not absolutely necessary to have a ton of experience. \n\nTo prepare yourself, I'd say look into labs to join in undergrad if you can, just to get a little experience and/or get a taste for one of the fields and see if you like it. This could also help you determine what exactly you want to do. I'd also suggest looking at potential supervisors/labs at schools you're thinking of applying to so you can see if any of their work interests you.",
