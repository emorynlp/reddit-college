  "text": "I definitely think my outlook changed a lot. I was very much into the idea of post docing and continuing an academic career at one point.\n\nNow that I went through academia, I realize how much this takes a toll. TBH, I still want a research career, but I'm only going to do a post doc in non academic areas(government labs, NASA etc). If not I'll just figure it out and go from there.\n\nI just can't bring myself to try and post doc in academia. My friend is going through it right now and it's tough on her. Not only that, but the reward is not great wages and more uncertainty too.",

By the end, I felt like I had neither the research nor teaching experience for anything other than the adjunct circuit, and that it would take years and years more of postdocs to get there. Pretty much everyone else in my class planned on going into industry right off the bat, which surprised me at first, but hey guess who is probably going to join them.",
