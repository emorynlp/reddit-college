People don\u2019t want to hire some one with an attitude or who may say the same thing about them in the future. Plus, if they know the person you wrote about (as they are in your same field) and respect them it could be an issue. I would think leaving a neutral comment that could be interpreted as positive by someone else is best. Plus don\u2019t write a scathing comment in a copy just for your viewing in any form that you could possibly end up sending my mistake instead of the one you want published.",
