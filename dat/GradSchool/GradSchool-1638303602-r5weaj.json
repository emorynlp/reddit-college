  "text": "Hello,\n\nI graduated with my BA 4 years ago and recently started a MA program in a social science while working full time in a decent paying job. It pays all my bills, allows me to save, go on trips etc. I have determined that my goal is to get a PhD since I love the research I have been doing and want to continue in this type of environment. \n\nI spoke with my advisor who told me the 3 common things phd committees look for are grades/research, university service and teaching experience. I want to be as competitive as I can possibly be when applying next fall so I am considering quitting my job and becoming a TA in the department. This would mean I would lose 90% of my income and would have to take out loans or drive for Uber to survive. Is it worth quitting my job to have a better resume? I currently teach hiring managers and lead meeting etc in my role. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciate.",

      "text": "In my honest opinion\u2026 no. If you already have a good job and can translate those skills to your field (for eg teaching your colleagues), I see that as way more valuable than TA. Unless you want to be a professor or to teach as your end goal? Otherwise, if you already have a job that\u2019s paying you through school and don\u2019t need to take out loans, I see no advantage to quit for a TA position. Of course let\u2019s strategically think about this. What kind of TA position is it? Are you lecturing or leading discussion sessions or are you just helping with grading homework and exams? Do you have enough professors on hand to write LORs for when you apply? Usually with TAship it is a way  to build connections with the professor who will then be able to speak on your behalf in the academic setting and also pay for things lol I guess what I\u2019m trying to get you to think about it is how will this TAship make you more competitive than you already are? Because if the pros don\u2019t outweigh the cons ie being in debt, then I would stay at your current job. Plus coming in with a masters is already setting the bar high for you. Just my two cents.",

      "text": "I also wouldn't suggest quitting your job.\n\nI think you can just spin your job to show you have obtained the skills necessary to succeed in a PhD program. I actually recently interviewed someone who worked in retail and they did a wonderful job relating their retail skills to the research position (importance of time management, working with the public, attention to detail, ability to receive feedback from managers, etc)\n\nOne compromise I might suggest is asking a professor if you can give a guest lecture in one of their classes. Then you can add it to the CV, and it's not a huge workload.",
