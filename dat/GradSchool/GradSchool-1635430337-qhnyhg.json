  "text": "So I applied to a mentorship placement put together with my department and a leading industry org. There was a training for potential mentors that I had to miss because of a family emergency. I informed them way before the web training started and asked if I could either watch the recording or attend a different training. \n\nIn the response from the coordinator, I learned the training was the same as one I did in March for a different placement and I can just watch the recording. \n\nWhat really annoyed me was the final line in the email. They stated: \n\u201cWe understand that family issues do arise, but throughout your mentoring, please ensure you are reliable and try not to let this sort of thing happen.\u201d\n\nAm I being silly or is it unreasonable to imply I\u2019m unreliable because I needed to assist my family in an emergency? I gave as much notice as possible, and I\u2019ve done the training before. Also, how am I supposed to \u201ctry not to let this sort of thing happen\u201d? I can\u2019t control emergencies! Am I supposed to tell my family they shouldn\u2019t even bother contacting me while in need because I might have a mentorship meeting that day? \nMy family is obviously the most important part of my life and I\u2019ll always put them before grad school or my career when needed, especially an emergency. \n\nI want to say something back about how unreasonable that is but also I know I\u2019m a little quick to react. So, am I over reacting? Is there a \u201cprofessional\u201d way to address this? \n\nThanks!!!",

So it would only apply to people for whom emergencies *seem* to pop up all the time. There are people like that, just so you know.\n\nI wouldn't take it personally.",

People don't have control over the health or lives of their family, so no person can possibly guarantee that they will never have a family death or medical emergency. \n\nIf it were me and I was able to, I would withdraw from this training citing the above email. I would thank them for their consideration and time, but that exchanges like this demonstrated that their values and mine do not align and wish them well. \n\nWe're still in a global pandemic, so this person is not only stupid, they're absolutely clueless. Bless their heart to heaven, because they're surely not getting there with their brain.",
