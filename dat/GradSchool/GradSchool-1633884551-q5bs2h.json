It doesn\u2019t need to do much, just download files off of data loggers, which will be offloaded when I get back to the lab.\n\niPad with waterproof/drop proof case? Rugged laptop? Anyone have experience or suggestions?\n\nBattery life and reliability are important.",

      "text": "Well, cheaper can bring peace of mind in that you don\u2019t have to worry about damaging and expensive laptop/tablet. I picked up a (gasp) cheap Amazon Fire Tab 10, side loaded google play store so I can run a terminal, Jupiter lab  in a browser, MS Office and other quality of life apps. Bought it in case my 2012 MB pro decides to die. Honestly it\u2019s excellent for the price, long battery life. What makes it even better is the case/keyboard they make for it, get a cheap Bluetooth mouse and your set with a cursor as well. I don\u2019t have to really worry about damage because it was cheap and the case it honestly quite sturdy. It\u2019s a perfect size too IMHO. USB-C helps for physical connections.
