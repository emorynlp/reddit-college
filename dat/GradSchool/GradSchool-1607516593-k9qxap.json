It honestly feels kind of unethical. You don't get the software dev skills to do traditional computer jobs, you don't do enough math to do the math pivot jobs, the actual market for chemical simulations in industry is pretty small while the field itself is large, and like you said, nobody in the history of ever has been hired because they know QM which is the only thing a computational chemistry PhD shows in a vacuum. I guess there are the handful of method dev jobs, but you can count the number of quantum chemistry packages that aren't run by academics on one hand more or less, so...",

I guess what ticks me off the most is since I already basically *paid* for a master's degree out of pocket, it doesn't make sense to master out a second time (note: faculty actually lied during orientation, leaving me and my cohort to pay tuition for 1.5 years... only to get funding for my LAST semester before defending and switching departments to the department my research was in). I knew academica could be scummy, but I wasn't aware people were downright liars. Honestly I make more teaching part time ESL, than I do from my graduate stipend. I will probably ditch academia for *something, anything else* with a decent pay grade. This was a terrible decision on my part and I just want others to know what could happen to them as well.",

It\u2019s not unheard of for CS postdocs working at big-5 companies to clear $200k, but academic postdoc pay a fair bit less.\n\nedit, [here\u2019s](https://www.salarylist.com/jobs/PostDoctoral-Fellow-Salary.htm) a website that gives the media US postdoc salary as $47k.\n\nedit 2, [this Nature piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00688-8) from 2019 gives the US median as $47.5k and the W. European median as \u20ac40,500 (= $49k), the E. European median as \u20ac15,600 ($19k), and the S. European median \u20ac18,000 ($22k), though I'd wonder how take-homes compare after taxes (or even better, after adjustment for ppp). The article also notes that \"contracts also ban 60% of postdocs across Europe from taking extra jobs. In southern Europe, 83% of postdocs\u2019 contracts contain the restriction\", which I know can be a nice source of extra income for lots of postdocs (e.g. my partner's postdoc / resident salary in around $70k, but she can easily make a few thousand extra per month through relief work, which pays $100-500 an hour depending on availability).",
