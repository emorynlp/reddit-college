  "text": "I am in my second year master but so far all the classes I took didn\u2019t give me the kind of satisfaction my undergrad upper-division classes offered. \nSo, when I was an undergrad, classes usually offer a lot of new insights and perspectives; I felt I learned a lot and progressed a lot through each class. But now I don\u2019t feel as excited about what i study, and i feel I am not enough for the material because I don\u2019t get as rich information from what I learn. Is this just a common feeling that would happen when one dive deep into a subject? How to tell which is the factor (the program/course or just a common grad school experience)? and is there a way to overcome it?\n\nFor reference, I am doing philosophy in the US",

      "text": "One of the things that helped me was thinking about where you are at in the learning process during grad school. As an undergrad, you are expected to learn what a field is and develop a basic understanding of how to operate within it. As a graduate student, you are now expected to be a general expert in your field and know most or all of the theories and practices. Your primary job is not to be learning new information, instead you are helping to make those incremental discoveries at the bounds of our knowledge on a specific topic. This is much harder and you are more likely to be stuck or need to struggle for longer with the material you are learning.",

      "text": "I think this is pretty normal because you've learned so much about the topic already and everything gets boring eventually. Working on a thesis about the same topic also gets boring after a while. If you still have to write papers for your classes, choose topics that you find really interesting if you can or find a way to look at things from another perspective. I had a similar experience in my program too. In undergrad we have more variety in what we study, so grad school material on one topic can get a bit repetitive.",
