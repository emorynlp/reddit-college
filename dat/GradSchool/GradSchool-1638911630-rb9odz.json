  "text": "I'm in the midst of finals week. I'm finishing up one last 15 page paper and project. Luckily, the project is taking form but I still have to write 10ish pages for my proposal. I'm so tired but I cut down my work hours this week so I can write more. Sunday I literally spent almost all day on my computer for 8 hours writing 10 pages of an academic paper that I was so intimidated to start. I had about 30+ pages to write for finals week, and I'm getting there!\n\nPer my letters of accommodation, I got extensions for some of my work this semester and I've managed to get As on pretty much everything. I had to sign up for at least 8 credit hours instead of doing part-time as I wanted to to get my tuition waiver and I had wondered from the start should I get a reduced course load accommodation which I did for next semester. I barely did my 10 credit hours but somehow I did. \n\nGoing to grad school, staying sober, working and having disabilities is really hard. But I have done it   \n somehow and well. I just need some positive vibes and some hype up playlists. Any music is good!",

      "text": "You can do it!\nI had my last one today and MY GOD what a term! Full time work, 3 kids, then my husband started commuting, so he's away 4 days a week, AND we had a freaking water leak just as finals were about to begin, so I have had builders and noise and a demolished kitchen and living area. And 15 kids in my youngest's class have come down with covid the last 3 weeks, so I have just been expecting it (by some miracle, she hasn't caught it yet. They're too young to get vaccinated).\nIn-freakin-sane.\nBut I did it, and if I survived this madness, so can you!\nI don't think I'll keep up my run of good grades. But honestly, I can't believe I battled through all that. \nGo go go! Write write write!",
