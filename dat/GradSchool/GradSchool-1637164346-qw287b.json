      "text": "Happens to the best! First are you sure all data is useless? Could some maybe be used as a negative baseline? Second, you might want to look into test-driven development - imo this is really under appreciated in academia, but might help prevent this happening again in the future (or at least maybe reduce the likelihood). Also looks good on your CV should you ever transition to industry (at least so I have been told)",

Thankfully, the major conclusions were not changed, and we were able to address the issue in edits. \n\nA few comforting things: \n\nThis happens to everyone. What defines you as a researcher is not whether you make mistakes, but how you react to them. What can you learn? Is there a way you can incorporate a check on future scripts to avoid this?\n\nYou've done the right thing by acknowledging the data is flawed and starting again. It's one thing to lose time, it's quite another to lose a reputation.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint. A few weeks is nothing in the grand scheme of things.",

All the errors I had in the beginning were obvious problems, now they are more specific and sometimes difficult to spot!",
