  "text": "I\u2019m currently wrapping up my PhD applications for the season and decided not to apply to one of the schools I was originally considering. I had been in touch with a faculty member at this school over the summer (and even attended a lab meeting), but as I got deeper into exploring programs, I realized this wasn\u2019t the best fit for my research interests. Should I reach out to the professor and let them know I no longer intend to apply or just let it go?",
