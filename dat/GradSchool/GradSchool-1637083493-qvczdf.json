  "text": "I applied to 4 online programs recently for a software engineering masters, all with start dates in early January 2022.  Their deadlines were all around November 1st - November 15th and I'm confused by the timeline.  Sending out decisions in December would barely give any time for me to decide on a school and enroll in courses before immediately starting classes.  Do they typically have super fast turnarounds or should I expect to have to decide on a school quickly?",

      "text": "My experience was similar to this. I applied and got into a master's program through Texas Tech University, completely online. I applied by October 2020, did an interview and was accepted by mid to late November 2020...to the Spring term starting this past January 2021. I only applied to that program so it wasn't a hard decision for me.",
