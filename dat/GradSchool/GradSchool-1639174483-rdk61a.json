  "title:": "Why do some supervisors have no respect?",
  "text": "I returned to campus 3 months ago and have been working with my supervisor there since then. I've always struggled to grasp new concepts so thought it was simply that which was holding me back from gaining the knowledge I needed to make way with my PhD project.\n\nNow, I'm nearly a year in and I don't feel any better off and I actually feel much, much worse about the way things are going. Every interaction I have with them makes me feel belittled and inadequate- she described my writing as \"vague and poor\" when I submitted my first ever report when I was 2 months into the project. The other day I was close to tears after a 40 minute meeting which tore apart my manuscript- this came right after she okayed my previous draft, saying it was good. I feel like the conventional skills a PhD student is taught, encouraged and coached to gain are simply not there.\n\nI'm constantly made to feel left out of almost every meeting and discussion that goes on- for example, I found out today that the entire research group is visiting a university professor in London (I'm uk based) and leaving me behind!\n\nI get the impression that there's just a fundamental lack of respect seeing as every single meeting has to come from 2 days of trying to grab their attention on Teams, outlook or physically running into them. My questions or discussions almost always go ignored and I feel like the relationship I'm supposed to have is completely non-existent, today I asked for a simple piece of advice on a technicality and they ignored my message (left on read since 1PM).\n\nIt wasn't until I saw how other students are treated that I realised I'd ended up with a raw deal. There are 9 other students in the office and their supervisors normally come in 4/5 times a week and sit with them to coach them with the numerical simulations or manuscript editing.\n\nThe girl next to me had a 2 hour meeting going through all the theory for a manuscript and I'm here having to physically beg my supervisor for 15 minutes of professionally disguised insults. My co supervisor is lovely but he's only just qualified so lacks the seniority to take the lead with things so I'm stuck here with a supervisor who dislikes me.\n\nI apologise for the ranty nature of this but I'm just tired, man.",

      "text": "That's... really crappy, wow. Your supervisor is an ass. Seriously. It's pretty clear that for whatever reason, they have disfavored you and it is impacting your program. If you can, I would start testing the waters to see if you can find a replacement; someone who will actually invest in your success, not be complicit in your failure.",

      "text": "Frankly, that all sounds low-key abusive. That fucking sucks, and it's way too common in academia. Not sure if you're looking for advice, but if you are, you might look into techniques to survive toxic workplace dynamics - strategies like gray-rock, for instance. Don't let this bully take your power away, you deserve better than that! Good luck and hang in there!",
