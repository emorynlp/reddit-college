  "text": "Dear Redditeurs,\n\nAm a writer in a bit of a career transition. Breaking the bank on MFA programs seems like it may be a losing battle, but am looking at online programs in order to improve craft and meet other writers. There is one local (Michener Center at UT) I'll be applying to for a second time, but otherwise wondering your thoughts:\n\n1. **What are some of the best** ***fully funded*** **MFA programs which are remote/distance learning?**\n2. What are some of the best and *affordable* MFA programs which are remote/distance?\n\nAnyone have experience applying in this space? Would be so helpful to get some ideas!",

There\u2019s an enormous amount of information on creative writing/literary arts programs and some discussions on low-residency programs (which fulfill your remote/distance learning requirement). \n\nMy understanding is that very few low-res programs offer full funding to all students. Some have partial scholarships (Bennington).",
