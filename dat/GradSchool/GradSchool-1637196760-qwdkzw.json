  "text": "Feeling very defeated by the academic job market, and having a lot of job anxiety (have never been particularly good at securing jobs) so trying to figure out a workable alt-ac path as a plan B while I have time.\n\nLooking at all the alt-ac sites, I can't help but feel like this cottage industry is just as cynical as the academic market. I tried using some of the job searches but they were trying to funnel me into crap jobs or jobs in industries I would never want to work in (corporate, banking, etc.)\n\nWould appreciate pointers, tips, personal experiences from folks who have been successful going alt-ac with a humanities degree! Thanks!",

          "text": "Alt-ac isn't exactly \"more appealing\" more than the academic job market seems extremely unappealing now, having gone through it once and not had much success.\n\nI'm about 7 years older than most applicants so I don't have much time to waste, whereas a lot of the kids now can spend the next 1-3 years applying and reapplying. \n\nIdeally I'd love to still do something related to teaching/writing/researching/education but without the insane grind (like secondary teaching, for eg) or the insane application process.",
