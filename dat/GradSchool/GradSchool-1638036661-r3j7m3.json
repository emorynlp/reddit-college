  "text": "I joined a new lab for my first rotation. The grad student I was paired with treats me like a burden. Like she is avoiding me, and I know it's not my imagination. Lately, we talk about my experiments, and she says she is going to be there with me, but three days ago, she left me in the lab. I spent over a week preparing the reagents and cells for the experiment. Now I have to throw them away and re-do them after thanksgiving. She spent all day dodging me and pretending to be busy. It would have taken her 10 minutes max to show me what to do. Its not the first time she has done this. My experiments are delayed by several days because no one can help me. I designed my primers, but couldn't order them until an undergrad was able to eventually help three days after. There are so many reagents I needed that I spent hours looking for because I didnt know where they were.  Other lab mates have been so nice, but I need her guidance because she is the only one who knows how to do most of those experiments. It's not just the experimental delays, it's the shady looks, and the dodging. I'm starting to hate going to the lab, and I bet that's her intention. I try to be nice. I even bought her coffee twice. I love the research and other lab mates but have been super frustrated by this. Yet I know she cannot leave her job to attend to me.  I dont feel entitled to her time, I just dont understand this treatment. Its one thing to say hey im sorry im too busy to help. Its another to intentionally waste my time in this manner. I dont know what to do, but I dont think telling the professor is going to help our relationship.",

      "text": "That sucks. I had a similar experience and changed labs. \n\nIs there anyone who is a leader in the lab that you can approach? I'm thinking of someone like a staff scientist or postdoc. Go to them first. Ask for advice and bring up the idea of talking to your PI with them. \n\nYou can also ask more experienced folks in lab for suggestions on how to set up your experiments. If you go this route, it'll be much more independent but you'll also learn more in the long run.\n\nYou have a lot of options. Don't let one sucky person bring you down!",

I'm going to be here for three more weeks so I was wondering if I could fix it before I had to move to another lab.  Unfortunately, she is the most senior person since the lab is still fairly new. But youre right, I wont let it get to me anymore",

What you perceive as shitty behavior may not be intentional. Difficult to say. If you can, just talk with her; I would not take this to someone else for now.",

You shouldn\u2019t be waiting 3 days after designing primers, nor spending hours looking for reagents, before asking someone for help. \n\nTheir behavior\u2014shady looks, etc\u2014is inexcusable. But mentoring a rotation student is a huge burden. They have to show you how to do literally everything, while still doing their own work. It\u2019s like doing research for two people at once. If you\u2019re not communicating where you are and what you need, they\u2019re going to focus on their own thing.",

      "text": "Hi there! I understand your situation so well, as I had a very similar one. And yes, your thinking is right. First thing is to talk to that person, explain your expectation and feelings (vibes) you get, highlight that you cannot be efficient if this atmosphere is between you and that person. If she will get that and take it into account for the future - it is perfect. But usually, this is not the case. Then, make an appointment to meet with your PI, that person and yourself, before she talks to PI. As that student is working for a long time there, the professor will be on grad student's side. So it would be better to make a meeting before the student will talk to the professor and be ready for possible questions or claims that the student can argue with. I wish you luck and all the best. Hope it won't go so bad and you can friendly talk to students without any further meetings. Head's up!",
