  "title:": "How to meet people and make friends as an older PhD student?",
  "text": "I (33m) just moved halfway across the country to start a PhD program. I have no significant other and my friends from my 20s are all hundreds of miles away and starting families. I'm having a good time in my program so far, but am finding that the things I thought would help me meet people are not helping all that much. \n\nHere are the things I've tried so far:\n\n- **Meetup.com groups.** I've checked out several organizations and gone to several events, but meetup seems a bit dead in my city, at least for my age group and interests. Many groups seem to be virtual still, and I just don't have any more Zoom time left in me. The events I've gone to have been sparsely attended by people I have not clicked with. I was particularly hoping to find a hiking group, and my city has several, but some of them are female-only and the others seem to be mostly for people 10-20 years older than me.\n\n- **Bumble BFF.** Met several nice gay guys who were looking to date me; more power to them but that's not what I'm looking for. (Also why do people use BFF to look for dates? Stop it!)\n\n- **D&D.** I love TTRPGs and figured I'd find a group to play with in the city. It has been hell to find open games, as what seems to have been the main hub for this (a local comics shop) has not resumed the practice post-COVID yet, and the local D&D discord and facebook groups are mostly dead. \n\n- **Joining student groups.** I found a terrific D&D group this way, and it's a highlight of my week, but I'm the only grad student in the whole organization. I'm nearly a decade and a half older than these folks, which is fine for RPG night in the student union but not ideal for making friends. The student hiking/outdoors club is exactly the same. (This *really* surprised me; how can there be no other grad students who want to go backpacking? But if they exist, they haven't joined the organization for it.)\n\n- **Organizations specifically for grad students.** The university-wide grad student government and my school's grad student government both do events from time to time. Many of these seem cool but have strict attendance limits, and I haven't managed to secure a ticket to any yet. The few events I have attended are 10am coffee hours with 8 attendees who all came with someone they already knew and haven't seemed very open to befriending the 30+-year-old trying to make conversation. At least it's free coffee.\n\n- **Trying to do things with people in my classes.** Many of my classmates are straight out of undergrad and I look like I could be their dad. The older ones are married with kids and don't seem all that interested in hanging out. (I'm in a cohort of three, and the other two are both married and seem uninterested in doing things.) I am also the only male-presenting person of my ethnicity in any of my classes, and while everyone is cordial and friendly it has made me feel a bit disconnected from the others. I still hope I'll manage to convince someone to get coffee or a beer sometime, but no luck yet. \n\n- **Going to the gym.** I swim two days a week and lift three. It's helping a ton with the things I want it to help with -- physical and mental health -- but it doesn't seem like I can reasonably expect to make friends at the gym. I have never observed anyone there talking to anyone else they didn't walk in with and everyone has airpods in full time.\n\n- **Going to coffee shops.** I'm a semi-regular at this point at a coffee shop in my neighborhood. The baristas recognize me by now and I'm becoming an espresso snob, but that's about it. \n\n- **Going to church.** I find religion academically interesting but am not a true believer (after deconverting away from the fundamentalist background I was raised in.) Still, after so many other avenues took me nowhere I figured it might help to try some of the more accepting churches. After visiting a few I believe I am the only churchgoer in my area who is neither an undergrad nor middle-aged.  \n\n- **Going to events.** I've been to several concerts -- both the buy-tickets kind and the free-in-the-park kind -- and they've been great fun but also very full and loud. Not exactly the most conducive environment for striking up a conversation. There are also semi-frequent art fairs in my neighborhood, but my attempts to strike up conversation there have not gone anywhere. \n\n- **Talking to my cat.** She's cool but gets bored easily when catnip isn't involved. \n\nLike I said, I did not expect it to be this hard to make friends. As you can see from this list, I've invested a significant amount of time into trying to meet people, and the return so far has been very low. I'm a genial ambivert and have always been able to make friends (this isn't the first time I've moved long distance to a new city and had to make a friend group from scratch), but I think that's because I've always been able to rely on at least a small network at school or work to jumpstart things, so to speak. It seems like the problem this time around is that I'm just not finding people my age. I feel like I've pulled every lever I can find marked Meet People and so far I've got nothing. \n\nAny other suggestions for things I can try? What helped you make friends in grad school?",

      "text": "I honestly don't see what is the problem with hanging around with undergrads, or for that matter, older students. I am a similar age to you (not in a grad program but in a similar situation of having moved recently), and *many* of my friends are younger or older than me by 7-10 years. Some are in their 50s, the youngest is 19. We hang out, chill, go to events together, talk, do outdoor activities, go to bars sometimes, just all the things regular friends do - and no one usually gives a shit about any age difference.   \n\nA 20 year old and a 30 year old grew up basically in the same world, have seen the same issues and problems and changes in society, know the same media, usually have similar cultural values - they are so much more similar than you seem to think. Aside from the really obvious stuff related to life circumstances, (like childraising, purchasing houses, etc), there is still *literally everything else* to talk about - hobbies, interests, music, politics. Hell, my aunt came out of her second undergrad at 55 years old with a bunch of 20-and 30-something friends that genuinely enjoyed spending time with her, and they even still keep in touch.\n\nSo please stop putting yourself in some \"I'm *old* because I'm *33* pity hole\", and give a try socializing with younger and older people. If for some reason it still is sooo important to talk to someone born within a few years of your birthday, keep in mind many of these people will have older (or younger) colleagues, acquaintances at part-time positions, and the like, that they could introduce you to. \n\nAnyone else reading this, being 30 (or 40 or 50) or whatever doesn't have to be some damn deathtrap after which you aren't allowed to talk to anyone, to enjoy life, and to generally have a good time and *live*. It's illogical, irrational, and even harmful to everyone's mental health, to act like it is.",

Maybe try Twitter and ask if there are any grad students in whatever city you're in who are interested in DnD? I know there's a big overlap on academic Twitter and dnd. I'm a dancer and mostly make friends in my dance classes but I think those are different than going to the gym and lifting. I've also seen people go on Atlas Obscura to find weird tours they might be interested in and meeting people that way. My friend went on an urban foraging trip and it sounds like she met some people that way.",

I talked to people and knew the regulars at the time I went but we weren't hanging out post gym time. Try subbing to the reddit sub for whatever city your in and looking for activities/meetups that way? Search for some local city/state newsletters you can subscribe to, like for local events or arts/culture things happening. You can try going to some of those or joining a volunteer group to get out and meet people. \n\nBut also tbh, as a 1st year PhD you'll maybe have 1 free evening a week, if you're lucky.",

I've had good luck with the following:\n\n* Specialty running stores to look for running groups.\n* The same but for hashing groups, if you like also beer.\n* Specialty outdoor shops to look for hiking/backpacking groups.\n* Specialty bike shops to look for biking groups\n\nAll of these exist in any city I've lived, because they attract customers. If you're really into any of the above (like for me, running), I'd look to see if any of the stores need Saturday help. An 8 hour shift 2-3 times a month is a sweet way to meet people. And people who exercise regularly are usually chill as shit, cause endorphins.\n\nSimilarly, try board game cafes to meet like-minded gamers, etc. And, as random as this sounds, your specialty-interest subreddit and city subreddit.",

Have you considered starting your own student group or meet up catered to your interests instead of trying to fit into a different group? There have got to be so many people tired of zoom meetings, I their early 30s looking to connect. \n\nAnd love the tips on climbing or running groups. Crossfit is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea and is pricy, but is also pretty social if you\u2019re interested. \n\nVolunteering might be another thing to explore! \n\nBest of luck, and hats off to your efforts! It\u2019s not easy making friends as an adult. It takes so much time to form connections that seem worth investing in compared to when you almost make friends by default of how much time you spend with people when you\u2019re younger in school. I think friendships are built off of shared experiences and time, and it takes a lot of that to truly bond, but staying patient is hard!\n\nOn that note, if no one seems interested in coffee, Maybe organize a colloquium with a speaker and after lecture beer for your grad program. I did that during my MS and it was always well attended by faculty and grad students alike, and easy to transition to hey let\u2019s grab dinner or keep the night going, or at the very least be a good intermediate step between a professional relationship and a social one to make making plans in the future more natural.",

I probably wouldn't have felt comfortable hanging out with a group of her friends, but one-on-one activities, or hanging out with her and her boyfriend were fine since he was a lot like her. \n\nI think you just have to continue putting yourself out there.

This would definitely hurt to change as a 33 year old because living alone is ideal, but it might help you for a year or two to live with roommates or in a cooperative/rooming house, just to get a base of people to know and meet their friends, expand your circles, etc. Living in a coop was responsible for about 95% of my friends when I moved to a new city knowing nobody \\~5 years ago.",

      "text": "Doing things with people in my cohort was the way for me. \n\nI was around the same age as you when I started, and most of my cohort was maybe 7 years younger on average, but that was never a big issue. Also, I was the only international student in my cohort, which for sure meant I didn't click with many (or they didn't click with me), but I did click with others. During our first year, the whole cohort had several classes together, including one advisory type class. Someone got a group chat going, and someone would often say \"drinks after class at bar X\". That would be like a weekly occurrence. Or people would text the group to find someone to write with, eat with, go to games with... Friendships and friend groups started emerging that way. \n\nI had initially relocated without my partner, but he moved in with me a few months in. I was worried he wouldn't have any friends, so I invited the whole cohort and some ppl from my lab over for lunch one day, so that he could meet everyone. I was expecting around 10 - more like 20 showed up, haha. From there, the ones I was already the closest with adopted my partner as a friend, and we've formed a pretty tight bond ever since. They were our bubble throughout the pandemic, too.",

      "text": "Haven't read all the comments yet (sorry if someone has said this already).. but my first bit of advice is stop worrying about age! Don't already go into the situation creating a difference. \n\nI am on the other end of the spectrum. I was 20 years old when I moved 18 hours from home to start my PhD. I felt like a literal infant in my program and at my school because the person closest in age to me was 7 years older than me. I went in telling myself I had nothing in common with them and it definitely influenced how I acted. While I would go to events, I would kind of subconscioulsy create distance between myself and others because I had this idea in my head that because of my age, I couldn't really talk to anyone. Once I dropped that thinking, I felt like I could just try to make connections with people. \n\nAlso don't assume that the people with kids don't want to hang out! Two of my closest friends since I started here are moms (one is literally old enough to be my mom). Just because they have kids doesn't mean they want their whole identities to be about their kids! \n\nI am a crazy shy person with pretty bad social anxiety, but after a couple years I finally feel like I have a couple friends and feel much less lonely. It will be okay, but it will take time. Once I stopped worrying about how people thought I was 15 upon first glance and creating a difference between me and them based on age, I was much happier. \n\nLast thing I will say, is I think you are already doing a good job getting plugged in. Just be patient and you eill be fine!",

          "text": "Agreed. I reaaaally don't get why everyone cares about age *so damn much*. Especially a pretty trivial difference like 10 years. Like who literally cares - it's not like a 40-year gap, where the society we grew up in is completely different, it's just a difference of a few more/fewer life experiences and maybe slightly different popculture you consume?\n\nHonestly, a 20 and a 30 year old with similar basic set of interests should still have a LOT to talk about, except, I don't know, the stuff not directly related to work/career experience.\n\nUnless OP himself is making himself boring just because of his age, and cutting out interests and parts of his personality just because it's what \"you're supposed to be like at 30\" or some unfounded horseshit like that.",
