                              "text": "I mean, yes and no. Money for TAs generally comes from the tuition money that is raised. That is also true for adjunct faculty who teach classes or professors who teach in non-research fields. That's why research faculty are paid even if they don't happen to teach a course that semester. It's intentionally vague where to money comes and goes to, but generally speaking a research faculty is bringing in more money than they are paid even if they aren't teaching. \n\nBut for argument's sake let's say the professor is adjunct and not research faculty. I've never known an adjunct faculty not to teach at least two classes per semester. If those are big general classes, that could be 200 students, all taking 3-4 credits (if it has a lab, also the lab fee) paying somewhere along the lines of $500 per credit. So assuming $1500 per student. If they are only teaching 50 students in their two classes, that is along the lines of $75,000 per semester they are bringing in in tuition monies. Adjunct faculty don't make that much in a year, much less a semester. So let's say they take $30,000 per semester they teach, that leaves $45,000 in tuition money. Grad assistants generally make along the lines of $9,000-$10,000 per semester, and if you only have 50 students, that is probably going to be only 2 TAs. So that STILL leaves $25,000 on the table for the school in profit, after it has paid ALL of its employees responsible for the course. And that's being conservative. If this is a general class with 200 students, you'll need about 8 - 10 TAs, or about $100,000 for all the TAs, and another $30,000 for the faculty member. But the students have paid nearly $300,000 in tuition for that course, so the university has now profited $170,000 on this ONE course.\n\nAll that to say, there is ALWAYS money to pay grad assistants, especially in research related fields where a ton of money is coming in from other sources even before we talk about tuition.",
