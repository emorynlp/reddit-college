  "text": "So basically I am a first year MS student (fully funded), working as a Graduate Research Assistant. Since my stipend is not hourly, and is a flat salary essentially, I am expected to work mostly the entire year on this research project. That being said, my research professor said he would accommodate any internship I got for the summer. \n\nWith all of that in mind, is it a bad thing to not have any internships during the summer if I am working as a GRA? How will future employers feel about me not having an internship, and instead working as a GRA all summer?",
