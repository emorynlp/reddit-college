  "title:": "Turned in the final assignment for my first semester of grad school\u2026 uffda",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first year graduate student, pursuing my masters degree in history. Finals week doesn\u2019t officially start until tomorrow, but one of my classes ended last week due to the professor having surgery this week and the other gave us the final information in the middle of last week. It was a pretty simple three question written final, the first two questions being 250-500 words and the final being no more than 1,500 words. \n\nI\u2019m worried I rushed a bit on the last bit as her instructions were very confusing, but I\u2019m certain the references and work I did will be enough. It\u2019s technically not due until Thursday, but I had the whole weekend free to do this final so I spent the last three days working on it. Might revise, but at this point I am complete with my first semester and am resdy for a very long nap\u2026 and maybe a glsss of wine.",
