  "text": "I was so scared to go into graduate school. My undergraduate experience was filled with mediocrity and trauma and I finally reached a point in my life where I realized I should give my past self grace.\n\n- I've came from a low income household\n- I was dealing with housing insecurity\n- I'm ADHD and dyslexic and had no idea how to get services\n- I had my daughter at 22. \n\n I was terrified that even applying because I didn't want a repeat of my undergraduate experience. I now have two kids, And the idea of getting my graduate degree, while potentially teaching from home (The whole pandemic and everything), while working full-time felt overwhelming.\n\nBut this time around I was able to contact my disability service office and get accommodations. It has made a world of difference.\n\nLet me tell you, I cried when I read 99.1 out of 100. Two semesters in and I finally feel like I belong.",

I didn't even know about ADHD before that and strongly suspect that I have ADHD. I have all the symptoms. My college days were so hard and still have an arrear left. Now I am thinking about doing a second masters in the same field from US. I don't have any idea how to fight ADHD (If I have it). All those my college days I blamed myself, I put myself down saying that I am not trying hard. Will there be disability service office in every college? And do you take any medications? (Asking because I don't even have a slightest idea).",

You could probably outreach the person now to get an idea of what the process looks like.\n\nI personally am not on medication but it's a very personal choice, and definitely support pepe who thrive on it.\nI was identified in second grade, So I was able to learn a lot of tools to help me in K through 12. One of the hardest things to learn is identifying when your ADHD is really affecting you, how to ground yourself, And get yourself back on track.\nI work with a cognitive behavioral therapist to help me out with that.\n\nGood luck on your journey!
