  "text": "I\u2019m genuinely considering it. I had massive health problems crop up over the summer and I\u2019m overwhelmed and depressed. Going to appointments, getting enough rest, eating the right foods combined with the program I\u2019m in is just too much. \n\nI just worry that I\u2019d be letting my advisor down, or that I\u2019d for some reason be asked to leave. I feel like a massive failure. On top of that I\u2019ve done a pretty good job at concealing what I\u2019m dealing with from my coworkers and I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a fraud. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t have started the semester. Sorry for the rant. Does anyone have any advice?",

      "text": "Hey, I came here to ask exactly this with a very similar situation. \n\nI'm having a lot of mental and physical health problems and can't heal while I'm under gun in grad school. I feel like I'm letting my advisor down, who I respect and admire. \n\nI'm not sure how to go about it. I also shouldn't have started the quarter, but I didn't know I was going to be this bad. I'm worried about financial aid and if I can postpone it, but they won't give me an appt until next week. \n\nI'm a little numb and overwhelmed right now.",

      "text": "I think students asking for leave during Covid is not uncommon or unexpected from schools at this point. We lost several students in my cohort for various reasons, some about that and some about mental health.  I have both taken a leave and withdrawn from a program before, and taking a leave is a much better alternative, because you can go back after things settle down, and then withdraw later if you choose.",
