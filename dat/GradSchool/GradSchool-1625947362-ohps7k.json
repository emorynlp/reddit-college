  "title:": "Anecdote: homelessness rising among graduate students",
  "text": "I don't know if this is a real trend in the US, but I've learned of 6 grad students at my institution who will no longer have a place to live by the end of this year. Some are leaving school, while others are trying to tough it out. Given the upcoming lift of eviction moratoria and skyrocketing rent prices (including on-campus... my university just raised grad housing rents by 85%), I fear homelessness is set to become commonplace among grad students. \n\nFor those who think it a little suspicious that a half-dozen people would share this one particular concern with me:  I have a bit of an open secret. I've been homeless for about three years and I'm a vocal advocate for campus housing reform. People know I'm surviving grad school while living on the streets. \n\nIt began as a choice for me:  a conscientious objection to insane rent prices (even before this year!) and the total lack of consequences for many landlords' criminal behavior. The grad students who have spoken to me about their impending homelessness aren't being given a choice, however. And, unlike me, they don't have enough time to plan for what's coming. \n\nI'm posting this here to raise awareness of what might be a major wave of hardship sweeping through our shared community. There is a lot of shame and stigma around homelessness and universities have very sparse support programs outside of offering high-interest loans. A bit of social support and kindness toward your struggling colleagues can make an enormous difference.",

But since the inspectors couldn't find anything that proved the house was the problem, I was stuck in a lease and paying rent for a place I couldn't live. I was able to get through it because a friend let me crash in her spare room for a couple of months until my lease was up. It was incredibly scary.",

          "text": "This is an *excellent* point.\n\nMy parents are not incredibly well off, but I'm definitely still privileged here. I lived in a camper on my parent's property (and paid them rent) to save money before graduate school. I cannot imagine having gone into school without the emergency fund I have from that (of which I have used a lot, between my beater car needing repairs and my dog needing emergency vet care). And I couldn't have put away any money if I couldn't find a job within an hour of them because all I was able to save was the difference between the rent in my area and the rent I was paying them. Utilities, car, etc. took up literally every other cent of the best job I was able to find with my bachelors.\n\nWhat if something worse had happened to my dog, or I didn't have that emergency fund? Where are the resources for the student who got in a car accident and has no transportation to school, no disposable income for a down payment on a new car? They live in a bad part of the city (since that's all we can afford rent-wise) and walk over an hour each way to spend 11 hours a day in the lab.... Where are the resources for the students with dependents, significant others, when they need help? Do we have to only associate ourselves with partners that are well off? I find myself jealous of my friends in my program who are married to well-off people who front the bill when something happens, like needing to move somewhere new ASAP.  I went through a breakup and lived with my abusive ex for *six months* because neither of us could afford to buy ourselves out of the lease and put the first, last, and security on a new place, and that is far from the worst I can imagine. And I picked the program with the biggest disparity between stipend and cost of living. Having to be smart with limited funds is very different than knowing you're one 'small' problem completely out of your control away from being in a very scary financial position.",

              "text": "I honestly don't think it's a very good point. The vast majority of \"traditional\" students get no appreciable financial support either. I've noticed a lot of first gen students here put up a strawman of the typical grad student who is given a $1k per month stipend from their parents while getting a bunch of tips about how to navigate academia from their parents, and that student just doesn't exist in an appreciable quantity (in the sciences at least). If they aren't obviously doing things that they shouldn't be able to afford or coming from an academic family, chances are they aren't getting financial help from home and were flying into grad school blind too. They probably would get help if they were facing homelessness, but it should never get to that point anyway.\n\nThe problem is a lot of bad housing policy for a few decades, a little bit of real estate being a common vehicle to hide money from authoritarian regimes, and a lot of schools underpaying grad students. The first two sound like the real cause of what OP is seeing here. 85% rent increases are not remotely normal and are completely unheard of outside of a select few cities. Not making enough to start paying off your debt is one thing, but being able to afford rent and eating and utilities and a cellphone and transportation without getting into extra debt isn't asking too much.",

The research they do is work, and they also usually teach classes or are teaching assistants at their university.",

The reason it seems you dislike poor people/welfare programs is the tone of a lot of your posts which seem to simply belittle people.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what your deal is.  \n\nBut seriously: Go back and look at some of the language of your posts and comments.  Don't you see how nasty and rude you are being to people?  Look at this conversation.  Is this who you want to be?  \n\n\nLook at your own post history and how many times you tell people to \"shut the fuck up\"\n\nDude...Like letting go of the conversation we just had I'm actually legitimately concerned for you.  You seem to have a lot of anger and insecurity and you vent it out on people over the internet.  Let that shit go.",

There is a very small number of people who abuse welfare systems by taking advantage of them when they're not needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile many people in our society are motivated by the need to support themselves financially, in general, humans enjoy productivity. A lot of people make money pursuing their hobbies professionally, people pick their major in school often based on their interests/passions and later their careers, a lot of people enjoy structure and a sense of purpose, and people like a sense of community, which can be found at a job. I think generally, people understand that workers are needed for us to enjoy basic necessities and luxuries, and people respect that jobs have to be done. (Which is why I think a living wage should be required even for low-skilled workers. Someone has to flip the burgers, and from 6am-4pm, it can't be the teenagers in school!) \n\nNot only that, but it's kind of nonsense to assume as well that the government would be providing others some glamorous sort of housing. People really just need a place to sleep, shower, store their belongings, make food, and relax. Some people have kids and need more space for them. I personally would not mind my tax dollars going to make sure all people have a place to live. And that means whoever is building the houses, etc., is still being compensated fairly by the government through tax dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, housing people actually increases people's ability to be productive. Homelessness is often connected to mental health issues and substance abuse, which are only exacerbated by inability to have ones basic needs met (eating, sleeping, bathing, safety). Homelessness also often implies the person does not have access to reliable transportation to work, which is basically a requirement for jobs. So if your goal is a more productive and fair society, you ought to be concerned with making sure everyone is equally able to participate in such a society.",

These people don't even know how a graduate school contract works, yet love to bully graduate students to feel better about themselves (even though that doesn't make them better!).\n\nAs OP said, I've never seen a school that allows you to get a second job, and I signed that contract coming in as well. Fortunately, my school pays pretty well, so I haven't had this issue, but these schools are very few in number. If you don't know this, you're either not a graduate student or went to a grad school that's really a joke. No graduate school that's serious about academics would want their students to be distracted from research and teaching. And there you go: graduate students aren't monkeys who want to play with toys. They're employees of a university who work for them. If you don't understand this either, you really have nothing to say in this subreddit. Like, why are you even here?\n\nPerhaps you should do more research before you troll next time.",
