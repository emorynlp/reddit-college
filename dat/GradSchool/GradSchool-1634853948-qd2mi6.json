  "text": "I applied for admission for this fall but one of my letters of reference was delayed due to COVID. They gave me the option to withdraw or go into the next admission cycle. I chose to go into the next cycle. \n\nFor my trouble, they offered me a grant that will cover one class. \n\nGee, thanks so much.\n\nI'm completing my doctorate in educational leadership, which isn't as fancy as some other programs... But it's still a hell of a lot of work. \n\nI set a goal that I wanted to complete my doctorate by the time I'm 50. I'm not doing to make it. Hopefully I will be done by 51.",
