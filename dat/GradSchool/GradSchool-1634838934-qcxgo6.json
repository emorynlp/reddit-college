  "text": "Hello everyone,  I will be applying to masters degrees this fall and I have just enrolled in a graduate diploma by distance learning. I already have a bachelors degree which is the main requirement for the programs that I am applying to. My question is do I need to mention that I am doing this diploma as well? The graduate diploma is in Economics which is my undergraduate degree as well",

In some countries the graduate diploma and postgraduate diploma are synonymous, while in others (particularly where the graduate diploma is at undergraduate degree level) the postgraduate diploma is a higher qualification.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",
