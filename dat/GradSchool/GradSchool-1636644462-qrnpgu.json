  "text": " \n\nHello fellow grad students! I am a teacher at a suburban Chicago high school and I am trying to get together an ongoing project for next semester involving \"Flat Stanley.\" I am also a grad student, but through an online program, so not on a campus. If you don\u2019t know what Flat Stanley is, it\u2019s a little paper dude that students decorate who you mail to someone else who takes Stanley on adventures.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m trying to put a heavy focus on college and careers this year. Next semester I would like to do Post-Secondary Flat Stanley. I would like to have students create their own Flat Stanleys and then mail them off to people at colleges/trade schools and ask that they take pictures of the Stanleys around campus. Then, you would ideally send me the Stanley back and e-mail me some of the pictures of you having a fun time with him around campus! I think this would be a great way to expose my students to some post-secondary institutions and start to form some type of relationship with them.\n\nI am reaching out to r/GradSchool hoping some of you might be willing to take him on trips around your campus and send him back to us!\n\nPlease let me know if this is something you would be interested in! You would be greatly helping out this special education teacher!\n\n(this is next semester, so Stanley would visit you sometime from January-May)",
