  "text": "I am a candidate for an academic award in my MBA program but yesterday, I fucked up badly in my thesis proposal that I managed to get a grade that eliminated my chances of being an honor student. To add insult to the injury, I had the lowest grade on thesis proposal in my batch.\n\nNext week is my comprehensive exam. I study, and study, and study but everything seems difficult. I don't know how to continue anymore. Even if I get highly satisfactory score on my exam, it still won't change the fact that I am no longer a candidate for an academic award.",
