  "text": "Or is it even allowed? On the application it shows a list of types of recommenders (professor, employer, family member, co worker, friend etc.) Im only thinking about this because I'm anxious my professors aren't responding to my email requests although I still have a few weeks for the deadline. I have one from one of my undergrad professors so far though just need two more",

      "text": "Anecdotally, it helps to have letter writers who hold at least the level of degree you're applying for, but that doesn't necessarily need to be an academic. Because the recommendation is for graduate study, the letter is more meaningful if the writer is familiar with that experience and the qualities necessary for success. \n\nThen again, perhaps those are confounded---a letter from someone without the relevant degree but who appropriately tailors the letter to qualities of interest is probably similarly impactful. For example, if an employer is writing the letter for a PhD application, they should emphasize qualities like resourcefulness over \"follows directions\", but that might not be obvious.",

I doubt it helped my packet, but apparently it didn't hurt so much that I was rejected. \n\nAnd before that weirdo jumps all over my comment again - no, I am not a researcher on graduate admissions. I do not have data to back up my assertion. I am speaking from personal experience not presenting evidence.",

I was totally stuck for a third reference so I ended up using a family friend who works in medicine. Guess it was more like a character reference.\n\nMy situation was kinda atypical, I'm old and the professors who I actually worked with are dead or gone. Then due to some total BS with my former employer I lost all my professional contacts with no warning and had to agree not to communicate with any of my former accounts for 1 year. \n\nNot ideal, but I made it in. Now - was accepting the best decision of my life? That's debatable.",

You want a good mix of perspectives on your work ethic, studies, research (if applicable), and professional development. So, for example, if they're all from professors who don't know anything about an internship that you did and a club you led, you're missing critical components of your profile. But if it's three supervisors, none of them have first-hand knowledge of you as a student",

So if you\u2019re able to get a prominent person to write your letter, it doesn\u2019t matter if they have an Associates degree because it\u2019ll stand out compared to those with just professors, at least in my experience.",
