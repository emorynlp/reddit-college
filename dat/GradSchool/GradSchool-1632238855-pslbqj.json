  "text": "There\u2019s so many little bugs with the software that pisses me off to no end.  \n\nEvery day when I open it, it asks me to log in (even though I have \u201cremember me\u201d checked), I type in my credentials (no auto-fill), it tells me there\u2019s an error, I close and reopen it, then type in my credentials again and then it works.  \n\nWhenever I am typing in the general notes and it syncs the data, the cursor gets placed up at the top of the notes. So I have to erase and scroll back down.  \n\nI don\u2019t think I even need to mention the Mendeley Word plugin. Just Google \u201cMendeley word plugin problem\u201d and you\u2019ll see how difficult it is to get working for some people. And even once it is working I still get popups in word telling me it can\u2019t connect.  \n\nThen today is my last straw. It won\u2019t let me erase any notes I\u2019ve written. So one typo and I can\u2019t go back and change it or add anything in other than the bottom. Drives me nuts.  \n\nSo, long story short, is there a better manager to use? Preferably one that has the same features (highlighting, notes, adding citations in Word) without the bugs. Bonus if I can somehow transfer my annotations from Mendeley to the new app :)",

I end up using Zoterobib online to format my citations and then use that for my reference list. Sucks when I remove, add, or change the order  of my citations.\n\nI tried using Endnote but I hate it (ie can\u2019t figure out how to get it to work for me). I do most of my work on my iPad, and it does not have Cite in text for iPad. I can\u2019t figure out how to import citations or change style on the iPad app. \n\nI tried using the online version of Endnote on my laptop but when I tried to use the Cite in text Word add-in connected to that account it says I have no references. Plus I don\u2019t know how to transfer all the citations I already have to the program so I would have to start over.",

I prefer it to others as they have a great PDF reader, which automatically extracts figures and references from the document and makes it easier to read or search the reference list. The iPad app is also great which is nice for switching between devices. Just wanted to suggest another potential option. It of course, like others has a word plug in for citation managing.",

It was fantastic and I would still use it today except\u2026 I had a library sync problem and it hung the whole thing up. I emailed the tech support about it and instead of providing me with any help, they told me to get readcube and then they would help. No, I\u2019ve already paid for your program and you aren\u2019t instilling any sort of confidence that my my now monthly fee will come with competent tech support. \n\nTLDR: readcube is run by a scummy company",
