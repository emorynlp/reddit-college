  "title:": "How to not get my hopes up for my dream PhD program?",
  "text": "Everything seems like it is falling into place. I  met with my dream advisor before starting my masters and was told I would need at least 3 publications to get into my dream PhD program.  He had introduced me to his PhD students and invited me to their student happy hour. He stayed for the happy hour to observe how I interacted with others, which apparently he never attended. \n\nI\u2019m going to have 4-6 publications by the time I apply.  My masters advisor is friends with several people in the department I want to get into.  I have a 4.0.  I came from a low income background and overcame adversity to get into college.  \n\nHowever, the department I am trying to get into is one of the most competitive in the world for my field.  I want it so bad. My masters advisor keeps saying I will get in.  But I don\u2019t want to be shattered if I don\u2019t.  I feel like I must be conceited to think I have a chance, none of my classmates are trying to get into programs as competitive as this one.",

      "text": "Change your thought paradigm to this.\n\nSounds like you gave it your all.  It's now in the hands of fate.  If you don't get it then it wasn't meant to be, but you can say you gave it your best shot.  Yeah you might be disappointed in the end, but it's better than someone who got overwhelmed and just didn't even submit an application.\n\nYou took all the necessary steps.  You've accomplished all of their pre-requisites.  You have more publications than the minimum required.  You **networked** with them.  You're on their radars and it seems like you have nothing but positive reviews about it.\n\nYou did what you could.  Sounds like you're pretty much in, just need to sign at the dotted lines.  But again you don't know until you have a contract in front of you.  But you know you gave it your all.\n\nI did what I could for a top university (some institute of technology in Cambridge).  I networked, I gave it my all.  It wasn't in the cards.  Instead, I was offered an invitation to another R1 university with a professor who was at the top of my field (over 57k citations, a lot of work (and funding), honestly more famous than the professor I wanted to work with, etc...).  3 months before I started, I got another offer from another professor who was a rising star (now a star and with more $$$ for my stipend too) as he heard about me through the grape vines and sought me out.  I ended up going with the second professor as I just couldn't say no (first professor was very understanding and told me \"Wow, he's a great guy and worth working with.  I understand.\".  It was positive terms).\n\nWhen one door closes, others open.  It is what it is.",

      "text": "Despite what you may have been told as a kid, \u201cnot getting your hopes up\u201d cannot let you magically avoid feeling pain/disappointment if things don\u2019t work out. It\u2019s like trying not to feel pain when you stub your toe. Unless you\u2019re a monk who spent decades meditating in a cave, you don\u2019t have voluntary control over either.\n\nWhat you do have control over is how you respond to pain/disappointment if it happens. But there is nothing you can do right now, no amount of \u201cnot getting hopes up\u201d, that will prevent you from feeling disappointment if it doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nSo if there is nothing you can do to prevent the potential future pain of disappointment, there\u2019s no use in dwelling on it right now. Just enjoy the enthusiasm/excitement you have right now, and trust that if it ultimately ends in disappointment future you will be able to handle it.",
