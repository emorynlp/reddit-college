  "text": "When I tell friends and family that I'm really stressed out from grad school, they assume that just means \"oh you've got a lot of assignments to do\" and like, yes that is definitely part of it. But being stressed in grad school is much more than just having a lot of tasks to complete. It's not like in undergrad, when stress meant having a paper due the same week as a bunch of problem sets. In grad school, not only do you have a lot of actual tasks, but as you're doing those tasks, your worth as a scientist and ability to think critically is constantly being judged and evaluated, and it can have a toll on your self-esteem.",

That can be a lot, as you said; it can seem very difficult, depending on how seriously others take it... But the difficulty in grad school, from my perspective, comes in the later years. Up until my 4th year, I was one of those people that thought \"I could see why so many find this difficult, but I really enjoy it! This is great, I enjoy the challenge!\"\n\nAgain, I don't know anything about a graduate poli sci program, what the length is, whether you are Masters or PhD, etc; there are so many variables... But, as advice from a random person who is sitting at the end of a very long road, don't discount what your friends said as the difficult simply being \"a lot\".

You work a 4- or 5-day work week and have clear delineations in your work life and home life.\n\nTo put it another way, there's also alienation of labor. Retail jobs are the most obvious example.

All of this is self directed, and a lot of the 'compensation' you're getting from a graduate program is inherently intertwined with your research experience, vs. executing exactly what you are assigned to.

I'm thinking of jobs like programming or 'data scientist' or architect or engineer or writer or reporter, etc., where there's an end goal but the way to get there might not be entirely clear. \n\nI would add that there is at least one feature of grad school that might make it more stressful, depending on your situation, that I haven't seen mentioned a lot -- the fact that you can't easily quit and move positions like you can in many other jobs. That seems more to do with imbalances in power and hierarchies than the kind of intellectual differences I'm seeing highlighted in other responses.",

Also, some people I worked with were expected to be available all the time: I wasn't, but I was in a culture of constant availability, so I had to put up walls around my personal time.\n\nHowever, it is VERY true that academia doesn't have a 9 to 5 culture at all. You can set boundaries with work hours, and you should, but it's an uphill battle. Unlike a job, you can't move somewhere else in academia and expect a different culture. It's everywhere (though some places are worse than others).\n\nI basically have no choice but to be a 9 to 5 student these days, and it's amazing what it's done for my stress. It's much easier to enforce boundaries. So much more chill than last time I was in grad school. The idea of studying at the weekends or in the evening is just a joke to me now.",
