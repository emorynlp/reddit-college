  "title:": "What Graduate Degrees can a Math Undergrad Apply to?",
  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm a second year undergraduate math student who is also working through a minor in computer science. I've been researching graduate programs and for the sake of being informed I'd like to know what all graduate programs a math undergrad can reasonably apply to. Do any of you know of graduate fields (besides math) which look to admit math undergrads? If you do, is there any set of coursework beyond a standard math degree which would make an applicant more successful?\n\nHere I'm thinking of fields like Economics, Epidemiology, Data Science, Computational Linguistics, Computational Biology, etc. Anything that a math major might go into.\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "STATISTICS. They crave applicants who have taken real analysis. A PhD in Statistics (vs Math) will open up soooo many doors since it's the gateway into data science. I've seen plenty of Statistics PhD grads from institutions that weren't even R2 who bagged 2-3 TT offers immediately upon graduation. And the industry will have shit ton of offers since you have data scientist as a career option. \n\nThe base prereqs for a PhD in Statistics is calc 1-3, linear algebra, and real analysis. if you want to add even more value to your application, try to also take a \"mathematical statistics\" and a \"probability/inference\" course.",

And also prove to yourself, and to them, that you know like it and can be committed to it.\n\nFor example, if you only take macroeconomics and microeconomics, how would you know you really want to do economics for a masters? Same with linguistics. You would want to go beyond whatever exposure you've had to linguistics through your CS courses by doing a linguistics minor.",

      "text": "I would agree Stats and Data Science are good options if you like that. For me, I fell in love with a niche field within Oceanography and that's what I am doing after doing my undergrad in Math. I probably should mention that I didn't like math very much (especially analysis and abstract stuff), so going into something that was more applied math/stats/light machine learning was perfect for me since I had enough background to understand what was going on but my research didn't depend on the nitty gritty of why.\n\nEdit: If you take basics physics, Chem, and bio, you're pretty much set for environmental Sciences. I learned all the Oceanography stuff in grad school and only took like 1 environmental science class in undergrad",
