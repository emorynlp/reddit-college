  "text": "I'm travelling to Nashville and would like to visit Vanderbuilt, however I was wondering how the visitation process works as an undergrad rather than a high schooler? I am not far down the grad school research/application process and wasn't sure how it worked to visit a college as a prospective grad student and wanted to reach out to this thread for any advice/input.  Is it wise to go on the general tours for high schoolers?  At what point in the process of considering/applying to grad schools do you email professors specifically?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help you could offer:)",

      "text": "You should definitely talk with your current professors - they'll have great advice about discipline-specific application procedures.\n\nI'm in social sciences: we don't do visits until you're accepted to a program, at which point accepted students are invited for a few days to meet and learn more. I emailed professors as I was putting together my applications. I wanted to know if they were accepting students for the upcoming cycle. Many did not return my emails, but some did schedule a phone call.\n\nIf you'll be in Nashville, I'd just walk around the campus yourself to get a feel for it. Grad school is a much more specific process than undergrad, so there aren't really established tours in the same way, and you definitely don't want to just drop in on potential supervisors. But definitely talk to your current professors about all of this!",
