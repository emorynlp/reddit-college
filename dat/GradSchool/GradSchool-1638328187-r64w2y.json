  "text": "The day I've been dreading finally happened - my trusty 500GB portable HDD that I've had since 2014 started acting up when I plugged it in to organize some project files. I managed to sweet-talk the little brick into hanging on just long enough to mount a rescue operation for my files, but the initial panic definitely shed a couple of years off my life and I'm not in the mood to go through that again, haha. \n\nI started looking at online reviews but they weren't really helping me out all that much, so I thought I'd ask here for some recommendations and see what other grad students use. What's your daily driver for portable and/or backup storage? How much space do you use? Is a portable SSD worth the extra money in terms of durability? I'm, erm... not too gentle with my electronics (especially when I'm doing fieldwork), so the more armored/dustproof/dumbass proof, the better. Don't think I need more than 1-2TB since I have cloud storage and a desktop for backups, just liked the convenience of having a giant flash drive that could store everything I needed & boot up projects/small programs on with ease. \n\nThanks!",

Although the probability is slim, SSD can fail as well - I have personally experienced that. I wouldn't recommend buying SSD over HDD just for the sake of reliability, but if you do fieldwork, it might be worth it. HDDs don't like to be moved around while in use.",

If you still need more space then consider a small harddrive for project data and a second larger one for regular backups.",
