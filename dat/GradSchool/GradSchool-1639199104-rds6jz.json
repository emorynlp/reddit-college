  "text": "Hi all, I got accepted into a Master program contingent that I enroll into the Graduate Certificate program first, and then if i get a B or higher in the first 3 or 4 courses, they make me a Masters Students. \n\nWith that being said, I still can't afford the Grad Cert program and was looking for recommendations on student loan services/providers that'll pay for a Graduate CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. I already tried Discover and my university declined them saying they dont fund grad certificate programs.",
