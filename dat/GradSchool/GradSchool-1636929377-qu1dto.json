  "text": "I'm currently studying for a Master's in Physics. My school does not offer doctorate degrees in this area, so I have to apply to other schools for my PhD. While working on my applications, I saw that there was a section that says \"Complete the following for any other universities / colleges to which you have applied or are planning to apply (optional)\". Should I fill this out? Would it help or hurt my application? I plan on applying to 8-10 schools",

          "text": "This is what happened to me. People who were accepted at both school A and school B mostly ended up at school B. So when school A found out I was also considering school B, I was put on the wait-list and ultimately rejected bc they viewed me as less likely to accept their offer of admission. Granted they were very much right, I would have totally (and did) accept the offer from school A over B (better resources, closer to civilizations, better grad community, etc.).",

I'm curious because I've never heard of a grad school being so forthcoming. \n\nBut if they didn't actually tell you, then how do you know it wasn't one of a million other factors that put you lower on this list than others?",
