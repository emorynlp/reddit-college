  "title:": "Did y\u2019all invite your advisors to your wedding? Or some wedding related celebration?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my fifth year PhD and I\u2019m getting married in December. My advisor is absolutely fantastic, very understanding that I need to work part time during all this to pay bills, and has repeatedly had my back when higher ups didn\u2019t understand. They\u2019ve also gone to bat that covid delayed my research because all my archives closed for like a year (some still haven\u2019t reopened and they helped me find solid alternatives that are open) and worked to ensure I could delay my teaching requirement a year because they changed the time at the last minute to conflict with my part-time gig (teaching a few history classes at a local private school). Their spouse is one of my other committee members too, specializing in one of the secondary aspects of my thesis. \n\nBut I\u2019m unsure of the protocol here. The wedding is out of town, so I don\u2019t expect they could come, but maybe it\u2019s polite? Alternatively, I\u2019m Jewish and we have a few celebratory events back in my town (my fianc\u00e9e is moving here). One is the l\u2019chaim, basically a fairly casual engagement celebration. The other alternative is one of the sheva brachos, more formal festive meals celebrated for a week after the wedding hosted by close friends. My advisor and their spouse are also Jewish (useful as I\u2019m studying Jewish history), so they do know about these kinds of things. Given how supportive both of them have been, especially my advisor, I feel it may be proper to invite them to something. Any thoughts?",

Over the last ten years or so, I've attended three weddings where the lab group had a table. Always a good time.",

I can't imagine your advisor would be offended even if you broke protocol to invite them. I have a lot of respect for my advisor who has repeatedly gone up to bat for me and has been very generous during the parallelogram. My advisor is also Jewish (convenient for my research too considering I was raised Catholic, his insight has been very valuable) and I wouldn't hesitate to extend an invite to my future non-religious lesbian marriage celebration. I say follow your heart and screw protocol!",

Whether or not he attends depends on a lot of factors, but I know the invitations are appreciated.\n\nSome of my friends who have gotten married invited some of our profs or advisors from undergrad if they had good/close relationships with them, and I feel like grad school the connections you make with faculty are even deeper (at least that's been my experience).\n\nSo, I'm not married yet so take my advice for what it's worth, but I would say if you want to invite your advisor to some or all of your celebrations, go for it! And congratulations!",
