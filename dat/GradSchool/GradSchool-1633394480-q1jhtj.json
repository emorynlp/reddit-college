  "text": "I have one year left of my master\u2019s program for criminology and criminal justice. I see that my school also offers a graduate certificate in forensic psychology which is the career path I would like to go down. Would it make sense to get a graduate certificate in forensic psychology while also getting a Master\u2019s Degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice?\n\nI have an easy in for the doctorate program at my school. They keep trying to push me into that program instead but the stipend isn\u2019t enough for me to live on. I\u2019m also wondering if I could become a forensic psychologist with a PhD in Criminology and CJ or if I should be going into a psychology PhD program. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
