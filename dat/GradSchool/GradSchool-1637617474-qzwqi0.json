I have little to no confidence in my research project and now I have little to no confidence in my writing and critical thinking abilities. I don\u2019t really know what I want out of this post but I just needed to vent somewhere where people would maybe understand.",

They tend to just focus on the stuff that needs improvement and more or less ignore what's good. Since you're passing you're probably doing just fine!",

      "text": "Fellow grad student having a bad day here. My advisor called my manuscript outline \"a mess\". One thing I don't understand is that we've been writing this outline for almost a semester and it ping-ponged with her more than a dozen times. I feel like it's half her fault at this point if it's that much of a mess. She just wants more and more details for even the smallest thing and then complains about it being too long. TBH it's not even an outline anymore, but rather a whole manuscript with sentences separated and bullet-pointed. I'm very confused at this point and am starting to think maybe I'm just a lousy researcher who has no right to be in research.",

That\u2019s amazing! \n\nThe comments you got are meant to be feedback to make you a better researcher. I\u2019m not a fan of all criticism all the time, but it\u2019s definitely common in academia. I\u2019m sorry if no one told you what you did well \u2013 after dealing with that myself, it\u2019s been a personal goal of mine to always include strengths in feedback, not just weaknesses. When I managed people in a lab, I definitely noticed them respond better to that. We work hard, after all, and we deserve to know when our efforts are appreciated. I\u2019d take this experience and use it to learn how to a stronger mentor and supervisor someday. \n\nAll that aside, you passed. Yes, you\u2019re meant to be there! Take a moment to feel proud of yourself. You don\u2019t have to have all the research figured out right now. You can tackle the dissertation one step at a time.",
