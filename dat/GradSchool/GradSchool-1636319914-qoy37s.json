  "title:": "I was offered a position in a lab but it was shut down due to COVID - include in personal statement?",
  "text": "I am applying to PhD programs (neuroscience) and finalizing my personal statement. My lab experience is a bit lacking (didn't start in a lab until this past summer) unfortunately. I was offered a lab position in college but it never materialized because the covid shutdown began about a week before that position was supposed to start. Is that worth putting in my personal statement as rationale for why my lab experience is a little lacking? I have plenty of other experiences to talk about, but feel like admissions will wonder why i didn't start in a lab until recently. help lol",

      "text": "I think a lot of places are quite forgiving at the moment with regards to lack of lab experience. If you feel like it was an achievement to be offered the position, then I say go for it :) I would however say don't put it down if it feels like you are using it as an excuse. Also, you will be competing with a lot of people who also don't have a lot of lab experience because of covid. the fact that you have been working in a lab since summer is a big boost for your application",

      "text": "I had a similar experience in undergrad (cancelled summer research program) and did include it in my personal statements (in fact, I was encouraged to include the offer on my CV by the director of the cancelled summer program, which I did - though I've since removed it after getting into my graduate program). I tried to spin my experience as something that showed my interests and accomplishments, and ultimately focused on how this required me to seek out different creative ways to learn in the COVID academic landscape.",

          "text": "Exactly this, find a way to frame it as showing other good qualities you have. That way you get to mention the acceptance but don\u2019t come across as \u201coh covid woe is me.\u201d For instance, you could talk about how you used the learning experience of applying to the first lab to help you land the position at this most recent lab, and emphasize the kind of transferable skills that could also make you good at applying for and receiving grants and the like.",

Maybe if you started the job you would have shown you deserved to be hired, or maybe you would have proven to have been a hiring mistake and got fired after a week\u2026",
