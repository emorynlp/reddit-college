  "text": "For those who have went to a less prestigious school for undergrad and then went to an Ivy, Oxbridge, or another really prestigious university for grad school, have you ever heard or personally encountered snobbery from undergrads (or anyone else there)? Have you ever been made to feel like you didn't belong? \n\nI'm mainly talking about the attitude that is like: \"You wouldn't have gotten in here for undergrad\" coming from the impression that graduate degrees are typically less competitive (though not necessarily easier!) to get in than many undergrad programs at the Ivies for example.",

      "text": "....actually as a mixed race woman who mostly identifies as black, yes! Especially since I\u2019m only 25, almost 26. I\u2019ve also been an instructor and faced snobbery. I was a grad student at an Ivy League and an adjunct for another. As a humanities scholar, I also teach the classes that students regard as the electives they don\u2019t want to take.\n\nI once created the class text book by compiling open source material and my own personal book scans, and sending it to a printing company. So the book was free digitally or they could get a printed copy with a ticket for like $5. I had a student email the DEAN and say that free open source material wasn\u2019t rigorous enough for the class standard. Whether this was because ITV was Ivy leaguer or that student was a dick but the dean called me to laugh. He saw the textbook was anything but.\n\nBut on a regular basis, undergrads wouldn\u2019t necessarily know I was a grad student or a professor. So I\u2019d ask a student in the large lectures I was TAing for to not block the door and get flat out \u201cwhys?\u201d At the bus stop, undergrads would weirdly hit on me with snobby attitudes. \n\nBut the worst part is that many of them DO assume that getting into grad school is easy. Especially for them, since they are IVY league. I had a student say she didn\u2019t need to register for a library account or even learn what databases were because she was going into accounting.\n\nAnother source of the snobbery is that they believe they are paying us grad students lots of money. So I should be greatful. And I get to tell them that they don\u2019t pay me anything! I get paid less to teach and research than you paid to take this class. Your money is not in my pocket, my pockets are empty. That may seem like a bad thing (and it is!) but it also means I have no fear. I have nothing, *nothing,* to lose. So I will grade however I wish! \n\n\u201cI pay your salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHAHAHA.....I HAVE NO SALARY!....YOUR TUITION HAS *NO POWER HERE*\u201d",

So far my teaching evals have been pretty good, with occasional sexist/bs comments from students about how they think my \u201cpersonality isn\u2019t enthusiastic enough\u201d or some shit. (I\u2019m a child abuse survivor and am rather soft-spoken sometimes.)

I just finished my MS at a mediocre state school has a \\~90% acceptance rate and a \\~60% graduation rate. When my undergrad experience came up to undergrads, it basically was a shock to them. Of course, this happened maybe twice, since I only TAed 2 classes for 150 students, and only \\~3 ever showed up for office hours (the students just did not care about anything).\n\nTo my peers, they might have been a little bit weirded out. I would explain that my undergrad was a joke, which might have come across like humble bragging. Ultimately, I do not think it changed their perception of me much, because I did finish my MS degree on time and they saw me do well in class.\n\nI am now \"moving up in the world\" to a UC that has a program in the top 5 nationwide of my subfield.

And there was almost the same number of graduate students applications in 2020 as undergraduate students applications. Many graduate students are funded, so you are literally competing for funding with thousands of applicants when you apply for graduate studies, while undergraduate students are literally one of the main sources of income for universities. Only 1/4 of *UK* undergraduate students at Oxford received any type of funding to pursue their studies while over 50% of *all* their graduate students are receiving funding. Let's not forget that the evaluation criteria for undergraduate students are far more relaxed than for graduate students where \\*all\\* your academic work + work experience + publications + research experience + references + etc are taken into account.

                  "text": "> Sometimes the students make comments about how I wouldn\u2019t understand their courses because I did so much easier stuff for my degree. They can also raise doubts over my ability to supervise them\n\nI'm honestly surprised by this. You're the students' TA and the students have the gall to talk shit to you to your face?! I mean as a TA you have some authority over the students, possibly in terms of grading. You'd think the students wouldn't want to piss off the TA in case the TA turns out to be vindictive and takes it out on the student's grades. Not that you would do that, but TAs do have some authority, even if it's very little. The TA could mention this behavior to the professor and in the event the student needs something from the professor, the professor might refuse because of the shitty behavior.\n\nNot to mention, as a grad student you're literally specializing in the field that the undergrads are either just taking a class or two in, or just an undergrad degree. You were selected by their very same professors to do research with them, the undergrads weren't! And you're at the same institution as them!! Logically I don't even see how they could look down on you!\n\nEven if you ignore all that, it's just plain rude for students to behave like that. Are students really that shitty of human beings at Oxbridge?",

Their entire grade for the entire degree rests on a small number of exams in the final year only. They do have assignments and I do mark them and give feedback, but those marks are not recorded anywhere. At best, I give predicated grades in my final report which *might* influence grade assignment in very extreme cases like severe illness in a pandemic, but otherwise has no real effect.\n\nI have effectively no power and they know it. \n\nAnd since the lecturers do not assign grades either, there wouldn\u2019t be much point complaining (although I have already raised the issue). Students have effectively no interaction with lecturers beyond lectures - I am their supervisor and am responsible for teaching them beyond lectures. Exams are graded independently too and whether a student is an asshole doesn\u2019t factor in at all.\n\nI\u2019m sure most students are okay, but the bad ones are really bad. Also, students are assigned per college and I tend to pick up a lot of Trin students, who are the most arrogant by far.",

Including new money.\n\nThe fact that you think the US has \"old money\" shows that you don't understand the gulf between US and UK ideas of class. The US has no old money by any UK standard. You're all nouveau riche *at best*. The aristocrats of the UK look at the \"old money\" of the US with pity and shame for how tacky and low class they are. The Rothschilds are about as close as you get in the US and they **are not** considered old money in the UK. \n\nThe aristocracy and nobility play a large role in Oxbridge, and they are classes that you can **never** aspire to. No amount of money buys you a place, no OBE, and you can't even marry in because all you'd do is drag them down to your lower class. If you're not already a member of the peerage then you never can be. If you are born lower class then you are guaranteed to die lower class.\n\nThat distinction does not exist in the US because you lack peers, and you lack the aristocracy, nobility, and royalty in general. So you have no hard divide between classes that can never be crossed and you end up believing in this notion of improving your class - being born working class and dying upper-middle class. That is not something you see in the UK. You're born working class and you die a slightly wealthier working class.\n\nAnd as others have said, the pomp and formality at Oxbridge isn't limited to some special club. It's mandatory for all students, all year long. There are Latin graces and High Tables and 5 different kinds of spoon for dinner and archaic rules over who can drink the 70 Bordeaux from the Auruchs horn. Everyone must follow the hidden rules and it's obvious which people are lower class because they don't know the rules. I mean, it's not that uncommon that I have to check with [Debrett's](https://www.debretts.com/expertise/etiquette/dress-codes/white-tie-dress-code/) to make sure I get a dress code correct or that I know the correct form of address for an event.",

You are expected to have and wear a dinner jacket (tuxedo) quite frequently (though not really curing covid) for formal dinners, may balls, and other events. It\u2019s truly entrenched In the system here and it\u2019s very alienating often for students from different backgrounds to suddenly be thrust into situations where you are eating 12 course meals in a dinner jack and academic gown and the correct way to drink port etc. But even before formals happen, you can tell someone\u2019s class very easily by their accent and everyone here just sort of unconsciously sorts you into your class \u2018box.\u2019 There isn\u2019t the same awareness around class in the us that exists here. Unless someone truly speaks poorly, you cannot really identify anyone class by their accent alone in the us.\n\nI imagine due to the nature of the eating clubs at Princeton just like our dining clubs, they\u2019re exclusive and not something most people are exposed to. Most people are exposed to the formal dinners and expected (at least socially) to attend them with their friends at least a few times a year. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in both the us and the uk, and in my experience the way the class system works here is vastly different and much more present in the uk.",

I'm here at the same internship you are. You went to a no name school with next to no reputation in your field. Its clear to me you got here because you have talent. Do I have the same talent? Or did the word princeton on my resume get me here? And did I deserve to get in to princeton? Was it really just dumb luck? Or was it because of who my father was? I don't know and that's killing me\".\n\nHe said that kind of constant self doubt does a number on your self esteem and drive, which coupled with the course load can lead to burnout real fast.",

She stayed with us for a while to save money on hotels while visiting hospitals in the northeast and she admitted the whole *job application* process was going to set her back like $5k.\n\nIdk how people afford any sort of professional graduate school (med, law, pharmacy, etc) without being independently wealthy or lucky enough to have had a full ride for undergrad where they don\u2019t have to worry as much about adding more debt onto them.
