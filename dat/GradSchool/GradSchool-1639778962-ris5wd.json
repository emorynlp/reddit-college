  "title:": "Are Grad Assistantships hard to get?",
  "text": "I was accepted into the grad program of my dream months ago but upon viewing my\nfinancial aid package, I realized it was much too expensive. I had settled on going elsewhere. \n\nLast week, however, I received an email inviting me to apply to be a GA. The GA position would be just enough for me to cover the cost of tuition for the program and I\u2019d be able to attend it. So of course, I jumped at the opportunity. \n\nI\u2019m a first-gen navigating all things college on my own so I had never heard of a graduate assistantship. Outside of needing 3 recs, the application is pretty straight forward. Still, I called my admissions counselor and asked for more info and whether or not it was competitive. She made it seem as if being a GA was a pretty easy thing to do. She said things like \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be an academic role. We even have GAs serving in the admissions office with us.\u201d She told me I could list \u201cno preference\u201d for the question that asked about what position I\u2019d like to work in. \n\nShe made it like filling the application and getting the recs was just a formality and getting a spot would be easy. However, everywhere I look online says that assistantships were competitive and were hard to get.\n\nI plan to complete the application regardless but I just wonder if I\u2019m getting my hopes up for nothing. While I am not at the bottom of the barrel, nothing in my academic is especially remarkable either. I\u2019m a relatively average student with an average resume and GPA. \n\nAnybody have an experience with applying for assistantships? Any input is appreciated.",

      "text": "It really just depends on the institution. At my last university, GA positions were super easy to get. You just had to accept the position. I didn\u2019t get one my first semester but it turns out I just had to inquire about it and let them know I was interested in a position when the information was sent about it in an email. My GA through my second year of my master\u2019s was a low fuss grading position. At my current uni, you just get assigned to a class and can accept this position or not. Responsibilities can be anything from leading classes to simple grading responsibilities. But I\u2019ve also heard that positions are competitive at other universities.\n\nSorry this isn\u2019t a straightforward answer, but it just really depends on where you\u2019re at.",

      "text": "A lot of graduate schools provide full support on an assistanship. Students get tuition paid, health insurance, and a stipend that covers basic living expenses on a graduate assistanship. The responsibilities of the assistanshtip generally provide a significant learning experience. \n\nYou should only go to graduate school at a place that gives you this kind of arrangement.\n\nThe program that you have been accepted to probably provides an assistantship to most or all students. You just need to apply. Your director of graduate studies will help provide context and direction. The admissions counselor is putting you on the right track and is a good person to get you oriented. They are there to help you succeed, in particular to fill in the gaps that make you feel uncertain.",

          "text": "I'm a physics grad student and all the offers I got when applying to grad programs also all offered TA/RA appointments (with health care and waived tuition/classes), just as you stated. I know this is quite common in physics programs as profs teaching gen-phys classes with hundreds of students per section need TAs to grade and run the labs and the profs need RAs to do research. But is this common in other fields (history/arts, buisiness, bio, CS, etc...)? I honestly don't know, that's why I'm asking.",

      "text": "An assistantship should fully cover your tuition (via \"tuition remission\") and should also provide you a stipend (it'll be small, but enough to pay the rent and eat so whatever). If you're in the US, it may likely cover health insurance as well (but it'll probably be basic to average insurance). Typically this only takes place in PhD programs, which in the US will also involve getting a masters. \n\nBasically, the deal with the assistantship is that you get all that in return for working for the university. The hours are often pretty rough, but it can be anything. TA's (teaching assistant, where you're helping teach/grade a course) are common. RA's (research assistant, where you're doing research on behalf of a professor) are better for your career but are harder to get. In general, these are all competitive, but it depends on school/type/professor/etc. I would recommend applying despite competitiveness: it sounds like your academic advisor is confident, and it's a fantastic deal.\n\nThe application/recs can be a formality if you already have an in: if a tenured professor says they want you working for them, the application process doesn't super matter, their word is plenty. Otherwise, you'll want to triple-check your CV, do well on the GRE, get your recs, and pull up/maintain your GPA while you still can. \n\nHopefully this answers your questions, but feel free to reply/ping with more.\n\n(pinging u/origional_esseven, since they mentioning wondering similar things)",

      "text": "Assistantships only tend to be as hard to get as it is to get into the school in the first place. In my experience the majority of grad students do assistantships, and everyone I know in my program is doing a TA. It's pretty much impossible to have a full time job and do grad school at the same time and schools know that.\n\nIt depends a lot on the school but I think most are pretty good about emphasizing you are a student first and not completely overloading you. I only teach about 5.5 hours a week, with office hours and grading I probably only do about 9-10 hours of teaching work a week and quite a lot more on school. That gives me free tuition and a stipend big enough to cover living expenses. I also get cheap health insurance through the grad student organization. \n\nI'd ask your admissions counselor if there is a student doing a GA you could talk to about their experience.",

      "text": "It depends on both the field on and the schools. For a PhD program you should not accept a position if it does not include a GA position. For masters programs GA positions are less common, but they still may try to offer them to top prospects.  If you have experience in a skill that is needed in a lot of departments (grant writing, statistical analysis, programing) you will have a good chance of finding a GA position but it might not come with a full tuition stipend.",

All PhD programs worth anything will likely pay you a stipend, cover tuition and other costs, and sometimes provide free health insurance. \nThis is less common for MAs. \nFrom my experience: I applied for two cycles (this is my second) for social science PhD programs. I was admitted to four places last year all with livable stipends and tuition waivers. I ended up accepting a 1 year MA program and that was also funded. \nTypically this is not a separate application, but something included in your acceptance.",

Some \u201cservice assistantships\u201d (admissions is an example) might not cover everything you want/need because they responsibilities or hours are less than, say, a teaching assistantship. If cost is a factor, let them know you are looking for an assistantship that at LEAST covers tuition and health insurance so you dont get suckered into something that covers half of tuition and no health insurance, like my school tried to do with me",
