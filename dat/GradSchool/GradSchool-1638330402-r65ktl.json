  "text": "I\u2019m a first year grad student and had to write a ten page paper for a class. It was the first time I\u2019ve written an academic paper since I graduated undergrad around 4 years ago. I spent weeks and long hours reading papers and writing what I thought was a really good paper and making sure every thing that needed to be was backed up by citations and references. After I turned it in I realized I some how combined APA and AMA citation styles (alphabetical numbered APA references in the bibliography but numeric in-text citations???) I talked to professor and will probably just get a grade ding since I did throughly reference all my sources but smh we learned how to cite in what? Middle school? I\u2019m dumb.",

      "text": "Wait, why would you get a grade ding over something like this? Its a mistake yeah, but hardly something that critically affects your scholarship. For that matter, why can't your prof just let you resubmit this after fixing it. Or just... acknowledge the error was noted, and move on? I make a million silly mistakes all the time in my writing. Especially since writing for grad school courses involves doing fairly complex work under significantly shorter timeframes. Its not like this sort of mistake is unfixable in any real world academic situation. If a publisher noticed it, you'd just cure it before publication and that would be the end of it. So why is your professor penalizing you for this?\n\nI routinely make idiotic mistakes. It happens. There's minor casual errors all the time, especially with large writing projects that you construct over multiple sittings, and so have dissonances due to the interrupted trains of thought. And I have friends who are much deeper into their careers, and they routinely make mistakes too. Its part of being human.",

Moreover, if the paper is meant to be published in a journal, the citations will likely have to be re-done anyway so the entire issue is pointless from the get-go.  \n\nI can't think of a single professor I've had who has said anything other than \"make sure the citations and neat and orderly - other than that I don't really care.\"",
