  "text": "Hey guys, so I've been going to college to study psychology and I also have a podcast on the side talking about all things mental health, depression, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal thoughts and positive affirmations resulting from young adult mental health. I started this podcast at the beginning on my freshman year, kind of to show my journey through as a college student mentally. Anyways I started telling others on my campus about the podcast and it caught on like wildfire, the other students loved it. We started having listening sessions and it helped a lot out mentally. Anyways my family found out about my podcast and started questioning me about it, saying I need to continue getting my degree (which I am), saying that I'm over sharing or people don't care what I have to say about mental health, the podcast won't last long etc. For a while it really hurt my feelings because I put my all into my podcast for the last ten months and hearing that from loved ones hurt me but I don't care anymore. I want to show everyone how much college students go through mentally to just survive college, I want them to know about our loneliness, burnout moments, long hours of work. I also want to share my podcast with you guys because it helped so many of my close friends in college, life is hard as a student and i want to give you this resource to at least help you through the bad nights. I really appreciate anyone reading this post, it just this podcast means the world to me and I want you guys help show its true potential. \n\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN5SpmvW8aXeZNdC93mZKgg\n\nThe podcast also streams on all streaming platforms: Spotify, Google podcast, stitcher, Apple etc.",
