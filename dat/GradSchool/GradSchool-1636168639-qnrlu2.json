  "text": "I have a GRFP and am pretty proud of it, but I also really don't want to be boastful and obnoxious. I try to avoid bringing it up in conversation unless it's to offer reading over an application. Saying \"NSF Graduate Research Fellow\" is a lot cooler than just putting \"Graduate Student\" in my email signature, but I also cringe that it's there with every email I send, even short casual ones. Is this too much? Would you think someone was an asshat if they wrote you an email with this in the signature and you didn't know them?",

Personally, I am not comfortable doing so. \n\nMy signature only has my name, title (doctoral student), program, university, and a link to my website (my university provides each student with a professional website). My website includes a copy of my CV, research interests, publications, past and current projects.",

I wouldn't even notice any fellowships mentioned, especially if they aren't related to what is being actively discussed. Even if I did, I wouldn't judge you negatively for having it in your signature.",
