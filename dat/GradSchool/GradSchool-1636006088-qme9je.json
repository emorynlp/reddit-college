  "text": "Hi all,\nSome supplemental info: I graduated with my Bachelors this past May. Some time later I decided to fill out an application for the computer science graduate program at the same college. After like three months of waiting and hassle, I was denied for reasons unknown. I looked around for other places to go, but as it turns out the same school that denied me is the best place for me to do it. So after some asking around at the graduate admissions office and comp sci department, it was recommended that I take the GRE and take some classes to raise my GPA. A GPA of 3.0 or above and a GRE quant score of 151 is what\u2019s preferred. My GPA as of now is 2.98 and GRE score will hopefully be over 151. I\u2019m considering taking one or two winter classes as a non matriculated student in order to boost my GPA. Would the classes do this? The other option is to take a math class in the spring that is a prerequisite for an introductory class I\u2019d have to wait for the fall to take, all as a non matriculated student. It would cost way too much money and time so I\u2019m not even really considering it. Thanks for your help.",
