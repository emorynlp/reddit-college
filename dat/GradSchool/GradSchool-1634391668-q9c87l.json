  "text": "I\u2019m currently doing my masters and it\u2019s history based. A lot of readings, presentations and writing. I was wondering what a healthy working schedule is like? So far I\u2019ve been doing something like 9am-5pm mon-fri, but I also study on weekends. Is this normal?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts and suggestions. Thanks!",

      "text": "a healthy study schedule is definitely an individual thing. you will hear a lot of people talk about being up late into the night/early morning working and studying. Unless I\u2019m on a time crunch, I personally avoid working past 9pm. I\u2019ve never set a strict window of time for working, but it\u2019s a good habit to establish boundaries for yourself. \n\nimo a healthy study schedule is one where you can successfully accomplish what you want/need to without feeling overly pressured and without disturbing your other daily tasks/sleep schedule.",
