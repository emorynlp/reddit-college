  "text": "I feel stuck. I don\u2019t like the life I have two decent jobs, neither are fulfilling. I just started a grad program that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m passionate about. I was feeling regret before the program even started. \n\n\nI\u2019m considering restarting an undergrad program this time far away (MA, currently in TN). There\u2019s not a ton of opportunit\u00e9s for dance in Tennessee and I just feel stifled. Am I being too drastic? Probably, but I feel like I just need out.",
