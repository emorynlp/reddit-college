  "title:": "Did anyone think they hated research but later found they were just in a bad living situation?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve wanted to do research since I did my own undergrad research project. I genuinely enjoyed it, and that\u2019s what made me pursue my MA and PhD. I also wanted to be a teacher ever since I was little, so being able to do both seemed like the perfect job. I know that the prospect for TT jobs is terrible, but regardless I\u2019m starting to have trouble distinguishing between burn out, hatred for research and teaching, and being in a terrible situation. I think before the pandemic I was doing pretty well. But so much has changed in the last couple years.\n\nI\u2019m so miserable about where I am stuck right now. I\u2019m in a bleak hellhole of a republican state that handled the covid crises terribly. Maybe 5% of the people in my apartment complex wore a mask throughout the pandemic. I spent nearly a full year in my apartment, never going out, never doing anything, always masking and avoiding people, and then got long covid. I never encountered anyone, so either it was left in the air of the apartment or I didn\u2019t clean a surface well enough. I\u2019ve hated myself for getting sick ever since, even though it\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m stuck here. But my mind was never the same after that. The brain fog I had mostly cleared but I\u2019m very prone to depression, anxiety, fatigue, and even mood swings I don\u2019t think I ever had. I don\u2019t leave the house anymore except for occasional walks and to go to campus for things, because I\u2019m tired of being judged for wearing a mask and being put in danger by the half or so of the population that remains unvaxxed (this is the kind of place where, within 5 minutes of stepping downtown, you will get sneezed on for wearing a mask and catcalled for not wearing a mask. And if you think that's a joke, that is what happened to me the first time I decided to walk home from school.). But is my misery from covid? Or the fact that I\u2019ve been stuck inside for 2 years? Or that I hate doing my PhD? Or is it just that I hate where I live and the only thing motivating me to finish is that I never have to step back in this sorry excuse for a state ever again?\n\nI want nothing more than to be able to get out of this state, but I really want to just finish my PhD too. I\u2019m really hoping that I just hate living here so much that it\u2019s clouding my ability to enjoy things, so I\u2019ve been applying for postdocs and the like, but what if I\u2019m wrong? What if I get into a better situation, where I feel safer and more alive, and I still hate what I\u2019m doing? Is it bad if the reason I want to finish is to leave here? Does that mean I really don\u2019t want to do this anymore?\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Were you in a bad situation in grad school that turned around after going to a new institution or a new place to live?",

      "text": "Do you have student health insurance? Because if you do your university counseling center should have a list of providers who accept it that they should be able to refer you to. A lot of outside providers are offering virtual counseling.\n\nAlternatively could you make a plan to move out of state? Where you live has a HUGE impact on mental health and I think it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world to want to live somewhere with a culture that jives with you. Academics act like having geographic preferences for where you live is unreasonable and IT IS NOT. Plenty of grad students move away from where their university is when they reach the dissertation or thesis writing stage or if they\u2019re done with classes and all their work is computational. Having a plan to move away somewhere you would be happier before the end of your degree could help you see some kind of light at the end of the tunnel and that alone might improve your mental health now.",

          "text": "Unfortunately the only virtual counseling I could be directed to was some sort of app that pulls random therapists for one-time sessions, so nothing scheduled or regular. That's really not what I want. \n\nI'm planning to move out of state the second I graduate, but until then it just isn't realistic unfortunately. I have on campus obligations this semester and would have to apply to keep doing my work off campus. Unfortunately I also have to regularly go to campus for diss. materials. I just keep picturing getting out of here eventually and hoping if I work hard enough I can get a good postdoc somewhere else.",

And if you live in a gloomy wintry climate, make sure you get out and walk at times when the sun is out.\n\nI'm not discounting whatever effects covid had on your health. But staying in your apartment and not getting regular physical activity for 2 years can be just as bad. If you get out and walk *every* day, most likely in a month you'll start to feel better. Then keep it up from there.",

I agree it's difficult to really tease out which things are contributing to your unhappiness. I think you have the right idea to apply for postdocs (in places that are a better match for your values and living needs). This will give you the opportunity to see if maybe it was just location, without giving up your career ambitions just yet.
