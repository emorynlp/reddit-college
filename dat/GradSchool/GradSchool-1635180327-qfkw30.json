  "text": "I have an undergraduate degree in communications and currently work as a marketing coordinator. I have worked on a couple of blogs, SEO, filming Facebook Live chats, and made print and digital ads.\n\nMost programs I am looking at require 3 examples of work but I'm not sure what examples to include. One program wanted a long form research paper which thankfully I have one I completed in undergrad, but that's a 24 page paper that took a few weeks to complete. It feels like most of my other work examples don't hold the same weight as that.\n\nOne program said they value a video statement of purpose over a written one so that makes me think to include more video content but I also want the portfolio to be well balanced with different works.\n\nDoes anyone have any examples of what they put in their marketing portfolio I could look at? Or any suggestions?",
