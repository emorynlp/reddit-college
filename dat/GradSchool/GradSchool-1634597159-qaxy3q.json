  "text": "I do not mean to sound like a complainer at all & I know I should be grateful to be in grad school. I was recently diagnosed with depression. This is my first time dealing with this. I have no motivation to do anything other than lay on my couch. I still force myself to get my assignments done, but it takes all my willpower to write even a sentence. If anyone feels comfortable, if you\u2019ve going through depression in grad school, how did you do it? I need advice from those who\u2019ve been in my shoes. I\u2019m struggling more than most know.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in grad school now but have had depression since I was ~12. Usually therapy is the first step in dealing with depression. You can check out your school counseling center (usually free but might be backed up as a result) or you can find a therapist you feel comfortable talking to off campus. Psychologytoday.com is a good place to look off campus, and you can sort by insurance company. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s weird seeing a therapist if you never have before, but they\u2019re genuinely not there to judge you or anything. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with whoever you see first, it\u2019s okay to try other therapists to find a \u201cgood fit.\u201d Also, your school counseling center might have support groups for students who are struggling with depression. Sometimes it helps a lot just to know that you\u2019re not the only one (and it really helps to see that in real life vs. just knowing it theoretically). \n\nAlso, I know it\u2019s stigmatized but honestly I wish I\u2019d gotten on medication earlier. Again I\u2019ve had depression for years so mine is a bit more complicated, but if this is the first time you\u2019re experiencing it, sometimes meds are just temporary (a few months to a year) to kickstart your brain again. And if you need them for longer than that, that\u2019s okay too. There\u2019s a lot of fear-mongering around meds and how they\u2019ll \u201cchange you\u201d but the reality is more like\u2026if you can\u2019t make your own serotonin, store-bought is fine \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It can be frustrating because different meds work for different people, so sometimes there\u2019s a bit of trial and error, but finding the right meds can really help with what you\u2019re describing about feeling like you just can\u2019t get motivated no matter how hard you try. \n\nHope this helps and that you start feeling better soon! \u2764\ufe0f",

          "text": "Also! You\u2019re not ungrateful for feeling depressed right now. It\u2019s incredibly common to struggle with mental health in grad school. I know for me at least, it brings up a lot of feelings like fear of failure and imposter syndrome (feeling like you\u2019re not supposed to be there and the program must\u2019ve made a mistake letting you in). And unfortunately a lot of people feel that way - but a lot of us hide it because we feel like we shouldn\u2019t feel that way. I\u2019ve had a few instances where I was shocked to learn that other people in my program were struggling in the same way, but it\u2019s really common.",

              "text": "Ugh. My main struggle personally is that my PI and supervisor are doing their best to be supportive and reassure me that it\u2019s their jobs to basically listen to me feeling sorry for myself but I can\u2019t bring myself to actually trust their word and believe that I\u2019m not just being a huge burden on the lab. I\u2019m also struggling with the fact I basically was depressed during the whole summer and unproductive and now everyone must be under the impression that I talk the talk but can\u2019t walk the walk or get anything done. Oh, and I\u2019m in a Master\u2019s so all that data I didn\u2019t analyze can\u2019t go into the thesis due at the end of next year\u2026 And not comparing one\u2019s self to other in an unstructured environment is nearly impossible, and the other Master\u2019s student seems to be much closer to her supervisor (something I resent them AND my own supervisor for), and I\u2019m pretty sure she gets to call some of the shots in her project and isn\u2019t giving her supervisor or our PI nearly as many problems as I am. So yeah. Feeling like a failure all around and it practically feels like I should have therapy every day instead of every week. Fun times. \n\nAll that to say we're probably all our own worst enemies. And 100% I get how it feels like we shouldn\u2019t feel this way. That\u2019s one of the things I struggle with too, and it\u2019s probably the worst thing about reinforcing the narrative of failure I keep having in my head. If this doesn\u2019t sort itself out\u2026 no way in hell am I doing a PhD. I\u2019ll pivot and go into engineering or something. That, at least, sounds like pain I\u2019d actually find fun instead of soul-sucking.",

Please do remember to have compassion for yourself and what you are going through, you are not alone. Couch times are ok and normal and it is ok to rest! \n\nBeing in the privileged position to be in grad school, I experience guilt for how lucky I am and how I should be doing so much more.  One of the hardest things for me has been comparing my current level of motivation/productivity with how I was in the past or how I think others are doing. With things going remote since the pandemic, it's been isolating and tough to reach out and have the connections that helped support me in getting through the harder times.  \n\nOne thing that has helped me manage the depression is having a routine for physical activity to get me out of the house. I am lucky to have two dogs who make sure I get up and take them for walks regularly.     \n\n\nHere I've written more words in this comment than I have all week for my thesis. Looking forward to see what others may have to share in this thread.  Thanks for bringing this to light.  <3",

It got much worse during grad school, and it\u2019s very common for grad school to take a serious toll on your mental health so please don\u2019t feel guilty for \u201ccomplaining.\u201d Motivation is the hardest when you\u2019re depressed, so the fact that you\u2019re doing anything at all and staying caught up with your assignments is huge. You should give yourself credit for that. \n\nEveryone is different so you have to find what works for you, but for me I find I need to treat my depression like any other illness. When it\u2019s really bad, I try to take time off or take things really easy. When it\u2019s not as bad, I try to get done as much as possible. Trying to incorporate self care and time management practices into your life can help too. I also highly recommend therapy if you can, and don\u2019t be ashamed to try out different medications. I would be non-functional without meds. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you want any more specific advice. You\u2019re right that you\u2019re going to have to struggle more than people who aren\u2019t depressed, but I also want you to know it IS possible to make it through grad school with depression.",

      "text": "Discussing and treating your depression deserves the same weight as discussing any other health problem, and I\u2019m sorry for the stigma that leads us to feel otherwise. \nTalking about your mental health and looking for support is not complaining \u2013 please don\u2019t feel like you need to minimize what you\u2019re going through. You are doing the right thing by having this discussion. It can be challenging to have, so be proud of yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s good news that you have a diagnosis. I know that\u2019s weird to say, but a diagnosis means treatment. Like any illness, you will need that, and like many health issues, there can be some trial and error before you find what works for you. \n\nIf you\u2019re not therapy, I would highly recommend it. Keep in mind that it can take talking to a few before you find the right one for you. That\u2019s okay, the most important thing is to find someone you feel comfortable opening up to. I find people sometimes feel a little hesitant to try it, but it is so worth it to have the guidance of an expert as you navigate this. It\u2019s also worthwhile to carve out an hour every week or every few weeks to focus on yourself. If you need any suggestions or help finding therapy options, feel free to let me know. I know it can be hard. Honestly, that initial call can be the hardest part. \n\nMedication is another option, and worth discussing with your doctor if you haven\u2019t. Therapy and medication can be a very powerful combo. \n\nAs far as grad school goes, you have a health issue. If you believe you will need accommodations, it\u2019s worth going through your school\u2019s process to request them. You don\u2019t deserve to be dinged on stuff because you\u2019re working on treating a diagnosed health problem. \n\nYou will have to give yourself the space and grace to be imperfect as you work through this. I think part of the struggle can be breaking the feedback loops that just slowly wear you down. Stopping those is huge, but it\u2019s not immediate. \n\nYou\u2019ll slowly find what works for you. It may be very deliberately scheduling time for things like exercise, time outside, hobbies, etc. Even if you feel like you\u2019re behind, you have to give yourself a break from work. Getting rest helps. \n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble focusing, you could try something like the Pomodoro Method. That can help you stay on task *and* take breaks. \n\nI know it seems like a lot right now. Some days you\u2019ll just be putting one foot in front of the other, but you\u2019re working on this and it will get better. You\u2019ll find what works for you and you\u2019ll feel the fog start to lift. \n\nIn the meantime, be well.",

Sometimes it\u2019s how you deal with stress, handle criticism, and lack rounding out life.  A lot of times it\u2019s boundaries as grad students feel they can\u2019t have them and take care of themselves while being successful.  For me, it was all the above.\n\nTherapy, self care, meds, and a lab that doesn\u2019t prioritize its own needs over yours.  PIs think they are saving the world.  They are not.  It\u2019s school.  \n\nThe biggest thing that changed for me was realizing it\u2019s school and that I also mattered.  Papers came eventually.  And for those without papers?  They still graduated.  It\u2019s school.  Unless you\u2019re a rare lab that is on the Nobel track, you are literally adding a word or two in the sentence of your field.  People take it seriously and put too much of their self worth into it.\n\nYou matter.  Treat you right and the rest will follow.  And for those who disagree with caring for yourself, fuck them.\n\nGrad school depression is real.  It\u2019s very real.  You are not whining and you are not alone.",
