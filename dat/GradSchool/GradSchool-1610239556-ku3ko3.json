Every morning when I wake up, I feel a sense of impeding doom knowing I have classes that day. Every class, meeting, or presentation I open my mouth at, I feel like the dumbest person on earth. \n\nMy cohort members are all smart and talk about how \"this program is easy as f\\*\\*k\" and how it \"lets literally anyone in.\" It makes me feel even more stupid because it's not easy for me, and it makes me really feel like I had nothing to offer coming into this program because they let everyone in anyways. \n\nIt's only a two year program so I'm going to try my best, but man. This sh\\*t is hard.",

There's a lot of people I encountered who were just acting with a 'can't show weakness' attitude.  One guy like that went back home, we all thought he had graduated, and he started teaching.  Come to find out it was on contingency to him finishing, and he hadn't actually done any work on his thesis.  Also, some people are just pretentious dicks.  That's just a nasty fact of life, and we're all going to have to deal with them at some point.  How you react to it, however, by either letting it get into your way, or by letting their attitude be THEIR problem, is on you.  Finally, don't mix up big vocabulary with the substance of what they're saying.  I've also met a LOT of people who can spout out a dictionary but can't think their way out of a paper bag.  So start paying attention to WHAT is said and HOW, and whether they match up, or if the words are a mask.  If you have a question, YOU'RE IN THE PLACE TO ASK THEM.  If you have an idea, YOU'RE IN THE PLACE TO STATE IT (just also be willing to defend that you had the idea, but also humble enough to be willing to be proven wrong).  Worry about professor and advisor feedback, and fuck everyone else.  They aren't getting your degree, you are.    \n\n\nSo let it be hard, be honest with yourself.  It's not easy, or it wouldn't be fucking graduate school with a barrier to entry.  They don't let ANYONE in, they let in who they think will be good for the program.

They honestly might be deflecting from those feelings and the possibility of appearing as they are struggling, by saying stuff like that.\n\nTry and remember that grad school is competitive, and you would not have been accepted if the faculty did not feel that you were capable of being there. Even if cohort members say that anyone can get in. That's very likely not true. If you're really feeling like you're struggling, maybe speak with your supervisor? I know how hard it can be to ask for help, especially because in my case I never want to bring attention to the fact that I'm struggling, but that is part of what they're there for. \n\nGood luck.

It was comforting to hear my professor say he spends more than 5 hours.",
