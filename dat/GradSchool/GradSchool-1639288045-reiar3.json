  "text": "Hi, sorry English isn't my first language. I'm from Malaysia. I graduated in SUNY Buffalo in May 2020.\n\nWhile I'm fortunate enough to study abroad in the US as an undergrad, and have my parents to support me financially all the way through, I feel ashamed at myself that I couldn't get a job in the US. I had to return to my home country after graduation. That's where I started my grad school in Malaysia (for 2 reasons - cheap and it's close to home). I  dropped out temporary after completed my first semester, it was  completely virtual (they've changed it to online classes a week before the semester started). I took a leave of absence for one year (until March 2022), hoping I could find some work in Malaysia.\n\nUnfortunately, reality is often disappointing.  I couldn't find a job in Malaysia either despite everything I've done. Construction sector was badly impacted by the surge in COVID-19 (even now, it still is). That's  where my father let me to work in his company, to gain some practical experience. I tried to learn as much as I could while working there.\n\nAnd now, it's almost a year since I took a leave of absence. I'm not sure  if I should continue my Master's, or to drop out for good. I feel uncertain about my future. I'm not sure about my path after getting my Master's.\n\nAny advice would be fine here.",

      "text": ">Hi, sorry English isn't my first language.\n\nYour English is splendid. \n\n>I feel ashamed at myself that I couldn't get a job in the US\n\nDon't feel this way, please. I implore you. Even during the best of times the job market can be tough. Things are improving slightly but they're still not what they were pre-COVID. Do not be down on yourself because of this.\n\n>Construction sector was badly impacted by the surge in COVID-19 (even now, it still is).\n\nI dream of being an exploration geologist but unfortunately those jobs are really hard to come by right now. But I'm about to do another job to keep busy and to make a little money until I can find the job I enjoy. \n\n>to gain some practical experience\n\nThis is just as important as gaining the academic knowledge. In fact, having this practical knowledge may greatly assist you in your studies. Knowing the real-world applications of your studies.\n\nI don't know what's best for you, but a lot of people have done well taking a gap year at some point in their education. You can always come back later and finish your Master's. Or if you decide your current program isn't the right fit, you might be able to switch to a program that suites you better.\n\nBest of luck!",
