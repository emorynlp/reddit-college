  "text": "I\u2019m applying to six masters programs and a few of them require academic writing samples. One of the schools (I\u2019ll call it school #1) gave me a specific article to write about, so I did that, and I\u2019m very happy with how it turned out. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s acceptable to submit this sample to other schools as well.\n\nThe only thing really holding me back is that the writing sample article and prompt is on school #1\u2019s website, so technically an admissions counselor at school #2 could know I\u2019m reusing a sample I wrote for school #1. Most of the programs I\u2019m applying to are in the same city. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s something they even take note of or care about\u2026",

      "text": "Hmm that\u2019s tough. I mean, technically you could submit an old paper you\u2019re proud of as a writing sample. So considering this is something you wrote, I don\u2019t see why it would be a problem to use it for other programs. However if you want to play it extremely safe then probably use/write another paper? This is just my opinion",

      "text": "It\u2019s almost certainly fine to submit the same writing sample assuming it meets the prerequisite (length, topic etc.).  There is no obligation or expectation that you write unique writing samples for each application.  No one will know or care.  I\u2019d be surprised to find out if someone didn\u2019t provide the same sample to different schools.",
