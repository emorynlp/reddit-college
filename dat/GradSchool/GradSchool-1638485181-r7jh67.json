  "title:": "Withdrawal from a course and mental health (trigger warning)",
  "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m a masters student studying neuroscience. This semester my mental health went downhill again. I\u2019m in an intensive outpatient program now because my therapist worried for my own safety. I do not want to go into much detail but my self destructive behaviors have gotten much worse, and I feel suicidal often.\n\nOne of my courses has been giving me a particularly hard time, even though all of my courses really are. I did not do well on the first exam and think I did even worse on the second. I\u2019m starting to think I won\u2019t be able to get through my program and need inpatient again.\n\nI just want to hear opinions on if I should withdraw from this course or take a full medical leave altogether to get treatment. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this. I feel guilty about the cost of the program too.",

      "text": "If you could take medical leave for a term, or even just a month or 2, it could really help. I don\u2019t think pushing through and destroying your mental health even more is good in the long run.  \n\nAnother thing is that you don\u2019t have to 100% quit school in this time. You can have a nice break from your courses and intense deadlines, but you can still read papers and casually write to stay on top of things! You\u2019ll come back stronger than ever :)",

      "text": "If I were you, I would probably lean towards withdrawing from studies for now. That said, everyone is different, and what is good for me is not necessarily good for you. When I was an undergraduate student, especially in my first year, I struggled very much with suicidal ideation but didn't really tell anyone or get help. In hindsight, that was very stupid and it almost cost me everything.\n\nWhat I found to be most helpful at that time: \n\n(1) telling a trusted friend... at the time I felt like no one would care if I was gone, but it turns out that was not the case when I told someone what I was actually considering, \n\n(2) working a job with regular hours that paid me money... strangely enough, I found that working in a factory (through a temp agency) in the summer after my first year was very therapeutic.... I would recommend anyone who is having mental health issues related to school or grad school to get a chance to just do some honest if menial work. The effort/reward matrix is so fucked up and weird in school, and especially grad school that it is easy to forget that just doing some work and seeing something get better is very good for the soul.\n\nSorry if this was too personal but I just want to encourage you to hang in there. If you wait long enough, I really believe that you will wake up one day and realize that you are doing a lot better and that life really was worth it all along.",
