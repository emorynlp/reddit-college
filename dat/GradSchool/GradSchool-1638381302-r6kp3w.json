  "title:": "Citing articles in your motivation letter",
  "text": "I am currently applying to some PhD positions and I'm in the process of finalising the applications. I wanted to cite some articles in my cover letter, to showcase how I am interested in their field even though it's not very relevant to my background (I hold 2 MSc degrees and have worked in research for a few years already). Is it a weird thing to do? I want to link my previous experience to their work and I don't want to just bring up information without citing it, but I'm not sure if this is done or if it will come off as trying too hard. The papers I want to cite are not my own.",
