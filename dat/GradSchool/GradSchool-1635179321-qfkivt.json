  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m curious about the existence of a part-time PhD program as well as your thoughts on them in comparison to typical PhD programs. \n\nI\u2019m currently in my fourth year of undergrad and should be graduating with a BS in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Bio next semester. Ever since I fell in love with my first research lab experience in high school I\u2019ve wanted to pursue grad school and a PhD. However, two years ago my health went on a downward spiral and I was diagnosed with autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) and some other less serious autoimmune disorders. I\u2019ve begun treatment and seem to be very slowly getting better, but realistically I need to consider that I won\u2019t be back to normal soon if ever. \n\nI\u2019ve got a laundry list of symptoms, but the most challenging to handle in the context of grad school I think will be the fatigue and low (more like nonexistent) energy. I\u2019m on the highest dosage of Adderall XR I can be on which helps a bit, but bottom line is that I am always tired and need to sleep close to ~12hrs every day. It\u2019s no secret that grad school is incredibly demanding and work intensive and I fear that I won\u2019t be able to physically handle it/put in the required number of hours per week. I love biology so damn much and have dreamed of grad school for many years but I need to be realistic about what I can handle.\n\nOn that note, are part time PhD programs relatively common? Is the experience the same as what one would get in a full time program? Are they viewed as comparable to full time programs by employers/academia/hiring committees?",

      "text": "You may find it helpful to talk to disability/accessibility advisors at your undergrad, if you haven't already. They might be able to help you talk through accommodations you could utilize in grad school, tips, growing support networks, and maybe guide you to programs with good accessibility infrastructure. I've had some really good folks in disability departments help me with balancing my migraines and grad school\n\nI've heard of people doing PhDs part time, but usually when working another part time job to make up for funding issues. Usually (in my experience) there aren't many issues with classes and the program, but there are issues with finding funding. More common are part time MS programs. What about a PhD is important to you and your future goals? Have you talked with current grad students or newer faculty about how their programs prepped/aligned with their desired work?",
