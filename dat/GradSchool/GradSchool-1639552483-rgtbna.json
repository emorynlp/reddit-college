  "title:": "So I graduated. Emotionally, now what?",
  "text": "I started grad school in June 2020, so most of my program was online. This semester was my first (and last) one on campus before graduating, I had one full-semester in-person class and one three-weekend intensive. I\u2019ve become incredibly close friends with so many of my classmates. But the fact that I just started my on-campus/in-person journey and now it\u2019s over makes me feel so emotionally incomplete. Most of my friends still have a semester or two to go, and we all live in the same city so it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll never see each other again but\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just needed to vent. It feels like a bittersweet end at best, just downright sad that I missed out on a year of hanging out with people at worst.",

      "text": "I feel that. I am in the middle of a long gap right now before I go to graduate school and I\u2019m with my parents for a year and it just feels empty. especially since my last year of my bachelors I had no interaction anyways Bc of covid. It\u2019s one of the main reasons I\u2019ll be going to graduate school soon. I don\u2019t even care too much about the degree it is just that I can\u2019t currently imagine a life outside of school honestly and would rather do that then be uncertain or become settled with a long term job and no fun university hangouts. I also felt bittersweet it\u2019s like ok? Here is my degree but I feel it won\u2019t help me much. I\u2019ll honestly be so lost when/if graduate school ends for me",

      "text": "I definitely feel your frustration. I started my grad school in Autumn 2019. So I had one semester and a month of in-person classes before everything went online. They stayed online until this past August. My husband started grad school this Autumn. He has in-person classes and meet-ups. I'm both happy for him and jealous.",

      "text": "I wasn't ready to graduate, either. I'm slowly building a life outside of academia. COVID put that process on hold for me, but now I'm reading books for fun, playing video games, making friends, going on dates, etc. I still don't know if I feel like really belong outside of academia, though, and I toss around going back to school.",
