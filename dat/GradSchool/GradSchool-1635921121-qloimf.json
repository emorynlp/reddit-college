Though not at all time-sensitive, I\u2019m wondering down the line if I should introduce my partner to her or if that seems unprofessional as a mentee to cross that boundary.",

      "text": "First, a caveat--there may be individual lab, departmental, local, regional, or national cultural differences; take any advice here with a grain of salt.\n\nMy own experience (large-city Canadian institution) was that it would be very unusual to arrange a *specific* outing to introduce your spouse to your PI. \n\nOn the other hand, back in the Before Times it was entirely unremarkable for partners to drop by when meeting or picking up a lab member for lunch or an evening event (for example).  If the PI was in, and not busy, then an introduction would be appropriate, followed by a modest amount of small talk.\n\nFinally, different groups and departments will have varying numbers of outside-of-work events, ranging from beer-after-work to holiday-party to backyard-barbecue. Each will have its own expectations about whether a \"plus one\" is invited. My own group used to do a lunch potluck before the winter break each year that was just lab members in a conference room; the lab next to us did an evening gathering at the PI's house where spouses were invited. Everybody's different.\n\nThe best summary I can think of is that the grad-student-PI relationship is much less like an undergrad-professor relationship and much more an employee-manager one. There's certainly still an authority gradient, but you're both adults. Your PI isn't a part of your family, or necessarily part of your circle of friends--but is a close coworker who will likely run into your spouse *organically* at least once or twice a year.",

For examine, a really close friend of mine is from a country in Asia, and one of the professors we worked with is also from that same country. The professor would ask about my friend's fiance, but my friend felt that the questions were more like the professor trying to be like a parent and see if this guy is \"good enough\". It's kind of complicated because I am not from that culture so I didn't really completely follow why she felt this way, but it had something to do with professor being an elder (and higher status) and the fact that, even if my friend started the conversation in English, the professor would speak in their native language where it is considered taboo to not speak to an elder in formal language and to be deferential, so there was no real way to say \"no\" without committing a faux pas. Bless my friend's heart, because they made consistent excuses for 5 whole years lolol\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your adviser, then I'm sure they are just genuinely interested in how youre doing so it would not be a big deal if you introduce your partner to them in a casual context. People in my department do it all the time, if we have a happy hour or department party, so it would not at all be unusual.",
