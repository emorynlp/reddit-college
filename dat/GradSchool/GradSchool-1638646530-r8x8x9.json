  "text": "I\u2019m in a masters program for drug development. It\u2019s not a hard program, honestly. We have class three times a month and and one paper per class. That\u2019s it, no exams.\n\nI\u2019m very involved in the class and like to participate, so everyone seems to know me. We have a WhatsApp chat that I\u2019m really active in and like to help people out with questions they have (and ask my own too). Apparently this has an effect on people and gives them an image of me that I don\u2019t want.\n\nI\u2019ve had three people privately message me, saying that they think I\u2019m really smart and know what I\u2019m doing (I\u2019m not, and I don\u2019t). After a slew of compliments, try straight up ask to see my paper, or even just ask for me to write theirs for them. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted. This is a fucking masters program, grow up and do it yourself. It\u2019s not a long paper, between 2000-3000 words. I\u2019m tempted to send these messages to the program director, honestly. But as the old Chinese proverb goes, snitches get stitches.\n\nThese are the same people that told me that in their home country, they just paid websites to write their essays for them and haven\u2019t written an actual paper since high school. Like??? Am I the only one here on actual merit??",

It's the price you pay.\n\nNote: I'm currently procrastinating to avoid writing a term paper due tomorrow. Got the coffee ready for tonight. Wish me luck.",

      "text": "I feel this. During my Honours year (4th year of my undergraduate degree) we took an advanced research methods class and my classmates would come find me when the written assessments were due. I use to study alone in the library and 4-5 mfers would sit with me for the week leading up to the submission of the assignment and then I'd be all alone again after submission day. Always tried to avoid just giving the answers away but was asked on several occasions to interpret the models we ran for the assessment from start to finish and provide the write-up. People suck at doing the work sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I TA'd the same course 2 years later I had **students** ask me to do their assignment for them. Imagine asking the TA to write your assignment for that very class. One student tried to bargain by increasing the amount he'd pay be for it. My brain was so stunned I didn't respond to him for like 45 seconds while he was standing in front of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people should not be in these programs. They should not go beyond the 3-year Bachelor's. Several of these people pursue Master's and PhDs in my department. Astonishing shit.",

We\u2019re fucking adults in god damn Grad school, therefore when they didn\u2019t meet their deadlines I decided to see if they\u2019d reach out. They never did. So I did their work. Didn\u2019t go crying to the professor, I just tore them to shreds on the peer review. If they didn\u2019t give a fuck enough to even acknowledge they didn\u2019t turn the work in, then hunting them down for their portions would\u2019ve just left me with half-assed work that I\u2019d have to heavily edit or just do myself anyway. They\u2019ll probably throw me under the bus for not communicating with them, but the professor has access to our communication forum where I was very active. So when they try to lie to him he\u2019ll probably drop their grades even further. What they probably don\u2019t even realize is that while it\u2019s a group project, it\u2019s being graded individually. I hope the one guy who did nothing fails and tries to email me asking about why \u201cwe\u201d did so bad on the project. I\u2019ll send him a screenshot of my \u201cA\u201d and nothing else.",
