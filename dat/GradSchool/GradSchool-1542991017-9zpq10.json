  "text": "Been holding this in all week and need to get this off my chest. I've spent this whole week lying to myself/family members that I'm happy and enjoy being in grad school. Here's the real truth: the sheer amount of work I've had to do this week, the guilt of not spending more time with my family, and the fact that I've had enough time to sit and think about what I'm trying to accomplish here has made me realize that grad school is crushing my spirit and leaving me hollow and so unbelievably unhappy. Hopefully winter break will be different and I'll actually start feeling like an actual person again. I'm so tired and it's hard to see the light through all of this.",

From personal experience and reading others experience, it\u2019s not uncommon to feel imposter syndrome and/or overburdened with work. I think this stems from the rigours of Grad School itself. I would recommend completing it not on the recommended timeline of the institution but rather at a bit of a slower pace. Take an extra semester or two and balance everything out. You\u2019ll then have more time to find a research topic you\u2019d like to pursue and decide if you want to pursue it further. ",

My comment wasn't to say all postdocs are wastes of time or traps, I hope it didn't come across that way and there is definitely time to gather relevant skills in a postdoc for jobs outside of academia.  If coding isn't for you, there are business and policy skills that would make you a more attractive candidate for government/public policy position.  There are career alternatives that don't have to be the same grind that academia is and just take some small, building-block steps to prepare for.",

      "text": "First off, what you are feeling is very normal. Graduate school (both masters or PhD) is an incredibly isolating experience. No one (not even your cohort) understands exactly what you're going through, or how you're feeling throughout the program. Trying to explain what you're doing or what you're feeling to family is nearly impossible because it leaves you torn between putting on a facade and telling the truth. It's okay, you can do this! \n\nSecond, most schools offer free counseling/psychologist sessions through the Student Rec Center, or something similar. Take advantage of this, you are paying for it anyway.\n\nMy experience: I'm a 3rd year PhD student. I was diagnosed with advanced anxiety and panic attacks at the beginning of my second year. It sucked - I couldn't drive to campus (40 minutes) without feeling like I was going to pass out (panic attack), I had to stop teaching, started taking meds, and I couldnt focus on anything. I did 12 sessions with a psychologist and I cannot even tell you the difference in my mood and personality afterwards. In less than 6 months (~12 sessions) I went from not being able drive, to less depressed and anxious. I stopped relying on meds, and was more outgoing, and could finally focus my mind again. I'm not saying you need help, everyone is different. I just wanted to share my story and let you know that you're not alone. ",

When my best friend died I went to some very, dark and awful places with thoughts and how I treated others, pushed away friends and was generally an awful mess. I kept on coming up with excuses as to why I didn't need any help and if it wasn't for my other best friend taking me aside and saying you need to get help I don't know where I would have ended up. School counseling will give you a means to formulate a plan to work through these thoughts of doubt you are having and make more sound decisions. I wish you the best of luck.",
