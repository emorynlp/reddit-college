What if it doesn\u2019t go through?! I\u2019m freaking out - it hasn\u2019t been bad until now, but the closer the deadline gets, the worse it gets. Any tips on how to make it through the last couple of days?",

I feel like my mind frantically overthinks because it is trying to find a solution that will help me - but if there's no solution to find, I have to give it other tasks to do. I use a meditation app to help me reframe and relax in these situations. You'll have other big stressors on your way to completing your studies - this is a chance to learn how to manage those moments. Also, it's Wednesday. Any updates?",
