  "title:": "A little bit of a rant about grad school\u2026",
  "text": "Hello all, \n\nI don\u2019t often post but I needed a space where I could just talk about my course currently, and maybe get some advice from people who have been here and seen it all before! \n\nI started my Masters course in September and in all honestly it\u2019s been very disappointing, the course was so promising and very enticing - it has a major module devoted to employability, with a lot of links to our sector who are willing to take us on for internships and such so we have at least 6 months if relevant work experience. All of this seemed great, I loved my undergrad experience, and I figured that even changing uni, I would love to continue with the work that I had been doing previously. \n\nBut, in all honesty, the course feels like a mess. Deadlines change at will. Essay titles are rarely reviewed by other members of staff for clarity. In one such case the questions rarely correspond well with the taught components - and that\u2019s the core module. Staff have a tendency to make snide comments to the class at large, one such lecturer does so frequently when no one is able to answer her questions, but the questions are often hidden within her long, rambling explanations. There\u2019s little in the way of guidance for coursework. For example, presenters have been penalised for having 20 minute presentations, which were advised, but praised for presentations of 40 minutes or more. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say I am complaining because I am doing badly, I am doing well, perhaps not brilliantly but achieving a solid merit in all courseworks, barring one which I will admit was my fault entirely for failing to submit the correct document.  A silly mistake that I am very unhappy about, but as it\u2019s not worth a great deal I\u2019ve simply focused on doing better in the larger coursework.  \n\nMy question is: is this normal? \n\nI know all masters are a step up and less scheduled than undergrad but this feels excessive. Perhaps it\u2019s just me? As I came from a different university , maybe I\u2019m just not as aware as the others about the way things are done around here? I\u2019ve met others, though admittedly I have found it hard to make close friends when almost everyone has friend groups from their undergrad, and this seems to be normal for them.\n\nSorry for the long text, and thank you for reading if you got this far!",
