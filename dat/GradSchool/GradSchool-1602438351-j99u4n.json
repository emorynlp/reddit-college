I keep worrying he or the other committee members will quit my committee or something. But the school says I have 6 years to complete the degree, so goddamnit I'm going to take however long I need. My project is also not really related to anything my profs are doing, so I don't require tons of help/input, which in this instance I think works out.",

      "text": "This totally resonates with me. How much longer do you have in your program? \n\nI\u2019m in my second year of my PhD, also in mental health. At least 3 year more to go for me. I printed out a list of things that I am working toward and put it just above my computer screen on the wall so I can look at it every day and be reminded of why I\u2019m making these sacrifices. I\u2019ve also found it adds some motivation to do just one thing more toward non-school goals some days and that\u2019s been helpful for balance. One of my goals is to go to Disney (because I\u2019ve never been and it\u2019s dang expensive) so sometimes I\u2019ll read or watch a video about special events at Disney and think about what time of year I might want to eventually go. That\u2019s usually fun, a bit of a mental break for self-care, and also helps me feel like I\u2019m moving 1% closer to that goal (even though it\u2019s probably at least 4 years off). \n\nBut I\u2019m not going to lie, I have absolutely had days where I was ready to give up. Grad school is tough even in the best of times, but right now it just feels like a special sort of hell. It does also give me a bit of purpose and security that I wouldn\u2019t have if I were back in the professional world - I can do all my teaching, research, practicum and course work from home, and I am a mighty cheap source of labor for the university so I feel a bit of confidence in the stability of my income (even though it\u2019s small, stability feels mighty nice right now).  So appreciating what grad life does allow me to do right now, coupled with focusing on the short time all of this is going to last and what I want to be doing after it\u2019s all over (plus a good therapist, cuddly pets, a mighty supportive and handsome partner, and a little too much wine) are what are getting me through this right now.",

A lot of the final half of graduate school is a sort of long term, formalized hazing:  putting you through a ton of stress and workload to filter out people by temperament.  Once you get to that point you've got 6-18 months left, and you'll exit with or without a Ph.D.  The biggest final hurdle is how you react to the pressure -- by buckling down and getting shit done, by slowing down and balancing work and life, by flaming out in any of several important ways -- or by saying \"eff that, I don't need that in my life\" and leaving with the skills you've got already.\n\nEspecially toward the end the pressure really ramps up.  It doesn't necessarily even help much that *you* are the one ramping up the pressure.  It can be disorienting when it suddenly lets up at the end.",

      "text": "I felt this so hard this week. My natural coping mechanism is to disassociate - and man did I do that hard this week. I kept up with work or whatever but its like I wasn't there mentally. I didn't do anything extra this week, and I tried to focus on why I wanted the phd. I want to help people through my research, so I made a decision to focus all my work where I can on getting that done. It took time, but I'm feeling much better about it. \n\nHope you can find your own inspiration! Best of luck!",

Class assignments, proposals, all of the hoops you have to jump through to get your degree take away from the power that you feel in actually getting your degree. It sucks.

You did. \n\nSometimes when I'm driving to campus, I remind myself that I can make a right turn (heading away from campus and toward the forest), but I'm choosing to turn left instead. As I near the end of my degree, I've made more right turns.",

I\u2019d definitely seek out having good conversations if I were you.

If you\u2019re being productive and doing well, then I think it is a good decision to ground yourself. If you\u2019re still feeling as lost as you began, I\u2019d consider seeking more help from others.\n\nDefinitely interested in how it goes if you ever remember this comment whenever you decide.",
