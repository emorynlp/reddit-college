  "text": "So a very important conference in my field that I need to present at was scheduled for Dec 5-8th... Which is in the final 2 weeks of a semester! Where multiple projects are due, exams are coming up/being taken and everything else going crazy at the end of semester. I'm also a lab TA so I have to take care of my obligations to that. The classes I'm in expect a ton of time out of you for some reason, and a big project is due soon after the conference (plus an exam right before!). \n\nMy advisors just gave me a laundry list of things that I still gotta do for the presentation, and I'm absolutely slammed to the point where I can barely think about anything else. I would literally not be anywhere near this stressed if the conference were scheduled at a different time of the year, yet here it is. Also I might have Covid and mild symptoms so everything might just be moot to begin with. I'll get tested on Friday, and if I'm negative, I will have to go to the conference. I guess my time management throughout the semester could've been better, but holy shit. I was supposed to practice presenting today but I've been literally too busy trying to do everything else so I have nothing. I might have nothing because I might have Covid, idk.\n\nThis is my first talk so I really don't want to miss it. So seriously, in what world is it ok to just slap a conference at the end of the semester?\n\n/End rant",
