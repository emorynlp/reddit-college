  "title:": "Lab mate keeps bringing up their religion in office",
  "text": "Issue is the title. Basically, they keep bringing up their religion in the workplace. I have a different view and, being a dumbass, engaged. \n\nSeemed like they wanted discourse about it and they did not appreciate my opinion (not religious). I did mention it was unprofessional to bring this up, however, being academics, I thought it would just be a discussion. Turned into them pushing their ideology and them telling me how I\u2019m wrong. It didn\u2019t end horribly, but I just dropped the subject. I\u2019d really like to get some advice on handling this. This is not the first time it has happened and the individual has been informed it is an uncomfortable topic and should be left out of the workplace.\n\nThoughts?",

For someone this hockey-obsessed, it\u2019s hard to talk to others about anything in their life without mentioning hockey.\n\nBut the hockey fan probably isn\u2019t trying to convert you or pressure you into watching games with them, and isn\u2019t judging/criticizing you or others for not being into hockey.\n\nAs long as the religious person behaves likes the hockey fan, they\u2019re OK. Annoying, and you probably wish they\u2019d shut the hell up about it, but they\u2019re not crossing any major lines. You\u2019re allowed to talk about the things that matter to you, whether that\u2019s hockey, religion, or advocating for justice on a social/political issue that\u2019s important to you. Even if other people find it annoying.\n\nBut if the religious person is crossing lines that would be a major \u201cWTF?\u201d If the hockey fan crossed them, that\u2019s a \u201cWTF?\u201d for the religious person too.",

Obviously you may have to skirt some issues bc there's the no politics rule and religion can get a little political, but this is really vague and could mean SO many things.\n\nWhat way are they bringing up their religion? What ideology are they pushing? Is it a marginalized religion or is it the major religion of wherever y'all are at? You don't have to say what religion it is specifically bc that itself doesn't super matter, but ppl conflate marginalized and majority religious groups a lot even though that's pretty important to understanding motivations & dynamics.\n\nAnyway if it's inappropriate and recurrent talk to your ombudsperson probably. Their judgement will be more sound than mine anyway lol",
