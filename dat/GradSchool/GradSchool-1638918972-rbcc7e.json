  "text": "\nJust found out that I\u2019ll be left whilst the entire group goes to a university in Germany\n\n\nUk based PhD student and was feeling pretty good about the project until I found out that both my supervisors, their other PhD student and 2 of their postdoctoral students are getting on a plane to visit a professor in Germany who they collaborate with. \n\nMeanwhile I\u2019m the only one who wasn\u2019t invited despite my supervisor saying that I need to meet this person since their research is the same areas as mine\u2026\n\nFeeling pretty disappointed especially since I have a travel budget and was still ignored\u2026",

If the other PhD student is collaborating with the person and you are currently not it also makes sense that they are going and you are not.
