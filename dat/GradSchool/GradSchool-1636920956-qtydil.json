  "title:": "Competitive Grad Programs that do NOT require GRE scores... What do I do about it?",
  "text": "Hi, y'all!\n\nI'm preparing to apply for a Grad school program in Neuroscience and have been a bit puzzled because this particular program doesn't require GRE scores. The thing is, it is a very competitive program in an ivy league university, so I'm wondering how I should make use of this information.\n\nThey mention on their website that they don't even accept the scores... Is there anything I can do (aside from the regular research experience, good GPA, etc.) to boost my application?\n\nAny advice/insight is welcome (especially if you got into a program that didn't require GRE scores)!\n\nThank you!",

Research shows it\u2019s an extremely poor predictor of success in graduate school and is just an expensive waste of time. \n\nFocus on your essays, recommendations, prior experience. Sell yourself, and try to make connections with students/professors.",

      "text": "A lot of school of all tiers/rankings have gotten rid of or are phasing out the GRE. I think the pandemic sped this process up since there were 2 application cycles where it was more impossible than normal to request GRE scores and maintain any facade of a commitment to equity. \n\nI think LORs and your statement of purpose become bigger factors when the GRE isn't accepted. So, make sure you're clear about what you want your letter writers to talk about and see if you can get any of them or another mentor your trust to look over your SOP.",

Long story short, it only happened because I was highly recommended to commit and finish.\n\nMy undergrad had lots of stats research and the graduate degree is stats based engineering. Most undergrads went with a BA that required no math or stats.",
