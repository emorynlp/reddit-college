  "text": "I am planning to apply to Econ and/or Statistics grad schools in the next year or two. I am trying to decide what institution to take Real Analysis at to prepare. I already have an undergrad degree from a decent school (University of Illinois) and I could take the Real Analysis class there as a non-degree grad student, but the class is harder to get into and more expensive compared to Real Analysis at University of Maryland Global Campus. Would it actually matter to the strength of my application which institution I took that one prerequisite at?",

      "text": "I don't know about econ but I'm familiar with statistics (currently a statistics master's student applying to PhD programs). \n\nQuestions: 1) What is your undergrad degree in, 2) Is this undergrad level \"Intro to Real Analysis\" or grad level measure theory 3) Are you applying to master's or PhD programs, and 4) how competitive are the schools you're applying to?\n\nGenerally, where you take real analysis tends not to matter, but that's partially because it's a class that's almost never taught online (covid obviously changed this drastically) or at schools with particularly questionable reputations. As in, no matter where you take it, you can expect it to be have at least a certain minimal level of rigor and at least a certain minimal level of guards against cheating. That being said, most schools with the words \"Global Campus\" in it don't pass the \"sniff test\" of more traditional members of admissions committees, so there is a chance you might be shooting yourself in the foot if you go that route.\n\nAnecdotally, I've found that contacting key people (professors likely to be on admissions committees) at target grad schools and just asking them questions such as \"is taking Real Analysis at the University of Maryland Global Campus a bad idea\" is likely to yield very honest and helpful opinions.\n\nEdit: I had actually asked \"does the prestige of the institution you take the prerequisites matter\" directly to someone on admissions committee to a statistics PhD program and his answer was a big fat YES, but he was talking specifically about community colleges, and community colleges don't offer real analysis. I took real analysis at a state school that's not a top school but still a T100 so not bad either and he said that the credits from that state school would be viewed with high levels of respect-- not much different than more prestigious universities.\n\nEdit 2: Taking more advanced courses at higher ranked schools (and doing well in them) more or less negates the effect of the community college stigma, which might not apply to you, but is worth noting. Also, A's in real analysis and B+'s in applied statistics courses seem, anecdotally, to be a better look to admissions than B+'s in analysis and A's in applied statistics courses (source: I have A's in analysis and B+'s in some other courses but admissions seems to really hone in on those analysis grades in a way they don't for other classes). I know this because I go out of my way to ask anyone and everyone I can find who is involved in admissions at different schools their thoughts about what is and isn't important. Analysis comes up again and again and again in these discussions as being considered a key course that demonstrates student chops for grad school, so take it seriously.",

      "text": "The prestige doesn't matter for the application process. You want to make sure you're getting a quality course, though, if it's a prerequisite for other courses. I had the experience in grad school of not having the prior knowledge needed for a course (actually, it was with Real Analysis--I only took the first course when I really needed the two-course sequence) and it was a miserable semester taking the grad version of it. If you can get the rigor you need at the less expensive school, go for it.",
