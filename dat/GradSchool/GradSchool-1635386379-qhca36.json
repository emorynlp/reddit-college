  "text": "I\u2019m starting a Master\u2019s program in Math Education and I\u2019m VERY nervous! I teach full time and am very worried that I won\u2019t have enough time or energy to devote to the degree. Consequently, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fail because of these things. \n\nI also am wondering: what\u2019s it like???? Is there anyone who has pursued (or knows someone who has pursued) the same degree? Will it take up ALL my spare time?? :/\n\nA little bit about me (to help you advise me) I teach middle school full time, I don\u2019t have a prep period this year, I don\u2019t have kids of my own, and I\u2019ve been out of college for 5 years.",

      "text": "Hi! \n\nI am a high school Social Studies teacher and am in my last semester of grad school (MA in American Studies). It's possible, but I wont lie, it's hard. I'm finishing writing my thesis and studying to take my comp exams in November. I'm also teaching a new prep (AP World History) in a new district this year. I usually spend most of my weekends working on my graduate school stuff and then stay late at school most days to keep up with grading, lesson plans, communicating with parents, etc. \n\nMy only advice is to be very intentional with your time and try to set very hard boundaries on when you will work on teacher stuff, vs grad school. Reach out if you have any other questions!",
