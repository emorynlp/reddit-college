  "text": "Hi everyone! I've been wanting to get a PhD but I'm not exactly sure what degree I should go into and what University, some degrees sound similar to me depending on how different universities advertise them. I want to make a research contribution on Mental health / Psychology. \n\nMy background is in tech (worked 4 years with a Masters in Business Analytics), I work as a Data Engineer / Data Scientist for a healthcare company in retail (a little heavy on programming using python, R or SQL for Supply Chain). I'm more on a hands on problem solving type and less theoretical (but I'm working on it). \n\nAny suggestion on a tech related PhD degree that I can do this research on? I've looked at a few like Operations Research or Computer Engineering but I'm not really sure.",

So I was looking for a PhD degree in a similar approach where it will still be tech based but the areas of research will be on the topics I'm interested in.",

      "text": "My philosophy is choose a professor not a program. Think of a PhD as more of an apprenticeship into Academia (although in many fields you can spin off into industry) as who you work with is more important than what the name of your degree is.  You probably can find a lot of machine learning people who are into mental health/psychology and who might accept either psych students or computer science students. Given your background you might have an easier time selling yourself from the computer science side of things, but as long as you have evidence of the core knowledge of psychology, you might still get into a psychology lab. \n\nNow I will warn you that Psychology programs are far more competitive and less likely to offer TAships. My advice is to never do a PhD if you have to go into debt to do so, unless it is a Medical Degree or a Law Degree or something similar as it is a very high stakes gamble with a low chance of financial payoff (I mean you probably will get a job, but the inflated cost of paying out of pocket plus the interest on the loan is often not worth it if you are paying for the degree. Also enough programs offer Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships that you should aim for those options).",

              "text": "Yes you apply for the program, but I highly recommend emailing whatever professor you want to work with before applying. That way they can advocate for you and you get a strong sense of if they have funding or not for research. (Some professors transition towards administration and abandon research later in their careers, a select few become academic celebrities (think Stephen Pinker) and give up on accepting grad students. Just because a program offers funding doesn't mean that there is funding for research (it just means they will cover your tuition and usually a paltry stipend for living expenses, make sure it covers the cost of living at least). So yeah I always say professor first (which now might be a bit late in the year for that as you usually want to start asking around in late July or early August as many applications are due in September or October). If the professor you want isn't interested don't bother applying for that program.",
