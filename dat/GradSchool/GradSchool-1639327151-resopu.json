  "text": "Pictures are worth 1000 words and greatly increase the accessibility of your work. \n\nYou'd be amazed how many fields just ignore the usefulness of pictures. \n\nAs an example: I'm currently looking for a comparative picture of a corrosion resistant coating to a bare surface. I've been through 20 different papers so far, none of which include anything remotely useful.",
