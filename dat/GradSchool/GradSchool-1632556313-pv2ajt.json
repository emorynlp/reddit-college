  "text": "I\u2019m about to wrap up my masters this year. For some background: I did a three year undergraduate degree (a BA Honours) in the best possible public university in my home country, worked as an RA for six months (in my field of interest) immediately after and am now completing a one year MSc in the same discipline at a reputed university in Europe. \n\nThat makes 4 years of education, 6 months of relevant work experience. I do want to directly do a PhD but I realise I will not be able to do my applications simultaneously with my masters, so maybe I will finish this degree in 2022 and apply for 2023 intake. \n\nShould I wait longer? Maybe get a job or study more and then apply for a PhD? \n\nAnd what would be the process to apply for a PhD in Europe since it\u2019s super unclear on how to go about this and how is it different from applying to the US/Canada? \n\nSorry if I sound clueless, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to plan my academic career (if there will even be one!)",
