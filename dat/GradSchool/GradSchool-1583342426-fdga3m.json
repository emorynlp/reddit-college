  "text": "Update: Y'all I am doing so much better now that I'm on my own raising my son, finishing my degree!! Covid has kicked my progress in the butt, but summer semester started today and I'm already teaching again! I've really missed my students. I'm having to wait on the official divorce paperwork, due to the monetary issue of being a poor graduate student, but I'm doing it. I'm really doing it and am super happy. Thank you all for your encouragement. \n\n\nI left my husband after 6 yrs last week. We got married my first semester of grad school and this was supposed to be my last semester. The stress from the emotional abuse, moving, and basically raising a kid on my own for the past year has forced me to push back graduation to december.\n\n  I don't know how I feel honestly. Part of me is embarrassed I'm still in school, part of me is sad my marriage is over. The rest of me just wants to throw all my research into the wall and say fuck it.\n\nAnybody else deal with this? Feeling kinda low today.\n\nI am so close and don't want to give up, but this shit is killing me.",

I'm sorry if I'm being a little too peppy for what I'm sure is a really difficult and heartbreaking transition, but I'm so proud of you and excited you chose to do something this hard in order to have a better future for yourself and your child. My parents stayed together waaaaay longer than they should have and it was absolutely miserable for all of us. Whenever I see anyone being like \"No thanks I deserve better than this\" instead of just slogging through a bad situation it just really inspires me. You are obviously so smart and strong and you are going to have such a bright future! Congrats!",

He's a happy kid and I'm finding the person I gave up when I got married; I really missed her.  I'm happy I left and everyone has been super supportive.  Thanks for the support!",

      "text": "My 8, almost 9 year relationship ended after the first year of my Ph.D. program. Of course I was sad. I felt like a failure, especially when my parents came to visit me for the first time after I left. I moved from a large 3 bedroom home into a duplex with 4 other graduate students. I thought that we'd start discussing marriage. \n\nAt the same time, I felt so relieved. Graduate school made salient issues I had been ignoring for years. He was threatened by my intellectual advancement. He never missed the chance to question my expertise (in my field, i'm not claiming expertise in literally anything else). In the past, I was the one with the disposable time and income and I spent most of both on him. When the tables were flipped (he moved into a career where he made almost 50% more than me, never worked nights or weekends) it wasn't the same. \n\nBeing surrounded by really smart people I jived with also meant that I started crystallizing why some of my core values were really important to me, and of course, it highlighted differences there too. \n\nI don't know if I would've been strong enough, or come to those same conclusions without grad school. You can do this, and you will feel amazing about it when it's all done. Until then, eat some junk food and have a good cry.",

I wasn't coping with the stress well and in the middle of my 5th year the day after grad studies removed me from the lab because of their concerns she said she wanted a divorce. Took a leave of absence for 6 months, tried to get things figured out and joined  a new lab.

Raising a kid while in grad school is a massive achievement, and it's amazing that you're going to graduate in December!\n\nAlso, I know a *lot* of people whose long-term relationships and marriages dissolved in grad school.  Know that you are *definitely* not alone in this -- there is nothing wrong with you, in case you were worried. (I say this only because I know that school makes a lot of people worry that there is something wrong with them.)\n\nA PhD is really, really hard.  But you are *so* close.  You can do this.",

You are right on time, because you aren't in competition with anyone else. Consider people who complete college with part-time enrollment: no one accuses them of falling behind. It's the opposite actually: they celebrate their ability to juggle busy lives and still find the time to progress. A single mother working a full time job might only be able to take 2 classes a semester - of course it will take her longer than someone who is able to devote all their efforts to taking courses, but they both still cross the finish line. It's not a race, though. \n\nI am a 37 year old single father, and I pushed my Master's graduation back a semester for mental health. What's the alternative? Quitting? Or having a breakdown? Take your time and recognize that you have already accomplished more than most, with more responsibility and obligation than most, and at the end of the day, if you get the expertise, no one cares if it took you an extra year or two to get it. When you feel overwhelmed like this, repeat the mantra: it's not a race. It's not a race.",

She randomly developed a major health issue out of the blue while we were both working on our PhDs at the same institution. We got married. It took 4-5 years to get her meds sorted out. The medical issue transformed our relationship in many ways. Over time, the  love stopped and we basically became roommates. We separated and then divorced while just before/while writing our dissertations.\n\nShe completed her PhDs. I completed my double too. It was really hard. I can't imagine doing all of that with a child. I'm a TT professor now (luckily). \n\nAnyway, all this to say, I've been in a similar position and it sucks what can only be described as a monumental amount of dirty ass. If you've survived a divorce while a grad student (and while being a parent), holy shit, you can do just about anything.",

I didn't really realize why my friends always said they were so encouraged and inspired by me and my ability to manage a family and grad school until I finished.  You see, I came to grad school with one kid (added 2 more before I left) so grad school with kids is all I knew.  But it is orders of magnitude more difficult than without children.  I didn't realize that I never really got a break: I'd go to lab and destroy my brain working through stuff, then I'd come home and be a parent which, while not necessarily as intellectually challenging as grad school, was challenging in many other ways.  We'd ship the kids to bed and then my brain would immediately switch back to grad school.  \n\nIt took me 6 years plus a quarter.  I also felt a bit ashamed.  But then I realized that it doesn't matter.  What I accomplished is much more important than how long it took me to accomplish it.  (I also had to fight with our graduate division and basically told them to \"go pound sand\" whenever they asked me why I haven't graduated in normative time).\n\nAll this to say: I know, not the full burden you bear, but a significant burden.  And it's hard.  And as I got closer to completion the difficultly increased exponentially.  I don't know if it was imposter syndrome or what for me, but I have always seen -- and experienced -- this sharp rise in difficulty and while I don't know exactly what causes it (it's probably dependent upon the person), I know it's real.\n\nThe best advice I can say is: you can absolutely do this.  You made it this far, the only thing that is going to stop you from graduating is you.  And it doesn't sound like that is the case, so take a second -- or two -- and breath.  Take a weekend off (if you don't already take weekends off) and go somewhere and do something either by yourself or with you kid that you or both of you enjoy doing.\n\nRest.  This is like a hike through the mountains and it's ok to stop and rest for a second, to take in the view.  Celebrate the journey you've been on.  Look at where you started and where you are now.  What you've managed to do is worthy of celebration!  After all, even hikers sit down to eat lunch on a long hike.\n\nYou're doing a great job and as one (technically post) grad parent to another: you got this!",
