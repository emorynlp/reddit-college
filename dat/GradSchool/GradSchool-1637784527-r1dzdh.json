  "title:": "CGS M Application - Employment Question",
  "text": "Currently going through the process of filling out my Canadian Common CV for the CGS M application (specifically CIHR). I was wondering what people's thoughts are about including non-relevant non-academic employment experience? I had a lot of odd jobs throughout uni (factory, landscaping, deli, etc) and I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to include them or not. I feel like it shows balance, but also isn't as relevant as other jobs I've had. Any insight (especially if anyone here has won a CGS M scholarship) would be extremely helpful! Thanks :)",

So include everything you can that gives you an edge, it can and probably will come down to that 0.1% application score. Mine did in the past for CIHR - missed funding by 0.5% on my application score.",

      "text": "Current NSERC CGS-M holder here! Keep in mind that the CGS M is a bit different than the PhD competition: there are a certain number of awards that each school has allocated each year (for example, I go to a small university and there are only 2 NSERC CGS-M awards allocated for the entire school, and some major schools will have as much as 5 times that many). I don't recognize what the other commenter was saying about the score, I think that's only applicable for the PhD competition? I don't recall seeing it for my application in the portal, anyways.\n\nAlso, the weight of each application section is slightly different: CGS M funding is mostly dependent on academic record. Adding in as much work experience as you can may give you a slight advantage for the \"personal characteristics and interpersonal skills\" section, but that's also the lowest weighted (20%) section in the application. So probably not dramatic, but I'd include it!\n\nBest of luck! :)",
