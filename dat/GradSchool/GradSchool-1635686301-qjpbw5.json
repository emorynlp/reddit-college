  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in college, looking into doing a M.S. in environmental toxicology / ecotoxicology [though some schools have this under an M.S. in environmental science and the research undertaken by faculty is etox]. \nI am set to graduate Fall of 2022, and I know some schools don\u2019t allow for spring admission, only fall. (For instance, some schools would not allow me to begin my MS spring of 2023, but would admit me for fall of 2023. While others would allow me to begin spring of 2023). When should I begin to reach out to professors and potential advisors? And are there any tips for doing so?",

      "text": "For my field's December-January deadlines, people typically reach out in September-November. So maybe 3-4 months before the deadline?\n\nWriting a cold-call letter to profs is pretty difficult to do well. There are guides online and in old threads here if you look deep. Generally, you want to keep your letter very short, and make your purpose clear ASAP. It's important to be familiar with their work, but don't name their papers just for the sake of naming them (\"I really liked your paper 'Investigating the high-energy eigenvectors of...'\"). Instead, highlight the topics and techniques you're interested in, and only name their specific works in order to support those claims.",

      "text": "Maybe it's different in your field, but in mathematics, we're generally not interested in talking to prospective MS students, since they don't stay long enough to make a positive contribution to our research efforts. The recruitment effort focuses on PhD students and postdocs.",
