  "text": "I\u2019m currently finishing up my MHA and am at my wit\u2019s end with my two other group members.  Instead of us all equally contributing to weekly assignments, I end up typing the whole damn thing out every week an am constantly catching one copy and paste bodies of text from the book.  We have a module research paper and I have zero confidence I\u2019ll be able to catch every uncited quote.  It\u2019s almost the end of the module and they STILL have gotten the necessary data that I can\u2019t provide myself to start writing.  I\u2019m worried about getting expelled if she plagiarized and I don\u2019t catch it.",
