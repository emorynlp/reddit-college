  "title:": "Question for grad school biology students",
  "text": "I\u2019m a junior majoring in biology and psychology. I plan for my career to involve research in conservation ecology, probably with the national park service or some other government group. I\u2019ve also thought about becoming a professor. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the next 5-10 years and thought of a question.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s getting a masters, phd, or a post doc, how do you think you\u2019ve changed since undergrad? I assume that your goals, expectations, and plans have probably changed a lot over time, but what about the things that define you as a person? Like your outlook on life, your personality, your general thoughts and feelings, etc.\n\nAlso open to anyone who\u2019s farther along in their biology careers and remember any significant changes over the years.",

      "text": "You will get much more jaded about the career/job market. Park service and academia are both VERY tough to get into. I am in a field adjacent to conservation ecology and was shocked by how hard it was to get a gruntwork job after undergrad (something like invasive species control ie pulling weeds for minimum wage). The norm is many years of unpaid or less-than-minimum-wage paid seasonal positions unless you have and like some very in-demand skill (GIS, wetland delineation, hazardous waste management, there are probably some others -- but note that these can still be tricky jobs to get).\n\nNot to get you down too much but it's a good thing to start thinking about if this is the road you want to go down.",

      "text": "Uhm, a lot. I'm an MD PhD student, so I see more human illness than other PhD students, but honestly my interactions with others have influenced me much more than my field of study. Since becoming a professional/grad student, I've also become a wife and mother, and lived and worked during a global pandemic (like everyone else lol).\n\nOne thing that comes to mind for me is how much I've had to be mindful that I am more educated than most people I know outside of work. Please don't take that to mean I think I'm better- while ego problems are common in science, I know many people who are less educated who are better, more well-adjusted people than me. I have my biases and my obvious flaws, I'm pretty damn human. But it's almost impossible to explain to others how a scientist thinks. I get questions all the time- I study virology, so you can imagine- and I have to consider frequently what is obvious to me that is not obvious to a non scientist. I have to also step cautiously so as to not sound condescending, and remember that I have spent years cultivating and refining my scientific ability and knowledge. Others spend their time on other things, and that's okay! It's not better or worse. \n\nIt's just hard to look someone in the face while they confidently assert that you can't know (x) because you're a (y) scientist, totally ignorant of the fact that we scientists have \"hobby\" fields we read about, and the process of good science is universal in its logic. We're allowed to know about more than one thing. Science dabbles, inadvertently or otherwise, in politics, so it has become a challenge to not tell non scientists who have very poorly informed, loud opinions not to f&ck off, eat a bag of d**ks and stay off the internet.",

      "text": "I'm a 4th year PhD student studying evolutionary bio. If you don't change after undergrad, honestly I would be worried about you. People in their early 20s think they're fully mature (so did I), but your brain is still developing and you have a ton of things you haven't experienced yet. There are a lot of changes you experience in your mid twenties regardless of grad school.\n\nFor me, the specific changes that have happened because of grad school involve me becoming a lot more confident of myself and my abilities. I used to be so shy and a few years ago, I felt like I couldn't do *anything*. I've gained so much through grad school! I'm still me, but I'm honestly emotionally doing so much better than I was in college. I also came out as bi and stopped being so ashamed of my ADHD, which was something I tried really hard to hide in college (mostly because of the environment I went to college in being unfortunately conservative).",

      "text": "This question reminds me of an old comic a colleague had posted at his desk regarding the goals of a graduate student over time:\n\n1. I'm going to change the world with my research\n2. I want to publish in a high impact factor journal\n3. I want to publish anywhere\n4. I want this experiment to work\n5. Ooooh, free pizza!\n\nBut in all seriousness, I started graduate school at #3. I think I came in with a pretty reasonable understanding of how the graduate student experience worked. However, for me, it was way worse than I could have imagined. It changed me a lot. I'm far more jaded about most things. It also opened my eyes to how much of science is really just bs. \n\nI definitely came out of school as a more critical thinker and with better problem solving skills. But my experience also led me to loathe bench work, which I never thought would have happened. \n\nAcademic researchers eat, sleep, and breathe research. In my experience (I'm sure there are exceptions), those who became successful PIs live to work. I thought maybe I'd like that too. I loved school and science, and I really didn't have anything else going for me in my life at the time. However, I've now realized that I really would prefer to work to live. I want to enjoy the work that I do, but I don't want to completely sacrifice other aspects of my life either.",

      "text": "I\u2019m about 8 months into grad school (MSc, switching into PhD next term) in molecular biology/bioinformatics. Honestly I\u2019m completely different person. In a good way. I feel so much more fulfilled, useful, and productive than I ever did before. It feels really good to be part of a community, which I never really felt in my undergrad. As long as you are pursuing a topic you really enjoy and are prepared to work hard, you will transform as a person very quickly.",
