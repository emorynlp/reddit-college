  "text": "So\u2026I got accepted into a masters program which starts in a month. So I was wondering if anyone had any advice for how to make the most out of it. That is, how can I best utilize my resources so that I can leave the program with a masters degree and a lot more confidence",

      "text": "Congrats on getting accepted into grad school, and welcome to the gang! \n\nSo before I can offer you useful advice, I\u2019ll need a bit more context. What is the nature of your program? Do you need to do original research and write a thesis? Are you in STEM or humanities? Do you have a TA or RA lined up? Do you have alums from undergrad who is currently in the same program?\n\nI can share with you a [blog](https://www.kaleidoglobe.com/blog/posts) from KaleidoGlobe that contains lots of good information. Perhaps you can find something useful on it?",

      "text": "Figure out what you want out of graduate school. Do you want a job or a path to a PhD program.  If you want a job/career then use your time to learn the skills for the career you want. Try to use university resources to help you navigate any certifications or training that would be beneficial. If you want to get into a PhD program then talk with your professors. Take the challenging courses or excel at any  projects.  Everyone in the program is there for different reasons. Don't compare yourself to them unless you both have the same goals. \n\nFinally don't expect graduate school to be life changing in any way. Unless you put effort in  you will be the same person you are at the end as you are coming in.",

      "text": "Some advice that was given to me is participate in as many trainings as you can while you\u2019re a student. I\u2019m not sure what your area of study is but I am in a counseling psych program and I have heard that it is best to do trainings while you are a graduate student because you get a discounted cost (due to being a student) as opposed to participating in trainings after you have already graduate. Some trainings will require you to already have your master\u2019s degree or licensure though. I\u2019ve heard it takes some footwork to get into the trainings as a student but it is worth it in the end.",

My first 2 months were rough finding a job but I discussed this with my advisor and they got an assistantship. Every good thing that I\u2019ve been able to work on at graduate school, projects, research, travel, internships has all been because I maintained connections and reached out to any sort of connection with questions for guidance. At least at my university, they truly want us to succeed and want to help us and appreciated that I made time to make connections and ask.",

I just wished I had realized I could reach out and discuss things earlier since I could have had a job much earlier if I had!",

But I\u2019m doing it now and I chose the school I chose cuz it\u2019s online and also I didn\u2019t need to do anything in preparation. That\u2019s not to say I made the decision on a whim, but it was nice not having to take the GRE because it was just less stress. I just hope that if it ever comes up that my degree (which will be the same as someone not online) came from going to school online, that it doesn\u2019t matter since a ton of people are technically getting theirs online with covid. Just an awful 2 years and still going on now. But yeah, thank you so much. I plan on taking advantage of every possible resource and talking with everyone I can. It\u2019s about time I knew what I wanted and how to get it",
