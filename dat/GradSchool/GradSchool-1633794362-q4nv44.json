  "text": "So I was in the office for a couple of days last week and didn't really enjoy it. I found the other students to be a bit cold and they didn't really chat much with me.\n\nI was thinking about how I can make myself seem like less of a stranger and less awkward? I'm terribly self conscious so I'm really worried about not making a good impression.\n\nWhat can I do to ease the anxiety of meeting new office mates?\n\nEdit: I appreciate this is slightly off topic but I'm totally new to the PhD game",
