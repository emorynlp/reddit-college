  "title:": "How much of an asshole would I be if I withdrew from a big group presentation and took a zero because I already have enough points to pass the class?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my last semester of my masters program and graduate in December. For one of my classes, I have a group presentation worth 20% of my grade during finals week. I have just enough points right now that I would have a \u2018C\u2019 in the class if I took a zero on the presentation. That\u2019s all I need to graduate, and I already have a job lined up and I\u2019ll still finish with like a 3.4 or 3.5 GPA. I don\u2019t see any possible way where having a C instead of an A or B on my transcript will ever effect me. I\u2019m working with a bunch of random ppl in my class that I\u2019m not friends with and we haven\u2019t even started yet because they never respond to my messages so I wouldn\u2019t feel that terrible about ditching them. Basically I feel like I have nothing to gain by putting myself through this time consuming project, but it feels so wrong to quit and put even more responsibility on my group mates during the most stressful time of the semester",

Maybe you could reach out and see if the rest of the team feels the same way. Since nobody has initiated contact, it\u2019s possible that everyone else feels the same as you and is willing to put together a half-assed project for this class so they can focus on other work. Just a thought.",

You may not technically gain from doing the work, but in the long run, you\u2019ll appreciate that you did your work and didn\u2019t take the easy way out.  I\u2019d say just finish the best of your abilities and move on. Congrats on graduating soon!",

For example, cheaters at sports/games/school always start out with \u201cit won\u2019t be a big deal if I take a tiny shortcut this one time\u201d, and it eventually spirals into full-blown cheating.
