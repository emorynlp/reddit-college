  "text": "I am really freaking out here..... I just got an email from a professor in one of my computer science classes that my program was very similar to another. I have never been accused of anything like this, and the only thing I can think of was using some of the same inspiration from github, but it was not a copy paste. I do not know what I should do and the meeting is in 6 hours. This is my first semester, and it is an asynchronous class, so I do not even know who I could have potentially copied. Any advice? I plan to fight tooth and nail, but do not know how. My program did not even work properly, so I don't know why I'd be similar to someone.\n\nEDIT: This seems to be a lot more students than just me. The average grade on the assignment is 48, which makes me thing he's taking a shotgun approach to this, trying to catch anyone cheating.",

I was required to explain and accuse of cheating. The reason was that they know one of us copied the other.\n\nFor the meeting I started by explaining the helping part. Then as a proof I went into details or why I took this part, what was my logic and explained the result. Basically I demonstrated that I understood the class material and was proud of my work. The professor was satisfy and happy so I was good.\n\nI think you can do something similar. Go in details of your work and show knowledge and learning.
