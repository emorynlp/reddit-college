  "text": "I kind of hate it - the manuscript I mean - especially now it's at the editing stage before sending off. I've never published anything before, don't completely trust half of what I've written or half of the techniques I've used. It 'looks' great, but I feel like there's so much wrong under the surface that I just can't see, yet peer reviewers will. Especially in a high ranked journal, I'm worried my work will be ripped to shreds. Doesn't really help that my supervisors - while excellent researchers - are about as empathetic as a loan shark. No real help there.",

For what it\u2019s worth: I think almost everyone uses techniques that are flawed, makes human errors, and questions their own research. Publishing something is about reporting honestly: \u201cthis is what I did, this is what I saw.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be 100% indisputable.",
