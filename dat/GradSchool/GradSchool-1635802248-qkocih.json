  "text": "I've been struggling with acting naturally around people in my field who I admire for doing amazing work and also can make or break my career based off their impression of me. I have a lot of anxiety and tend to behave kind of strangely in these situations as i swerve between trying to unclench my brain enough to be social (in a professional way ofc) and then swerving back when I accidentally say something weird or find myself making banal observations that leave the conversation hanging. How can I learn to act normal around these people when I know they are the gate keepers of my own success or failure?",

      "text": "Totally get where you are coming from - it can be hard to be your naturally charming (and professional) self when this is someone you very much admire and/or could play a large role in your career. \n\nI take a pretty existential stance to manage my anxiety. To recognize that everyone here (however amazing), is just another human being living on a large rock hurling through space for a minute speck of time over the course of the universe's lifespan. This is another human who wants to be recognize, to be loved, and has fears, aspirations, and anxieties of their own. \n\nBy reminding yourself that they are human just like you, and being mindful during your conversation of what makes them happy, respected, and heard will probably be a good way to get started. Hope that helps!",

They\u2019ve got research and management.  They couldn\u2019t be shit at both and have their jobs.  If they\u2019re shit managers, as you suggest, then they\u2019re likely excellent researchers.\n\nI\u2019m really not following how your second comment supports your first.

In order to become a PI, you need to be a very productive postdoc, getting papers and grants, i.e. be very good at research. Generally a very solo activity, managing your project but not people. Essentially you have full control.\n\nAs a PI, now you have to manage your trainees AND their work streams. Different skill set and one not selected for in the hiring process. The evidence is all here in this sub, where PIs are raging assholes to their trainees.\n\nThey're not special because very few have mastered both sides of the coin. Not really their fault either, their training was broken from the start. Now that I'm in the corporate world I've met senior people who can do the work AND manage others to do it. That should be the goal is what I'm saying.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know much this helps. But just talk to them and make conversation about stuff. In my case I had a professor in undergrad who was an absolute superstar. I was very intimidated by him in the beginning. Over time I got to know the guy after spending time talking to him in office hours, and outside classes. I came to realize that he was a toxic person, who used discriminatory filters to pick students for his projects. But he was a regular politician and made himself appear like a saint. He indirectly refused to take students of color or women. After getting a good understanding of him as a person, I was no longer intimidated by him. I was now disgusted by the person that he was. The point is these professors are human beings just like you and me. They may be good researchers, but that doesn\u2019t tell you that they are better people than you. Don\u2019t be intimidated by anyone. Show respect to start with, but don\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve accomplished either.",

      "text": "Thanks for posting this! \n\nThis was exactly how I felt when I was surrounded by them. I still remind myself that these people are just people who happen to have xyz degrees, skills, looks, etc etc. I understand how interacting with them can be intimidating as they most likely have something that we want, but not yet have. We have to remind ourselves that these people were ones like us who admired others that they wanted to be too. Most likely they still admire those people! \n\nWhat got me to lessen the stress of being around powerful people is that I tell myself that I\u2019m going to be them in the future and right now I\u2019m in the process of being like them so why not try to be comfortable around them. It takes practice and time to be comfortable with this, but keep bettering yourself and keep interacting with them. Forget that they have so and so that you admire. Talk to them as if they have nothing. Talk to them as if you\u2019re equal with them because you are. As clich\u00e9 as they may sound we are all people. In the grand scheme of things, There\u2019s nothing special about any of us. We\u2019re here on earth and at some point we are all going to die (not at the same time, obviously)",
