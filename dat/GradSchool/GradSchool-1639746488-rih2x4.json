  "title:": "Getting a Concentration for my Master's?",
  "text": "I'm an undergrad in my senior year for my University. I'm doing a dual degree with a BS in mathematics and also a BS in computer science. I also saved a year (graduating winter 2022 instead of winter 2023) due to saving time from summer classes and with that extra year I just decided to get a master's in Computer Science. I got into to a fast track program that allows me to do some grad school credits while I'm in undergrad simultaneously so I don't have to complete the full amount of grad credits once I graduate. Instead of taking 30 credits over grad school I'll only need 14 credits (4/5 classes) once I get out of undergrad.\n\nAs it stood a few weeks ago, I just planned to get my masters in CS and be done. I'm not going for my PhD or anything else. However a classmate in my AI grad class was talking to me and said that I should get a concentration if I'm doing a master's. Another person joined in and agreed saying a master's with no concentration is kinda pointless if ur not going further. More stuff I heard included from them included.\n- \"People that go just for a masters are sometimes seen as PhD failures\"\n- \"No concentration makes you like an ore where employers can/need to mold you into what they want whereas a concentration makes you like a hammer, specialized for a certain job\"\n- Employers would rather have 1 year experience over no experience and a master's\n\n... And some more things like this. I asked \"but I'm going to have 2 bachelor's degree plus a master's at the same age that my friends are graduating with just one degree. Doesn't that count for something?\" They're like \"ehhh, again you would rather do a job and get your master's a few years down the road.\" Which doesn't really make sense to me since if I'm gonna do a MS eventually then why not now? They also said the master's had a shelf life saying the stuff we learn now will be different in ten years time. I don't know, it's kinda an overwhelming amount of info. I'm totally grateful for their input no doubt and I get some of their reasoning but some parts of it aren't intuitive to me. I also wanna give more weight to them since they're like 5-10 years older than me and have been/are in the workforce but that's the only advice I've gotten about grad school so far.\n\nMy grad school has two possible concentrations. Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Driving. I can do either or even both concentrations if I really wanted to in those remaining 14 credits with no extra classes but this means I have no freedom for the classes I do as opposed to my current plan where at this point I just have to take up 14 credits (meaning I can take some classes in genuinely interested in or maybe those that aren't as work intensive). Bottom line: a concentration wouldn't add any time or credits, but I would get any freedom in choosing my remaining classes plus the difficulty may be harder.\n\nOh and the one thing that really made me question it is that a concentration *doesn't* show up on the diploma/degree (it might on a transcript though). This made me question the pros and cons of it. \n\nSo my main question: Is getting a concentration for my master's in CS worth it if I'll already have 2 additional BS degrees under my belt and minimal work experience? (Ik there's no \"right answer\" but I just need some input)",
