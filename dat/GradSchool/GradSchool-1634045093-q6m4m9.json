  "text": "Hi All, I\u2019m currently a PhD student taking 9 credits and working as a TA part time. I plan to take 12 credits next semester cause I definitely have time (we were just encouraged to take 9 our first semester to ease into the program). I\u2019m also considering taking a Spanish undergraduate class to get started on my language requirement. Anyone have experience with this kind of credit load? I\u2019m pretty good at managing my time, but do you think I\u2019d hate myself if I did that?",
