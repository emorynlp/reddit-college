  "text": "I took on a part-time job this semester to pay for classes for my MPA and am taking a full load (4 classes). The job I took is a manager role for a family trying to start an organization and even though I'm technically part-time I don't have the bandwidth the do what I could do. I was only planning on holding onto the job for this semester because I live with relatives right now and need to move back to in-person classes next semester, so everything I'm making is to help fund the next year or so of my life. The class I'm considering dropping is an elective that's offered every 3 semesters (there's a 50-50 chance I'll still be in school in 3 semesters) but the class isn't required. I downloaded all the resources and material from the classes online portal. I picked this class because I screwed up and have a 10 page analysis due in a couple days that I wasn't aware of because I was doing other assignments for this class, my 3 other classes, and juggling work, and am crunched for multiple work deadlines so it completely dropped off my radar. I'm way overloaded and either need to leave my job or drop an elective and take a W. Which option is more damaging? Dropping the class or dropping the job? What do I do?",

      "text": "If you're not going to graduate school beyond the masters, then the W on your transcript won't matter. Employers don't typically ask for a transcript as part of the interview process. \n\nIf you do decide later to get a PhD, you'll have to explain it. Given that you're gaining practical experience, and the job and even the three courses is a heavy load, I can't imagine a PhD program in PA would hold the W against you. They might even think it was the best choice. \n\nSo are you learning a lot with this job? Is it a good resume builder, too? In other words, weigh it versus the elective as for which is better for your career goals.\n\nAlso, in a discipline like public administration, real world experience gives you perspective on what you're learning in your classes. So it may facilitate the learning you're doing in the rest of your masters.\n\nAt the same time, also consider whether or not dropping this class would extend your graduation date.",

      "text": "If I were you I would drop the class, because it sounds like you\u2019re overstretched and from my personal experience, doing a poor job on a commitment that you felt obligated to take on but don\u2019t feel strongly about intrinsically will be painful and not worth the grief. If it\u2019s something you are actually passionate about learning it might be worth the risk of not doing great \u201con paper\u201d for your personal growth - I took a W in a class that shaped my worldview in an important way so it was worth trying to make it work, the concepts were valuable, no regrets. I also once took on an extracurricular project that I wasn\u2019t sincerely interested in and it damaged the networking relationships that made me say \u201cyes\u201d in the first place - NOT worth it, still haunts me. Your situation is kind of flipped, a W is much less personal and won\u2019t burn any bridges. But a start-up non profit with a family sounds like a recipe for burnout so do not feel guilty about setting very conservative boundaries about your commitments regarding time and deliverables.",

I was talking about quitting my job as a nonprofit manager and taking out loans to make up for lost income to take an additional class about nonprofit management and just hearing the idea out loud felt wrong to me.

Some programs have internship credits in that vein, maybe you can make a case to work something creative out with your advisor. But again - saying no is an important skill that nobody is going to encourage you to practice, so if your gut is saying drop the class, do it.",

But dropping the class that\u2019s not guaranteed to be offered again, even if it\u2019s not required, might make you miss out on an interesting and great learning experience. I took 4 classes (2 core + 2 electives w/1 elective in sociology) each semester and I feel I have a more well rounded and expansive set of knowledge that\u2019s given me an interesting perspective about how bureaucracy and policy meet social movements and social environments that I wouldn\u2019t have had without it. \n\nBut if the extra money from the job is necessary for you to get through, then I\u2019d choose that and hope to get another elective eventually. But is there an option to take a week or so off or a temporary leave of absence from the job and come back to it?",
