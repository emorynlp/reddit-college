I'd say the summer of research would be a good chance to work on your research skills and get into that kind of a mindset for grad school.

Professional experience will always give you a leg up in grad school, and usually help you understand how to apply concepts you learn in the real world and quickly asses potential gaps in academia and industry application. I am personally pretty ambitious so I wouldn\u2019t decline the opportunity if I could still take a week or two off before the semester starts. After a year and a half in grad school, I have realized that a better strategy is to figure out how to have work life balance or learn how to take breaks during the semester rather than waiting for breaks. This makes you more productive and allows you to deal with stress better rather than planning for a long break which might or might not be possible based on ad hoc deadlines or workload.",
