  "text": "I've posted here a few times in the past, but I feel like nothing ever really happened and I can't do anything to change it\n\nI'm trying to find a job so I can actually quit my PhD. program, but that's proving problematic. Has anyone left grad school fairly late in the game (halfway through 5th year) and found a decent job? I keep getting ghosted by recruiters/hiring managers and I have no idea why. How do I make them notice or even care?\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, my life is sort of in free fall right now and I think grad school is a major factor in that. I just want to leave.\n\nEdit: I'm looking for an engineering/data science job. My PhD. Program is in the hard sciences. I have a masters in the same subject along with undergraduate degrees in physics and engineering. I don't want to get too specific just in case anyone I know is on this sub.",

      "text": "My only advice is to mine your network hard. Use professors, old internships, friends of friends, people you haven't talked to in years, anybody that could be helpful. Don't feel weird about it, just take the awkward plunge and ask them for help. Worst they can do is say no. I realize that's super hard as a grad student since your network is fledgling, but that's why you have to really dig deep into your contacts. As much as I dislike the LinkedIn ethos, it can actually be useful for organizing who you know and who they know. Basically got my job through my network. I am in my 5th year and they have been happy to let me finish my PhD (on my own time lol....). Obviously applying cold to jobs can work as well, but if you have an in or a mutual acquaintance, it can be the extra bump you need to stand out. Good luck!",
