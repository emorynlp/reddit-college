However, because of my lack of experience I don't know where to continue and I'm quite confused.\n\nThe university I'm interested in repeatedly suggests that its course based graduate programs are for professionals in the field.. \n\nAlso, for their thesis-based programs, I get the implication that some sort of experience is also needed to compete in admission.  \n\nMy question is: why wouldn't it be suitable for someone that holds a Bachelors of Science degree ( but lacks work experience) to apply to a course-based program?  \n\nI would appreciate if someone can explain to me the matter regarding thesis and course based degrees.\n\nThank you! \n\n* I hold a BSc degree in Food Science and Technology.",

      "text": "Disclaimer: I'm American and most familiar with the US education system and workforce, but I imagine a lot of this generalizes elsewhere.\n\n>The university I'm interested in repeatedly suggests that its course based graduate programs are for professionals in the field..\n\nThere are multiple ways to understand this. It could be that this university happens to only offer an accelerated program in the topic, which builds on existing professional experience in the field; however, this doesn't mean all master's degrees in the field require such experience.\n\nThe more general approach to understanding that this is contrasting \"professional\" with \"academic\". At least where thesis-based master's degrees are plentiful, course-based master's are more likely to feed into the professional workforce (\"industry\") than into further academic training at the doctoral level.\n\nAgain, these are tendencies and trends, not hard and fast rules.\n\n>My question is: why wouldn't it be suitable for someone that holds a Bachelors of Science degree ( but lacks work experience) to apply to a course-based program?\n\nYou need to get experience and beef up your marketable skills. If you have a undergraduate degree in the same field already, a course-based master's doesn't demonstrate much new about your skills. A thesis-based master's would at least give you an opportunity to at least demonstrate your skills applied to a more real-world project.",
