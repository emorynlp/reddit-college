  "title:": "Taking a W grade this semester, dropping out, but asking for LOR?",
  "text": "I returned to grad school this semester after a 2 year hiatus. I didn't intend to leave my MS program for so long but life happened (and COVID). \n\nUnfortunately, I am way more rusty on the material than I thought I would be. I am struggling to keep up, and I am afraid I might fail. I think the best course of action is to drop with a W. Hindsight is 20/20 but I shouldn't have jumped back in with both feet.\n\nI am intending to take some time to regroup, but I also want to apply to programs in a different field. Part of this is due to the fact that I will time-out on my coursework if I keep delaying my return, but I also feel that my interests and career focus have shifted elsewhere. \n\nAny advice on how to approach my professors from my current program to ask for LOR, if I am not doing well this semester and want to apply to a different grad program? Is this just too awkward to do? I don't really have anyone else to ask for LOR from undergrad. I'm not sure if I should mention my desire to change programs at the same time I discuss dropping out so that I can explain my situation or if I should address it later when I need LOR? Or am I just screwed if I ever need LOR in the future?\n\nIf it matters, I am working full time in supply chain (while in school part time), which has gained a lot of attention in the news right now. I am hoping that if I explained that my long hiatus coupled with intense work hours has been more than I can handle this would be understandable. (And is truthful - I can't catch up in the course while also working in this industry right now).\n\nI should also say that my grad school GPA and relationship with my professors has been excellent up to this point. This semester just sucks, I have never struggled to grasp the material like this before, even in my past grad classes. I just feel awkward for returning to the program and almost immediately deciding to leave.",
