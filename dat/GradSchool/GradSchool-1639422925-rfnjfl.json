  "text": "hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this! i am currently in my first year of a two-year MA program in art history at a west coast (US) institution. i was wondering if anyone had any experience or opinions about this\u2026i would really love to do some sort of research experience/receive exposure to a museum collection on the east coast that specializes in a particular field of art history that i am specializing in with my own research and eventual thesis. Nothing quite like this museum is currently near where i live. this museum is affiliated with a university and is on university grounds. i wanted to see if i could reach out to the head curator (who is also a professor in the art history department at said school) and see if there is any way that i could potentially do something with and for the collection, either research or anything else, over the next summer. i\u2019m super afraid that this is inappropriate to ask, or if this is an uncommon request coming from an MA student, and that this will baffle the professor. it does not appear that this institution has typical research internships, or at least i cannot find out about opportunities as i am not affiliated with this institution internally and currently. I appreciate if anyone has advice, or if you would strongly recommend i do not reach out. thank you so much in advance!!",
