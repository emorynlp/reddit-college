  "text": "Hi! I'm looking for some articles to get me in the mood to think of new ideas and craft my own research path in STEM. Some articles I like are:\n\n1. The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research (https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research)\n\n2. You and Your Research (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)\n\n3. How to Choose a Good Scientific Problem (https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/sites/mcb.UriAlon/files/uploads/nurturing/howtochoosegoodproblem.pdf)\n\nI'm sorry if these are too specific to science but they're the ones I've come across. Are there any other articles similar to these that you like?",
