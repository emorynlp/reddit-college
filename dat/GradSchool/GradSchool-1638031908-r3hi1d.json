  "text": "Hey all! Hoping for maybe some perspective or advice from those who can relate- I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science last December and I\u2019ve been accepted for a Master of Science in the field of sustainability + environmental science that starts this January (non-thesis but with applied research projects throughout). \n\nThe Master\u2019s program is pretty interdisciplinary (as is the nature of sustainability) so it will have some components of law/policy studies that I\u2019m used to, but I guess I\u2019m a little worried about my knowledge gap in sustainability/environmental studies side of things, and just transitioning to applied science-based research in general.",

      "text": "This isn\u2019t exactly the same, but my BA was in ~Liberal Studies~ with a concentration in literature. Aka I dropped out of undergrad and went back a few years later and got the quickest degree I could. Anyway I\u2019m in a clinical psych doctoral program now. I\u2019m the only one with an unrelated undergrad, although I did have to go back and take some undergrad level classes to meet minimum application requirements. I\u2019ve found that it wasn\u2019t too hard to catch up. Most of where I\u2019m lacking is in research related classes and work in the lab. My faculty mentor has been super helpful at getting me up to speed on everything, as have the more experienced folks in the lab. \n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much! You\u2019ll get the hang of the applied stuff once you dig into it. You wouldn\u2019t have been admitted if they didn\u2019t think you were equipped to do it! I would just encourage you to not be afraid to speak up if you\u2019re completely lost. In my experience it\u2019s been well received and I\u2019ve gotten good advice.",

For me, I hated working a computer job and wanted something with more human interaction. I\u2019d always been interested in nutrition on a personal level and used the process of elimination to figure out that I didn\u2019t want to be a doctor, physical therapist, teacher, or other \u201chands-on\u201d career.\n\nHonestly, everyone in my program came from a different background so I never felt like there really was a knowledge gap. It just made for much richer discussions when we could get perspective from people with backgrounds in nutrition, chemistry, marketing, policy, etc.\n\nI think imposter syndrome is natural and most people in grad school are probably also dealing with it. So you\u2019re definitely not alone!",

You\u2019re probably better off than those with a BS because you took a more diverse course load and it seems your Masters will also be diverse.",

Now after finishing that and enjoying research so much I am a PhD candidate in Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. I was never necessarily bad at science in high school, but I wouldn't call myself good at math or science courses. Since my BFA, I've had to take 3 separate anatomy&physiology courses (my figure drawing background actually helped a little for this), 3 statistics courses, neuro, several research methods courses, other clinical courses, bio, etc. \n\nAll that to say, that if I can go from a studio art degree to a PhD in a medical science field, you can do your transition too! I really enjoy interdisciplinary programs (like my PhD is now) because you can appreciate your (and others's) unique perspective and experiences. I felt like I was able to bring something different to the conversation and connect in a different way. Be proud of yourself and where you've come from, you and your journey make a difference!",

Especially compared to my classmates who come from a myriad of backgrounds but most with a science degree or even better, direct experience working in the field.\n\nI\u2019m also a first gen grad student, so I\u2019m pretty much going in blind overall.

Her research has been more social science but she's taken hard science/ag courses and been fine.\n\nI was in an interdisciplinary sustainable ag type MS and people with various backgrounds were plenty successful and made transitions to/from more social sciences to more natural and vice versa.\n\nYour policy knowledge and understanding will be a huge help to you - and your classmates! Some will know a lot more science content and can help you study and some will be desperate for help in policy analysis. You'll likely have someone(s) like me in your cohort who are interested in systems thinking and policy... But have no idea where to start in on actually analyzing or comparing any of it.\n\nYou may find that you have a couple of gaps but overall, you'll be fine. They wouldn't have accepted you if they thought you were missing a lot of knowledge. I would recommend asking someone in charge at the program if they have any preparatory reading recommendations, or if they can ask around and get some. I think that would set you up for success and also help assuage a lot of your fears.",
