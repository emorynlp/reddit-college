  "text": "Hi everyone, I need some advice about what I should do for grad school. I am applying to grad schools right now, and my endgame is to get a job in the biomedical device industry, ideally something like a product development engineer or something of that sort. I am really torn on whether I should do a Masters or a PhD. All the professors that I have talked to are encouraging me to just apply for the PhD and leave with a Masters after 2 years if I don\u2019t want to continue, so that I won\u2019t have to self-fund. However, I feel that this will potentially disappoint the professor I will be working under, and it will make it hard to get a referral to future jobs. Also, I won\u2019t be coming out with a first author paper if I master out. I want to apply for a masters and try to get a TA or research assistantship but I don\u2019t know how rare that is, and I don\u2019t want to self-fund. Since BME is a relatively newer field, I don\u2019t even know whether getting a Masters will improve my starting salary or job prospects all that much compared to a bachelors. But I am also not prepared to go do a PhD for 4-5 more years. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Whether or not you can get a TA or RA while doing a Master's is totally dependent on the school and the relevant department you'll be in. You need to communicate with the grad student coordinator or the department chair to determine that, or even what the liklihood of that is. I would not advise getting into a PhD program with the intention of dropping out early. But you need to know what kind of requirements are called for by the jobs and employers you'd be interested in. You can either try to find sources on that yourself, or you can try to ask a PI that you're familiar with about the job prospects in the field.",
