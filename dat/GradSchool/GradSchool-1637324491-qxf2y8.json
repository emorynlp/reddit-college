  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nNot sure whether this is the right sub for this but I am interested in writing a popularized summary for my PhD project.. my supervisor is a bit unhelpful and I am a bit unsure where to start. \n\nI have obviously gone on google and have searched for examples but I am still unsure how to write a popularized summary. Do you have any tips for a beginner? Are there any specific websites that are particularly helpful with this? Are you familiar with any web pages where I can look for examples? Any tips/ help is appreciated. \n\nThank you all a million =)",
