Then ask for recommendation of papers or authors that might help you dig deeper. Most professor enjoy that kind of conversation, but find other things get in the way too often.",

So your supervisor doesn\u2019t need to spend time teaching you (as at this level, you learn from reading), but should be able to help you out when you get stuck.",

Luckily I have an advisor that's patient enough to head a journal club for us non-senior members and he's pretty good at bridging the gap between our class knowledge and journal articles. I do though have many peers that are not as fortunate.",
