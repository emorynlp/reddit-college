  "text": "Good afternoon! \nDoes anyone know for full time taught masters, what are contact hours ? \nIn some universities, it's stated two days per week actually in lectures/other activities in campus, for some nothing is stated. Asking, because I am looking to apply in different city and what to prepare - for two days in person,say I would travel, if more than that, would consider moving closer. \nParticularly, thinking about QMUL. Emailed, received response that didn't actually answer my question.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have something like 3 contact hours per module per week (4 modules/term) but that is in a London university in computer science + finance. Other courses in other departments can have massively different hours.",

              "text": "Often universities have a module catalogue for each of their modules listing the topics covered, who the lecturer is, how it's graded etc. Usually, it also lists the number of contact hours. So I would find the course that you would be enrolled in from your university website, then look at each of the modules it mentions in the module catalogue. Should help a little bit?",

A friend did an MA and was in for about 2 hours every other week. I\u2019d see if there was a PDF with extra course information on the websites of universities you\u2019re interested in and go from there. \n\nGood luck!",
