  "text": "PhD Pros:\n\n* You could still get a full PhD if you really enjoy your program\n* You actually get paid (instead of paying the school)\n* You could always just leave with a masters\n\nPhD Cons:\n\n* Lower Acceptance Rate\n\nSo even if one was only interested in a master's degree, why wouldn't the default be to pursue a PhD program with the intention of mastering out, unless/until the prospect of staying becomes highly compelling?  \n\n\nUpdating after discussion: \n\n* You might be *taking the opportunity* from somebody who actually wants to see their research through. But then again, you might decide that you like living at college, love your research, and want to stick it through yourself\n* You're sort of exploiting the system, but at the same time, the system itself is a bit exploitative, so maybe you have the right to be Machiavellian\n* Unless you're absolutely sure that you don't want to see a doctorate through, starting as a PhD student gives you more optionality either way\n* Canada seems to do everything more reasonably  ",

There are also separate classes, which the doctoral-level classes being more theoretical and the master\u2019s level classes being more applied. It\u2019s not a difference of the doctoral-level classes just having additional work\u2014they straight-up have different curricula and you would not walk away from the courses with the same practical abilities. After two years in the PhD program and mostly done with my coursework, I would say that I\u2019m very much *not* qualified through my coursework to do a lot of master\u2019s level work in industry; our department designed the PhD coursework to be deliberately different.",

I did the master\u2019s in the end, and now that I\u2019m just about done, I wouldn\u2019t go back in time and do it any differently. I did get to take a gap year (just started that) that turned out better than I could have ever imagined, and I want to switch topics and schools for my PhD. I\u2019m much more prepared for a PhD now, and my application will be much stronger.\n\nI was quite lucky to get a fully funded master\u2019s at a top school for my field, so there was no downside to doing it first. But when I decided to get my master\u2019s, I did not know I\u2019d get full funding at this school. I did know I would at least get full funding at my undergrad institute, though it was much lower ranked and not specialized in my area of interest. If I ended up taking that route, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d come to the same conclusion I have now - that getting a master\u2019s first was worth it.",

I wanted some research experience and some graduate level classes to sort of test the waters to ensure I want to continue onto a PhD.

I've decided that I would like to go on of course, but I'm not sure at the end of my undergrad that I even felt prepared and qualified to start the MSc. Sometimes the 2 years of a masters can be more about personal growth than serving some academic need.\n\nAlso, in my particular case, my MSc is designed to hone in on a more particular branch of my field, as my BS is in physics, but my MSc will be in geophysics.\n\nAs a result of this, I will have a Masters to my name, and a much nicer CV with solid research, and a TA position, among other things, attached to my PhD applications as a result. Your mileage may vary of course.",

A MA in certain areas of study does not necessarily get you very far in every field despite a PhD opening up more opportunities, particularly because some careers really prefer to see more professional masters degrees rather than a typical MA you would get \"along the way\" during your PhD.\n\nFor example, a MA in political science actually doesn't get you much. In undergrad, I was told that the typical advanced degree tracks for political science majors were to get a MA in Public Admin, Public Policy, International Relations, etc. (a \"professional\" degree) or to get a PhD if I wanted to go the academic route. A MA in political science is a stepping stone to the PhD, and most related careers would prefer to see a professional degree like listed above rather than a MA in political science. So mastering out in some fields may get you a masters degree, but that masters on its own may not be as valuable to you as a masters from a more specialized, separate degree route that you could have gone.",

There were other factors, but these were both huge for me in determining which programs to even apply to. I'm very glad I made the terminal masters choice because it was a struggle for me to finish, and I personally *needed* it to feel like an accomplishment after delaying so long rather than feeling like a failure at getting a masters.",

(The transfer oral exam served essentially the same purpose as a PhD qualifying exam.)\n\nIt meant that students who didn't like their project, their supervisor, or the academic world had a straightforward off-ramp, without spending four years spinning their wheels. Students who decide to go ahead with their PhD don't lose time writing an MSc thesis, and have a pretty clear idea of what they're committing themselves to.",

Theres a huge gap in confidence and class performance between the PhD students in my classes who are right out of undergrad and those who took the time to work or do a masters first and i understand now why everyone in my field told me I should give a masters more consideration. It's also relevant that in my field you have to commit to your specific project and advisor before accepting (no lab rounds here) so it's really really beneficial to know some more people in the field and to be really certain what you're specifically interested in studying",

I would give their info to my contacts. I would check out their resume.\n\n\nThe only people I hear saying 'Mastering out is dishonest!

And the ones that have a nice PI and have an uneventful time mastering out will not write online so often or so extensively about their experiences -- so we don't get to hear from them. There are a lot of selection biases going on here.",

                  "text": "Your example is just as anecdotal as mine. But I understand your point. My situation may not be the norm, and that is valid. I had the same worries of my PI reacting poorly to when I announced I wanted to Master out. My point is to give hope to people and that it doesn't need to always be doom and gloom. That there are decent PI's out there who understand that their career path is not the end all be all. Only someone can judge how their PI can react, and if they know it's not positive then I empathize and sympathize with them. It is then time to gather your committee, find mentors outside of your PI, friends, staff, and those you know who can support your transition and time in the lab, and make it bearable as possible. Graduate school is murky, and hard to navigate. In the end, we are all just people trying to find our way.",
