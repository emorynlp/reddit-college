  "text": "I opened my computer this morning and for some reason my manuscript seems not only to not have changes from my last session saved but the past 5 days of edits are also magically gone. Four pages and who knows how many in-paragraph edits gone into the void, no unsaved document versions to be recovered, and I have no idea how it happened.  I usually back up everything to an external harddrive weekly but thanks to this incident I bit the bullet on cloud backup as well. Thank God for citation managers-if I didn't have one I'd really be up shit creek on the re-write. \n\nAnyways, don't be like me! Be prepared for inexplicable and bizarre document mishaps with multiple backups, at least one of them synchronous.",

I get the yearly package, so I can go back to any version of my files over the past year. I've recovered old files so manny times that way and it's really easy to use. Also, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc are not backup services, they are file sharing services. If you delete your file on your computer Dropbox it will sync this deletion online and you will not have a copy of that file. You need a true backup like TimeMachine for Apple, etc.",

But I don't know how it compares to Backblaze... Backblaze is more like, it's just working in the background and taking a snapshot every so many minutes. Then you can access your files on the online portal if you need to go back in time. So it's not a good replacement for \\*constantly\\* going between versions, more for once in a while.  Not sure how OneDrive works, worth looking into - could do the trick for you!",
