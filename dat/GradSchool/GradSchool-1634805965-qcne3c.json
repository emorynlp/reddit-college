  "title:": "Exhausted from PHD and just want to quite",
  "text": "I started my PHD in 2020 abroad in Finland. From the start it was really rough. I landed the position just as the pandemic was kicking off in late March, and I wasn't able to make it over here until October 2020 because of pandemic restrictions. Because of the pandemic I didn't get to have any orientation, I only met my supervisors once until 2021 and I ended up working alone in a studio apartment at home in a foreign country. During Christmas of 2021 my entire family caught covid, and there was nothing I could do about it here in Finland.\n\nI went long distance with my partner, and we had the idea that he would try and do his masters in the EU so we could be closer. He got into an EU masters program for fall 2021, but because he's from a 3rd world country his vaccine card is not being recognized. Which means that he is stuck back in his home country and we're stuck very far apart. I'm in software engineering so I was able to work completely remote. Which means I don't have a cohort, at all. Because everything is so remote, last August, I discussed going fully remote for the spring semester with my supervisors so that I could be with my partner. They had agreed back then, but now they're asking me to be here in January. \n\nI spent the better half of 2021 building a data visualization system which will be the foundation of my thesis. And while I really enjoyed building it, now that I'm done I just feel empty and exhausted. I just want to go home and see my family. I just want to be with my partner. I can't find the motivation to work on anything anymore.",

      "text": "That sounds tough and I can completely understand why you are exhausted. I also started somewhere new in the middle of the pandemic and I am very poorly connected with the institution. \n\nI can imagine your quality of life improving greatly if at least your partner was close by. I have read that for vaccine certificates that are not accepted in the EU, you could still apply for converting the certificate (and it could then be accepted). Did you already look into that possibility? [Here](https://reopen.europa.eu/en) is an overview of measures in place in EU member countries (select a country and then check the icon with the globe to see what requirements are in place for entering the country if you are not from the EU).\n\nApart from that, would it be possible for you to visit your family or partner for an extended time (like a month or more)? Maybe you could ask your supervisors to work remotely for that time or you could just take vacation. \n\nFinally, if you want to vent, my DMs are open. I am in a similar situation and I am trying to negotiate working conditions that allow me to see my partner and family more often.",

          "text": "Thanks for the support. Unfortunately the place where he's doing the first year of his program (Malta) has been extremely strict. But it's looking like he may be able to be in Malta by spring semester...hopefully.\n\nI did talk to my supervisors about trying to work remote either from back home or with my partner for awhile and they said that would be ok, my plan was initially to go home for Xmas and then just stay longer. The thing is we have a big study coming up, any time from January to March, which means I'd need to be back in Finland. I really wish I could have a more specific date for that study... I may ask if we can chose a set date in March for the study so that I can stay longer post-Xmas. \n\nIf you don't mind me asking what's your working situation like with your partner and family? What solutions for being closer to them have you found?",

              "text": "Oof, Malta looks extremely strict indeed. It looks like they are accepting more certificates in relatively regular time intervals, so hopefully it will work for the spring semester. Fingers crossed!\n\nYour plan with the Christmas break sounds good. There should be no harm in asking if the study starting date could be pushed back a bit in the given timeframe. I hope your supervisors are understanding. Based on my experience, nothing really happens until mid-Janaury anyway because most people are on holidays. \n\nMy family and partner are still relatively close to me (below 6h travel time), so I can visit them more often. The best solution I have found is figuring out when I absolutely need to be in the office/lab and work from home (flat with my partner) otherwise. I experienced that it seemed to become more accepted by my supervisor and coworkers over time. In your case, maybe you can work from home for a month or two every once in a while? This means a lot of travel of course, but one can get used to that. So, I guess my main advice would be to negotiate that you could work from home in relatively regular intervals.\n\nThen, there is more general things I do like phone calls or making plans for the time when I see them again, which also keeps me going. \n\nFinally, getting to know people in the country/city I am working in is also helpful for my mood. I don't exactly have close friends here, but I occasionally meet people and that always significantly improves my mood. Roomates could be great for that. There are also often networks of people that are from the same country ([example](https://www.awcfinland.com/)).\n\nHope something of that was useful!",
