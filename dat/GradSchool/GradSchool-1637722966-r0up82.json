  "text": "Okay, so this is very off the cuff and I haven't really considered well my question because I'm also in the middle of listening to my uni's grad society annual general meeting. Here's hoping it makes sense.\n\nI have persistent depressive disorder (aka dysthymia in former versions of the DSM) and part of that is currently manifesting as anxiety about my project proposal and specifically my advisor's notes on it. Specifically that he's rather busy and after turning in a major draft, I haven't heard back from him on when he'd be able to give me notes on the draft.\n\nThe last time we met via video conference was two Fridays ago. During that meeting, he said that while he was very busy with his PhD students and his courses and also his work as the editor of a journal, it wouldn't take him that long to give me notes back if I emailed the draft to him that Monday by 3 pm. On Monday itself, my area had a power outage which started around 2:30 pm and lasted until 5 pm. I emailed my draft as soon as the power came back on, and then a whole week went past without me hearing from him about the draft. I \\*did\\* hear back from him during the week about possible courses I could take next semester to support my research project, but nothing else.\n\nYesterday, I was having lunch at the student union and overheard two people having a conversation which was very relevant to my research project. When the two people got up to leave, I briefly interrupted them to say that I am researching the very thing they were talking about and it turns out that one of them works for the uni and had co-taught a course with my advisor at one point. He didn't have a business card on him but told me to tell my advisor that he said hi. So of course, I emailed my advisor to say that, to ask when we could talk about my draft, and to inform him that I was taking Thursday and Friday off for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday (I'm living/studying in Canada).\n\nGiven how much email has gone back and forth already, when is an appropriate time to email him again?",

      "text": "I would suggest disengaging this part of your brain for the holidays.  No offense, but I doubt very seriously that your advisor was as hung up on 3 pm on Monday as you were.  If that is part of your concern, I think you can safely set that aside.  \n\nLike many advisors s/he has a mountain of responsibilities to juggle and not enough time.  More than likely your advisor is working on a different timeline than you are.  S/he is thinking in terms of a week and you are thinking in terms of a day.  To be honest, s/he probably took your comment about Thurs/Fri to mean that it wasn\u2019t urgent to get the comments back to you.  \n\nYou\u2019re excited about the work your doing and I\u2019m sure they are supportive or they wouldn\u2019t be working with you.  It\u2019s very possible that they underscored their timeline to communicate that it may take more time than you would like it to.  That is, they are engaging in expectation management.  That\u2019s my take on your situation based on what you\u2019ve said.  I think you\u2019re probably overthinking it.  Give it a week.",
