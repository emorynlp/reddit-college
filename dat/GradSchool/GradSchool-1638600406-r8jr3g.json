  "title:": "Unexpected institutions are downloading my MA thesis\u2026why?",
  "text": "So I submitted my MA thesis in August to my former institution\u2019s open access digital repository. Since then I\u2019ve had 36 downloads from around the world, which blows my mind. I didn\u2019t expect it to get any downloads. I actually kinda hoped no one would read it, because I always look back at my writing and go \u201cew.\u201d\n\nSome downloads have been from universities, which is understandable\u2026\n\nBut I got some commercial and government downloads! It\u2019s freaking me out!\n\nOne download is from a chemical industry company in TX, another is from a telephone company in Prague, an internet company in Brazil, an internet company in Oklahoma, and two downloads from the state of North Dakota. What!!??? Plus a number of unaffiliated individuals across the country, some of which make sense because they\u2019re from areas I\u2019m affiliated with. \n\nMy thesis was about conservation, capitalism, and zoos. I don\u2019t get it. Is this real? Why would the state of North Dakota, a chemical company, a phone company, and internet companies want my thesis?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI\u2019m already embarrassed as it is. I wish I knew what I signed up for, having my name out there like that. It\u2019s embarrassing. I never thought people would actually download it. In a few years I\u2019m gonna look at my MA thesis and think \u201cew how could I have written that??\u201d Now I don\u2019t want to publish anything, ever\u2026.why am I in a PhD program? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nI\u2019m just\u2026embarrassed. I put myself out there for the world. And now random companies are downloading it. It feels weird. It can\u2019t be right.\n\nAnother commenter in another sub said it could be bots. Idk how bots work or what they do, but I hope it\u2019s that. Don\u2019t know why bots would want my thesis though, either.",

Look, I get the pressure of needing to be professional and have a pristine academic legacy, but at the end of the day, the shame you feel in having your work seen is your own construction. If your standards are higher than they were when you finished your thesis, then that means you\u2019re growing as an intellectual. The point is not to get it right the first time, the point is to get it right the 10th time after learning 9 times. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.",
