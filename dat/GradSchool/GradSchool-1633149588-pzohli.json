  "text": "After I accepted my offer to my current PhD program, my professor told the public during one of my undergrad presentations that I earned a prestigious PhD position at my university.\n\nI do not think of my acceptance into a PhD program as prestigious, but I was wondering, do you believe that they are prestigious in itself?",

      "text": "It's not really *provable*. Like, you couldn't list an acceptance on your CV. Prestige isn't about how you *truly are* it's about how people think of you. The fact that you were offered a spot means that the faculty at the other program thought that you were a good candidate, which is evidence in favor of your abilities. It would give you prestige if it were generally known to people that this happened. But it won't be and there's really no way to try to change that that wouldn't seem incredibly odd and wind up being counterproductive.",

E.g. it said something like: University of [Name], $[funding amount] -- Declined. The person had it listed under their awards. I already have too many awards on my CV but I can see why someone who doesn't can use it to boost their CV",

It is an acknowledgement of \\*potential\\* and not really of \\*accomplishment\\*.\n\nYour prof is understandably proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself.  But keep in mind that by praising you they are also indirectly praising themself and their program.  All programs do this.  High schools brag about their students' college acceptances.  Undergraduate programs brag about their students' grad school acceptances.",
