  "title:": "Advice on Writing a Statement of Purpose",
  "text": "To get the basics out of the way, a statement of purpose should include:\n\n* Reasons for attending the school\n* Academic and personal background\n* Long-term goals\n* Research interests\n\nSo where do career transitions fit in?  For example, what should a business student include if he or she wishes to switch to conservation science but lacks the necessary background?",

      "text": "I would state it at the beginning. Describe your background and your journey so far, and then spend the rest of the SOP talking about your new interests and how your current experience makes you a good fit for that degree. I\u2019m assuming you have some relevant experience. There\u2019s always a way to spin anything into making it relevant to your desired field",

      "text": "Oh boy, do I have a story for this.\n\nI was premed and in a Master's program to beef up my application for med school. I also worked in EMS.\n\nDue to some trauma I suffered from EMS, I decided to go full PhD. so I have the same issue as you with \"how do I explain my career transition?\" Oh and this was my third career transition as I was a musician before I got into medicine. So I had to explain all three career transitions in a believable way.\n\nMy advice: make it personal. State what you learned in your previous career, but how you have uncovered a new passion for conservation science.\n\nDo not be afraid to get personal. You don't need to have a sob story, but get a little personal here. They want to get  to know you a bit through this, so you need to let you personality and goals shine through especially as it applies to the career switch.\n\nYou are more than welcome to PM me and I can send you my personal statement/statement of purpose as I had to address many of the same issues you do.",
