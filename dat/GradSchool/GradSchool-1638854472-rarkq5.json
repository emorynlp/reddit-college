  "text": "After I struggled to keep up with my coursework, I finally failed out. A \u2018D\u2019 in my program is considered a failing grade and I missed it by 4 points. I\u2019ve been dealing with so much change and I think I simply ran myself into the ground and burned out and I hate it. I started before completing my bachelor\u2019s degree, I took one course as I finished my last semester in my bachelors, then got a job and completely uprooted my life to move away from my home state by myself and I did not handle it well.\n\nI struggle with depression and ADHD already and the workload of three writing intensive courses, plus working night shift, plus not having the power to make my own schedule for work at the moment made everything 10 times worse. I thought I could do it and now all I feel like is a complete failure. I missed deadlines and felt absolutely no desire to do my classes, then on top of all of that, we had a sudden death in my family that really had me hit rock bottom.\n\nI feel like a complete failure. I feel inadequate and like I\u2019ve wasted my time, money, and effort. What do I do? Do I try again in the future? I\u2019m beating myself into the ground about this and I know I shouldn\u2019t be, but I had to just get this out to people who maybe have felt this way or know someone who feels this way now. I just feel really alone in this right now.",

What I\u2019d do is use the time now to find a job in a field that makes you happy and might be similar, gain experience and go back if you want later. You can explain how you grew as a person + overcame the struggle of graduate school during a pandemic. Give yourself some grace? Everyone is at their wits end right now, and it sounds like you are too.",

      "text": "You think you're a total failure for giving yourself an insane amount of responsibility and not being able to handle it? That doesn't make you a \"total failure\", that makes you human! You've very clearly set extremely high expectations for yourself, way higher than most other human beings, and I sure don't see all these other humans who didn't even try to do grad school AND keep up with a job considering themselves to be even more colossal failures. You gave yourself more than you can handle during a time when you weren't equipped to handle it. It happens.\n\nJust try to be kind to yourself here and realize how much higher you set the bar for yourself than most others do for their own selves.",

      "text": "Have you talked to your mentor/advisor/graduate program director/chair? These sound like pretty overwhelming circumstances.  Some are beyond your control.  Others are within your control and you\u2019ll need to make the necessary judgements about how to manage them moving forward.   But, at the very least, you need to take the bull by the horns and talk with someone.  They may or may not be able to do anything to help you.  But even if you don\u2019t anything from them, you owe it to yourself to explain to them your circumstances.  If there are things you can modify to ensure your success moving forward tell them. I can\u2019t say this will get you the results you\u2019re hoping for but you should at least explore the possibility.  Regardless, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.  Life sounds hard enough as it is.  Some self compassion will go a long way.",

      "text": "Hey you are absolutely not alone. I am in this boat with you, or am about to fall into one similar to it: It's the last week of finals and I'm still working on midterms that probably won't be accepted at this point. Today (or rather, this evening/morning at 1:26), I've failed yet again to produce more than 300 usable words for a research paper due over a month ago despite sitting here for 8 hours--and this kind of thing has been going on for months. Every day for the past several months I've felt an intense shame when yet another day ends without me being able to just finish one thing. Worse is the self-hatred because I know I'm  beyond capable of doing this stuff, but my ability to function with ADHD/depression like I used to has completely left me after multiple deaths and various life stressors over the last year. Unfortunately my sense shame and fear about failure is also gone, which is a problem because they used to give me enough motivation and cognitive ability to get straight A's; now I just seem to want to go sleep or lie down on the ground for the rest of my life. This term I've started to sleep through alarms, was late for almost all classes, and just generally have stopped caring about anything in life besides my cat and family (living beings who actually matter more than this dumb degree and the pointlessness of it all; imagine that). I received multiple extensions and my professors have been beyond generous because of my previous work and ideas. Yet I know their patience can only go on so much, and even with a doctor's note I can't expect them to let me get away with being such a shitbag.\n\n*/possibly relatable preface rant*\n\nAnyway, you mentioned that you feel burned out, had a death in the family, are dealing with various life changes, and just generally feel powerless in life. This is too much for anyone to bear without making some adjustments, and receiving grace from both yourself and others as another poster mentioned. Although I cannot claim that I can truly understand what you are going through, I have had all of these experiences as well (including multiple deaths plus long-term COVID-related health complications in family despite all their precautions and perviously good health and being decent people who don't deserve such fates) in the last several months and have been burned out and overworked myself for about two years (including one other failed master's!). And I can tell you with certainty that you will not be able to recover unless you forgive yourself for any perceived mistakes or failures you have experienced.\n\nI have also realized that when it comes to the burnout, it's a natural condition that comes about when your mind/heart/body is likely trying to warn you (and has been for a long of time) that you are killing yourself with what you're doing (and not doing!). Either you don't really want to do what you're doing, OR even if you truly do, you have been running yourself into the ground too long and need a break. You were doing something unsustainable. It doesn't make you weak, it just means that something has been amiss too long in your life equation. Again, I have no idea if this really applies to you as it has to me, but thinking about what your body/heart might be telling you about what you really need or want. I mean, based solely on this post, it really doesn't even sound like you wanted your bachelor's, your job, or your master's. Have you actually been doing what you want? If not, it's time to look elsewhere. If you do like what you've been doing, you need a break; as another poster mentioned, there are ways of continuing, but please for the love of god do NOT go back until you have recovered and are in a better place.\n\nAlso, keep in mind before you beat yourself up about being so burned out that you can't do what you are \"supposed to\" anymore that some people are more suited to many aspects of modern society than others--and based on my experience, those of us who are lucky enough to have both ADHD AND depression are not among those most suited. You among the brightest students in the program who can make new contributions to your field, but if you can't operate the same way as students with brains that are more suited to meeting arbitrary deadlines and thinking in neat boxes, then you are going to have even more added stress that the average grad student (all other things equal). Toss in the death in the family and other major stressors, and you have a recipe for crashing and burning.\n\nOn the subject of death in the family--please, PLEASE go speak with the campus mental health or some counselor and find out a way to get regular therapy to cope with not only that but all this other stuff going on. Death is something that society likes to move on from ASAP, but clearly this is something that is affecting you and must be addressed. Do not let it go unaddressed. I went back to work after burying my mom last year and immediately pushed everything out of mind so that I could do my job and do grown up things. It turned out that I did that to my own detriment, I had dreams about her for months and am only just now starting to properly process what happened and what it meant for me.\n\nOn the school side, did you ever tell your professors/advisor about all this? Like other posters, I am concerned that you didn't mention anything about that. Given the increased popular support for mental health recently, schools in particular have become remarkably understanding and helpful when it comes to students with genuinely difficult circumstances such as the ones you described. Maybe you can talk to them about taking a break and coming back to finish your degree with some caveats? If it is too late now to come forward, in the future please, please don't martyr yourself by staying silent out of shame or fear of how others might perceive your \"failure\" to be OK and do everything that OK people can. I say this as someone who went 10 years without mentioning anything about my problems, even in the depths of my despair; after finally hitting rock bottom a few months ago, I finally confessed to my professors and advisor and learned that people knowing about my problems was not the end of the world. Yes, part of this is due to my apathy about life, and yes, I learned that many people are really uncomfortable when you cant respond palatably to \"How are you?\" for long periods of time. But I also learned that many can relate and are really there to talk to and help.\n\ntl;dr, forgive yourself, take it easier, get help, recover, reflect, take care and let me know how things go for you :)",
