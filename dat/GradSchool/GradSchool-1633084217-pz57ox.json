  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm in the first year of my PhD in Europe and I have a friend who also started her PhD around the same time as me. We work in different labs and different topics but our domains are more or less the same. It's been 6 months since I started and about 8 months since she started. She is currently writing a paper; and while I have some interesting results and writing a paper is on the cards, I haven't started yet. I sense that I'm feeling a lot of envy and I want to stop feeling this way as it's not healthy, both for me and for our friendship. How do I deal with this situation? Looking forward to hearing from you guys.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Simple, never compare yourself to your friend. Your friend is ~~better~~ more precious than your ego right? I mean I also envy of my other friend that can done their master 1.5 years, but I cheer for them, because they're good at what they do, and I think, I will try my best like them, so don't be too focus on your envy-ness, focus on the result you got. It will be fun. \n\nTLDR; focus on something that's worth doing",
