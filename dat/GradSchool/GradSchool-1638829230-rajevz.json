Even on the days you're feeling super tired and burnt out? If you answer no, then personally, I think spacing them out would be better. But if you think you can, then go for it and more power to you!",

Don\u2019t know where you\u2019re located but it gets dark by 5pm for me. Being inside all day without much sun or exercise is depressing. You will feel extremely burnt out if you\u2019re straight up in lectures for 9 hours in a single day. Even if your other days are light. If you can, try to balance out your schedule, for your own sanity.",

That could be a decent trade off for an otherwise fairly flexible week IF you feel confident in your time management enough to use the unstructured time effectively. If this would be three 3's multiple times per week, that's a different story. questions: how well do you function during that last 6-9pm block on a typical day? Are these lectures, seminars, labs, other? And how much do each of those sap your energy?\n\nI doubt I could do three 3's of straight lectures, but a lecture and a couple more engaging classes? Sign me up, especially with the flexibility for the rest of the week. Just make sure you're ready for that big day every week!",

I left for school around 5:45am and got home around 10pm, and most of the time packed meals the night before to take with me. \n\nI'll be honest, it was tough and I was very tired most days. I do have a private office/studio space so I was able to take naps and get a little privacy, which really helped. It also meant that I had to spend all day on my work since I wasn't home at all, so I was quite productive most of the time. It would have been miserable to do that every day though, it was really only doable because I only taught one MW afternoon class and nothing on Fridays, so I had breaks in my week.",

That day was *brutal* to be fair, and it was hard to get myself up out of bed to do it sometimes, but it felt so good to only have that one long day of teaching and then not have to worry about it at all the rest of the week.\n\nBut the other posters are right that you have to think about your own stamina and how you like to work. I like to work a few really long days so that I can then have full days of relaxing. It's just how my body/mind work, and not everyone can do that.",
