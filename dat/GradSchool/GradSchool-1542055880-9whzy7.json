Here's a bit of an overview to my own personal information management system:\n\ntl;dr - Yes, I back up an EHD to another EHD and NAS.\n\nActivities:\n\n1. I save nothing to only a native PC that I want. Yes, I save files there, but then...\n2. I save files I want to keep to a RAID 1 (that's a mirrored drive, typically a software configured array) external hard drive.\n3. Then I ensure that the top priority files (these are files that I can't get again or are cost-prohibitive to replace) are triplicated on a separate external hard drive.\n4. Finally, for non-personal data that I want to access outside the house (media, mostly), I quadruplicate these on a network attached storage. Since I believe that my NAS can be hacked, I keep little personal information, such as photos, on the drive.\n5. For school work, I'm also backing up in Google Drive. I'd been using Google Drive for a whole bunch of errata before, and nothing that was important. Until grad school. Now it's a bit of a learning process.\n6. Also remembered that I've got a Google Photos account, which has been backing up my Pixel-taken photos.\n\nConsequences:\n\n1. In repairing my data loss from the RAID failure, I've realized that I have over 1TB in archived music files alone. Of this, approximately 600GB are unintentionally duplicated files.\n2. Poor file management in years past has created a nigh-unnavigable system of random assortments of files. Some important, some not.\n3. Hastily created folders have mysterious content, some of which is only one file. There's a lot of whiskey tango foxtrot in that.\n4. Accidentally awakened elder god.\n5. It takes loads of time to manage data. More to recover.\n6. I can survive a catastrophic hard drive failure with little to no data loss.",

One of my buds forgot to sign out of their account in the library and the next yahoo that came along decided the fun thing to do would be delete everything in her google drive. There is a way to restore when this stuff happens, but it is a chunk of work best avoided by saving outside of the cloud as well.\n\n2. Not a problem for most of us still in school, but remember that when your university email is gone, so are the files in the cloud storage tied to it. An MA and undergrad didn't realize that on their way out, and now there is about a semester's worth of work that needs to be redone on the project they were working on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA horror story for those content to use a single external hard drive\n\n1. Sometimes those stop working and you should have more than one. I got back from the field with about 20gigs of data from a colleague. Didn't have internet in the field capable of putting it in cloud storage. Didn't have extra storage on my computer or thumb drive because I wasn't expecting to get the data. When I get back home, a happy dog tail swipes the external hard drive off the table just as I'm hooking it up. When I plug it back in, the hard drive was not recognized.\n\nNow I'm obsessed with redundancy and it has super saved my ass in at least three instances. I use two Google drive, the Box account from my university, server storage from my university, one external hard drive that gets backed up and stored in a locker at the library (in case of a fire at my apartment), two external hard drives that get backed up daily (I'm in data collection) and are with me in the field, and one external hard drive that is dedicated only to dissertation research, though dissertation research is redundant on all others, too.",
