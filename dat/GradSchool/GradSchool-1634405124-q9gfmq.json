  "title:": "My PhD supervisor tried to force me to \"master out\" due to my progress. It turns out that the problem was simply too hard. Has this ever happened to you?",
  "text": "It still makes me laugh till this day when I think back early on during my master when my now PhD supervisor sat me down and told me I could still get a \"master of engineering\" (a weaker degree) as opposed to a \"master of applied science\" (a more rigorous degree). Admittedly , at that time I wasn't really productive.\n\nThen a breakthrough occurred.\n\nIt turns out, simply the problem was too hard and my supervisor underestimated the difficulty because it looked like another (simpler) problem.\n\nNo, my supervisor has never really...said anything about it afterwards.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else, where your supervisor underestimate the difficulty of the problem then sort of blames it on you?",

Figuring out which paths to follow, and choosing those with the best combination of importance and tractability is something that distinguishes good researchers. You have to learn that by doing, but it helps a lot to have good mentorship so you don't just flounder.",

It turned out a bunch of groups had given up on this problem (without discussing it). Instead I solved the problem with a pretty sweet approximation when he was traveling for the summer. He saw my presentation and solution in my livestreamed job interview/seminar and asked me afterwards if it really worked that well; it did. I published the method and some results, won some awards and placed well in a competition. He gave me even more free reign after that then he had beforehand, and I finished my PhD a year later.",
