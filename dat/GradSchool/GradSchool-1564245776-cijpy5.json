  "text": "My mom was diagnosed with brain cancer just last week. She was given a month. I'm in my 4th year of a PhD program 800 miles away (home now). My advisor said to take off whatever time I need, no matter how many months, and he will continue to pay my stipend and tuition so I don't need to worry about it. Because of him, I'm able to take care of my mom in hospice at home, and spend her last few weeks with her. I wish I could put into words what this means to me, but the words just fall short...",

My PI and program were so supportive, and I'm glad you are having a similar experience \u2764\ufe0f. I'm finishing up my 5th year, and it is a really hard time to lose a family member to terminal illness with grad school on top -- but you are strong, and you will make it! Please reach out if you ever want to talk.",

Stay strong during these days and fill her last days with happy memories. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to.",

Best of luck to you both, there's a tough road ahead, but I hope you can cherish every moment with your mom.",
