      "text": "Having dealt with eczema for quite a couple decades of my life before I figured out how to manage it, the first thing to know is that once you break out with it, it can be hard to get rid of it.\n\nSo as soon as I start to feel like I have dry skin in the places where I tend to break out with it (such as the beginning of winter), I start using lotion regularly. \n\nSome lotions also tend to stay on my skin more. Eucerin Original Healing lotion is very good. Their Original Healing cream even better. \n\nIt's also better to put on lotion immediately after showering, or washing your hands, as it helps to seal in the moisture.",

I try to avoid using hand sanitizer if I can (super hard/impossible sometimes), stopped using the more scented hand soaps (Method has been working well so far), and try to remember to use lotion regularly and after washing my hands (Bag Balm, Udderly Smooth have worked well). I also had my PI get latex gloves for the lab so I don't have to destroy my hands when wiping down equipment. I'm sorry, it sucks. Hopefully will get better after winter.",
