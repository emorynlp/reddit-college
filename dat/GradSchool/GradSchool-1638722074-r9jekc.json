  "text": "I just finished most of my classes. I had 3.85 going into the semester. For a final grade grade in my classes got a C and a D. I know most programs will put you on academic probation with the Cs, but what about with a D?\n\nI figured my GPA will be at a 3.50. Will I get kicked out with a D? Some people have told me that I should've contacted the advising department. I was hanging in there with Bs until the finals hit. I'm not sure of the consequences or what I can do at this point.",
