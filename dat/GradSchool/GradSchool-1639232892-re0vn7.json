  "title:": "My advisor has lost interest in running our lab and I\u2019m losing confidence in this life decision, should I stay?",
  "text": "I joined the lab of an up-and-coming researcher in my field in 2020. Due to COVID, I wasn\u2019t on campus until about March of 2021 (just class work until then). Since then, I have barely been given any research direction or instruction of any kind. \n\nMy main project I anticipated contributing to was hung up in contracting a year longer than it was supposed to. I was on bridge funding until this month. Throughout the summer I was doing tedious and boring culture work, and every time I\u2019d ask what I was supposed to do with the cultures he\u2019d say \u201cwe need to have a meeting with the collaborators to discuss!\u201d And then it\u2019d never happen, despite my repeated offers to send the emails. After 5 or so months, he finally told me to try a method of quantifying an intracellular electron carrier, and it didn\u2019t work. His response was pretty much \u201coh well, dump them!\u201d. I basically dumped my time down the drain.\n\nNow, my main project is starting up. It\u2019s a big collaboration with several other labs. We have an important go/no-go meeting coming up in a month, and my advisor had cancelled our weekly meetings for 5 weeks in a row. I had to beg him to divert his attention from a virtual conference he felt the need to attend every zoom call for and meet with me this past week, and he only gave me 20 minutes. As it turns out, he was unaware that this deadline even existed and didn\u2019t believe me when I said we had to produce materials for it. He apparently wasn\u2019t listening during the meeting we had about it in October.  I had been keeping some stuff moving, but his response was basically \u201cfigure it out\u201d and now I\u2019m going to be stressing about it over Christmas.\n\nI\u2019m not alone. We have 9 PhD students and none of them are senior (only 2 in their third year). There are two post-docs, but they are assigned to two labs and specific projects so they don\u2019t have much time to help us with our individual problems. Our advisor is a kind man, but he is weirdly more interested in networking with everyone under the sun rather than running his lab, instructing us, or even just finding a dedicated post-doc to do it for him. On that last point, he told me that if I volunteer to TA for this two-semester class, he would use the money that frees up to get a post-doc for the lab. I did, and now he keeps pushing it off when I ask him when we\u2019re going to start looking for  that post-doc.\n\nPapers are not getting written, projects are in holding patterns, and nobody knows what they\u2019re doing. Morale is not good. I feel like i\u2019ll be here for 5 more years at this rate. Really, I could probably find a job in a week if I wanted, but it\u2019s always been a dream of mine to become a professor. I don\u2019t know if talking to him would change his behavior, and the only other professor i\u2019d be interested in working with at our school is going on sabbatical next year. Is this normal? Should I stay or go get a job? General advice?",

      "text": "Wait\u2026 are you saying he asked you to volunteer to be a TA to free up money to hire a postdoc to provide you with the research direction you need to make progress?  Because if so, that\u2019s pretty dysfunctional. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your lab is not good and it\u2019s difficult to imagine it getting better. If it were me, I\u2019d consider getting a job, regrouping, and applying for transfer to other programs if it\u2019s still your dream to become a prof. \n\nOne question, can you master out (or have you gotten a masters?) It\u2019s usually beneficial to reach a milestone like that before you would leave. \n\nBut yeah, sorry\u2026 I think you should leave. What you described around your volunteer TA is exploitative and not at all normal. Your adviser does sound like a problem and you\u2019re not going to change him.",

          "text": "Yeah, essentially I was offered the TA-ship if I wanted it, and when I was talking it over with him he said that if I took it we\u2019d have the money for a post-doc to help on my project. So I did, and now he\u2019s not doing anything to follow through on his end of that deal. So now I just have more work to do (that I didn\u2019t have to take on, really) with no benefit to myself. \n\nI also didn\u2019t mention that this was not the impression I got of him when I talked to him and his previous students before signing on. He promised weekly meetings and constant back-and-forth on data, and his previous students said the experience was largely positive. My understanding is that he had a first crop of students he spent a lot of time with, then a lull in funding where he didn\u2019t take anyone on for two years, and then he suddenly hit paydirt on a ton of proposals, and he\u2019s taken on a ton of students and established relationships with too many collaborators, and he\u2019s just not doing enough to keep up with it.  It particularly sucks because the money is there to do amazing things, but he is stuck in his \u201cI don\u2019t have funding\u201d mindset and he won\u2019t even let us buy equipment to do the research we want or even maintain broken instruments in our lab (he\u2019d prefer us to spend 5x as long at user facilities). \n\nI do have a Masters. The problem is that the jobs that would be available to me are probably similar to the ones I was doing before I went to grad school, and I\u2019m pretty lukewarm on that idea. Thank you for your response",

That\u2019s bad. \n\nIf you\u2019re not wanting to take a job, I think you can just apply for transfers from where you are. The question is whether you\u2019ll have rec letters. If you have a good record and letters, you\u2019re probably in good shape to just work on transfer apps, and that might be what I\u2019d do.",

Any way to develop a co-advisorship with sabbatical prof? To be honest, I\u2019ve never seen a co-advisor arrangement fix a bad advisor situation\u2026 but if you really want to stay and can\u2019t change advisors, that might be another avenue to explore.",

      "text": "This is very normal and a sign of the times. There are many end-of-career PIs that primarily enjoy a certain lifestyle and social standing that comes with heading a research lab. At the same time, many obtained their positions at a time when science required extremely less expertise and they now sit comfortably on their reputation. Everything productive in their labs originate from post-docs and RAs, which they then take credit for to obtain new productive post-docs and RAs. Probably the most important skill to their grant-funding is learning what their junior researchers have done\u2014well enough to convince future researchers that they participated in the formulation of those experiments. \n\nThe actual science is generated and carried out by post-docs and RAs, who exchange their labor and ideas for wages and access to the PI\u2019s connections. Whereas this used to be a tenable exchange to motivate junior researchers, many are learning that these wages are easily obtained elsewhere, that the connections are not as valuable as they thought (as career prospects are tarnished by oversupply of graduate degrees and adjunctification of research). Now you have many post-docs and RAs biding their time, looking for a way to jump ship. They are becoming more hesitant to give free ideas and free labor to the labs, and so nothing happens in the labs (most PIs are very disconnected from modern methodologies and practices and are unable to solely formulate the experiments that modern research requires). In spite of this unmeritocratic and inefficient system, academic research still occurs through mostly unpaid labor and the passion of junior researchers, but this was also financially motivated by the possibility of obtaining tenure. Now as more see that possibility is gone, people are poorly motivated to \u201cuse the lab\u2019s resources to build their career\u201d aka pretend that you are mutually assisting each other\u2019s careers when it really is one-sided exploitation. As a result you see labs in holding patterns, milking old experiments that prior post-docs and grad students refined decades ago, when motivators were more effective at extracting novel ideas and research. Most publications are rehashing old experiments, \u201ccollaborating\u201d or various PIs scraping their barrels of shelved data, and attempting to combine them into something \u201cnew\u201d. Everything is a copy of a copy, an imitation of something genuine. Unable to generate novel experiments, these zombie labs rely upon poor data-collection practices, falsification, p-hacking, and underhanded collaboration with other zombie labs (I\u2019m getting a little paranoid here).\n\nGet out my friend.",
