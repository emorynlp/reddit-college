  "text": "Looking to hear stories about those who have completed or are in the process of completing a master's program or ph.D. I'm an aspiring teacher, enrolled into a teaching alternative certification program that would subsidize much of the first master's! \n\n  \nJust recently, I've discovered that ph.D students get full funding, or a stipend to be exact to study and earn credentials. It blows my mind. As an aspiring teacher, it pays to increase your schooling and education. A second masters would increase my salary steps or a ph.D for that matter. I could also go for the edD.\n\n  \nWhat are some low-cost, or fully-funded master's or ph.D programs? Would love to hear from those enrolled in a graduate school, or ph.d at the moment! Thanks. \n\n  \nI've been obsessed with grabbing a ph.D and would most likely do it in communications or education. I have a bachelors in Communications with a specialization in advertising and public relations.",

      "text": "All PhD programs afaik are fully funded. Masters programs on the other hand can be either you pay or they pay you (very rare). NYU probably has the best stipend in the NYC area. You can make up-to $50k depending on how much you teach. Most other PhD programs are about ~30K in terms of stipend.",
