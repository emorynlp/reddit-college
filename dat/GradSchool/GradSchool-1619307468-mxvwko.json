  "title:": "Brief \"someone already wrote a dissertation about that\" heart-attack",
  "text": "I'm nearing the end of my PhD in the Humanities/Social Sciences at an EU university (where employed PhDs are on fixed term contracts). I really hate competition, so I struggled a lot to find a topic that was fairly obscure and approach it from a novel theoretical angle. I finally found a configuration I was really excited about, and I've been working on that for the past couple years. Things have been going slowly because of covid-relatex anxieties and issues, but the one thing I have never had any doubts about has been my topic.\n\n... That is, until about an hour and a half ago when an acquaintance at a different university in another country sent me an emails saying \"By the way, I just found these two dissertations written last year on exactly your topic.\". As you can imagine, my heart immediately dropped. My mouth went dry, my vision blurred... Had I not been sitting down at the time, I might have genuinely fainted. I really hesitated to open those two PDFs, but I held my breath and dove right in.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I did. Yes, those dissertations deal with much the same dataset, and yes they look at some of the same issues, but they use an approach that is considerably broader and more general, whereas mine is a very detailed focus on a specific subset of the phenomena they observed which they don't investigate in any detail. Even the parts where we genuinely look at the same stuff, we have very different theoretical frameworks, goals, and even some different conclusions. That means that I'll be able to engage their theses without worrying that I'm stepping on toes or reinventing the wheel.\n\nI struggle with a massive lack of self-confidence, so being able to realise and accept this is a big step for me, and I dare say I'm even a little proud of myself for not spiraling down into a pit of despair because of this. Gives me hope I may even finish!\n\nTL;DR - Thought not one but *two* people had already written my dissertation, but it turns out there's less overlap than I thought.",

I sometimes wish I had kept going with it, but I was really terrified of continuing in heavily theoretical programs. I am absolute junk at Generative syntax and was super intimidated by the prospect of spending the rest of my career in linguistics departments surrounded by brilliant syntacticians who often didn't even consider what I did linguistics. (I'm old, so this is back in the day when they really dominated most big ling departments. It's gotten a lot better over the past decade.)\n\nAlso, thanks! I look varied, but the phonology work is mostly in the past and I haven't kept up on the literature at all. At one point I decided to focus on a particular region with a limited set of languages/language families, and learn those languages really well as opposed to becoming a stellar theoretician.\n\nBy the way, one of those language families is Turkic, so if you ever have any questions about Turkic harmony let me know! I don't work much on the Turkic languages with more ATR-y harmony, but I know someone who does.",

He told me if only I was a few years earlier and I\u2019m just like- jdkaiwnak@. But, he said it is a great sign when you come up with a topic someone else also worked on recently, because it means that topic is interesting + publishable. I came up with new questions that can take a deeper dive building upon my predecessor\u2019s dissertation, so in the end, my research will be stronger thanks to their work is the way I think of it!\n\nI am super proud of you being able to accept it and overcome your feelings of panic! Best of luck to you!",
