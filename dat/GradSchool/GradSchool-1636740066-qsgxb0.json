  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI was wondering what are my chances of continuing to work in Europe after that I had graduated from a master's degree -mine would be in Data Science- do I get a good chance to continue working in Europe if I don't have a visa, or is it like I read about the US where people would have to leave since H1B visas are so hard to get there\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Are you doing your master's degree in Europe? If so, there may be a post-study visa available, depending on the country you are studying in. Different countries give different periods of time. After that, you generally need to be sponsored to a work visa in order to stay and work. It will depend on your experience, your connections, your location, your language abilities, and your general skills.",
