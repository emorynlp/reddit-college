  "text": "I feel like most people figure this out by the time they are older, but I am struggling a lot.\n\nMy partner and I just moved in together, and work-life balance has been hard for me. I used to sprawl out my days, working whenever inspiration struck, sometimes late into the night. But now I'm trying to condense it to a 9-5, and sometimes it just doesn't work.\n\nHow do you all do it?\n\nAnd side note, have you ever thought the academic life wasn't for you? Right now, I feel like it's not worth it, because of all the potential quality time that I'm losing with my partner. What other jobs could I do, without a PhD yet (STEM)?",

If your are afraid your partner is going to be upset that they have less time with you a couple of weeks just talk to them and explain that you have some bigger assignments that require more time and find other ways to spend time with them, or arrange to have a special day together when you finish the semester to make up for it.  \n\nWhen I was in grad school, because we didn't live together and my partner worked all week, we only saw each other on weekends, but I often had to do weekly readings and assignments on the weekends so we just hung out in the same space each doing our own thing but together.",

      "text": "My husband and I have been in school together for roughly four years. We don\u2019t spend a ton of time together because I also work 9-5. But a couple nights per week we will hang out and we also co-loaf where I do homework near him while he plays video games or vice versa. You\u2019ll have to compromise in school, and personally I really don\u2019t like devoting all my free time to another person. Sometimes I just want to sprawl out on my bed alone and watch a movie. I will bring it up, however, if we haven\u2019t spent any time together focusing on each other in weeks. \n\nI think if you can both be understanding during this time, it will go a long way. It\u2019s not forever and you just have to find moments to hang out (we take showers together because there are no distractions and we can just talk and fuck around, and sometimes have sex).",

After that point, my partner is usually coming home soon, our animals will need fed, or it will be time to cook dinner. I also devote time in the evening specifically to being present with my partner and our animals. Sometimes I do have to be reading while we're together, but I try to save \"easier\" or shorter readings for home. \n\nI also keep the rule for myself that I will not stay up past midnight on nights that I have a lot of work because I would rather wake up super early to do work than force my partner to go to bed alone with our animals. I also personally do better waking up early to finish things than I do staying up too late and I refuse to force my body to do an all nighter.",

              "text": "I think the difference for me is that these night/weekend work sessions are temporary and they go away after certain deadlines are passed. Whereas in grad school, this feeling is constant (at least in my program). \n\nMy partner, with his regular white collar job, occasionally gets way busier than I do, but these bouts usually last at most for 1.5 weeks. Then he\u2019s back to the 9-5 schedule, with the Summer Fridays (he gets the full day or partial day off every other Friday). He\u2019s accumulated a lot of vacation days he hasn\u2019t used because I can\u2019t take time off from lab (technically we get ~30 days a year, but it\u2019s so frowned upon to take more than 2 weeks off). All of my friends who work in various pharma positions (n=5) also have similar perks with time that my grad school friends and I do not have. \n\nPlus, the best part about working a job is the ability to quit and find a different job if you find that it\u2019s a poor fit. With grad school, you can probably switch lab once, then you\u2019re stuck there until you graduate or leave with nothing.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the compensation \ud83e\udd72\n\nThe lack of work/life balance isn\u2019t a problem that is unique to grad school, but IMO we do experience it worse than some working professionals because we lack the perks that would make the lack of work/life balance more bearable.",

For me, sometimes I am writing a paper or something that I have to work a ton, or have some weird experimental time points that require me to spend 18+ hours in lab, but those are sporadic. \n\nVacations are a whole different story and at least for me, a real killer. I always have something long term running and often can\u2019t take a weekend or more away from lab without setting myself back weeks. Even when I leave I usually have something to do (I had to write some sections of a grant last vacation because deadline was coming up).

Sometimes I can't swing it due to homework or projects but I know when I can it means a lot. His family is super important to him so if he says ahead of time he wants to see his parents on Thursday night, I make sure to write that paper early so I can be there. Another example is that my partner is huge football fan and we are flying out to see a game in December. I'll make sure I have my assignments done in time so I can have a stress free trip. It's a balancing act. Sometimes he \"fake\" moans and groans (but does feel ignored). I have to explain that it's not that I'm ignoring, it's that I'm super busy with school. I have found that it helps to communicate but there will be ups and downs. He has gotten a lot better with compromising over the years and I set boundaries more frequently now.",
