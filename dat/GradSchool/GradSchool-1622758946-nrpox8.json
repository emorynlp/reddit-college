No point in continuing with a PI that doesn't support you or believes in your success.\n\nNow I have comfy desk job in the field with a better starting salary than most postdocs.",

      "text": "Grad schools, reminds me of my shitty but helpful experience:\n\nMy prof was a busy guy and kind of pawned me off to a girl doing a phD in his lab, she hated me and the fact that I may be taking up part of her research. Like 1 week in, she told me that she will be first author of the work.  I didnt even know why that's important but sure. Naive, wide eyed me just tried to get along but she kept me out of the group at the lab, to her credit, she was very charismatic so ... It became too hard for me to stay and try to figure things out while most people tried to stay away from the drama or she actively pushed them away from me. Whoever I got close to, even the older lab tech she used to ignore, she would befriend to push me further into isolation. \n\nAnyways, that was best thing that has happened to me. I left academia because the competitiveness for publishing and being first author for a MS in biology was not for me and my mental health was suffering. I decided I just wanted to make money and live a chill life. I became a dentist instead, now I work 4 days a week and recently signed a contract to work 3 days a week making 100k usd. On my days off I work out and get massages. I'm so much happier now and looking back, it was all because of her.\n\nLastly. I found her Instagram all these years later. She got fat, she dropped out of her PhD and now works as a lab tech in a lab I know pays out 30k usd a year. Her apartment looks shitty and run down. \n\nI wish her well because if she was amazing, really helpful to me, and helped me get my MS, I would be working as a lab tech or on a PhD hating life. I owe it all to her.",

                  "text": "I totally agree that reporting hostile work environments to university HR departments, or the equivalent, should happen. I think that too often the path is difficult to find or these HR representatives have no interest in \"seeking justice.\" Instead, they prefer to quiet the issue and quickly escort the student out of their university by whatever means convenient. I had an abusive supervisor through my RA position at a university in the US. It turns out that my advisor also intended my supervisor to supervisor my entire thesis research and writing-- my advisor intended only to sign off on paperwork throughout my grad experience. When I brought the abuse to my advisor's attention, repeatedly, and asked for help, he absolutely refused to address the issue. After a year of this, I took it to my university's Title IX office. Since I was a white woman, I was not a protected class and could not be protected from harassment through their office. I was transferred to an official in the university who acted as mediator, which was helpful, but who, upon our first mediation meeting, informed me that she would not help me to \"seek justice\" in any way. She said it was her goal to help me be successful in or out of the program. That's nice, but it seems like sometimes these big academic machines are only looking out for their own welfare-- not doing the \"right\" thing. After mediation and striking compromises with the advisor and supervisor with the help of the mediator, I did graduate with a well-written and well-received thesis, a year late, but with no references from them. I wonder how my life could have been different since I left that university if someone *had* been brave enough to \"seek justice.\"",

Even industry post docs were significantly better than academic postdocs ($70K vs $45-50K). Industry postdocs are also focused differently from an actual industry role, which is that their work is academic and comparable to an academic lab. \n\nWhile a grad student I taught as an adjunct at a local community college. I considered going that route but then I learned that you have to teach for 3 years or longer to be even considered for tenure track. But I'd have to be making $40-50K teaching a full load without a guarantee that I'll be a full-time professor, after which I'll barely be cracking the six-figure territory. \n\nYou have to love what you do, but you also have to be willing to sacrifice your life outside academia to make it work financially.

After that the averages fell quickly but with Ohio and Hawaii at the top. California came in just under $100K for *unranked* faculty but only for three campuses, then the averages dropped immediately into the upper $70s in Delaware.  I've followed the AAUP reports since the late 1980s and am pretty surprised to hear that CCs anywhere are paying $100K.\n\nBut once you add \"field dependent\" that's an entirely different matter. There are always outliers in certain fields-- averages across all faculty are much more representative indicators of compensation.",

Maybe there are socio-cultural factors that drive a person with power to be shit to those without?\n\nMy advisor was a complete piece of shit who gave me hell till the very last minute. She didn't reply to my emails and would not turn up to the university on days she would schedule the meetings herself. She was toxic even when I was done and I needed her recommendation for my PhD applications. She said that she would write a recco for me for over 2 months and she backed out 1 month before deadline. And that is when I f-ing cut her off.\n\nSo why did she behave the way she did? Could be a number of factors. Maybe because I didn't suck up to the professors, as was the norm in my department. Maybe because I am from a socially marginalized group and she was socially privileged. Who can tell, right?\n\nOP here decided to not quit and get her/his degree anyway. We don't know the other side, true. But you are also completely dismissing the side in front of you?",

Choose people who you know will support an honest student like yourself, even if they are tough.\n\n\nOn a personal note, I chose a PI that also ended up acting like a mother figure.  10/10 recomend.
