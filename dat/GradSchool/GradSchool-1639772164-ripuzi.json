  "title:": "Original thoughts by undergraduates - should they never be included in an article?",
  "text": "A friend of mine is writing their first paper as part of an assignment. They're studying English translation and the research has to do with that.\n\nThey haven't had much guidance from their tutor, so they feel uncertain about how to go writing the paper in terms of quotes and paraphrasing.\n\nThey asked some questions such as:\n\n> Am I supposed to never include my own original thoughts in the paper?\n\nNot to get too philosophical by saying it's probably unlikely we've had thoughts no one has ever thought of first, but according to my understanding, an undergraduate student should stick to paraphrasing in their own words and only sometimes directly quoting pieces of text, while \"original thoughts\" could be left for sections such as the methodology/results/discussion/conclusion, and perhaps a little bit in the introduction, depending on the type of the article.\n\nIs this a fair assessment?\n\n> What is the point of me paraphrasing rather than sticking to directly quoting other articles while making sure to reference them properly? After all, I could never say things better than these experienced authors did.\n\nI think that is not the right mentality to have. I think the point is to learn how to write a paper and to put in the effort and show that actual research has been done, rather than copy/pasting portions of text. Why is this done? I don't know, but I do know this is how it's been done for centuries.\n\n>I'm not sure how to paraphrase and reference a collection of ideas into an amalgamation in a single paragraph in my own words, rather than paraphrasing each idea separately\n\nI think this can be done just fine - I've seen references written as something like [2-6] for example, following a piece of text that has taken something from references 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, for example. I'm not sure how easily this can be done in APA/MLA styles, though.",

      "text": "> Am I supposed to never include my own original thoughts in the paper?\n\nIt's not quite clear to me what you mean by this. Original thought should be put into research every step of the way, from the design of the study to the words in the paper.\n\n> an undergraduate student should stick to paraphrasing in their own words and only sometimes directly quoting pieces of text, while \"original thoughts\" could be left for sections such as the methodology/results/discussion/conclusion, and perhaps a little bit in the introduction\n\nMy field is in the physical sciences, which has a different culture, but we were taught to never quote. It was highly stressed, so I will repeat, do not put quotations of any other work in your paper. It is not appropriate. If you are writing a book, sure, but a technical paper in a journal, no. If you have a quote that is data of your study, sure, that is fine, but not direct quotes of other work. You should always paraphrase the other work without plagiarism. Read the other work, put it away, and type original words/sentences about that in your paper. \n\n> I think that is not the right mentality to have. I think the point is to learn how to write a paper and to put in the effort and show that actual research has been done, rather than copy/pasting portions of text.\n\nYes, exactly. This is the way. The reason is that researchers have so much to read and do, they don't want to waste time reading your second-hand work that adds nothing to the original. It is also the intellectual product of another and they deserve the reputation for their original work. Briefly describe it in your own words and cite it. \n\n> I've seen references written as something like [2-6] \n\nYes, that is acceptable and standard. Just makes sure to follow a consistent formatting guideline appropriate to the targeted journal/audience.",

          "text": "> not quite clear to me what you mean by this\n\nWhat my friend means to ask is that, as you said, the design of the study and the words in the paper are their own, but they were told to largely avoid adding their own personal observations or anecdotal experience. Let's say they want to define something or give an example, they should paraphrase from other authors rather than try do so without a reference because they think what they want to say is good enough.\n\nThey find it difficult to reconcile between the two concepts of \"I'm an undergraduate student and I shouldn't be writing my own inexperienced thoughts as if they were facts\" and \"researchers don't want to read second-hand work that adds nothing to the original\"\n\nIn other words, since most of their paper will end up being paraphrasing, since in translation and in their particular research topic they aren't exactly doing an experiment or gathering new data, it feels more like a literature review rather than an essay, and so in their eyes it seems to be not very useful. The they're finding it hard to figure out when/where or even if they should write their own thoughts rather than just paraphrasing.\n\nI'm not sure if I've elaborated on that satisfactorily but please do let me know if I haven't been clear.",

      "text": "Based on having written a lot for an undergraduate English degree, and two MS degrees in two not-humanities fields, I would generally agree with that for undergraduate work. You're a barnacle, attaching to something larger, and building off of it just a bit. The scale of original thought should be insight based on research, not necessarily a blindingly new idea. \n\nParaphrasing in your own words is important to demonstrate understanding of what the research is about, and appropriate citation essentially says, \"They think I'm right. See?\" \n\nDirectly quoting is a useful tool, but you'd better be damn sure you can justify it starting with the first sentence after instead of using an assertion in paraphrasing. I can scale this a bit based on experience -- it's not unusual in English to plop a whole passage into the text if you are going to be analyzing it in excruciating detail, I've used some direct quotes sparingly with qualitative interview data (Healthcare/business stuff) and essentially zero direct quotes when talking about technical analysis unless presenting something granular enough that it would take longer to explain than show, typically charts or a data subset (IT). \n\nI don't know much about English translation, but I would expect that any direct quotes (and appropriate citations) would need to be followed by writing that sufficiently justifies why that quote is put in front of the reader, rather than being described in paraphrasing.",
