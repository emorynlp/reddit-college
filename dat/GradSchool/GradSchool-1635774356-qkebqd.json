I already have 3 letters of recommendations and I'm looking through my applications and its just so nerve wracking\n\nAny words of wisdom?",

      "text": "Do not be afraid to ask faculty with whom you have relationships for advice and help with the application process. If they don\u2019t have time, the should let you know. \n\nVisit the campuses of any schools you can. Talk to admissions offices. Contact professors whose work interest you. Ask alumni questions on LinkedIn. \nAs a first gen student, people, esp in the sw field should be willing to help you. I\u2019ve found people willing to go out of their way to do something helpful for me, just because I had the guts to ask for help.\n\nYou sound like you are on the right track just by posting here\n\nGood luck. \n\nGlad to review anything or have a convo.
