  "text": "I was reading professor feedback on a short book review assignment that had comments saying \n\n\"Nice opening!\"\n\"Great point!\"\n\"Wonderful conclusion\" \n\"A very good, short essay\" \n\nAnd my brain is so garbled up in imposter syndrome that I thought these comments had to be sarcastic. I asked the professor what he meant in office hours by the comments and he looked stunned because the comments were genuine. \n\nMan, imposter syndrome has really messed with my brain.  \n\nHow do you guys cope with this?",

      "text": "I don't have any good advice about coping, but I can relate. I recently received a huge fellowship and went through the natural progression of thoughts and emotions: shock, joy, disbelief, the creeping suspicion that they'd made a mistake and emailed the wrong person, joy again, then shame at the thought that I'd somehow \"tricked\" other people into believing in me, and finally fear that this is another huge opportunity to let people down. I'm trying hard now to simply feel gratitude and motivation. It's kind of working.",

      "text": "My professor graded a 15 page paper I handed to him and gave it back with a couple of comments. Although it was all mostly praise and some typos and format stuff, my initial thought was that he didn\u2019t read the paper. I don\u2019t know if this can be dealt with. I once read on twitter from some people who have left academia that graduate school is a degrading institution. Only those with great, creative minds enter it just so the institution can beat you down, make you insecure, and ultimately drain your creativity. They make geniuses doubtful. You\u2019re placed with amazing, intelligent people most of your day for years. It\u2019s no wonder most academics have imposter syndrome.",

I heard it and thought, \"Oh my gosh, I could never think of anything like that./I have to compete with that?!\" I finally mustered the courage to look at my graded exam, and the answer was mine.\n\nI try really hard to not take myself too seriously, and that sometimes helps -- still failing, of course, and often falling sideways from, \"It's fine, this is a learning experience everyone goes through...\" into, \"but more of a learning experience for you because no one else here ever made the same mistakes as many times...\" but hopefully?? less often than I would if I weren't trying.",

Did I think the midterm and Comps were reasonably difficult? If so, why not celebrate the fact that I did really well on them? \n\nI did have one experience where a professor pulled me aside over an assignment and told me I could do better, but the relationship we had made me trust that she really did believe I had the ability to do better, and wanted me to use that ability. It wasn't a situation where she was putting me down, or exposing me as a fraud, or any of the things I could have thought about it. \n\nIt was difficult work to retrain my brain on the subject. I'm so used to negative self-talk that it's easy to fall prey to impostor syndrome. But you can to recognize it, stop what you're doing/thinking, and counter it with evidence.",

The only way out of *those* is to just give a metric f\\*ckton of talks.  Eventually you get used to it and the jitters go away. \n\nI didn't really get over impostor syndrome until I was working in a plum postdoc at NASA/GSFC, operating a spacecraft a million miles from Earth every day. Even then I'd do battle with it every once in a while, and it was always on a low simmer in the background of my head somewhere -- until one afternoon I was standing around in the hall with four friends figuring out where to go for lunch and the old grizzled guy said, \"Okay, four out of five NASA scientists prefer sushi, let's go there.\"  In that moment, what was left of it snapped for good, and I've never missed it.",
