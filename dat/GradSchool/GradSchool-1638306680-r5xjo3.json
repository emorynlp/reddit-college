  "text": "I have been wanting to leave my current masters program because I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the program itself is a mess, which baffles me because it\u2019s in a well known/prestigious state school.. anyways I started looking at other GIS programs and I found an environmental GIS program that is a master\u2019s of professional science as opposed to the MS I\u2019m in right now. I\u2019ve also had urban/regional planning in my thoughts for a while. What are your opinions on switching from a GIS masters to an urban/regional planning masters? I\u2019m happy whether I\u2019m working on environmental or social causes. Financially speaking, what field is less risky and has better job prospects? Thank you.",
