  "text": "I\u2019m not sure this is the best place to ask this question, and it\u2019s probably aimed at those of you who are in the life/medical sciences. But are joint labs a thing in different countries? What I mean is that 2 people are the PI of one lab. I\u2019ve seen it a couple of times now (I\u2019m UK-based) with 2 people being the head of one group, and it actually sounds like it\u2019d be nice. Has anyone seen this anywhere else, does anyone know how the logistics of this would work in terms of funding etc.?",

      "text": "In the US, it's not uncommon to see two labs that are very closely intertwined with collaborations and shared resources, but I think they mostly are represented as separate labs to the public and on paper by convention. \n\nI don't know if this is the entire reason, but at least part of the issue is that tenure and promotion focus a lot on individual contributions. This means that it's more advantageous to have the semblance of separate labs and official assignment of ownership of resources, contributions, trainees, etc.",

I've heard of a good handful of labs at the places I've gone to school/ worked at with 2-3 PIs but I've never been in a group like that so I don't know how far it goes beyond joint lab meetings and coordinating projects. This is in bio/ecology/ag fields.",

My PIs are husband/wife and both have their own individual labs on campus technically, but the husband (whose lab I'm technically in) does all the computational work while the wife does all the wet lab work for the same projects. It's a lot of back and forth with us analyzing the biological data and finding genes to target from our computational approaches, then them going and testing those genes as targets. That's just a very basic example though. All of our meetings are together so the wet lab people get exposed to computational methods and vice versa.",
