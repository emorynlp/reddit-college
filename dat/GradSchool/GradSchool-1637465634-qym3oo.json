  "text": "Hello all,\n\nAs my title says, I'm interested in learning how you guys studies for the GRE over a month or so. I'm taking it in a month, it's not super important but one out of the few graduate programs I'm applying for is requesting it. I figured I could take a practice exam, and go from there. But if any of you guys have study plans or resources you'd recommend, I'd love to hear them. \n\nI'm being very non-chalant about this exam because I don't believe it'll weigh very much on my chances of getting into that one program (unless I absolutely crash and burn lol). Plus stressing myself out about it would probably negatively affect my ability to study. \n\nAnyways, thanks for any advice/info!",

      "text": "Tbh I didn\u2019t study at all and made a 300 BUT I didn\u2019t know how much to write the for the writing portion so I only wrote a paragraph for each topic when I\u2019m reality you are only supposed to write like a 3 paragraph essay for each and made a 3 on the writing portion. I wish i would have studied more and maybe I would\u2019ve done better. This is what I recommend:\n\nTake a practice exam for you to know where you are and what you need to work on\n\nReview some vocabulary \n\nBrush up on some math formulas, like the basic ones like volume of shapes and surface area \n\nKnow writing structure, like how to structure essays \n\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Take a few practice tests to benchmark if you're already performing as you would like. I had 2 months to prepare (just weekends), which was pretty easy-going because I was already scoring in my target range. So, there was no content review involved and I was just working on getting more consistent. \n\nA specific resource I recommend is the Manhattan Prep 5lb Book of GRE Practice Problems. As the title indicates, it has loads of practice problems, but specifically I like that their answer guides are genuinely informative. If you're mainly just drilling the exam format and not doing formal content review (which would probably be tough with just a month), this is definitely a very helpful tool.\n\nFinally, definitely leverage your public library for prep books!",

      "text": "I scored a 305 (155 quant and 147 qual, lol) with only 3 days of studying. My brother scored much better in comparison since he studied far longer. Here was his study schedule, which is probably light in comparison to others. Since you have a month, I think you can do this! :)\n\nThe first thing to do is to buy one of those gre prep books at your local book store (I think he used Princeton review). Study about a page or two of vocab a day 30-45 minute session in the morning/afternoon and repeat before bed. After studying vocab (from the first session), move onto the quantitative section next and try the practice problems or review the mathematical concepts to solve the questions for 1-2 hours. At the end of the week, take a practice exam and take down notes where your weaknesses lie in to study that material the following week.\n\nFor the writing section and like most essays/writing prompts, they like it when you cite or reference books or even use quotes. So just be aware of that.\n\nAnyway, my brother scored a 320 (165 qaunt and 155 qual). That was technically considered low but he still got into a top 5 school as a PhD student. So even if you got a 'lower' score, I am sure it won't be the end of the world. Good luck!",
