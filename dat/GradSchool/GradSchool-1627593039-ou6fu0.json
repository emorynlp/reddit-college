  "text": "First yr student with a GA stipend and reduced tuition and I feel like I'm so busy trying to budget my stipend, tuition, rent, savings, and expenses with a semester payment plan and doing my best not to take out loans that I don't even have time be excited about classes.\nI feel like I'm more worried about paying for it than actually doing it.\nThen I find myself trying to hypothetically budget for next summer living expenses and it upsets me.\nI've got my books ordered and I'm looking forward to reading them\n...but jeez I feel like money worries is the thing that gives grad students stress\n\nNote: chose MA history, looking into higher education/advising/and working for a rez school or education nonprofit in my home of South Dakota. Or working community college in Wyoming/Colorado etc",
