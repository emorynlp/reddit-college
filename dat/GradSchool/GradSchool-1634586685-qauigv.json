  "text": "Hi, I just started a PhD program and it's a bit of a nightmare. I feel capable doing research alone, but I'm trying to research, take courses and not screw up my regular adult responsibilities. \n\nI feel like I lack a certain skill set, and I'm not sure how to go about improving my organizational habits. More or less my whole life I haven't had any. \n\nEvery time I mention stuff like this I get \"don't worry grad school is a nightmare for everyone, you'll get used to it\" kind of responses, but my sense is most people in grad school have a significantly better toolkit to deal with this kind of thing than I do. \n\nIs there anyone who had similar issues with organizational skills entering into grad school who feels like they were able to improve upon and overcome that deficiency?",

      "text": "I find that finding good organizational tools and the way you like to use them can make a world of difference. I use Google Calendar to block out time for both work meetings/tasks but also other things like fitness to make sure I have a good balance and get as much as I can done. I also use a todo list manager and a notes app for work related things.\n\nKeeping up a regular schedule, having time for hobbies, planning a todo list, meal prepping, etc. are what makes it all somewhat doable. \n\nBut you don't have to go all in at once. Pick one thing to add to your routine, and start there. For example, make a to do list at the beginning of the day or blocking out an hour a few times a week for fitness.",
