  "text": "I'm nearing the end of my third semester of my master's and my advisor told me to have a draft of my thesis with an \"extensive\" literature review and the progress I made so far. What's \"extensive\"? What should I usually have done by the end of my second to, hopefully, last semester in master's (computer science)? I'm super stressing. I've seen master's thesis' from online have 100 pages and right now I have THREE. Was I supposed to be writing all semester?? Sigh.",

      "text": "It all depends on the person and their situation. My 2nd MA is some ways easier then my first and harder in others. Every thesis is so individual at the graduate level; some take more time than others. I think the fact you are stressing speaks volumes that you are on the right track.",
