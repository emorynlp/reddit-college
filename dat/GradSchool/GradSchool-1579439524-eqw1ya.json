Another professor of mine knew Jason's advisor, and she said the advisor's main problem was that he was too brilliant for his and other's own good. The guy is brilliant (probably one of the top chemists of the past century, and his work will long outlive him), but the problem was that he expected everyone else to be just as brilliant. At the time, there were little to no protections for grad students and their graduation timelines, and that change was definitely needed to at least make sure students leave with a degree, or didn't go insane trying to get one. There was supposedly a culture problem and the average mood definitely wasn't happy.\n\nI've also read a lot on what Jason wrote and what happened in the days leading up to his death. The guy was in his 5th year (basically normal timeline for a Chem PhD) and apparently had dissertation quality material by his third. He had made the two hetero subunits for his final molecule, but encountered great difficulty bringing them together. It honestly sounds like he snapped (he had a near success after several failures), but yeah, people don't know why he called out his advisor. Some think that some things might have happened behind closed doors, but no one is sure. It's a sad situation, but I honestly think only a few people know enough to understand what happened.",

              "text": "PROFESSOR`S KILLER FREE, NOT SORRY\nJohn Crewdson, Chicago Tribune\nCHICAGO TRIBUNE\n \nTheodore Streleski, the unrepentant Stanford graduate student who bludgeoned one of his professors to death eight years ago in what he said was a protest against his treatment by the university, walked out of prison Sunday a free man.\n\nStreleski, 49, twice declined offers of parole, refusing to provide officials with assurances that he would not return to Stanford or kill again. Because he has served the maximum six years and three weeks of his eight- year sentence required by law, however, the conditions of Streleski`s parole are no longer at issue.\n\n''He`s being unconditionally released,'' said Lt. Joe McGrath of the state prison medical facility here, where Streleski was transferred 18 months ago for psychiatric evaluation. ''We can`t hold him any longer.''\n\nStanding in an early-morning rain just outside the prison gates, his dark shoulder-length hair held back from his face by a thin black headband, Streleski remained resolutely noncommittal.\n\n''I have no intention of killing again,'' he said. ''On the other hand, I cannot predict the future.''\n\nStreleski, who holds two degrees in electrical engineering and who said he will seek work in a related field, also maintained that ''it would be ridiculous'' to expect him to stay away from the Stanford area, which lies at the heart of California`s Silicon Valley.\n\nAlthough he noted that he is still a ''life member of the Stanford alumni association,'' Streleski said he would not return to the campus itself without giving some advance warning.\n\n''I do not have remorse,'' he said when asked about the 1978 murder of Karel deLeeuw, the Stanford mathematics professor who became the victim of his grievances against the university.\n\n''I have never felt remorse. I killed the man, and I submitted the issue to a judge and jury.''\n\nStreleski`s release has occasioned renewed concern at Stanford, particularly within the mathematics department, where he struggled for years without success to earn a Ph.D.\n\nAt his 1979 trial, Streleski testified that if he had been unable to find deLeeuw his ''backup candidate'' would have been Prof. David Gilbarg, who is still a member of the Stanford faculty.\n\nA departmental secretary said last week that ''we are making no comment'' about Streleski`s release. But Diana Diamond of the Stanford public affairs office said, ''I know there`s a lot of concern there.''\n\nThe mathematics faculty met last Friday, she said, ''to discuss what they`ll do if Streleski turns up on campus, how to contact the police and that sort of thing.'' If he should make an appearance, she said, ''He will be arrested for trespassing.''\n\nThough Streleski has never maintained his innocence--indeed, he said he welcomed the publicity surrounding his trial as a ''proper forum'' for airing his anger toward Stanford--his lawyer argued that he had suffered from ''diminished capacity'' at the time of the murder.\n\nAfter a psychiatrist testified for the defense that Streleski was a ''paranoid psychotic'' when he crushed deLeeuw`s skull with a two-pound sledgehammer, he was found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder.\n\nHis sentence of eight years was the maximum then allowed by law. Three months later, the California legislature adopted a new sentencing statute, under which Streleski could have been imprisoned for life.\n\nStreleski and deLeeuw had more than a little in common. Streleski was born in the downstate Illinois village of Breese, deLeeuw was born six years earlier in Chicago and both showed early academic promise.\n\nStreleski entered college at 16, taking his undergraduate degree in engineering from the University of Illinois at Champaign, where his mother still lives. DeLeeuw earned his B.S. in mathematics from the University of Chicago.\n\nBut deLeeuw went on to win a Ph.D. at Princeton and a teaching post at Stanford, where he was widely regarded as an innovative mathematician and an imaginative teacher.\n\nStreleski, rejected for graduate study by Harvard and M.I.T., was finally accepted in 1959 by Stanford, where he languished for the next 19 years while trying to complete his doctoral dissertation.\n\n''He did submit a thesis and was asked to flesh it out, and then resubmitted another one,'' Diamond said. ''And then I think he tried to have it published, and he could not get it published. Evidently he did work on it further, but he never did get his degree.''\n\nDuring those two difficult decades, Streleski married, divorced and was forced to take a succession of part-time jobs to pay his expenses and tuition. One of his complaints against Stanford, and deLeeuw, was that the university failed to provide him with a scholarship.\n\nAccording to those who knew him during those fruitless years, Streleski gradually became a different person. His ex-wife testified at his trial that he developed a persecution complex and become physically abusive, as well.\n\nThe frustrations eventually were directed at deLeeuw, by then the assistant chairman of the mathematics department and, by all accounts, everything that Theodore Streleski wished to be and was not.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 1978, two days after his divorce became final, Streleski went to the office where deLeeuw was seated at his desk, grading papers.\n\nDescribing the murder last year for parole board members, Streleski said: ''I struck him once on the top of the head with a hammer, and I think he was out at that time. I hit him two or three more times, for what I called insurance blows.''\n\nHe put a plastic bag over deLeeuw`s head, and a sign on his door announcing: ''No office hours today. Family emergency.'' A few hours later, Streleski turned himself in to the campus police.\n\nThe killing of deLeeuw, he said then, was meant as a ''political statement'' about the university`s treatment of graduate students in general, and himself in particular.\n\n''Stanford appeared only to care if you paid them money,'' Streleski was later quoted as having said. ''They didn`t care if you passed the course or even attended it.\n\n''Stanford took 19 years of my life with impunity, and I decided I would not let that pass.''",

To even get into grad school, you'd have to at least had some level of privilege that slaves you referred to before wouldn't have dreamed of having.

Your degree shouldn't be your fucking identity your rusted lug nut.",

Sure, we all laugh and make memes about grad students essentially being slaves (lots of responsibilities, often no work life balance, either very little stipend or none at all), but we C H O S E to do this. Not to mention the fact that there is career mobility and that we aren't being (I hope) physically and emotionally abused or starved when we didn't perform well enough. No one is cracking a whip on our back, we're not forced to do manual labor under the sun or in the freezing cold 12+ hrs a day. We aren't being tortured or separated from our loved ones. I am flabbergasted that OP even came up with such comparison.",
