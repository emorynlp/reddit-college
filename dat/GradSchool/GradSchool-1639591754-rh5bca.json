  "text": "TLDR: Switching to Masters like I always wanted in the first place despite pressures to stay in phd\n\nSo I applied to graduate school with the hopes of getting a Masters in plant science/ a related field right after graduating from undergrad. The only opportunity I was able to find for a research assistantship was for a fully funded PhD for three years with a professor at a uni in my hometown. I went to undergrad a 6 hour drive away, at a large state school that's great for plant science. I wasn't able to find anything else. I figured why not? The advisor says I can do it, I'll have the support of my folks living at home, getting a stipend, etc.\n\nI only learned about what the actual project was later on: the funder was a private farmer who wanted to do stuff with turmeric and vermicompost tea. Not exactly my interests. But again, who cares?\n\nThen the anxiety came in. I learned more about the lab and the program. How long PhDs can take. How it takes 2 years to get a harvest of turmeric. How I didn't want to spend so much time in grad school, only to overspecialize and limit myself elsewhere. How I didn't want to spend so much time in my birth city, Miami in my youth. I got so scared, so tired. I wanted to do a Masters like I wanted. I don't know what I'm doing and I'm scared. My advisor is hands off, older too. I feel like I can't really talk to him.\n\nThe dam broke and I cried at the end of one of my seminar classes, at the end of my first semester as a Phd student. The professor told my advisor, and he asked for an urgent zoom meeting. He said he would help me find funding for a RAship for a masters and another really helpful student helped me with some proposal stuff for something I can manage. Now I need to get the proposal plan done soon.\n\nThing is, my folks are upset, because the funding isn't guaranteed. They have money set aside for funding, but they're upset about still losing the stipend. They've come around on it a bit, but the doubt and the worry over my mom and even my new therapist telling me to reconsider has me super frazzled. I feel like if I don't make this proposal plan now, I'll miss out sooner on the prof getting the funding. But I feel like I'm making the wrong choice for wanting to do what I want to do. Everyone is telling me to do the phd just like before, but I never wanted one. my mom doesn't get how switching from a phd to a masters is any better than mastering out. im so scared. im turning 23 soon and I don't want to be stuck in academia so long. help",

      "text": "Doing a masters is a great move at this point. Finding out what is truly fulfilling is an important  part of your education right now, so take what you learn about that seriously. \n\nIt sounds like the faculty are on board with your plan and will support your efforts to succeed and to find funding. Work with them. \n\nSetting a different goal helps a lot with family. Telling them that your are actively working towards a fun and improtant career is a lot better than telling them you just are not dong a PhD. \n\nThere is a lot of horticulture in Florida, so opportunity to build a career on your knowledge abounds.",
