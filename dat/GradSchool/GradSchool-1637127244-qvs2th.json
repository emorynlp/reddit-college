  "text": "I'm wanting to apply to one of Trinity College Dublin's Ph.D. programs as a current US citizen and I'm not sure where to start on funding. Most U.S. scholarships seem to be for only a year of studying abroad and teaching assistantship stipends don't seem to be a thing there.\n\nDoes anyone have experience seeking funding for overseas study? I cannot afford to go to grad school without it. If this question has already been posted by someone else, feel free to just link there.",
