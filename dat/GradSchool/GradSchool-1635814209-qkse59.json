  "title:": "Does paying for grad school make you feel inadequate?",
  "text": "Just my story and you can skip past if you\u2019d like: \nI just started my master\u2019s. I was told when applying to not take any offers that didn\u2019t offer funding. But due to the pandemic, a lot of the schools took away funding opportunities and I had to stay in the southeast US (family reasons). I have a TA but it doesn\u2019t cover full tuition since I\u2019m out of state, and it was a last minute offer. Only one program I applied for offered me a TA immediately but the lab and campus were 5 hours apart (satellite campus) and required being at both campuses each day. \nDoes anyone else feel like they aren\u2019t as successful because they have to pay partial tuition for their degree?  And anyone else deal with finding a grad school with funding during the pandemic?",

              "text": "He's right but the ego has an inherent need to compare as it thinks linearly and hierarchically, putting achievement and ability above practically everything. So, it won't be that easy to stop. Thankfully most of our negative emotions don't belong to the ego, as such you can train your superego not to care about the comparisons. So, you really need to assess or logic out why you feel the way you do and verify if there is a legitimacy to this inadequacy. Essentially, are you working as hard as you can, taking full advantage of the mental capacities you were gifted along with life. Otherwise, your inadequacy is related to you believing that you could do better with the talent you were naturally born with. Do you feel like you could have gotten a full scholarship if you worked harder?",

I fully believe I am receiving a fantastic education, and I am in an environment that is good for my mental health and well-being. I read so many grad school horror stories on this sub of people literally depressed because they are in such toxic environments. I don\u2019t care that I\u2019m paying, I care that I\u2019m not in a toxic environment for the next 6 years and I am surrounded by professionals who want to see me succeed. I only heard negativity about being unfunded by ONE person, and guess what\u2026 he never could get into a PhD program for my field (after applying for 3 years), so that tells me all I need to know about his opinion. If you\u2019re happy, that is all that matters.",

I feel like I didn't look hard enough for grad opportunities outside my comfort zone but was lucky enough to find a professor with funding for three years of a PhD back home. The project is within my field and interest but not what I expected, but in this economy? During this pandemic? I see taking any paid opportunities within your field to be the best case scenario. Passion is important, I'm not saying you should ignore it, but having financial support will be critical to your well-being down the line. The world is constantly in flux from a variety of reasons, so take any change you can get. An old college advisor told me \"Bloom where you're planted\" when I bemoaned how rough it was to transition to a new school. It sounds like a shitty axiom, but sometimes, that's the best you can do in a strange situation. I hope this gives you a bit of solace.",
