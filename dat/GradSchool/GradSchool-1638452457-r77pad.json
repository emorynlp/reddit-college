  "title:": "UPenn completely scammed everyone in math last year",
  "text": "I saw some incredibly unethical behavior last year from the admissions committee during the whole COVID crisis.\n\n\nUntil late Autumn, their website said they weren't accepting new graduate students period in arts and sciences. No big deal, lots of schools were doing the same. By Decemberish, they decided they were in fact taking applications for their math grad school, so I threw mine in and paid the $100 or whatever it is. Come Spring, the following pops up on gradcafe.\n\n\n\"UPenn (2/16 unofficial offer, they said they only admit student interested in joining their mirror symmetry group because of funding issue.)\"\n\n[when asked for clarification]\n\"To answer the question on Penn below: It's their hodge theory and mirror symmetry group. They said students will be funded by outer grants of their group and not by Penn.\"\n\n\"email from prof. I previously talked to \"Formally Penn is not admitting\nnew graduate students this year. However, ------ and I have a Simons\nFoundation grant that is able to support two incoming graduate students.\nWe were very impressed with your file, so we hope you\u2019ll want to come\nto Penn and work with either or both of us.\" very strange year!\"\n\n\nI was pretty ticked off I wasted $100 since my area is nowhere close to mirror symmetry and that I wasted time and effort on this application as well. Dunno if they have more funding this year, but COVID is still around so I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happens again. Either way, assuming they got a few hundred applicants, they scammed tens of thousands of dollars in application fees only to throw most of them in the trash.\n\nedit: Some context for those who aren't familiar with how math programs work. In America, at least, you don't apply to work with specific faculty, you apply to departments. Generally, they take X people in field A, Y in field B, etc. and so on. If a professor isn't taking students, it's no big deal because there's always several other faculty in a related field. If they said only faculty in this research area are taking students, it'd be fine. But hundreds of people applied to work in completely unrelated fields and threw away their application fee.",

It would be dishonest to not disclaim this from the very beginning. Likewise they mention minimum criteria to even be considered.\n\nI'm pretty sure UPenn publishes their minimum criteria, so it is dishonest and scammy to hide some portions of the minimum criteria.",

The second thing is simply dishonest and it's honestly unheard of.\n\nFor example, if a university does not have faculty working on logic, and I mention that I want to do research in logic, it is reasonable for them to not accept me. All departments have a website showing the type of work their faculty works on, so applicants have an idea of what type of research could be compatible (IF AT ALL).\n\nBut if a university has faculty on several areas but only one specific subject of one specific area has a chance to receive one or two applicants, this fact should be disclaimed to the pool of applicants. Because applicants will operate under the reasonable assumption that there's a whole set of areas where research is currently funded.\n\nAll in all, this is as if a Math department said on their website they have 100 active areas of research but only 1 of them has actual funding for students. That's simply a scam for the pool of applicants.",

Now, I don't work at Penn, but I work at a large university and I *think* I can shed light on what happened:\n\nDue to COVID, admissions were thrown into chaos. Graduate Studies units were opening application portals, departments were anticipating students, but Deans at a myriad of schools kiboshed them. Why? Two issues:\n\n1. Student delivery\n2. Faculty unions\n3. Funding covenants\n4. Equity\n\nMost graduate programs have their programs designed for in-person delivery. They were unable to rapidly transition over to new delivery modalities quickly and many programs (Social Sciences, Humanities, STEM) were hit. Because of required in-person components, funding and a myriad of other issues, it was impractical to have open admission\n\nSecond was a union issue. Most faculty unions *allow* faculty to opt-in to remote teaching given exigent circumstances, but faculty unions were raising a stink about it becoming *compelled* to teach remote and several university presidents were sent warning letters by unions. It was a hellacious year and, while I have no general beef with faculty unions, many become toxic during COVID, pushed universities into corners (thus the early forced return to campus!) and left few management decisions available to Deans and Presidents.\n\nThird, many funding packages for faculty were written *prior* to COVID, so many stipulate the types of research that can happen, how and when. For a myriad of programs, they couldn't do the types of research they normally do until their teams worked to re-write contracts and update donor agreements. Which brings me to my final point.\n\nAs a result, Chairs, Program Directors and Deans began to squabble. B-Schools were largely unaffected, but many were so for the sake of \"equity\" Deans pulled the plug on almost *everyone*. You have programs with normal graduate intakes of 10-15 only admitting 1 student because they could pair them off with faculty who had preexisting funding that was eligible to be used during COVID. You had programs that closed enrollment *entirely*.\n\nBut, all of that said, what also was happening was that graduate studies, Deans, VPs and Chairs weren't communicating. Grad studies thought it was business as usual and had portals open. Chairs thought they were exempt or were focused on faculty issues and weren't paying attention. Deans and VPs had made other arrangements but failed to communicate them out to the broader community.\n\nCOVID exposed how quickly universities were able to fumble something as important as admissions & enrollment. It was a clusterfuck and least of which was the fact that no one knew what anyone else was doing/thinking.",
