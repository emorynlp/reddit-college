  "title:": "UPenn completely scammed everyone in math last year",
  "text": "I saw some incredibly unethical behavior last year from the admissions committee during the whole COVID crisis.\n\n\nUntil late Autumn, their website said they weren't accepting new graduate students period in arts and sciences. No big deal, lots of schools were doing the same. By Decemberish, they decided they were in fact taking applications for their math grad school, so I threw mine in and paid the $100 or whatever it is. Come Spring, the following pops up on gradcafe.\n\n\n\"UPenn (2/16 unofficial offer, they said they only admit student interested in joining their mirror symmetry group because of funding issue.)\"\n\n[when asked for clarification]\n\"To answer the question on Penn below: It's their hodge theory and mirror symmetry group. They said students will be funded by outer grants of their group and not by Penn.\"\n\n\"email from prof. I previously talked to \"Formally Penn is not admitting\nnew graduate students this year. However, ------ and I have a Simons\nFoundation grant that is able to support two incoming graduate students.\nWe were very impressed with your file, so we hope you\u2019ll want to come\nto Penn and work with either or both of us.\" very strange year!\"\n\n\nI was pretty ticked off I wasted $100 since my area is nowhere close to mirror symmetry and that I wasted time and effort on this application as well. Dunno if they have more funding this year, but COVID is still around so I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happens again. Either way, assuming they got a few hundred applicants, they scammed tens of thousands of dollars in application fees only to throw most of them in the trash.\n\nedit: Some context for those who aren't familiar with how math programs work. In America, at least, you don't apply to work with specific faculty, you apply to departments. Generally, they take X people in field A, Y in field B, etc. and so on. If a professor isn't taking students, it's no big deal because there's always several other faculty in a related field. If they said only faculty in this research area are taking students, it'd be fine. But hundreds of people applied to work in completely unrelated fields and threw away their application fee.",

Are these professors in the program, academic advisors for undergrads, or hustlers for testing and application-prep companies? \n\nAs an advisor, I suggest applying only to those programs that are a really good fit. You can't even research 12 programs deeply enough to do that. \n\nAs an admissions reviewer, I don't want to waste time with poorly targeted applications. I also feel for the applicant who wasted their time, money and letter-writer's effort by essentially buying a lottery ticket to something that isn't a lottery. I discourage applications from people who contact the grad program, but don't really find faculty who are a good match, and taking new students.",

It would be dishonest to not disclaim this from the very beginning. Likewise they mention minimum criteria to even be considered.\n\nI'm pretty sure UPenn publishes their minimum criteria, so it is dishonest and scammy to hide some portions of the minimum criteria.",

I hear there's going to be a class action lawsuit over the McDonalds ice cream machine any day now.\n\n> If they advertised an admission processer that was misleading out outright false \"customers\" have every right to complain.\n\nI see no evidence that they misled anyone. They said they were taking math grad students, and according to OP, they did. Obviously, most programs are not taking students in every single sub area ever semester, that's why you're supposed to do some research, make some phone calls, etc. \n\nI'm not sure why OP paid $100 and submitted an application *before* checking if there was an opening relevant to them. There were several schools that I spoke with and said, \"Thanks for taking the time to talk to me, I don't think your program is quite what I'm looking for.\"\n\nIf they'd called, they probably would've gotten their fee waived too, most departments I called/emailed with offered that part way through the conversation.\n\n> I strongly believe the math community can demand accountability what can lead to change. This applies to communities in general.\n\nWho? What community? UPenn has an acceptance rate below 10%, so grad students applying there don't have much leverage. I guess you could try to talk the faculty into kicking up a fuss about it, but that seems rather unlikely. Someone losing $100 because they couldn't be bothered to make sure they knew what they were applying for isn't even in the top million injustices in the world today.\n\n>Lastly, I am profoundly sorry you have grown used to being mistreated and feel helpless about it.\n\nI'm not even sure how OP was mistreated here.

This entire issue could've been solved with a basic interest phone call.\n\n>Departments offer waivers to students who don't have the financial means to afford it. If you did have the means but you took the waivers, you are just corrupt.\n\nThe vast majority of the schools I applied to were happy to offer a fee waiver based on the fact that I called and talked to them for ten minutes, or exchanged a handful of emails. It wasn't, \"you can use this if you need it,\" it was just, \"here, put this code in when you apply, look forward to seeing your work.\"\n\nI can't speak for UPenn, since it's not a school I applied to, but it was by no means uncommon or conditional in my case. I appreciate the baseless insult though.\n\n>The mathematical community. Professors, PhD students, College students. People in the field that raise objections to unconscionable decisions.\n\nWhat unconscionable decision? Taking application fees? UPenn didn't scam OP, or even mislead them. OP threw in an application half cocked, and got burned for it. \n\n>Since you are arguing in bad faith and purposefully being dense, I will simply stop engaging with this conversation.\n\nI love when people put this like three times in the same reply. It really proves how done they are.",

People often save up over several pay periods to pay for fees. \n\nSo yes, people should apply for application fee waivers if they are poor, but the university should make it extremely obvious that fee waivers exist, and extremely easy to apply for and receive them. Alternatively, universities should refund all application fees to students who are not admitted. If they're not admitted, a university has no justification for keeping the fee.",

A lot of students get into top math phd programs without being committed to any area at all. It's very normal to not decide on an advisor until a couple years in.",

Now, I don't work at Penn, but I work at a large university and I *think* I can shed light on what happened:\n\nDue to COVID, admissions were thrown into chaos. Graduate Studies units were opening application portals, departments were anticipating students, but Deans at a myriad of schools kiboshed them. Why? Two issues:\n\n1. Student delivery\n2. Faculty unions\n3. Funding covenants\n4. Equity\n\nMost graduate programs have their programs designed for in-person delivery. They were unable to rapidly transition over to new delivery modalities quickly and many programs (Social Sciences, Humanities, STEM) were hit. Because of required in-person components, funding and a myriad of other issues, it was impractical to have open admission\n\nSecond was a union issue. Most faculty unions *allow* faculty to opt-in to remote teaching given exigent circumstances, but faculty unions were raising a stink about it becoming *compelled* to teach remote and several university presidents were sent warning letters by unions. It was a hellacious year and, while I have no general beef with faculty unions, many become toxic during COVID, pushed universities into corners (thus the early forced return to campus!) and left few management decisions available to Deans and Presidents.\n\nThird, many funding packages for faculty were written *prior* to COVID, so many stipulate the types of research that can happen, how and when. For a myriad of programs, they couldn't do the types of research they normally do until their teams worked to re-write contracts and update donor agreements. Which brings me to my final point.\n\nAs a result, Chairs, Program Directors and Deans began to squabble. B-Schools were largely unaffected, but many were so for the sake of \"equity\" Deans pulled the plug on almost *everyone*. You have programs with normal graduate intakes of 10-15 only admitting 1 student because they could pair them off with faculty who had preexisting funding that was eligible to be used during COVID. You had programs that closed enrollment *entirely*.\n\nBut, all of that said, what also was happening was that graduate studies, Deans, VPs and Chairs weren't communicating. Grad studies thought it was business as usual and had portals open. Chairs thought they were exempt or were focused on faculty issues and weren't paying attention. Deans and VPs had made other arrangements but failed to communicate them out to the broader community.\n\nCOVID exposed how quickly universities were able to fumble something as important as admissions & enrollment. It was a clusterfuck and least of which was the fact that no one knew what anyone else was doing/thinking.",

I was most definitely not one of the two accepted. However, in my current program with 15-20 in my cohort, literally only I and two other people had a vague idea of who they wanted to work with. This is the expectation of my program:  you don't have to select or start working with an advisor until your 4th semester. Funding is TAship, guaranteed only 9 months for 5 years, and is by the department, not faculty. Summer or 6th+ year funding is by faculty or luck in getting a TAship in summer. Other programs I applied to were structured similarly, but not necessarily all. \n\n**In general, norms don't translate between fields of study.** Maybe some can overlap, but you cannot extrapolate from a specific chemistry department's norms to an arbitrary math department's norms.",
