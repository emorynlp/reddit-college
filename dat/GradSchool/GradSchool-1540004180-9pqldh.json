I learned at the Master\u2019s level to refuse to listen to bullshit (from faculty or students). I would put them on ignore, not engage, and let them ramble on (when I could not otherwise avoid them).   I compartmentalized my work, and was a real deadline hawk - putting that above everything else.\n\nI never really had problems other than two.  Biggest was motivation (I had a life, some horses to worry about, etc. that I refused to relinquish) and one time I got in over my head with some experimental math stuff.  At least I knew I was over my head.  I ventured to a nearby university (I was lucky as there were several R-1 AAU institutions nearby to find someone I could hire to help me.   I did not want anyone from my institution as I wanted zero gossip.   It all worked out fine.  That was almost 40 years ago.  I sure don\u2019t miss much of it.",

One thing I had to learn how to do as a new grad student was to break down my to do list into smaller pieces so I could actually see what I'd been busy on all day. \"Do x experiment\" didn't help because x experiment took four days.
