  "title:": "When did you know you should change advisors?",
  "text": "I'm hitting a wall with my PI where it feels like we're headed toward an irreparable divide in our mentee/mentor relationship. This is my first semester in grad school (I was in their lab as an undergrad) and I've never felt more under-supported in my academic/research career. I feel like they don't listen to my concerns or thoughts about anything and sometimes seem to actively work at undermining my progress. In the academics side, I specifically told my advisor I was not comfortable taking a graduate course that was outside of my field of study (and overall discipline) as I didn't have enough of a foundation to do so. They didn't care and forced me to take the course, which has turned out disastrous. With my more administrative work for my PhD, I've been trying to form a committee and every time I suggest someone, they say no. They've even gone as far as to tell me I shouldn't be speaking with other professors and asking for advise on anything without directly consulting them (my advisor) first. In my research, they constantly try to derail and completely change the direction of my work without consideration of my goals, concerns, or outcomes. Multiple times I've expressed being uncomfortable with how data is being represented (as it may not yield an accurate claim), but they've completely disregarded this. Even lately, they actively tried to find (or create) holes in a presentation I was giving to a potential co-advisor. \n\nI'm starting to feel like my advisor doesn't support me financially (as I'm on a fellowship), academically, emotionally, professionally, or intellectually. I'm considering leaving the lab but I don't know what that might mean for my future. There isn't anyone else working in my field within the department (or even university). The co-advisor seems to be interested in my work but I worry if they'll be willing to take me on entirely. I'm scared of asking them directly as I don't want to put that co-advisor in an uncomfortable situation where they'd know I'm preparing to leave and haven't told my primary advisor.",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation as you, where I considered switching advisors because I experienced something similar. I spoke with my department coordinator, who talked me out of switching advisors. I regretted that everyday after passing my oral qualifying exam. \n\nMy biggest takeaway from my PhD is that if my gut instinct tells me that someone doesn't have my best interests, then I should trust my gut. I tried many times to smooth things over with my PhD advisor directly and those attempts failed.\n\nPositive: I am almost finished with my PhD dissertation revisions and I am graduating soon. I survived.\n\nNegative: The emotional turmoil from staying with my PhD advisor resulted in permanent physical nerve damage. I went to a pain doctor and they told me that the stress I experienced is what led to permanent nerve damage. I also had to see other doctors to get prescription sleep aid because I had developed insomnia from the built up stress. Stress can really harm you and manifest physically in destructive ways. Some damage is irreversible, like in my case.\n\nTLDR: If your gut tells you that something is wrong with your relationship with your advisor, you are probably right. I wish I trust myself in the past but I didn't. I paid for it with my physical health and some of the damage is irreversible. I do not want to scare you, but that is my reality.\n\nEdit: I did go see counseling and although that was helpful, it was a stopgap measure. Prevent future frustration and stress if you can.",

      "text": "Over and over again, research and experience shows that the #1 factor in graduate school satisfaction is a supportive advisor. \n\n\"Supportive\" depends on your needs, not just the advisor's behavior. That means if you don't feel supported, then that is your reality, and no argument can change your reality.\n\nWith a fellowship, your options for advisors are wider than most. It could depend on your willingness to change topics. Some graduate students transfer schools as well.\n\nI wish you the best as you navigate this!",

Although I am a bit behind my plans since no publications came from my previous work, I am able to work pretty efficiently now.\n\nIf you're seriously thinking of switching, do it sooner rather than later.",
