  "text": "20 years ago today I was a homeless, teen mom, high school drop-out, living in a cheap motel. I had 2 babies, no car, and I walked 6 miles every day to work in a plastics extrusion factory. One kid strapped to my chest, one to my back, and their lunch bags in each hand. I lived on a steady diet of little debbie 25 cent brownies and leftover infant formula. \n\nIt's taken 20 years of fighting through the challenges of poverty, being a working mom, sexism in STEM, deficiencies in my education, crippling anxiety, and my own trauma. And I mean FIGHTING. \n\nBut this week I finished my Master's Degree in Software Engineering!!",
