  "text": "I ended up bringing in 18 credits when I started as a undergraduate at a local university. I earned these credits through a local community college while I was in high school, and I desperately want to cover up that disaster. Will anyone actually expect me to submit that transcript in addition to my university transcript? My university transcript indicates that I brought in credits. I never \"attended\" the community college though.",
