  "title:": "How do you all use your less productive work hours?",
  "text": "Like a lot of people, I have a certain time of the day where I'm most productive. For me it's around 9am-12/1pm, then I often have a boost around 4pm-5pm. After lunch it's honestly a bit difficult to get much done. I'm less focused and am really not sure what is the best way to utilise this time most effectively.\n\nWhat does everyone else do during your less productive hours? Do you just try to push through any work with less focus and hope you get some done? Do you prioritise less mentally taxing work? Do you take a break / more breaks?",

This can shift from day to day. Sometimes I DO get in the zone for a task and just work throughout the day. Sometimes I have meetings and classes from 10am until 7pm and it is what it is and I bonk out afterwards. Breaks consist of errands, exercise, mindless tasks, reading, self-care, etc.)\n\nI won't always be able to arrange my days like this, but I get a lot more done than trying to push through 9am-5pm (which I have had to do for internships and certain jobs before). I'm also a night owl and live alone, though.",
