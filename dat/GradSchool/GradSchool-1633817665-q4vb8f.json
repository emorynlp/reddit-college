Any advise on boosting your gpa or anything that would be sufficient for the application? Any help is appreciated!",

As clich\u00e9 as that may sound, it\u2019s damnnn real. \ud83e\udd72\n\n\n\nTo answer your question, you can take more classes before you graduate and make sure that you get all \u201cAs\u201d so you see a significant increase in your cumulative GPA. \n\nIf you have relevant experience in the grad program that you\u2019re aiming for and you have mentors/advisors that are willing to write you strong LORs, then having that low GPA may not weigh heavily on your overall application so you should consider applying. Plus, you could talk about why you did not perform well on your personal statement along with highlighting how you\u2019re a strong candidate for the program. \n\nAlso if your transcript shows an upward improvement throughout your college years, then that could help you out. (For example: 1st semester 2.10, 2nd semester 2.78\u2026., 6th semester 3.0, last semester 3.12). Sure, your cumulative GPA may not be above a 3.0 (as most grad programs require), but assuming you have those strong LORs, relevant experience, and display that you\u2019re constantly improving your GPA, then that should boost your chances of getting admitted.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to get rejections\u2026that means you tried. Plus you only need ONE school to take you in right?!? So either you stay an extra year and improve that GPA and wait to apply or you take your chances now and apply with what you have. It\u2019s up to you! \n\nBest of luck!",

I know you are likely busy, but showing your passion requires that you give up a good portion of your free time in the short term. What I mean is you absolutely have enough time to write an undergrad thesis. I just started writing mine about 2 months ago and I graduate in 5 months. Granted I have been pursuing/learning and interested the subject of my thesis long before that, but didn't get into the actual writing til 2 months ago. I have written about 40 pages in that time and likely will need another 2-3 months before I am happy enough to put it in my application. Granted, I am cutting it very close to the edge, but I will succeed, no matter how much crunching it takes. Even if I fail, the worst case scenario is I delay to the next semester start date which isn't that big of a deal. But depending on your field your \"project\" may serve you just as well, maybe ask your advisor.",
