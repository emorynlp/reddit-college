  "title:": "Just submitted by PhD applications. Should I email the professors at my top choice school (who I spoke to in August) just so I am on still their radar?",
  "text": "I chatted with 2 professors from my top choice school in late August, who both seemed encouraging and told me I had strong credentials. However, it has been 3 months and I just submitted my application. Could they have forgotten about me given all the other candidates they talked to recently? Would it be too pestering to send them a \"look forward to hearing from you\" email now? (BTW they are not directly in the admissions committee and the school does not ask professors to sponsor your application. But, they do get to pick the candidates they want in their department).\n\nWhat is a good reason to contact them at this point?\n\nAlso found out recently that one of the professors is friends/long time colleagues with the executive from my prior company. I recently also spoke to said executive, who suggested I can subtly mention her (i.e. name drop without seeming like it) . Is that too much? Just really passionate about this program but don't want to lose my dignity over it.",

      "text": "I would go ahead and send a follow-up email to both. Just thank them again for meeting with you, say you submitted your application, and that you're looking forward to speaking with them in the future. For the one professor that you have a connection with through your prior company, I would only \"name drop\" if that executive knows who you are. And if you do choose to \"name drop\" just be short about it \"funnily enough I just recently found out that you and I both know \\[executive\\], that was a nice surprise.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but don't want to lose my dignity over it.\n\nSorry, this part made me laugh, you can't have dignity in grad school. If you have it, you lose it pretty quickly. \ud83d\ude02",

Will email them both but probably won't name drop as I don't know the executive well - we just had a conversation about the school as she is alumni. Just so discouraging seeing the rejection posts from perfectly qualified candidates...",
