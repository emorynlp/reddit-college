  "title:": "Graduate Research - Note taking app: Notability v/s GoodNotes",
  "text": "Hello, I recently got an iPad and I am thinking of purchasing one of the apps: Notability or GoodNotes. I wanted suggestions from people who have extensively used one or both of their apps for their research. The two most important features I want out of the app are: reading papers(annotations) and lots (and lots) of notes.  \n\n\nFor context, my research would require a lot of reading papers (duh!) and from what I have heard and read online Notability is better out of the two for reading papers and annotations.\n\nMy research will be theory based and so will also require lots of note taking and calculations, so I want an app that has good organization for keeping those notes. Again from what I read online, GoodNotes is better in the sense it has nested folders while Notability only has 3 layers. \n\nBoth of the features are equally important to me, so in your opinion is the note organizational drawback of Notability worse compared to the annotation (in papers) drawback of GoodNotes? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Other features like audio recording of Notability etc. aren't that important to me. Thank you!",

      "text": "Def notability! I have it and my friend has goodnotes and the quality difference is significant. Her app lags a shxt ton and notability runs very smoothly on mine. I don\u2019t know about the other features of goodnotes but notability is very good importing and exporting files, so your unannotated and annotated papers. The organization of notes is definitely lacking but I\u2019d say the functionality more than makes up for it for me. In order to make up for the organization part a bit, I annotate on my iPad and then export to my laptop for more organized backup storage.",

      "text": "My friend had both going into grad school and found Notability faster and easier to use in most cases. \n\nNotability exports to other software/services smoothly, so personally the less sophisticated file structure is fine because I'm not relying on it for reference. I file everything more clearly on my Google Drive once I'm done annotating it. If I specifically want to go back and mark up a paper more, I can search for it within Notability since I still know the file name from where it is on my Google Drive.",

      "text": "One thing I don\u2019t often see mentioned in this debate is the eraser size in GoodNotes \u2014 there are only three options and no slider. Not a big thing but I find it quite annoying. I\u2019ve used both extensively and eventually settled on Notability. \n\nThe main detriment to using Notability in my opinion is it\u2019s archaic file system. Under the hood, it seems like all files live in the same directory, so once you name a note you can never use that name again unless you delete the original note. If you, like me, would like a note named \u201cScratch Notes\u201d for each subject, you can do that. It\u2019s a small annoyance however, and it likely makes searching for specific notes easier. I still highly recommend Notability.",
