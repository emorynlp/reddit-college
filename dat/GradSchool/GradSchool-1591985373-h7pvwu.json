  "title:": "Thesis and Star Wars",
  "text": "I had zero motivation to even start writing my Masters thesis, let alone finish it, at the beginning of May. \n\nUntil I got Disney+ and started watching The Clone Wars. I definitely had motivation to finish watching THAT, so I used my engineering brain, and solved the problem. \n\nI conditioned my brain to watch an episode only after I finish one sub heading (there are 7 seasons with 20+ episodes each).\nIt was hard in the beginning especially since there were so many cliffhangers. But this started working in my favor. I would write so many sub headings together so that I could watch many episodes at a time.\n\nOfcourse I caved and finished all of last season in a day but it has worked well for 3 out of 6 chapters. \n\nAnd now I'm watching Star Wars Rebels. \n\nDave Filoni and George Lucas (directors of the shows and all of Star Wars) are definitely getting acknowledged. They're literally the reason I'm going to graduate. Maybe I should invite them to my Zoom defense.",
