  "text": "I thought I\u2019d love it, and I do, but it\u2019s overwhelming! \n\nI have to get up a lot earlier, get ready, commute, find parking, walk to class/work on opposite ends of campus, meal prep to bring both lunch and dinner on campus, commute back home, then do assignments. Not to mention all the socializing which seem to only include alcohol (not my preference) or spending money. \n\nNot looking for advice, just need to vent and maybe get some affirmation. I \u201cgraduated\u201d from therapy in May but just one week of being back on campus is prompting me to go back. ):",

      "text": "Honestly, I can totally relate. I am not enjoying being back in person. My WFH setup is fantastic and I thrived working in an environment with no distractions. But I also recognize that I am privileged to live alone, and that many others did not do well with WFH. \n\nI'm currently hybrid (in person 3 days a week). Not sure if that will be a long term solution, but it works for now. \n\nWishing you all the best! It will surely get easier, I hope.",

      "text": "For those socialization events enjoy being the only sober one. I rarely drink alcohol when out at bars (I don\u2019t enjoy not being in control if drunk, need to drive back home, and it\u2019s too expensive) and watching drunk people act like idiots is an entertaining comedy show. Plus you get black mail material for later on ;).",
