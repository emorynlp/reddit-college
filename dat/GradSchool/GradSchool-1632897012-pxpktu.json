  "text": "I am currently at the end of my 6 month internship (will end this month) at an early stage startup working as a frontend developer. Also, I will be graduating in 2022. I, then plan to work for a year or so and then go to grad school for masters, preferably in computer science.\n\nI had a discussion with the CEO(who is also the senior developer) of the company I am interning with and I am not sure if I will get a return offer as he said that it would depend on the funding that the company gets.\n\nSo, assuming that I don't have a return offer from the company, should I ask for a LoR from the CEO right now?",

This being said, you should make it exceedingly clear that you fully intend to return to work for them (funding permitting). I\u2019d advice having a talk with the CEO in person about this. I\u2019m sure he/she would be more than understanding and willing to support you.",
