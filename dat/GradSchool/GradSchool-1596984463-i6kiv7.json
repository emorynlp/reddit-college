  "text": "Update!!!!! I passed! The closed door exam was brutal, but I made it through!\n\nI handed in my thesis three weeks ago and I'm defending tomorrow at 9am. I have two young children at home right now, so I haven't been able to study at all. I still need to change a few slides and I need to read through my thesis before I go to sleep tonight. I'm worried that I won't pass, and everyone around me telling me that I shouldn't be worried is not helping. I have a tough committee of 6 experts in my field and I really wanted to read their latest papers before my defense. Is there anything I can do at this point? I have to watch my kids all day, they don't go to bed until 9/10. I can pull an all nighter, but then I may be a zombie tomorrow. Any last minute advice? Am I freaking out for no reason?",

      "text": "Heres my advice: EVERY committee is a group of experts in the field so while you probably see your committee as the pantheon of ___ subject, they are just a bunch of people who studied the same thing you are about to be deemed an expert in. Not to mention NO committee WANTS to see you fail. Committees may want to challenge you, but they dont want to see you fail. So even if you go into it without every word memorized and every method down, they aren\u2019t going to pick on you, they want to support you and give you space to show that you can present all of what you know and have done. \n\nThese people may be testing you, but they are on your side.",

It is scary but you are ready. Writing your thesis was your studying. Just because they are experts in their field doesn\u2019t mean much and honestly reading their recent papers won\u2019t help much because it is your work that is being examined here. And YOU know your stuff better than anyone in that room because it is your project/s, your slice of the intellectual world. You wouldn\u2019t be allowed to present and defend by your mentor/committee if you weren\u2019t ready so the chance of you not passing is very likely insignificant unless you don\u2019t show up at all or talk about the wrong content or say something totally egregiously inappropriate. Maybe they see something that could have been done differently because they are experts and have been doing this forever but that doesn\u2019t make you unqualified to be an expert too. You got this.

A friend told me yesterday \"oh, so after you present you're like a doctor now, and talking with your committee is a rite-of-passage of your first discussion with your new peers?\"\nI really liked that. Your scary overseers are now your peers :) and it's just a professional discussion. \n\nYou got this!\n\n\nEdit: Do not pull an all-nighter",

Though it is also crunch time so forgive yourself if you're too frazzled to think straight haha \n\n(We're also in a pandemic, cut yourself some slack, and breathe!)\n\nAlso maybe you could pick the 2 most relevant/2 most recent expert papers if you reeeeally want to read them. Reading six would be a lot of work right now and I think taking some time to take a nice break before bed to unwind and relax, shower, pep talk it out, etc before you wake up to absolutely crush it would also help! Or wake up in the morning and pamper yourself, but the most important thing is:\n\nYou ARE gonna crush it!",

What makes you happy/relaxed. Watch a funny movie with kids? Whatever. Eat well and/or light. Drink water. Get sufficiently caffeinated in the morning. Finish the last few things about your slides. Do a \"superman/woman pose\" for 20 minutes before the talk. \n\nKeep reminding yourself....this many hours from now, I will be a PhD. This many hours from now I will be a PhD. This many hours from now I will be a PhD. For me, the more that voice ringed in my head, the better headspace I got in, the more confidence (the good kind) I had in my talk. You got this, and I'm sure your committee thinks so too (only jerks would let you go ahead with your talk if you weren't ready). You're good. Just let the process wash over you.\n\nEdit: oh yea, also, the fact that you are worrying and posting about it on reddit, sort of signals to me that 'you got this' too. Even the best, literally the best students, do exactly this when their time comes. I think oftentimes the students that fail the process don't see it coming, like a deer confused by headlights so to speak.",

But for some practical advice: if your kids are old enough, I might pop in a movie and give yourself that hour and a half to read their papers or yours to refresh yourself and ease your mind. Alternatively, you can copy/paste an article into the English side of Google translate and press the speaker button and it can read you an article while you do something else like cook. Just some suggestions. You\u2019ve got this!!",
