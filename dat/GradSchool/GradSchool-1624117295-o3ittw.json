If you are interested in medicine then working with a math professor wouldn't make much sense.\n\n2) Get involved when you can as much as you can. Approach professors. Express interest in their work. Show that you are willing to help and be an asset to their lab. It's never too early to start that.\n\n3) Work hard now, as it helps later. Building up a good work ethic now will not only show a potential advisor how dedicated you are, but it will prepare you mentally and academically to succeed in research. This is not to say you can't still party hard, but don't slouch on your work now. Professors are more keen to work with you if your academic record proves you're a reliable, well developed student.",

The only major difference is in the size of the dose - Moderna's is significantly larger, and that's likely the cause of its higher incidence and severity of side-effects (all non-life-threatening, just unpleasant for a day or so). So, given the choice, I'd recommend Pfizer - just as effective but it won't hit as hard.",
