In fact, at my school all 3 of these fields are one department.\n\nIndustrial engineering is pretty much a degree in optimization and statistics for \"systems\"\n\nOperations research is pretty much a degree in optimization and statistics for \"decision making\"\n\nStatistics is pretty much a degree in statistics but you'll definitely be taking optimization.\n\nPick according to how much you enjoy writing proofs in the above order. I think.",
