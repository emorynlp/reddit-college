  "title:": "When applying to grad school, is it common for people to directly contact a program director instead of applying first through a school?",
  "text": "Basically what the title says. I finished my BS in Wildlife & Conservation Biology back in 2017 and was burnt out, broke, and desperately wanted to start working, so I didn't have much interest in grad school at the time. After getting myself a bit more stabilized and solidifying myself in the professional world, I've started looking more seriously into programs for an MS in Ecology or Wildlife Biology. I never learned much about the process and always assumed it was similar to undergrad where you find a school you like, apply, and if you get accepted you can explore your options a little more deeply. I recently spoke to a coworker who was explaining his grad student experience to me and said after he finished his BS he just start emailing professors from programs he was interested in and supplied his transcripts/resume, almost like cold-calling colleges. Through this method he said he found a program he was interested in, a director he liked, and upon acceptance by the professor he said they were able to negotiate a financial package to cover his tuition and give him a decent stipend. \n\nSo what I'm asking is, is this normal? Without access to school resources to help me explore options and schools, the idea of just researching a program and contacting the director directly is much more appealing to me, but obviously I don't want to hurt my chances if this is something that typically will annoy those you're trying to impress. I also was a fairly average student in undergrad (life issues, 3.0) and am concerned that I'll be going through the whole application process only to find out I have to pay everything out of pocket (which will severely dampen the likelihood of me being able to attend), and direct contact with a professor seems like it would give a better idea of what kind of financial aid the school can provide. \n\nI'm not sure how different grad schools get internationally, but if it matters, my coworker did his BS in India and his MS in the US. My BS was in the US, and while that will likely be where I stay, I'm still exploring international options as well.\n\nAny and all relevant information is greatly appreciated! As I said this isn't a process I ever learned much about, so even if it's not directly related, I'll take any advice you may have",

      "text": "As the Director of Graduate Studies for a graduate program, I welcome calls from promising prospective students to describe our program. The conversation can help identify one or two faculty members who are worth communicating with directly. \n\nFunding is an extremely important issue. You can find out about actual practices for financial support from the grad director. Some places charge a lot, some waive tuition but provide no or a small stipend, some provide a good stipend. Some prioritize PhD students for support. The grad director is likely to tell you the program's current practice if your ask. \n\nYou will have an advantage over new graduates in that you can describe what you want out of the program based on direct experience in the field. You won't be competing for slots on the basis of GPA.",

      "text": "At least within the US, programs can vary quite a bit across the board in this respect. \n\nSome PhD programs (and maybe the odd master's program) won't really entertain your application at all unless you have already have the support of a faculty member who will be your advisor. In other programs, individual faculty members have little say in the admissions process and there is minimal utility to talking to them ahead of time. Then, there is a wide range of in between.\n\nDo some digging into all the programs you are considering to figure what kind each one is, and proceed accordingly. You may need to reach out to the program director to get that information.",
