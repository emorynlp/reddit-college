  "text": "Hello all. This is likely an ignorant question/situation I have gotten myself into, but it is my first time attempting to get work published and getting accepted to a conference its subsequent journal. I am somewhat lost in the process and would love your opinions. \n\nMy professor submitted our paper this spring. We got accepted in the summer, and made the formatting changes as requested by the committee and they mentioned that if we hadn\u2019t made payment to do so. \n\nI had two trains of thoughts:\n1.) I know paying for publishing is considered a taboo and figured my professor would not have applied to journal with those practices\n\n2.) I thought there may have been an application/convenience fee and that he had paid it when he submitted it for review. It\u2019s a European journal, so I thought maybe it\u2019s done a bit differently from US journals. \n\nAnyways, the conference happens in the fall with the journal to be published early 2022. I checked tonight to see the status and I had gotten an email that was overlooked from the committee earlier this month. They asked if we were still interested in publishing and requested payment by November 8th. Obviously it is way past the 8th, but I did reply back asking if it was too late. Email also got sent to prof, but I am assuming it got left unread due to his schedule too. \n\nNow\u2026I have no clue what the fee is. It was stupid of me to offer payment without asking the cost, and I know I should have communicated with my professor. It was tricky to get a hold of him during the summer, and I know the end of the semester is insanely busy for him as well so I\u2019d prefer to bother as little as possible. \n\nDoes any of this sound normal in regards to publishing? Is it normal to request a publishing fee? If so, any hopes in still getting published even though I missed their payment deadline?",

      "text": "Publication fees actually are common in many fields, even in prestigious journals. You should be able to find out what the fee is from the journal's webpage. And if you are submitting to a conference, they usually require at least one author to actually buy a ticket to the conference. \n\nThat said, none of this should come out of your pocket. It should be paid by a grant, or if your advisor doesn't have any grants that can be applied, a department fund or award.",

That applies to both the best journals and the scammiest ones. \n\nThe professor should have budgeted for that fee from the outset. Consider it part of the cost of participating in the conference. The best thing to do is ask.",

There are some open access journals with good reputations where the author pays a fee to offset the publishing cost out of their research grant or money from their institution. That's okay.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some publishers of poor reputation who charge the authors, which is more of a predatory practice.\n\nSo you really can't generalize.",

It depends on the field and the specific journal.\n\nThere are some very reputable Open Access journals that charge publication fees to offset the fact that they don't charge subscription fees for access to the articles.\n\nBut then there are journals who do it with poor reputation who are using it as a scam to make money.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/495426a\n\nSo it really depends",
