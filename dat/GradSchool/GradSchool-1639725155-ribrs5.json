  "text": "So, this is absolutely me searching for confirmation bias, but here goes. \n\nI\u2019m one semester away from my MA in English literature. Then I decide if I want to stick around for the PhD portion (I\u2019m enrolled as a PhD student, but I earn the MA en route). It\u2019s been a not-so-great year and a half, and I\u2019m not sure how much of that to blame on online classes (this semester I had 1/3 courses in person, the first of the whole program) and how much to blame on growing more and more disenchanted with my program overall. \n\nI love books and I love writing. But I feel unsupported by my department now; I can\u2019t see that changing over the next five years, and as it stands, our funding situation seems perilous. That isn\u2019t terrible on its own - first-year writing will always need instructors - but I haven\u2019t felt very supported or even necessarily wanted here. A lot of my cohort feel the same, but they\u2019re also set on the PhD in a way that I\u2019m not sure I am. \n\nDid you leave your literature program after the MA? If so, what did you do next? Alternatively: did you stick around? What did YOU do next? \n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "there's nothing wrong with taking a year off and applying to a diff phd program that might be better for you. I was planning to take a year off before i took an extra year due to pandemic in 2020. it was nice to have time to focus on just writing my thesis and a second job i had. plus i now live somewhere new (it has its own challenges) and get a new experience.",
