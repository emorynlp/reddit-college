      "text": "All of this is great advice. If your professor offers you the opportunity to do something unique for a final project, do it. If your professor is conducting research and asks for volunteers to help, do it. I recently ran into a professor who I did both of these things for who I hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to in 5 years. I had to remind her of my name but as soon as I did she said \u201coh, yes! ohdaisydaisy! I still have your final project in my office\u201d",

Lots of prof\u2019s will bring on TAs who received a good grade in the class. My second year I was an unpaid TA just for the experience and it really helped my relationship with that professor, who in return gave me a great LoR",

It's also highly refreshing and I was offered some mini-jobs with one professor already being rather early in my masters. \n\nMy prof also told me he is frustrated by how uncritical many of his students are, and that if they ask questions it's about the font size of some assignment or stupid stuff like that, instead of figuring things out themselves...",

I\u2019d say go to office hours for sure, but don\u2019t go just to go. Go with specific questions in mind. If you want to review a topic from class, that\u2019s great, but go with one in mind that you\u2019re struggling with.",
