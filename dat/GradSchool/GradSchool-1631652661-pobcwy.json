  "text": "Hello folks\\~ Long post warning, I'm so sorry!! I just have been holding these thoughts in like a bad turd, and it's time to metaphorically dump. Long version below the TL;DR below. I appreciate any advice or recommendations! Thank you for your time!!\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAfter fucking up my undergrad GPA and leaving an MS program halfway through because I thought I was stupid, I got diagnosed with really bad ADD/ADHD. Turns out I'm not as dumb as I thought, I just have a learning disability and need a bunch of meds to function (thank you, Dr. Psychiatrist). I'm trying to reapply to a grad program, but I'm worried I'll never get in again because I fucked up my undergrad and the first grad program too much. Any advice?\n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nSo I (25F) graduated with a BS in geology back in Dec. 2018 with a shitty GPA (an oh-so-sexy 2.5...yikes). I'd been a good student in school- kind of \"struggled\" in HS, but still somehow did well enough. I just had a hard time focusing, managing my time, and keeping things organized. Also, I have no idea what actually happened in any of those classes. I never remembered a single thing and was never mentally present no matter what. Even during tests. Oops. In college, I started out at an engineering school, (promptly did horribly) transferred to a larger state university that I loved and majored in geology, and was doing alright. But my senior year I tanked. I struggled and could not for the life of me do well. It was a similar situation to high school, just worse. Somehow, I managed to pass and graduate.\n\nAfter some soul searching and guidance from a professor, I got into a MS grad program after graduation through a rec from my senior research advisor. But my grad advisor couldn't stand my work process, and I frankly wasn't as excited about my thesis topic as I should have been. Additionally the department was extremely cliquey and I wasn't about that life. Conveniently (never thought I'd say that) a global pancake hit, and my prof withdrew as my advisor, so I withdrew from my MS program and entered the workforce instead and was blessed by a former intern supervisor who was impressed by my work and knowledge, interviewed me, and I got a job in the environmental regulatory field.\n\n \\*\\*\\*Important note: After getting this job, I sought some mental health treatment for my depression with my handy dandy new insurance because I didn't want to end up un-aliving myself for being such a big ole failure. Upon receiving therapy and treatment, I discovered I had some ragingly bad ADD/ADHD that was the worst case my doc had ever seen in a female (and he had treated adults with ADD/ADHD before, so that made me feel \\*really\\* special). Apparently, I had additionally been referred for treatment by literally every teacher who taught me from grades K-8. And my mom didn't want me to get tested because \"learning disabilities mean you're dumb, and my kid isn't dumb\". Nifty.\n\nTHE ISSUE:\n\nSo, now I'm in a position where my psych has been treating me for about a year-ish and it's been a night and day transformation. If this is how neurotypical folks are, I'm so fucking jealous. And I shudder to think of how much nicer college would have been if I had gotten proper treatment earlier. So much less angst. A lot of my \"work process\" in grad school was just symptoms of my ADD/ADHD spiraling out of control, and me coping the best I could (i.e. last minute completion of papers, panic attacks, impulse reactions, hyper-fixation, forgetting literally every. single. thing. absolutely no attention span, etc.). However, now I want to go back and give a masters degree another crack (in a slightly different field- environmental engineering) in an online program so I don't have to quit my job. But I'm worried that it's going to be nearly impossible to get into any programs after everything that's happened. Please tell me I'm not the only one who has gone through a shit show like this in my life. I can't be the only one. \n\nThoughts? Advice? Recommendations? Should I just start over and get a new BS? That way I can just apply with that GPA? Yikes I'm desperate.",

      "text": "Hey so I read your initial thing and some of your comments and here's a few thoughts:\n\n-my gf has ADHD and was undiagnosed until year 2 of undergrad, after which her grades skyrocketed. Idk how u even got a 2.5 with severe ADHD, that's seriously impressive. I didn't know her pre-adderall, but she certainly displays typical ADHD signs when not on it.\n- don't shortchanged yourself - you always have a shot at getting into universities even if they're respected in your field, especially if you can properly explain what special circumstance lowered your grades. I didn't do so well during undergrad due to being a student athlete/working/surrounding addiction issues, and have been able to get into top grad schools in my field. Certainly could be luck, but always worth taking a shot and applying when the time comes.\n\nBest of luck going forward!",

          "text": "Honestly thank you so much for this comment. Sometimes I feel like I'm making excuses for myself but when there is such a huge performance gap and everyone notices a huge jump in behavior and \"maturity/getting my shit together\" from one year to the next, it can't just be a coincidence. \n\nI'm so glad things have worked out for you and you're succeeding! And I'm glad your girlfriend got the diagnosis she needed. Girls unfortunately don't get diagnosed until really late, and despite that I was shocked to look through every one of my school reports and see \"recommended for ADD/ADHD testing\" on every single one of them. I'll give the programs I'm interested in a shot and hopefully make it through!",

              "text": "Wow idk what happened but my formatting is a disaster. Coupled with the late diagnosis typical of girls, she attended I believe 10? different elementary/secondary schools due to familial issues so it was a mess. Best of luck going forward, the application fees are generally about 100 so its always worth that shot in the dark, because you never know what the other applicants are submitting, or who is viewing your application.",

Don\u2019t do another BS. Take a course, get strong lors and you\u2019ll do great.",

It's a little comforting knowing I'm not alone in my situation, although I'm sure you're not enjoying being in this situation either. 2.9 isn't that far off from a 3.0 though, so you've def got a far better shot at being admitted to more grad programs! You can definitely do it. :)",

If possible, maybe take a grad course (1 at a time first) to show that you can handle the workload now. Then in another year or so maybe apply again?\n\n\nAlso, can you explain why you want a higher degree? This position you have seems great (awesome mentors can make or break a job)!",

          "text": "Funny enough I actually am located near a fantastic university for my field. I just highly doubt I could ever get in- I'm way too trash to even glance at them in my opinion. \n\nA graduate degree has always been something I've aspired for since I genuinely am academically minded and want to pursue the courses that are only accessible to graduate students. Additionally it would do wonders for my career especially financially. I'm somewhat cut off in what I can earn with a BS, and the team I'm working on in particular is mostly engineers. I'm one of the few non-engineers and the growth for my job title is limited to say the least. I'd love to continue to grow even more with my team, but I need an engineering degree to do so. The most closely aligned degree for that would be environmental engineering, and it aligns with my interests in hydrology and links to my BS in geology as well. :) sorry for babbling, I think about this on my lunch break a lot haha.",

It's a fairly large and semi-prestigious (at least they seem to think so) university, so I'm not sure if they would even let me sit in on lectures, let alone audit without being admitted as a student, but I can give it a go. My primary concern is whether I'd be able to even be admitted. But it's worth a shot! Thank you!",
