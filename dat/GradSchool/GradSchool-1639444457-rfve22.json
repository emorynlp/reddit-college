  "text": "I went to community college from 2016-2018. I completed my associates degree and then took a gap year in 2019 to live abroad. I started at a 4-year university in Spring of 2020. About 2 months into the semester, everything went online due to Covid. I only had 2 years of schooling to finish up at this 4 year school (because I already got my associates degree from community college), and I just graduated this month. This means that all of my experience at this university has been online classes, with all but one of them being asynchronous (meaning, we don't meet over zoom). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has seriously impacted my ability to form relationships with any professor. The one professor who I had a good chance of asking for a recommendation letter actually just passed away. Now I am completely panicked. I just graduated this past weekend. I have 0 close relationships with any of my professors. And every school I want to apply to requires 3 rec letters.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to proceed? Am I screwed? I've heard that recommendation letter are a paramount part of the application process and I have nobody to ask. The one professor I could possibly ask is my Spanish professor, and my degree is in Psychology. So it doesn't pertain to the grad program I'd be applying to.",

      "text": "All of my psych classes were online, too, although this was before the pandemic. My strategy was to reach out to the ones who had more relevant experience and ask them if we could have a short meeting so I could ask their advice on career trajectory stuff. Nobody turned me down, and I ended up getting two of my LORs from those profs. I also did get great advice and things they wish they\u2019d known before starting a doc program in clinical. \n\nThe other prof I just straight up asked for a letter where he specifically hyped up my quantitative and stats skills, and I offered to provide him some general highlights, a blurb about why I was interested in each of the programs, and a copy of my transcript if it would be helpful. He was happy to do it even though he didn\u2019t really know me.",

If that was necessary, then people who are shy, but great students, would never get into grad school.\n\nRather, if you performed well in the course, the professor can offer a recommendation based on your work. Which is the main point of a recommendation: it's about your academic performance. It's not about how someone talked to the professor half a dozen times after class or met with them during office hours.\n\nIf these are classes where you completed projects or papers as a main part of the course, I would recommend attaching the main project or paper and the feedback the professor gave you with your email request for a recommendation. Just so they have access to that to refresh their evaluation of your work beyond what might be recorded in their gradebook.",
