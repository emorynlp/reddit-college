  "title:": "How to leave in almost fifth year?",
  "text": "This is a kind of convoluted story, but the gist of it is I think I want out after spending almost 5 years working towards a PhD. \n\nI got a master's along the way, so it's not a total loss, but I feel like I'm just totally burnt out. My first advisors wife died early on and I had to find another advisor just to get through. We finally decided on a topic that made everyone happy, but then COVID hit. Things keep getting set back and I can't keep putting my life on hold for a degree I don't know if I care about anymore.\n\nHas anyone else called it quits this late in the game? I don't know if I'm looking for stories where something similar happened, or even just the feeling like I'm allowed to leave. Sorry if this is rambling, I'm not doing well lately and I'm just grasping for any kind of advice.",

What worked for me was sitting down and establishing a hard timeline for graduating, and stating that it was time to wrap my work up cohesively in a dissertation and pass the inevitable future work off to a junior student (a nice way of saying that the goal posts won't be moving further). Don't be afraid to be firm on this.",

Obviously you want to do your due diligence and complete the degree, but he needs to understand that it can't be delayed indefinitely whether due to the pandemic or something else. Whether you can trust him or not, I think it's time for a frank discussion about this. You don't have to trust him to make your point and start this process. If he refuses to be approachable about this, you can choose to elevate it to a Director of Graduate Studies level or start an exit strategy. Of course I don't know your whole situation just from the text here, but this is how I'd approach it.",

Makes a difference when one can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nPlus, you might have regrets later in life if you don't have that conversation and make a fully informed decision.",

I ended up staying (and next week will have a full draft of my dissertation), but I do not think either decision is right or wrong. While I'll be proud to finish it, I don't think I would've regretted leaving either. I'm in the same boat as you, don't want to do academia, don't care about my research at all anymore, and really don't know that I want a career even related to it now. Leaving would've meant I was prioritizing my mental and physical health, and I'd still have a masters, so how could I be mad at that decision? And it honestly might be easier to find jobs with a masters if you don't want to pursue a research career. Everyone likes to say \"but you're so close!\" and \"look how much time you've already invested,\" but that's just the sunk cost fallacy. You have to make the right decision for you, regardless of how many years in you are",

You\u2019re allowed to make a new decision for yourself, to follow a new path. There is no law or assassin forcing you to finish. You can, and should, prioritize your mental health. \n\nA few years ago I heard about a friend of a friend who quit his clinical psych PhD program before his 5th year. At the time, I couldn\u2019t understand that at all, but my perspective has definitely shifted. I\u2019d definitely encourage you to consider all the options, consequences, etc., but I also think that it\u2019s possible for someone to do that and decide that quitting at this point is the right decision. You get to decide what\u2019s best for you.",

      "text": "It might be helpful to start by getting an idea how much longer you\u2019d actually be on this programme as it doesn\u2019t seem clear. If its 8 years then yeah, spending another 3 on something you hate isn\u2019t worthwhile. If you\u2019ve started writing up though, you\u2019re closer to the end than you think. Personally I hated my phd and I didn\u2019t go into academia. I tried to quit several times. That being said, I think the idea of the \u2018sunk cost fallacy\u2019 is trash. You\u2019ve put 5 years of work into this thing, whether you intend to use it for your career or not you deserve that title and you deserve to complete the course. Meet your supervisors, take a timeline with you of which chapters you intend to complete when and map out the timeframe to completion. And remember almost everyone wants to quit near the end. I tried to quit when I already had the second draft of my thesis written\u2026this is something a lot of people go through.",

      "text": "I would weigh your options, some things to consider though. These are things I sometimes have to ask/say to myself if I'm having an especially \"fuck grad school\" day.\n\n* Are you financially stable enough that if your first option(s) after quitting fall through that you will be able to keep a roof over your head? This is/was a real issue for me.\n* Just because you've been in school for x years doesn't mean you're obligated to stay. Though I will say that you might want to at least finish whatever semester/quarter you're in, some schools will demand you repay your tuition if you stop midway through a semester.\n* If you don't care about the degree, have you tried to revisit why you wanted it in the first place? \n   * If your desire was simply to increase your potential earnings, then by all means, I would say start working towards your next thing, getting into \"industry\" (whatever that means for you) early is more likely to put you on a higher earning path than staying in, though there are some exceptions.\n   * If you were trying to answer some deep rooted questions, maybe you should try to understand why you feel burnt out and actively try to mitigate the burnout and see if that fire comes back?\n* Are you coping with your stress in healthy ways? Maybe going to therapy of some sort might help you to identify problematic ways that you're handling things. For a long time when things got stressful I'd just hide from everything/everyone and play video games, and it really just compounded the stress even if \"escaping\" felt good at the time.\n\nThe feeling of wanting to quit is really difficult sometimes. My wife has a regular urge to quit too, but she's just viewing grad school as a 9-5 job and that works for her most days. Even her advisor (a tenured professor) regularly admits to job searching because of the academia induced burnout.\n\nI think what I'm trying to say is figure out what you want and do it, you can always go back later if that's what you really want.",
