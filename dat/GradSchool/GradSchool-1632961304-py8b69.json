  "title:": "Writing a Personal Statement",
  "text": "Hello again to those of you reapplying this year. Hopefully second time is the charm for me. I am starting to write personal statements and one of the programs I am interested in wants us to write our personal statement about how their program philosophy matches with our professional goals. I am really stuck trying to figure out what is important to add and what isn\u2019t. Has anyone had to write a personal statement like this before and do you have any advice for approaching this? I\u2019m stressed!",

If so, have you determined which ones match up with their program philosophy?\n\nIf you've done that, I would freewrite out some rough text with what matches up. Don't worry about organizing. \n\nThen organize what you have, and write a first full draft of the personal statement.",

Jargon is a problem for laypeople, but useful within a discourse community, as it provides specificity. So I'm not sure why jargon is a problem. \n\nIf you are unclear as to what the terms mean, then best to look them up.",
