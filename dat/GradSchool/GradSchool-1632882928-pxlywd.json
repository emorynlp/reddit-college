  "text": "Oop forgot to include my description:\n\nI love research, but I also love law. I want to find an intersection of both for my career except I don\u2019t know what that is. Intellectual Property seems like an obvious answer, but I\u2019d like to be slightly more involved in research than what that job seems to entail. \n\nIn a perfect world, I would operate as a PI/co-I that also has the legal savvy to also review materials for patent applications. Would that just be a patent examiner? Can you even do both of those at the same time? If someone knows what I\u2019m looking for please shout it out because I am lost. \n\nHappy grad-schooling and professional developmenting!!",

You comb through precedent to try and find justification for the outcome your client wants.\n\nSince you went to talk about IP, I am guessing by \u201cresearch\u201d you might mean innovative technology.  That isn\u2019t really research, that is engineering.   And yeah, IP/patent would be the main intersection of engineering and law.",

If you are interested in social sciences you could volunteer to sit in on IRB reviews.  Not quite law, but there are similarities.\n\nPolitics involves law and funding of you get in to the right position.  Work your way up to Congress and get on a committee that funds science and you could help direct grants.\n\nThe other end of administration for grants might have some intersection with law.  I don\u2019t see much of that end of things myself.  The grant administrator here certainly has no training in law of any sort.  But I don\u2019t know if there is a higher position in the university that does.",

              "text": "This is a very rough explanation because I don\u2019t know the specifics, but my observation is that some people get dual degrees (PhD + JD) to do something similar to what you\u2019re asking, and how they do it is:\n\n1) they are a tenure track professor doing research in the intersection of the PhD topic and law\n2) they also run their own consultation company/firm that helps people with the law related side of patents in their PhD topic area\n\nYou can also do something similar without a JD but you would be opening a consulting/company to help with only the PhD expertise you have and nothing to do with law per say.\n\nThe whole professor + company formula is obviously a lot of work (being a TT professor itself is a lot!), but it\u2019s not he only way to do it. You can also just make a big company that has both research and patent consultation services as long as you have the right credentials, personnel, and obviously resources\u2026 most people do this after having years of experience in either industry or in academia working for someone else first, though.\n\nTake what I\u2019m saying with a grain of salt though, definitely not an expert on this",
