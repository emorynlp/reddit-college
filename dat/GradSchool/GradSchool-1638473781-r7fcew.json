  "text": "Hi everyone. I'm a 1st-year PhD student in Psychology.\n\nHonestly, I'm not that busy. Some days, I just have nothing to do. I am getting two studies going, but the only way to collect data for them is by bringing kids into the lab, and the RAs take care of recruitment. We really only get participants to come in on the weekends, maybe one on a weekday. So it's slow.\n\nI just feel like there's pretty much nothing I could be doing right now to speed up my studies. I'm still piloting so can't even report back to my PIs with data. I could read papers and do lit reviews but I already did those for my studies, and my PIs don't want me to start anything new until these two studies are well underway. Classes are done, but honestly even those didn't keep me terribly busy.\n\nI just feel so guilty because 1) I'm a super hard worker and in my previous lab I was a lab manager and just so busy and going to collect data at museums any chance I could get, or recruiting preschools, checking on RAs, etc. 2) My boyfriend is a chemistry PhD student who is in the lab like 9-5 everyday. He always has so much to share about his day and I'm just kinda like...I read some papers?\n\nFeels very boring and sometimes I even feel guilty for getting paid to do very little. Especially with my siblings working 9-5 jobs and kind of seeing me as an eternal student.",

              "text": "I don't plan to stay in academia, and not sure of your field, but there must be things you can do toward that end.\n\nStatistical analysis afaik is an essential skill for all research. You could start learning R so your analysis is reproducible (unlike in Excel). In certain field this could make you really stand out, and youd be a better mentor to your students too.\n\nYou could create a website to showcase your research interests, philosophy, and papers (once you publish). This could help quite a bit when going for post-docs and faculty positions.\n\nBoth of these could take quite a bit of time, and could be really helpful.",

This is becoming a skill that every researcher should be able to do, as it is becoming more and more common to publish data and the analysis code alongside it. R is great if you want to focus on statistical analysis. But if you are interested in learning about programming more broadly potentially also try python.",
