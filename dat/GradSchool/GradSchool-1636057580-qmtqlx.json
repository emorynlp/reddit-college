  "text": "Hi y'all,\n\nPerhaps this will come off as a venting-type post, but I want to hear about the broader grad student experience. \n\nSo, I am working alongside a young up-and-comer-type researcher. They very much play the game of academia - e.g., why publish 1 amazing paper, when you can get 3 good-enough papers. As a result, I have somewhat benefited from joining his team - I have been included on two articles where I contributed \\~10 hours of work for each. I understand that playing these academic games can be a necessary component when up for tenure and looking for post-doc jobs.\n\nAnyways, this mindset has extended to myself and my colleague becoming another line on their CV. They have essentially forced a pseudo-dissertation on me. My first three chapters were \\~120 pages - because they put it as \"I had to do the same.\" Their first three chapters for their PhD dissertation were 58 pages including references. During this process, I have had to cut out roughly \\~30 pages of work due to misguidance on their part - which they mentioned was part of the process and was intentionally done as a \"learning moment.\" This person has forced deadlines on me for drafts only to have not read said drafts, instead, providing general feedback and making suggestions that were already incorporated into the drafts. It has been a relationship not based on sound reason, but \"because I told you so.\" Whenever I question them, they get defensive and revert to this response. \n\nI recently encountered another situation where my research could become easier and more rigorous, but I was denied because \"it would be the easy way out.\" I think my frustration has reached a boiling point. I confided in a committee member and friend about this issue before the proposal and he mentioned that they would take me on if necessary (he only takes on one grad student at a time, and currently has one). The committee member's grad student is nearly complete their thesis, so I am strongly considering approaching the committee member. My worry is that I do not want to be labelled as a drama-creating individual. I just want to do research, but instead of facilitating my desire to learn, my supervisor has instead catalyzed this resentment I feel towards them... \n\nI wanted to reach out to you folk. I have good friends within my department, but I do not want to create a reputation for myself or hurt my supervisor in the process. Part of it I believe is related to fit, but also due to unrealistic expectations.",
