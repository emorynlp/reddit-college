  "title:": "LOW GRADES AND GRAD SCHOOL ADMISSIONS (TOP 50-100) (course : CS/MIS)",
  "text": "My institution is a Tier 2 institution(not sure if this matters in grad school applications).\n\nThe grading system in my college is relative.\n\nSo, I have low grades mostly because of my F\\*\\*k ups in year 1 (I was **not at all interested** in the courses that were taught in my first year \\[ Re: mechanics, engineering drawing ,physics , engineering math ,basics of electrical engineering etc \\] **which were completely unrelated to Information Technology(my course)** due to which, I had a lot of backlogs(F grades) .  I cleared all of the subjects that I had failed in(6), but all of them **were non-IT**.\n\nMy grades from year  2 and 3 are decent enough( 7.5+/10 ,which would be close to 3.2-3.4 on a 4.0 scale).\n\nNow because of my grades in year 1, I expect to graduate with a GPA of 3-3.3(approximate conversion) on a 4.0 scale .\n\nI want to know whether the courses that I had failed in would be taken seriously by the admissions committee?\n\nI also want to add that I have a job offer from one of the big 4 for the role of an Tech consultant (Will probably work for a year or two).  Will my work ex from the big 4  somehow compensate for the low grades ?\n\nI'd be glad if someone who has worked in the admissions committee could help me out too.",

      "text": "Not sure why you feel a 3-3.3 is a low GPA, as long as you do well on the GRE you should be fine. Really focus on any admissions essays and letters of recs; admissions committee\u2019s understand there can be a large GPA swing between different universities and it\u2019s less important than you would think",
