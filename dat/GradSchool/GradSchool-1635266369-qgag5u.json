  "text": "I am wondering if this is just my program or if other people are experiencing this. So we get a syllabus for all our classes and one class in particular this semester she is moving around the due dates a lot, and it's driving me crazy because I do better with hard deadlines. I am wondering if this is something they're doing on purpose to keep us on our toes and if I should expect more of it or maybe it is just this one professor LOL.",

You can try to ask her directly about it for reassurance, or keep working on delivering the task at hand by the first date so even if the date changes you can be clear on data and make use of the remaining time to do something else.",

          "text": "It's a research-heavy class and we have peer-reviewed articles to read for each week, however we are over a month into classes and we were still discussing week 1-2 articles last week. It takes a long time to read and analyze these articles and we have to write an analysis of each article every week (according to the syllabus, anyway) and sometimes she won't post the articles until a couple of days before class. I'd love to just read them all ahead of time but she doesn't post them way ahead of time.",

              "text": "In that case you could try asking around to former students of her about the way she goes around the course, so you know what to expect and if possible you can ask her to post them ahead of time so you can have an opportunity to make an outline, prepare questions, and so on. Otherwise, you could make some sort of template with key questions for each part of the analysis you need to complete so the abstract and  previous reading give you more output.",

I have this one class in my past that I compare to all others and it's not nearly as bad lol.",
