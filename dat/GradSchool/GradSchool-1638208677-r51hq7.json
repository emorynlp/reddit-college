  "text": "Doing a Masters of Arts, started fall of 2020 and will finish December 2022. My chronic illnesses (EDS/osteoarthritis/suspected POTS) and health anxiety are flaring up massively throughout this endeavor, to the point where I\u2019m having to skip classes and stay in bed from exhaustion for more than half the day. I\u2019m also working a stressful job part time.\n\nMy program offers the option of doing an internship track, but I wanted to challenge myself to write a thesis and I feel passionate about my topic. I have a foundation of a previous paper I\u2019m extending off of and several ideas/leads for research.\n\nDoes everything get easier when thesis research begins? Next semester I will have one core class, one lit review class for the thesis, work part time as a TA for another class, and continue working 2/3x a week part time at my job. Will that all be a lighter load than taking a more than full time amount of classes like I\u2019m doing now?\n\nI am exhausted and burnt out. I remember barely making it through last spring, but i have also heard the first year is generally the hardest.",

      "text": "In some ways yes, but in others no. There is way less class/busy work and it is really nice to feel like the things you're doing are moving you towards completing your thesis. Your time is more your own which can be a double edged sword. You can set your own deadlines, but you can also blow off those deadlines with relatively little consequences. Until they push back your graduation or put you in a massive stressful time crunch. \n\nMy advice is guard your time well. If there are extraneous things that you're asked to do but don't help you progress in your thesis, think long and hard about saying yes. I would go far as to default to saying no unless there is a compelling reason. My experience is from finishing up my STEM PhD, so ymmv.",

      "text": "It depends on the person, but based on the similarity of our experiences I suspect the transition could benefit you. \n\nA research-heavier (quant STEM) workload has been a lot easier for me to manage than a coursework-heavy one. I also struggle with a chronic health issue that took a turn for the worse in grad school, keeping me in bed and fueling significant anxiety. Research tasks are more varied and intermediate deadlines are more flexible, which is a huge boon with inconsistent health. For example, working \"ahead\" while I'm well is more possible than in coursework and there are important but less mentally intensive tasks (literature review, formalizing lab notes, etc.) that can be done from bed when I am less well. \n\nThat said, most people around me thought that coursework was easier. Shifting to research requires more self-direction and involves learning new skills on the fly, so there are certainly challenges in that transition (especially if you don't have prior research experience).",
