  "text": "I sent a current student a poor draft of my goal statement I am so embarrassed that I did this.  I\u2019m also wondering how big of an impact it will make on my chances of admission. I sent it THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS DUE too. (I made the mistake of editing it after a 10hr work shift.) \n\nI am very happy with the submitted GS but I feel embarrassed about sending her the early drafts, not only so late but also it wasn\u2019t my best work and I\u2019m afraid it makes me look rushed/careless\u2026.Should I text her and apologize? Email? I also want to thank her for all of her help because she reviewed my resume and talked with me about the program. I texted her yesterday (for the first time ever), but she didn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m afraid to bother her. \n\nIf you have any advice on how to deal with this I appreciate it.",
