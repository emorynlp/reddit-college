  "title:": "Losing participation in an ONLINE ONLY CLASS. Why do professors act like their class is the only one? I expected this behavior in undergrad but not in grad school...",
  "text": "I\u2019m getting a Master of Arts in Human Resources and Employee Relations. I\u2019ve been in the program for a year and this is my first time encountering a professor like this. The rest understand we work full time and/or have jobs and lives outside of school. \n\nI just found out I\u2019m losing participation points in my current class because even though I\u2019m meeting the weekly requirement of postings, I\u2019m only logging in once a week to interact with my peers on the discussion board and that\u2019s not enough. Regardless of everything being due on Sunday nights, regardless of Sunday being my only free day since I work full time and have health problems so I got to doctors appointments after work. Regardless of spending at least 6+ hours on said free day reading the book chapters, reading the PowerPoints, taking personal notes, posting on the discussion board, writing the weekly required 500 word essays that have nothing to do with HR, and taking the quizzes that have nothing to do with the material either, it\u2019s not enough. \n\nI\u2019m losing points because \u201cthe website monitors participation by logins and if you\u2019re only on once a week or for a short amount of time your score will be lower than others\u201d. \n\nI thought the whole point of an online only class was to be able to work at your own pace and do it whenever you have free time as long as you\u2019re meeting deadlines??? \n\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed getting my masters up to this class. I like the material and it\u2019s been better than my undergrad. But I have a life outside of school: a full time job and health issues. So outside of full time work, I\u2019m running to doctors appointments just about every evening. By the time I\u2019m officially home for the day or have free time during the week I don\u2019t have the mental or physical capacity to sit down and try to post well thought-out responses to each one my classmates. It\u2019s not even required in the syllabus!! But that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to have to start doing since I\u2019m not getting 100%s and I need them to pull off a good grade in this class since I\u2019m struggling. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I just needed to rant. I\u2019m thankful to be getting another degree. I really want it and to get out of my current job cause it sucks pretty bad too which is also adding to my depression, anxiety, and stress and hence why I\u2019m getting another degree so I can get out. Just feeling really stressed and overwhelmed and burnt out. \n\nIf you made it through this post, thanks \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m wordy when I\u2019m upset and it means a lot that you took the time to read this.",

Our midterms were last week, and every professor chose to use our course as normal learning, and then let us take the exam whenever we wanted to during that week. Which seems like a super reasonable approach, except they basically just added 9 more hours of class time to the week (not factoring in actual studying). I also feel like with everyone online, it can feel like we are the only ones struggling to stay onto of things. I reached out to some classmates and have actually felt a lot better after hearing their shared experiences- you may benefit from the same.",

I haven't see this type of asynchronous style of online class since the late 90s.\n\nWe have participation points as well but I think those are just measured by participation during lecture. You always have to be present during lecture (same as in person class) and then whatever time outside of class which is fairly significant but asynchronous. I generally chat with my classmates randomly throughout the week over slack, maybe 30 minutes a day (outside of meetings, research, interviews etc for group project work) at most while doing other things on the computer. I typically try to catch up during my lunch break, and some time in the evening. May spend both days on the weekends working on classwork, depends on the week. I generally try not go over a full 8 hour day for class work. This semester we have reading but I'm not doing it, professor doesn't grade anything about it, it's not discussed and all review for me. I have better things to do with my time.\n\nFor us a heavy class is 20-40 hours extra per week, and this is just for one class. Light class would be under 8 hours per week (generally just reading and writing a paper) I want to take more but can't manage the workload.

But since it's an online structure and we don't always have live Zoom meetings, the professors have to assign enough work during the week to balance out that time requirement (aside from projects/papers/exams)\n\n...YOU are meeting your time requirements, just not while logged into the system.

He is likely also tracking views of pages, videos and so on. \n\nWhat you can do is while you are doing something else (like having diner or whatever) open up something and then ten minutes later go in and open up something else, and so on. I am pretty sure you can get a bot to do this if you visit another sub. \n\nAnother thing you can do is go to the Dean and indicate that this isn't an appropriate method for tracking any kind of adult learning. How does he know you aren't printing everything out and reading it on paper? How is this measuring the learning? It is acceptable to look at an assignment and then retroactively go in and check what the student has looked at (like if they did an amazing assignment and hardly ever logged in, red flag); but it isn't acceptable to dictate to students how they learn. \n\nYour prof is not an educator. S/he is a practitioner and a researcher. The intent is positive, but the approach is poor teaching. So, when you raise your voice - and you should - don't do it because of \"the other things you have on\" or any personal issues you may be facing. This is bad teaching period.",

Participation points should be used loosely as an incentive to keep students engaged, but this sounds like a needly strict and arbitrary standard that doesn't necessarily promote healthy participation.\n\nAt the same time, it sounds like the instructor is grading on a standard that was different from what was listed in the syllabus or explained at the beginning of the course. If that's the case, I definitely would recommend a gentle email acknowledging the new standard but also asking that it be written out explicitly in the syllabus for the future.

I taught a fully online course before the pandemic and I had participation points because otherwise people would just never post. However, I didn't really monitor when they posted because, like you mentioned, people have other things going on. It seems like it would be better to monitor the quality of participation rather than the quantity. \n\nHave you discussed this with your professor? Hopefully they are understanding enough and have enough common sense to understand that you are working full time and penalizing you this way does not reflect your intellectual accomplishments in the course. If not, someone made the suggestion of typing out all your responses early so maybe you can do that and just post them throughout the week. You could even include boilerplate language like \"Hi \\[classmate\\], that's a really interesting perspective and I had similar thoughts when I read \\[assignment\\]. However, I also wondered \\[yadda yadda yadda\\]\" and just change a couple words based on the context of classmate's comment. It sounds like this professor doesn't care about how you engage, just that you do so they may not even notice the boilerplate language.",
