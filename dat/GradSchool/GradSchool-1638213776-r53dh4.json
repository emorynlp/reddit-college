  "text": "Hi, I'm new here!\nI shouldn't be writing this here now. I should be writing my final paper of the term which is due tomorrow. But here we are.\nI'm 41 and about to complete my 5th semester of a part time masters degree next to fulltime work, 3 tween/teenage kids and I also once had a social life, but not anymore. Hopefully I'll complete my thesis in about 1 year's time. \nI did great as an undergraduate, but I wanted to work, and never thought I'd go back to uni, but here we are. I started doing the masters at a relatively prestigeous university (European) and didn't really plan for anything but completing the coursework and qualifying for writing a thesis in something that interests me.\nTo my suprise I banged out an A for my first exam. And the second. Then a C. Then A, A, A.\nThis is NOT humble bragging, btw. I don't even mean to brag. I work my ASS OFF and always think I've failed miserably. \nMy point is: I'm a freaking grown up lady. Now I'm sitting here with my final papers, and as usual I think I've handed in the wrong file for the one that was due this morning, and if it is the correct file, I've probably done some f... Up and it's not going to be great.\n\nWHY DO I CARE.\nAnd: what is the point of good grades? There is no way in hell I'm doing a PhD. Ever. It's not for me (I work in a research institute and know how hard it is. And I'm not that interested in research.)\n\nI don't understand why these grades matter, except for the short lived ego trip. I'm clever in some ways, stupid in others, like the rest of us. I don't need the grades as some sort of stamp of \"you're clever\" approval.\nSo what are they good for? Can they be used for anything? It's the final thesis that matters, anyway, but I doubt anybody will ever read it or that future employers will care.\n\nDoes this make sense? I just feel stressed about doing well on these exams, but I don't know why.\n\nI feel like a 14 year old high achieving school kid who slaves away over her homework. But I'm not 14!\n\nCan anybody relate? \ud83e\udd2f",

I was even searching my school\u2019s website for awards or recognition thinking there had to be some benefit to having a great GPA. Apparently not.",

Grades are one way of knowing you have succeeded.  Yes, you should be able to ask (and answer) yourself about what you learned this semester.  But, you have to admit that insight without the grade itself would be a bit hollow.   Ultimately, it has whatever meaning you give it but it is important in as much as you give it meaning.  You sound like the kind of person who does well in an academic environment (many do not).  Your drive is aligned with the goal, so you do well.  \n\nI\u2019d bet you\u2019re a good role model for your kids.  You strive to do your best and that, in part, is reflected in your grades.  But the grade themselves are not the end goal.  They will soon have no meaning at all (once you graduate).  But what led you to make good grades will lead you to do well in future endeavors.  Hopefully, those endeavors are advanced by your degree.  It all adds up and amounts to impact.  With the knowledge you have acquired you will be better positioned to do more which will continue to impact your children\u2019s lives and others.  I think the fact that you don\u2019t ascribe your grades to the end all, be all of meaning is a good example to set.  But so is acknowledging their personal meaning and value.",

I hoped my issues were a bit more mature than \"I wanna get a good graaaaade\", but apparently not. Haha.\nThanks for your kind words. A researcher friend told me that a good grade is an \"acknowledgement of your thoughts and insight\", or something, which was nice of her to say, but I think you have to be a full blooded academic to look at it that way. I just look at the work we do, where we are barely introduced to these mind bending theoretical concepts, that I barely understand and definitely don't know the extent of, and I feel like I'm just pretend-thinking when I sit down and use whatever I understand of these ideas in assignments and papers. This is not imposter syndrome - I think it's a reflection of having been a professional for almost 20 years. I know what it mrans to have expertise, critical application of ideas and deep understanding  of concepts, and a master coursework ain't that...! So ok, maybe it reflects your ability to read strategically, understand stuff quickly, think critically, and write convincingly, but I already knew that about myself from work. \n\nSorry, I'm rambling! \nThanks again! My kids are stuck with me anyway, I think I'm doing ok as a parent. They can deal with whatever issues I give them with their own therapist eventually! \ud83d\ude02",
