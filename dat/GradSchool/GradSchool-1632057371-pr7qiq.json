  "text": " Just curious how many schools you all think is a good amount for a PhD. I am wanting to do my PhD in CS Ed/ HCI/Engineering Ed. I started off a list of 7 and crossed one off my list for being in a very unwelcoming area, and the other for my prospective advisor not taking students. Other profs havent replied yet but dont wanna wait until the last minute to look for more if i need to. so what are your alls thoughts?",

      "text": "I think your approach is sound and thus, there's no limit.  I applied to one, got in (diff field, same approach).  Like you said, there's funding and that's usually the real question.  Follow up if it's been long enough (\\~2weeks).  You're looking for Fall 2022 I assume?  You're really early.  But it could pan out still.",

If you\u2019re in education or another non-STEM field that doesn\u2019t always fund students, you might want to add a few more so you have more of a choice between them on financial grounds. \n\nYou can also ask r/gradadmissions for more advice.",
