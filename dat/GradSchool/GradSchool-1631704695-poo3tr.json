  "text": "I\u2019m coming towards the end of my PhD, so I\u2019m starting to think about my viva. Do you think it\u2019s worth it to make flash cards on anki for findings from papers? I know in the viva they\u2019ll test my background knowledge, so it\u2019ll be important to be able to talk about work that came before mine. But is it worth it to make a deck on anki with info from papers?",
