  "text": "I am in the process of finding and emailing lab PI's about PhD grad positions. I found one that perfectly fit my interests. I emailed and then was told that I needed a Master's to be considered for a PhD position (even though I have plenty of research and it was not expressed on their website). Are PhDs starting to require another graduate degree? It just feels really weird because I thought the point of a PhD is to create a great researcher, not essentially low pay a professional for 5 years.\n\nField: Ecology\n\nEdit: In the US",

      "text": "It's much less common in ecology than it used to be but it is still possible that it's a school requirement or something. Or it could be an attempt at turning you down nicely. Or a personal requirement of the PI (not that I necessarily agree that it's a good requirement).\n\nAlso even if you do a Master's before a PhD, that doesn't necessarily mean your PhD is any shorter. I'm a PhD student in bio and whether you come in with a Master's doesn't affect the average length of the PhD most of the time.",

Many even confer a Masters once you\u2019ve completed your comps and advanced to candidacy.\n\nI\u2019m living in Germany at the moment, doing a PhD (originally from the US and completed my Bachelor\u2019s & Master\u2019s stateside) and here you are required to have a Master\u2019s before starting a PhD. The idea is that you get all of your technical and empirical training (think basic theory understanding, methods training, research design training, etc.) done in a Master\u2019s, then when you start your PhD, you go directly into your research and writing phases without much training on *how to be a researcher.*\n\nSo maybe that\u2019s the pedagogy that this program you were hoping to get into follows.",

Why require another graduate degree when they are supposed to be doing the job of teaching you. It is just like a job asking for 2 years of prior professional experience for an entry-level position. That's why I am confused.",

This would usually be areas that are uncommon as undergrad majors (which is also the supposed reasoning for not accepting direct applicants from undergrad).",

To know what it is for the specific program that your are considering you simply have to look it up. Guessing based on what someone else does is not going to work.\n\nWhat may be happening in this instance is that the professor has a lot of students who want to train in the lab, and the prof simply chooses to consider only prospects who already have a masters. That approach makes the grad students in the program more productive and reduces the amount of time looking at uncompetitive applications.",
