As far as I am aware most Language degrees have some social sciences classes, studying the society and culture of the language you are studying, I would also assume you had some class on research design. These are all relevant and a good background to have. I have a background in Geography and I am now doing a MSc in International politics. What I found when applying was that some of the 1-year masters I applied to recommend a bridging program, to give me some more background knowledge. But this was not usually the case with 2-year masters. \n\nAdditionally, my classmates come from a variety of backgrounds, economics, policy, business, geography, history and linguistics.",
