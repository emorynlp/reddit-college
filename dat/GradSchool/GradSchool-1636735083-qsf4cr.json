  "text": "First year here with results that are once again poor, meaning I\u2019ll have to repeat the same experiment I\u2019ve been troubleshooting/doing all year. \n\nThe last month has really spiralled out of control - I\u2019m sleeping about 30 minutes a night and constantly thinking about how to fix my work. I try to make an effort to go to social events every now and then but the same thing happens. Constantly teary and nauseated. I feel inadequate and like a failure, and have told my advisors that I\u2019m thinking of quitting.\n\nI know my results are not reflective of my self worth\u2026 or at least I did at the start of the PhD. Now I feel like a burden to the lab and like everyone would be better off without me. \n\nI know I just need to keep trying but I feel like a wreck. I\u2019m sure people have been in a similar slump - do you take time off or just push through and keep working and working on it? I find if I even take a day off I\u2019m just curled up thinking about my experiment, but I also can barely function at the lab.",

This is how research goes.\n\nI think you need to push through in terms of sticking with grad school, but a break is definitely in order. Take a week or two away, have a meeting with your advisor about what the issues with the experiment could be and then recalibrate yourself. It\u2019s tough, and if you don\u2019t start sleeping more you\u2019re never going to fix the experiment.",

      "text": "Right now you need to listen to what your body is telling you, and you need to take a break. Working on 30 mins of sleep won\u2019t help you push through, it\u2019ll actively hinder you. Take a break to recharge yourself, maybe like one or two weeks, and then you can come back to your problem with a rested mind and new perspectives. You\u2019re going to burn yourself out if you try run on empty.",
