  "text": "Hello everyone! I am a 4th year undergrad biomolecular engineer applying for pdh programs in the fall. As the title says, I'm a little unclear on the difference between a \"personal statement\" and a \"statement of purpose\". I know these two have a little bit of a different focus content wise (personal motivations vs. research goals), but what about the technical aspects? \n\nAre these two supposed to be the same length? Do all schools require both of these? Or is it more of a school by school kind of thing?\n\nAlso, how long did it take you to gather all of the materials for your application? I've been swamped with this iGEM project until last Friday, so I hope I'm not too late to the game. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I think a personal statement is a professional narrative that sets up your statement of purpose. Its your hero\u2019s journey with all the steps along the way that taught you something to fight the dragon at the end and save the day. The statement of purpose is how you will put those things together accomplish your big career objective.",
