  "title:": "How do I tell my PI I am thinking about Mastering out?",
  "text": "TLDR: Unsure about graduate program, behind due to covid + personal problems. Am deciding if mastering out is my best option. Being very behind in research I am unsure if its best to tell him I am thinking of mastering out now while offering to keep working 3/4 months until my contract is up to tie up the results I have. OR should I just grind and get results over the next few months and tell him as my contract is nearing up. (we sign 9 and 3 month contracts, summer/school year). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright I know this topic has been talked about before, but I am looking for advice to my specific situation. I made a post a while ago about my struggle through covid and being behind. I didn't end up passing my candidacy exam in August, but they offered for me to retake it which I quickly accepted. The offer to retake is not available to everyone, I had specific  circumstances for being allowed to retake, in addition to having a good presentation that just lacked some depth in terms of thinking (not being far in my project made it hard to think about problem solving things I hadn't gotten to yet), but they were excited for me to retake. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few weeks I get married, finish moving my new wife in, and I thought I would just hit the ground running and go. I just find not much happiness or reward in my work, and my passion lacks much compared to people in my lab. I find myself behind again, luckily I haven't dug any hole for myself as I am catching this early on. \n\nI am now deciding if I should pull myself up by my bootstraps and just hunker down and get some results. But a big part of me is saying lack of financial motivation, extreme expectations, high anxiety, and lack of interest are worth it. I think half of the lack of interest is from depression, but the other half is me also wanting to just start my life and family. I feel like I am puting my whole life on hold for a little reward which in the end may not matter, because my lack of interest may impede results which then makes me a less competitive candidate when I graduate with a PhD. \n\nIts not that I hate chemistry, I still find it really cool and I love aspects of it. I just think I am ready to start working, and this lifestyle feels like a major pause.\n\nNOW onto where I need advice.\n\nI haven't told my PI this is how i have felt, ever really. I have briefly mentioned feeling over frustrated and having issues finding motivation. He knows about my mental health issues and has been supportive through them. But now I am at the point where I am behind enough I feel like if I mention thats how I feel, thats the path he would encourage/force me to take. So I am torn to tell him now with my lack of results, but offer to keep working/getting results until my contract is up in may. OR should I just work my butt off until march/may and tell him then after getting him results. I was planning on retaking my candidacy exam in the beginning of summer, when we sign our new contracts if that would change anything.",

      "text": "Your situation, priorities and goals are different now from when you started. That is not unusual, so it is a relatively common topic of conversation. You will want to have that conversation.\n\nTwo thoughts on how to approach it.\n\nFirst, don't start with the conclusion of mastering out. If the discussion goes there, fine, but you may discover other options that meet your new sitation better. \n\nSecond, if going to your advisor is fraught, start with your director of graduate studies. You can get some perspective and test out some approaches to the conversation. The DGS most likely want to see the best outcome for you, and also wants communication to be as clear as possible. That makes them a good source of advice and a good sounding board.",

          "text": "My program is all about publishing papers, I want to get enough research done that when I end up leaving the person taking over my project has a good starting off point. I\u2019m unsure if it would be smart to get myself ahead and no longer be behind to tell him I want to master out. So it\u2019s either I tell him now while I\u2019m behind but say I plan on researching and writing a masters thesis, or should I get a ton of research done and tell him in a few months that grad school isn\u2019t for me after getting deeper into my research. Getting research done=results. We only have one year of classes which I passed all of them, now I just research in a lab",

              "text": "It sounds selfish, but you just need to do what is best for you. Most of us, if not all of us, have been taken advantage of at cost to ourselves in our programs and it doesn't do us any good. If you have made up your mind to Master out, then do it unapologetically. My only piece of advice would be to make sure you don't need or would highly benefit from the PhD. \n\nSidenote: None of us have the passion for what we do throughout the process. People pretend, but it's a show. Imposter syndrome et al.",
