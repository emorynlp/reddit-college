  "text": "I'm a PhD student and recently returned to the office. \n\nDespite being back on campus, I haven't really made many friends and I often go the full day barely speaking to people. It's sad because I'm just really introverted and if they made the first move I'd probably give a better impression of myself.\n\nI don't mind being on my own but I literally have no support network or anyone on my side.  \n\nThey're all planning a christmas night out and predictably didn't invite me.",

      "text": "I am really introverted and my natural inclination is to mind my own business too. However, I set a personal goal for grad school since I was moving to a totally different state that I would try to make more of an effort to get to know at least 1 person. Having a ton of friends is not something I care about, and I didn't come to grad school to be a socialite, but having a support network is important so pushing myself out of my comfort zone was something I wanted to prioritize. \n\nIt ended up working well for me. I have at least 3 friends who I'm pretty sure are lifelong friends. It started with pretty much small talk. Sometimes I would have a question that I kind of knew the answer to, but I wanted to start a conversation so I asked them about it. I think grad school attracts a disproportionate number of introverts, so if you always wait for the other person to make the first move, they could be figuring the exact same thing.",

From the extrovert's perspective, I'm normally more than eager to start up a conversation with an introvert... but I've had it where some people in my office give off such cold, unfriendly vibes that I don't say more than a hi to them because I genuinely feel like I'm annoying them. They've almost got a \"Don't talk to me, I'm not interested\" vibe rather than a \"I'm friendly but just introverted\" vibe, whether that's deliberate or accidental. \n\nI know it's really hard (I used to have extreme social anxiety) so I emphasise a lot with your situation. I would really recommend, as others have, approaching someone regarding the Christmas event and saying you'd like to come too, that you're a bit shy but would like to make some new friends.",
