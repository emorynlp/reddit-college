I actually brought it my last year of undergrad because I was taking a Biblical Hebrew class that required me to carry 3 books around for it. I can get quite a few books in it along with my laptop and notebooks. I do strongly urge cup holders! I typically use one for a drink and the other for an umbrella.",
