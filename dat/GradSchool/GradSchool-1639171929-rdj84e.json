  "text": "Have any PhD students received bonuses or even appreciation gifts from their institution? Asking because my university\u2019s medical center just sent an email announcing a second $1000 \u201cgratitude bonus\u201d for employees that grad students are once again ineligible to receive. This came just days after they finally got back to a fellow student in my program who had reached out inquiring why we weren\u2019t eligible, stating that they \u201csee us as students first\u201d and building an excuse around that. I get that the main reason for the bonuses is to help with employee retention, especially those employees involved in patient care, but even nonclinical employees (including research faculty and staff) are eligible for the bonuses.\n\nWe\u2019re obviously pissed about this, especially given how many grad students helped with prepping kits for the university\u2019s independent COVID testing facility or even volunteered to help process tests.  Someone in my program said Michigan gave their grad students a $1500 bonus, so I was wondering if any other institutions have given their grad students bonuses or even appreciation gifts?",

I also was never considered an in-state student at my public university because I started <9 months after moving to the state. Even though I was in grad school for 7 years, bought a house, got married, had 2 kids in the state. \n\nI never heard of students getting bonuses. They fought us on $0.50/hr raises. And they punished people for taking 2nd jobs outside the university to make ends meet.",
