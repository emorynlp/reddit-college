  "text": "Hi friends! I have to do my first journal club for my masters program and I\u2019m actually freaking out. I have never done a journal club before and don\u2019t know anything about making the presentation or what needs to be included or discussed. I already chose my article but I\u2019m terrible at understanding and interpreting scientific papers. You might be thinking to ask my mentor but he already said that he won\u2019t help me and he\u2019s a little bit too harsh and mean if you look at my recent post history. \n\nI would appreciate any tips or just some guideline on what I should do?",

They briefly describe the experimental setup and then as a group we discuss the figures, results, and main conclusions.",

      "text": "In my experience (graduated with PhD in molecular biophysics 10 years ago\u2026god that makes me feel old), the purpose of a journal club is to critique the scientific approach, poke holes in the data, and consider/propose future experiments. I would give a brief background (only enough to kind of level-set your audience so that they have enough info to interpret the data), then focus on presentation of the data itself. Discuss each figure presented in the article, as time allows. Save enough time to briefly summarize the authors\u2019 interpretation of the results (pull from the discussion section of the paper), then provide your own interpretation and what questions you feel are left outstanding.",
