  "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am thinking of leaving my current MSc programme and joining a new one (the current one I am in is a two year programme in a big city, which makes it exorbitantly expensive). Now my question is, I have still not dropped my programme and I probably won\u2019t up until January.
