  "title:": "What to ask Program Coordinator",
  "text": "I'm applying for a MPH and I attended my prospective school's open house where I got to ask the program coordinators a few questions. When I told them I wanted to know more, they scheduled a Zoom call with me via email. As someone who didn't go to school in the US, I'm aware that there's a lot of things I have yet to learn. What questions should I ask that would make me memorable and more informed about their program? I also want to know if their program is a good fit for me.",
