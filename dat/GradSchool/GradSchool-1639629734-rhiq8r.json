Because that's an active job where I was on my feet and working with people, it replaced most of my social time downtime outside of school. \n\nBut I'm pretty sure I could have not have done an office job, sitting on my ass. Because I was already spending a lot of hours sitting in class, reading, and writing.",

      "text": "I'm a program that restricts, though doesn't outright ban, outside work. This set up is not uncommon for at least US STEM PhDs. \n\nAt least for us, the root cause is that the majority of students are funded on certain federal grants that have an outside work restriction and the department extended similar guidelines to everyone else in the name of fairness. The bar is that we have to justify that the work contributes to our training, so the jobs that generally get approved are consulting, tutoring, and stuff like that. (Even summer internships are dicey.) More regular jobs like retail or waiting tables would certainly not get approved.",
