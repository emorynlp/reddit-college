  "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm really interested in NYU Wagner's MPA in Health Policy & Management, as it seems like a unique program compare to other CAHME-accredited HP&M professional degree programs that are housed within schools of public health (i.e. MPH, MHA). I'm also intrigued by the flexibility to switch between full-time and part-time, since I expect I'll want to work during the program to make it more affordable and continue gaining professional experience (I have about 3 years of full-time post-bacc experience right now).\n\nIf anyone here has attended NYU Wagner or is otherwise familiar with the school, especially the MPA program in HP&M, I'd love to hear your overall thoughts about the program, how it prepared you for your current career path, why you chose Wagner, etc.\n\nAny insight at all is much appreciated -- thanks!",
