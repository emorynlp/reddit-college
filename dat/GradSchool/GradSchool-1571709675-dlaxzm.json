The self-doubt, it gets real. I\u2019m happy for the most part and doing the damn thing, but this journey is challenging in SO many ways, even as a first year student. If you\u2019re in a bad place right now, struggling, or feeling low, just know that I am proud of you. Really, truly proud of you. You are capable and resilient and powerful as all hell.

I was too busy to think and stopped sleeping half way through the year.\n\nThird year has been hard because post-comp slump is real. I'm super unmotivated and don't care about anything... except for when I'm filled with existential dread about my future and about how little I feel like I've done.\n\nAt this point, I'm expecting fourth year to be just as hard, in a new and exciting way.

Some people do that through sound (phonologists), some people do it through grammatical strucure (syntacticians), some people do it through meaning (semanticists), etc.\n\nBecause of that, saying \"I study linguistics\" is kinda like saying \"I study plants\". There's loads of ways to do it, and everyone does it differently. There are some commonalities, ofc-- we all use empirical data gathered from native-speaker consultants, for one.\n\nRight now I'm working on problems in the temporal modification of possessives, but I also wrote a paper about how an understudied Iranian language was able to create a new transitive ('I have coffee') possessive verb by (theoretically) combining it's original two intransitive forms ('I-with coffee' and 'at-me coffee exists') because the influence of a transitive possessive construction from a neighboring language.\n\nPeople work on a TON of other stuff too, like language acquisition and how to model language computationally. You're probably most familiar with comp ling, since one aspect of that deals with AI and how to fix Google translate. Lol\n\nIt feels a bit like putting puzzle pieces together when you don't have a full puzzle and people are constantly yelling at you haha.\n\nEdit: removed bit about applied ling. Check out the comment below mine for a better description of that, if you're interested.",

We basically study different languages to determine their internal structure and see if we can make universal generalizations, among other things. Some people do that through sound, some people do it through grammatical strucure, some people do it through meaning, etc.\n\nA lot of it feels like being given a bunch of ripped up pieces of paper and being told to put them back together, except you don't have all the pieces and some of the ripped ones are really, really tiny. And other people have similar papers from questionable sources and are constantly telling you you're doing it the wrong way and it fits much better if you flip it over. Lol\n\nThat said, I do love it!",

In my 2nd and last year now and I defintely feel more confident although self-doubt does occur here and there. Thanks for the motivating words and Im going to express the same thoughts back at you.",
