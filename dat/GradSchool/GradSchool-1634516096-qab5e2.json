  "text": "Looking for some advice and encourage during this moment. \n\nCurrently, I\u2019m in my first semester of my MA and I\u2019m mentally and physically exhausted. Despite feeling so excited and ambitious about everything originally, I realized I\u2019m not in the best mindset to continue with my courses. I was on barely on top of everything when September came around as I had work, studying for my GRE, and course work but a few weeks ago, my dad was in an accident where he lost his eye. I\u2019m currently his primary caretaker and translator so I\u2019ve been taking him to the hospital 3/4 times a week, keeping track of his prescriptions, and organizing his appointments/files. Everything is so exhausting and I\u2019m considering dropping my current courses now. I\u2019m planning to meet with my advisors and graduate director soon to let them know I\u2019m interested in taking some time off of graduate school. \n\nSince everything is new for me and the entire semester is online, I\u2019m not even sure if my graduate director can support me or give me the support I need.",

      "text": "I am so, so sorry to hear about your dad. Of course you\u2019re maxed out right now! Grad school is often stressful, but having a parent suffer a sudden accident and disability and being their primary caretaker is . \n\nI hope you\u2019ve sought counseling for this. It\u2019s a lot to cope with, and it would probably help a lot to do so with guidance from a professional. I know it feels like you\u2019re already swamped, but carving out that time for yourself is important. If you need help finding resources or want any advice on choosing a therapist, let me know. \n\nYou should absolutely take time if you need it. If you\u2019re not sure what your options are and you\u2019re nervous, I\u2019d reach out to the ombuds at your school. They\u2019re confidential and can let you know what is available to you. It may be that taking a leave of absence is the best route forward, or maybe dropping a couple classes even if you fall below the threshold of a full-time student. Things like that. \n\nYou are dealing with a lot, and you\u2019re being very thoughtful in figuring out how to best proceed with grad school. You\u2019re doing a good job in a very tough situation. And your dad is lucky to have you, too. Hang in there.",
