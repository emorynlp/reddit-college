  "text": "I\u2019m writing this on the same day that the deadline was due. I had known about the deadline since early this year, around graduation. I didn\u2019t consider it until about a month ago. I reached out to a former internship partner and they wrote a letter.\n\nHowever I only had one and I didn\u2019t message my professors until about a week ago. I know it was late to ask but they still offered to write one. I didn\u2019t get them the correct paperwork until this past Monday, severely limiting my chances of getting one in time. \n\nI followed up with an email today asking if they were able to write one. I still haven\u2019t gotten a response so I\u2019m hoping this weekend maybe. Still I feel bad for expecting a LOR on such short notice. \n\nI also just started the application today. Despite knowing about the date, I held it off until the very last minute like an dummy. I managed to fill out the first few pages of the application, but without the LORs I feel like it might not be considered. \n\nI\u2019ve also yet to type out the essays which consists of about 3-5 pages. I figure it\u2019s pointless if the LOR are considered \u2018required\u2019 to apply. Since I already started the application today, I\u2019m hoping I can get the letters in and essays written by Monday. Even though it\u2019s past the deadline, I\u2019ve heard they will still consider?\n\nThe issue is that I\u2019m not excited about the program as I\u2019m not that excited about my degree. I\u2019m in communications and I didn\u2019t enjoy the subject. As a result my grades kind of slipped below 3.0, which made me lose hope they\u2019ll even consider me. \n\nMy goal is to find a research or teaching position that will help me gain experience. I also have a friend down there in his last year, so I was hoping to get into the Spring graduate class. I also really want to get a second chance to improve as a student and focus on a better career.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m desperate to just apply and see what they say. Even though it\u2019s $70 I\u2019m willing to risk it since I know the regret will be far greater down the line. I had been wanting to attend spring but I let my doubts discourage me from applying. \n\nSo if I had any chance of getting accepted, should I just try to write as much on the application tonight and submit what I have? Or should I risk being late to potentially get my LOR\u2019s and full essays completed? I know I can apply for Fall 2022 and likely will if I don\u2019t get accepted now.",

          "text": "It\u2019s not the program as much as my degree. It\u2019s so basic and I\u2019m not excited about potential jobs. I figure getting a masters would help improve my chances and give me better credentials. I also didn\u2019t enjoy undergrad and I would like to get some experience with research or teaching position instead of getting a random job. It seems like an easier way than trying to go back to college and get a new major. Because I figure in a year or two I won\u2019t care about college anymore and just want to work. Since college is still fresh in my mind, it\u2019s motivating me to apply now. \n\nIt also goes back to being a student again and getting the opportunity to use those resources fo my full advantage. I didn\u2019t network or create real world experience, let alone befriend any professors while I was in undergrad. I figure grad school would help me take a more mature, career oriented approach toward school. Since once you finish college, all those resources available to you suddenly vanish and it sucks I missed out. I don\u2019t feel like I have any lasting skills from college and I\u2019m tempted to go back and develop them \n\nThere\u2019s also the factor of not wanting to grow up just yet. I didn\u2019t enjoy college until the very last year, as I finally had a friend circle. My friends are still there until spring so I figured I would be able to enjoy at least one more semester with them before they leave. Because once they leave, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have much time or energy to try and find new friends again. Heck I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d even want to go back to college again at that point. But I\u2019m only 24 and I just can\u2019t see myself wanting to go back to college at 25-29. \n\nBut all in all I\u2019m still on the fence about it. I wanted to go to grad school, but my counselor always said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I also spend way too long getting my undergrad. I took her advice until recently when I figured I make that decision myself. There\u2019s also the option of simply moving out there for next semester. Then I could enjoy college with them without the responsibilities of grad school. The only thing is that id be on the outside looking in. I wouldn\u2019t meet people through classes, clubs or any programs on campus. I\u2019d be isolated from the very school which I graduated.",

So is the desire to have one more semester with your friends.  \n\nListen to me here: You should NOT think about grad school unless you have a strong desire to dive deeper into one particular subject area, deeper into that area than you ever did in undergrad.  \n\nIf it's about credentials, there are abundant shorter term certificates and certifications that can help you stand out in the job market with much less time, effort and commitment than grad school would be. One or more of those could be a good idea, help you focus and stand out in the job market.\n\n>I didn\u2019t network or create real world experience, let alone befriend any professors while I was in undergrad.\n  \nIf you did not do this in undergrad, grad school is not the place to start. Get a job, any job, and network from there, earning real world experience (and a livable wage!) as you go. Employers will know other employers, real world experience is valuable, and at this point professional networking that you can continue your whole life will get you very far. (Coworkers can even become friends, believe it or not!) Nothing will give you a more career-oriented approach than an actual career. And if, in a few years, you can point to something that you KNOW you want to study more deeply, then a return to grad school for a master's may be in order. You may even get tuition help from your employer if it's knowledge that will help you on the job. That would be a good time to apply to grad school.  \n\nBut please, don't look to grad school to fix your undergrad mistakes and get your head on straight. You'd be wasting your time and the time of any school that accepted you. I've been blunt here, but I hope you can see why job experience will give you more of what you are seeking than grad school can.",

Graduate school is way too hard and way too much money for you do to get experience and utilize resources. If you\u2019re wanting more time to do school and figure your stuff out then just change your undergrad major or reenroll in classes part time while working. \n\nI know it sounds ridiculous, but unless you\u2019re extremely interested in your subject and need a secondary degree to pursue your career of choice, grad school isn\u2019t the answer.",
