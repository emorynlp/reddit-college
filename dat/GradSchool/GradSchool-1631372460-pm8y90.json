  "text": "Im in a group of other grad students and I see that they receive their I20 from the uni when they receive the acceptance letter. For the ones I've applied to, I need to accept their offer to begin the process of getting the I20. Is it different for different universities? \n\nAlso, can I accept two admission offers and hence receive two I20 forms and then decide on one when I file my visa application?",

      "text": "You should only accept one admission offer. Do the neccessary work to decide which one you want first. \n\nUniversities that accept international students have a good process for issuing I20s. There is no need for you to worry about that part. Just stay in communication with the admission staff after you have accepted.",
