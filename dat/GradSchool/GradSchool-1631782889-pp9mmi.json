  "text": "I'm in my first year of a PhD and just coming off 12 months of home working.\n\nTo me, the most crucial thing I've come to terms with is that I can't be expected to perform the way I did when I was on campus, especially because of the distractions or general setup I have at home.\n\nMoreover, I suppose it's also important to not judge productivity based upon raw output. Sometimes I only mabage to work 4 hours in a day or only make it through one article when I had 3 queued up. \n\nWhat are some good pointers or tools you've come to use?",

      "text": "The biggest thing I learned from my academic experiences is the ability to think critically. Grad school gave me the safe environment to fail in my decision making from time to time. Work in the industry is most likely not going to rely exactly on what you\u2019ve learned/researched during your academic years. But throughout my developing career, I am able to see parallels from the theory based work I\u2019ve done in my studies to the problems we see today. Although my experiences in grad school are mostly neutral, what I gained from my studies is something I\u2019m very grateful for.",

I don't think I would've been able to fix it just by being told it was a problem or being advised a certain way, it's one of those things you have to work out on your own or with a therapist.",
