  "title:": "Torn between attending grad school or sticking with an amazing job I recently started - advice?",
  "text": "My situation is pretty bizarre. I am in my early 30s and became widowed 2 years ago. Due to that, I received enough money to pay for grad school and all of my expenses if I chose that path. At the time, I was working at a job that didn\u2019t engage me, so I started looking into getting a masters in counselling. I\u2019m extremely passionate about the field and began volunteering and doing research assistantship at my local university to build my CV (I am 10 years out from my psych undergrad).\n\nRandomly out of the blue about 6 mos ago, I was offered a fantastic job in high tech/aerospace doing what was essentially my dream job pre-widowhood (Technical Writing). My undergrad degree is in psych and I had only a 1year college certificate in tech writing so it was a crazy networking stroke of luck that I even got the job. It\u2019s got excellent prospects for growth, great pay, and management has already recognized my potential and gotten me on track to building a technical publications department around me. I work only 4 days a week and have amazing work-life balance (for now at least).\n\nHowever, my passion is still psych and working in the MH field. I submitted my applications for grad school last month and have an interview with a potential thesis supervisor next week. But I need feedback on whether, realistically, going back to school is a good choice for me. It\u2019ll be a massive income hit (though due to my circumstances I have enough money put away that I don\u2019t really need to worry about income) and I\u2019m a sole parent to a toddler... Can I realistically do grad school as a sole parent? Would I be crazy to leave a fantastic job to do grad school? Can anyone offer any insight?",

      "text": "I left a lucrative career in marketing at 28 to start a doc program in clinical psych. I don\u2019t regret it, but I kind of do. Grad school fucking sucks. It\u2019s a miserable slog for those brief moments of rewarding interaction with clients. Maybe a masters program is better, but I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t have any free time, and I would be absolutely broke if I hadn\u2019t saved up in anticipation of this. \n\nStay in your dream job for now. If it loses its luster in a couple years, think about going back to school. In the meantime, find some rewarding volunteer work that hits you in the same way that counseling might. I volunteered for years an adult literacy tutor for folks with specific learning disorders, and it was really rewarding in similar ways to actually seeing clients.",

          "text": "This is my view - stick with the job, find a fulfilling volunteer opportunity, and get your kiddo into kindergarten/first grade. Then, reassess and decide what you need in that new chapter of your life. Maybe that's going back to school - now with your kid occupied and out of the house most of the day and a tidy little nest egg - or maybe you've grown your position into one that you're content with. Maybe you're involved with some mental health advocacy groups or mentoring at-risk kids or doing whatever it is that makes you happy.\n\nThe next few years are going to be hectic, so I'd spend some more time in this kickass position and see where it takes you. Best of luck!",

      "text": "Isn't getting a fantastic job with great work life balance what it's all about? Passion at work is overrated - and in the field you're looking at pivoting to, it's often used to justify exploitative working conditions. You would almost certainly end up in a much less ideal environment at the end of it.\n\nThere are a million comments all over reddit and other forums by people who chose to pursue their passion for work, and found that the monotony and drudgery of work eats away at that passion over time and they are left with nothing but just another job. I would never in a million years recommend you give up a dream situation like this to pursue an idealized vision of what you think counseling work would be like. If your work situation changes, go back to school then. There's no time limit here and no rush, you don't have to figure it all out right now.",

      "text": "Sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side, so you move on to greener pastures. Then, once you're already there, you realize that the grass was green because the previous owner spray painted the lawn. The paint is toxic, and smells really bad, but you couldn't notice it from further away. The lawn also has poor drainage, so it floods every time it rains. The septic tank is leaky, and the property has a really annoying homeowners association headed by an elderly retired curmudgeon named Bob who recently cited your neighbor for painting their door off white instead of eggshell white. He knows because he keeps color swatches from Home Depot on a key chain. Then you find out the city recently decided to take half your lawn to build a bus stop.\n\nLike others said, most people go to graduate school to get their dream job. If you already have an amazing job with potential for growth, and a salary sufficient enough that you can life comfortably, I'd stick with that.",

If you do find that later on down the road you still feel the pull of going into counseling, you could always find a program and study part time/remote while still working. Maybe as your child gets older and starts going to school, as you become more settled into the workload of your professional life, etc. A coworker of mine is getting a counseling masters remote through Prescott College while working 4 days a week. If you want it, there are totally doable options. But also, like\u2026keep the job.",
