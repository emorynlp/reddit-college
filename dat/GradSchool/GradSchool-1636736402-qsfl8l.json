  "text": "Hi Everyone! I\u2019m a junior in undergrad looking for some advice about getting a masters vs going right into the work force out of undergrad. In Spring of 2022, I\u2019m living in DC as part of a Washington Semester program and will have an internship somewhere TBD. I have some interviews lined up next week with government consulting firms and other law/lobbying firms like Brownstein Hyatt and Greenberg Traurig. This is is the area I want to work in full-time and am considering getting an MPP from any of the DC schools and working part time during those 2 years. Did anyone follow a similar path, and would you recommend the MPP? I know a lot of people say it makes sense to enter the workforce immediately because after 2 years I\u2019ll end up with the same-level job with having made less money and still having to pay off student loans. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

      "text": "I think for an MPP it almost always makes sense to enter the workforce first.\n\nNot only will you be a more competitive applicant, but you will likely have to take on less debt. You\u2019ll have a chance to save some money, and in my program which is kind of adjacent to an MPP, lots of the mid-career folks are getting their tuition at least partially paid for by their employer.",
