  "text": "I'm writing this because my PhD really damaged my self-esteem, so I want to practice being proud of myself. So yeah, I'm proud of saving my PhD pretty much all by myself, with some help from my colleagues. I had no idea it was even possible to go from 0 - 100% in the space of a year.\n\nI also wanted to write this to give hope to other students who are deep into their PhD and feel behind, especially those who have been left behind by their supervisors (like I was). So I'm happy to chat or offer advice related to those problems here/in PMs -- too many of us suffer in silence and it's super important to talk about these problems earlier rather than later.",

Second, you can write a book pretty quickly once you know what you want to say. And third, it is incredible how efficient you and your committee can become once a hard deadline is thrown into the mix (I had a job offer that began in May and a key committee member who was going on mat leave shortly after).",

          "text": "It was a really long process! I would say it wasn't just the change of events at the 3 year mark that \"fixed\" it, but also some other things along the way. **TL;DR:** improving work ethic through external courses, firmly telling my supervisor to supervise me better, and revamping my plan from the ground up.\n\nThe three main milestones:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Self-improvement**. In the first two years, I spent a lot of time going to seminars/researching how to be a better independent researcher, adopting a better work ethic, and finding out what works for *me*. I had the luxury of coming and going whenever, but by the 2 year mark I had a solid work ethic. I blame my supervisors a lot for my pitfalls (see below), but I knew I had to try my best to improve myself, and to accept responsibility for the slow progress. I will freely admit I am (or was?) terrible at planning, but I finally got the hang of it after a while too.\n* **Standing up to my supervisor**. The 2 year mark was also a huge milestone. It was the first time I grew a spine; for the first two years, even though I improved myself, my self-esteem *massively* dipped to the point I needed therapy. I blamed every failure on myself, and expected myself to do all the work without ever needing supervision. Poor self esteem impacts progress immensely. And I saw my supervisor once / 6 weeks, with really unproductive meetings. One day, having discussed + compared my PhD experiences to other PhD friends, I realised that my complete lack of tangible supervision was not normal. So I sat down my supervisor and I asked him firmly to change our structure. I made it very clear that I was unhappy with my progress and needed more supervision. Thus, we went from shit meetings once / 6 weeks --> productive meetings (with minutes) / 2 weeks. It helped my confidence immensely, and the added structure was really welcome in my life.\n* **Taking a risk and revamping my plan**. As I said above, by end of year 2 / beginning of year 3, I fixed my work ethic, \"grew a spine\", and had better supervision. But the work still wasn't going anywhere. Remember, up until the end of year 2 I was barely supervised, so even if supervision was better, I lost a lot of time already. I had a few good ideas, but nothing fit into a cohesive thesis. The end of year 3 approached and I still lacked tangible results. I needed an extension and my supervisor said he could give it, if I could show -- with a concrete plan -- that I could finish *everything* in 9 months, maximum. At this stage, I said fuck it -- I have nothing to lose, so I'm going in with a plan from scratch. I always found my supervisor's ideas too hazy, not concrete enough, too vague, and way too similar to what people have already done. Armed with 3 years of tools, datasets, and semi-useful (but not thesis-worthy) results, I spent a month writing a 3-page plan, complete with a Gantt chart of the weekly tasks to do until Month 9 of the extension. I showed my plan to everyone who was a PhD student and/or graduate and it was very well received.\n\nFrom there, everything really clicked. I had such a meticulously-written plan that the ideas were extremely clear and I never felt aimless. I'd solidified a good independent work ethic by now, and I \"fixed\" the previously-broken communication with my supervisor. I'll never forget a meeting we had last October, when we met and I felt like I wasn't desperate for his approval and guidance. I guided our conversation and I showed so much conviction in my ideas; I finally had *my* work, and didn't really need his input.\n\nThe one caveat is that, even though it's finished, I think a lot of people think my work is a bit... basic? I guess. But honestly, considering the circumstances, I don't even care! The main thing is that it's done, and there's a clear \"red thread\" that runs through my work.",

Mine were the following, of which some will seem obvious but for me weren\u2019t (oops). \n\nOne, lists. I kept a virtual and physical notebook where I would write down 3-7 bullet points every day of stuff to do, crossing them out as I went along. This included non-thesis stuff for those slow days- sometimes all you need to get started is a few easy tasks and the productivity comes shortly after.\n\nTwo, stop comparing yourself to other people (including non-academics) and accept that the workflow in academia isn\u2019t always so rigid. You really don\u2019t need to be the 9-5 person, research doesn\u2019t have to play by \u2018the rules\u2019. And on some days it\u2019s really about quality, not quantity. I had days where I felt focused, and 1.5 hours of brainstorming lead to big progress. I also had days from 7-7 and felt like no progress was made. You don\u2019t *need* to do 6+ hours of hard academic work. It\u2019s mentally taxing. \n\nThree, for the sake of keeping yourself busy and not getting too complacent, I found it helpful to split up my days into mentally-demanding and non-demanding periods. For example: if I spent the morning reading and taking notes from two papers \u2014 properly, from back to front \u2014 I\u2019d spend the afternoon cleaning up my folders, moving data around, fixing a plot, etc. \n\nFour, activity. I took 15-30 min walks near my department every day to clear my head and collect my thoughts. Otherwise, getting out of my chair and knocking on a colleague\u2019s door to quickly discuss something also gave me bursts of energy. \n\nLast thing you need to figure out is if you need deadlines or external pressure. If you don\u2019t have regular meetings with your supervisor, or bimonthly presentations, or conferences coming up, having no deadlines can lead to aimless days. In these quieter periods, a good way to give yourself a deadline is to arrange meetings with colleagues. The best way to brainstorm your work with them is to actually show up with notes, figures, papers, etc. \n\nHope that helps!",

Also can just help improve an already great life.",

However I have one caveat about your post. \n\nComplete lack of supervision IS normal for a lot of PhD students. \n\nHowever you did the right thing by demanding a turnaround from your advisor, and your advisor seems like someone solid enough to take that to heart. Not all advisors are so receptive to being challenged. Some can be outright toxic. \n\nI mostly say this as a reminder for other students that grad school is like a business in a lot of ways. Sometimes you need to manage your own bosses shortcomings in order to survive. Something you did extremely well, so well it almost feels like an outlier.",
