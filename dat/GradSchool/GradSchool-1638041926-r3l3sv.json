  "text": "I\u2019m applying to a PhD program and emailed the professor I\u2019m interested in working with about a month ago. I haven\u2019t heard back and am a pretty concerned about my admissions chances. I know they get a lot of emails from potential students so the probably don\u2019t have time to respond to everyone, but should I still be hesitant about applying?",

      "text": "Not hearing back from a professor shouldn\u2019t deter you from applying. Sure, it\u2019s nice to get a reply, but your email probably just got lost in their inbox. You can always send a brief follow-up email if you want, but generally their priority is with their own current students or students that are already in the program and looking for an advisor, so they might miss emails from prospective students.",
