  "text": "Please do not berate me for going to a for-profit school. I was young and dumb. I was the prey. I had a great GPA... I mean who wouldn't at a for-profit. I have no options for another bachelors. \n\nAt least my school was Regionally Accredited. Any chance of me getting into a Master's Program for any Management, Human Resources or Business at a NON-PROFIT?\n\nI am military if it helps. Thanks for any insight.",
