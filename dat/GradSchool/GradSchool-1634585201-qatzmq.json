  "text": "I hope this kind of post is allowed. I am a PhD student at the National School of Engineers of Brest (ENIB) which is a member of Lab-STICC, a French research laboratory. I really need more responses to a survey I am conducting. We are exploring how people perceive speech coming from an emergency room leader to understand how speech affects perception of authority and how that perception affects behavior. The survey consists of thirty-three sentences that participants evaluate four times according to a short scenario.\n\nThe survey should take 10-15 minutes. If you enter your email address (which is totally optional and no personal details are collected), you will be entered to win one of five \u20ac10 prizes (winners will receive an email to find out how they would like to receive their money).\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco-ukLpAFYxkU4rQnmXSk3hRwmr38GeAqI\\_D8md\\_\\_-aeQQRg/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco-ukLpAFYxkU4rQnmXSk3hRwmr38GeAqI_D8md__-aeQQRg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nI really need more native and high-level English speakers to participate, so every response counts. Thanks!",
