  "title:": "Looking for Advice in Undergrad for PsyD Program",
  "text": "So I am currently a student at Tulane University who recently transferred from a community college. I received an associates degree in liberal arts with a 3.6 gpa and am now getting my BS in Psych, atm I have a 3.8 gpa. I am a junior but will have to attend here for 2.5 years due to the fact that not all of my credits transferred. I am planning on joining clubs but unfortunately I have no experience in the field of psych yet. Also, no research experience until at best this Spring semester of my junior year. \n\nI wanted to ask if anyone has advice as to what I should be doing now in undergrad to best build up my application for a PsyD program. My plan after graduating with my Bachelors is to volunteer in Israel for a few months before beginning a clinical psych program in Fall 2024. When should I take my GRE? Also any advice for getting research experience/other things I could do to build my application? How important is research experience when applying to a PsyD instead of PhD? \n\nThank you!",
