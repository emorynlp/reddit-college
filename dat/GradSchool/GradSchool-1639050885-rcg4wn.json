  "text": "Hi!\n\nExcuse my lack of information on everything. I'm from Europe and I'm doing grad school abroad in another country in Europe. I don't have any friends who went to grad school anywhere ever so I literally don't know anything about grad school. I'm not going to give out any specific info because I am terrified that my professor or someone from my tiny cohort will find this and figure out it's me. \n\nI studied law before and it was a really hard degree. Often I had to study 8 hours a day (with breaks of course), even 10 hours in exam season and my grades weren't perfect or anything. A lot of people dropped out or failed classes constantly throughout the years. Professors were really hard on us.\n\nNow, in grad school I am finding the whole thing very... easy, I guess? So easy that it is making me anxious. It has me really worried that I am not doing enough or I am not understanding the assignments properly. My professor seems really uninterested in anything we have to say. It's a taught degree and we have 2 very short online lectures (most of the time less than an hour and they are recorded, not live) and 2 tutorials per week. We have at most 200 pages of reading in total per week, but often not even that, and some questions to answer from the reading (like 10 questions at most and they are not difficult ones, you can easily find the answers in the textbook, you don't even need to think at all). Then, in the tutorials, he just puts us in groups and makes us answer those questions that he assigned for home and he doesn't even give opinions on the answers or explanations or anything. I understand that grad school involves a lot of independent learning but there is almost zero teaching involved.\n\nThis wouldn't be that much of a problem, but the complete lack of interest on my professor's part is terrifying. He assigns an essay that's 40% of our grade, asks for an outline of it, sets up meetings with us to talk about that outline. Before my meeting, I sent him an e-mail asking whether the meetings will be online or in person because he didn't mention. He didn't reply to my e-mail. When I showed up to the meeting, it was obvious that he didn't read the outline at all. He literally read the title in the meeting and then gave me some reading to do that would be helpful. I told him about the e-mail and he goes 'yeah, i think i read something like that' almost smirking.\n\nThen he says send me a draft of the essay and I will send you feedback on it. This was 2 weeks ago and me and some colleagues did not get any feedback on it, the deadline is in a week and I have no idea what to change about the draft because I have never written this type of essay before. He keeps saying everytime in class that he will send us the feedback. I was supposed to have another meeting with him to talk about the essay 2 days ago and I thought oh finally I'm gonna get feedback. He says in the tutorial before that meeting that he has to postpone my meeting and 2 other peoples'. One guy who did not attend the tutorial didn't even get the memo so he just went to the professor's office and waited for the professor for like 2 hours until someone told him the professor went home. \n\nYesterday, he posted saying that all meetings have moved online and we should access the link at the time we were allotted, but I was never told when my meeting would be since it was postponed, so I sent him an e-mail again, no response of course. Now for the last 2 classes he was explaining about the next essays we have to write, what they are, how they should be written, asking for outlines again. \n\nI also feel like an outline takes me like 2 hours to make tops, especially because he doesn't even seem to read them. I don't necessarily enjoy this type of work where this week I send you the outline, next week a draft and 2 weeks later the whole essay. I like to set out time to work and get down to it and write the whole essay basically. At the same time, I am scared to start writing the whole essay because I have zero feedback on outlines, drafts, anything I send him so what if I write a 5000 word essay and it is completely wrong.\n\nHe also doesn't give clear answers to any question you ask, so as an international student everything is 10 times harder because it's not my first language AND he isn't clear about anything. Basically I feel like there's very little teaching, very little work that I have to do and almost zero interest from the professor. I paid a lot of money to go to grad school in another country, put myself in debt and now my grades might be shit because this professor doesn't care at all.",

      "text": "Is this professor your advisor? Or just a class you\u2019re taking? Because no, that\u2019s not normal, and grad school is more like how you described studying law but worse depending if you\u2019re getting your Masters or PhD. It sounds like you just have the terrible luck of getting a real shit of a professor your first semester.",

He will be my advisor once I start writing my dissertation.\n\nProblem is because he is going to be my advisor I have him until I graduate basically.",

      "text": "This is interesting, I\u2019ve heard quite the opposite from people that have done both a PhD and a professional degree. Even in the program I\u2019m at right now there\u2019s a student that is now getting her JD after completing the PhD and she says that the latter was more challenging not only because your doing both classes and research at the same time, but also because you\u2019re working on something no one has ever worked before so you have to guide yourself through the problems you\u2019re exploring. She has told me that in her JD is like being in grad school but without having to do the research which just makes the process more manageable. However, I guess this is going to be very dependent on the program you\u2019re working at. It sounds like you\u2019re only taking two classes with a very unhelpful professor, which has never been the experience of the people around me.",

          "text": "Yeah, but even if you would take the research out, the classes that I take are easy and pointless I feel? The reading that is assigned is pretty easy, the questions are easy, we do them as a group anyway and we never get feedback on them. I feel like I'm in primary school. \n\nI'm also someone who knows exactly what I want to research and I already found quite a few resources, I know what I'm gonna write for almost all of the assignments and my dissertation as well. The problem is with no feedback from the professor I have no idea what he wants so I could do it in a way that he absolutely hates. \n\nI genuinely don't understand him at all. Like he said he can't see too much of the draft or comment on it too much because then when time comes to grade, he will have read all of it before as a draft. So what's the point of asking for a draft then? If he wanted to say 'I don't want to tell you exactly what to do, you have to figure it out.' he would have said that. This way, it sounds like an excuse to just skim our drafts and not actually read them/give feedback on them properly.",

      "text": "Uh. He just sounds insanely lazy.\nI'm not an expert on grad school, just doing my own masters, but I have a feeling it's usually quite intense regardless of your area. I did a BA for my undergrad, which was much easier workload wise than my friends who did, say, law or engineering. But master level is something else and there's literally no end to how much you feel you need to study in order to fully grasp the concepts. (I'm in humanities.)\n\nAs for feedback on essays. Eh yes, that's the point. You write a draft, you get feedback and then you improve it and hand it in. I believe it's called teaching / learning...\n\nI would contact the head office at the faculty and ask for a meeting. Are any of the other students experiencing this?\n\nI work at a university, in a non-academic role, and my experience is that the faculty directors etc take it very seriously when lecturers are useless. I don't know what it's like where you live, but where I live, universities get rewarded based on the amount of students who complete their degree. It's in their interest to make sure students don't drop out, so they need and want information about faculty who don't perform well. Because this increases the risk of students dropping out. (In addition to it being unprofessional, of course. But it's no longer like it probably was before, when professors were kings amd could pretty much get away with murder.)",

          "text": "Yeah, others experience the lack of feedback too. To be honest, from what I am seeing, most people in my cohort are thrilled with the tiny amount of workload because they work and have other responsibilities so they don't seem to have as many problems with it as I am. I'm happy that I have free time as well but I am just worried I am not learning enough and because of the lack of feedback, my grades are going to be shit. I'm thinking I will request a meeting with someone if I get no feedback, submit my assignment and my grades are poor. Then I'll have solid proof that I asked for feedback multiple times and the poor grade.",
