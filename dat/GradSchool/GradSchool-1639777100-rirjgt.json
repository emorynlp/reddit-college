              "text": "Ah, ours is pretty much the opposite!\n\nWe're allowed to tutor (called \"supervising\" here) or maybe help with undergrad labs, if we have permission from our PI and it doesn't go over 10 hours a week maximum.\n\nBut we cannot hold any job outside of the university/department (ever) and we can't hold any job *inside* the university without our PIs permission. If they discover you've broken the rules, they can withhold all assistance. If you ever ask for help or an extension or anything like that, they'll refuse because it's your fault for holding a job. They don't usually go nuclear and expel people, but they'll definitely make your life hell. And it's a university town and you're not allowed to live more than 10 miles from the centre, so the chances of holding a separate job and not being caught are pretty low.",

In my physics program everyone has either a TA or an RA appointment that covers tuition & classes and provides health care and a livable stipend (we basically get paid to learn) and we need special permission to take on another job (and idk anyone that's gotten another job; between research and classes/studying there's not really time to take on more responsibility).",
