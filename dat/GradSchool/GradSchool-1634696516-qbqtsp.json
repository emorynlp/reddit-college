  "title:": "Finished graduate studies, want no relationship with advisors, should I continue to assist with publications?",
  "text": "My former advisors for my master's degree were absolutely awful to me. I want nothing to do with them anymore. I don't want to publish my thesis or continue working on anything else with them.\n\nI've remained friendly, respectful and professional so that we could finish my thesis and I could graduate ASAP, but now that I'm done, they're operating under the expectation that I'm going to help get my thesis results published (while working at a new job, no longer in the program).\n\nAnother publication or two would be fine for CV purposes, but I have a job now and I don't have any interest in academia or graduate studies anymore. So while I'm not against getting my name on papers, continuing to work with my advisors is unappealing.\n\nLegally, can they publish the data without me? I honestly don't care if they use my data, as long as I don't have to work with them anymore.\n\nAlso, since I'm done the program I just don't see the motivation to continue working for them uncompensated. I really want to move on with my life and leave this behind.\n\nCan anyone relate? What's the most professional way I can tell them I'm not interested in writing papers, if such a thing can even be done without conflict.",

      "text": "If you really don't want to actively publish with them I would at least write up your experimental for the things they would want to publish and give them all the data in an easy to access form (give them raw and processed data that is easy to tell where it came from with good labeling etc) and explain that you don't have time to publish it but you wanted to make sure they could if they wanted to. This way you have made it easy for them to publish without them hopefully ever talking to you again. it gives you the chance to not burn that bridge completely and gives you the chance to have more for the resume.",

      "text": "I don't know your country - but here in the US I was told that all my data is owned by my PI and the University. So yes, they can use any datasets you produced. You likely should still be listed as a coauthor on any resulting publications, but unfortunately the enforcement of that often depends on the journal and institution. \n\nIf you think you can do a small amount of work and they'll be satisfied then I'd probably just do it. If you think they'll just keep pushing and taking advantage then you can either explain that you don't have the time to continue or you can just ghost them. \n\nIf I was in your shoes I'd do the minimum possible and then say I'm willing to talk with whoever picks up the work in the future.",
