So far I\u2019ve handed in all of the homework assignments, but we have a paper due this week and I\u2019m wondering if it would be frowned upon to skip out on the larger assignments even though I\u2019ve handed in homework.",

It just depends on the instructor.",

Instructors are happy to just see you participating in class.\n\nBased on that experience, I would think it's fine to skip the paper. Nothing bad would come out of skipping the assignment, right?",
