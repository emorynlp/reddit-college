  "text": "I have been working and studying as a post graduate both full time since October 2019. It is supposed to last two semesters for courses and one or two for thesis.\n\nThe first winter semester, i failed two courses. One of them was because i didn't submit a paper on time. Tried negotiating this but couldn't extend the period to submit it. I passed all spring semester courses that year.\n\nI passed 1/2 of those courses at winter semester 2020. Due to my mental health problems flaring up, couldn't handle both then. I also started writing the code for my thesis application (it is a computer science postgraduate program)\n\nTwo days ago i learnt that there is a rule that students who fail to fulfill all their academic requirements (namely pass all the courses and complete their thesis) by end of fifth semester, they automatically get eliminated from postgraduate program. No one had informed us about that rule when applying.\n\nCurrently i am beginning my fifth semester. I just finished the implementation of the thesis application. So i still need to write the paper for my thesis, and pass a course (which consists of an exam and a semester assignment, usually a paper). I still work full time (have no other choice on that as i am practically disowned from my family so i really have to pay my way). Do i have any chances to complete all these by end of semester? If yes, what would be a good study schedule to follow, provided that i also work Mon-Fri 9-5? I feel so overwhelmed by anxiety, i can't do anything currently. How should i handle this?",

      "text": "> I just finished the implementation of the thesis application. \n\nCongratulations! That\u2019s an accomplishment and we don\u2019t celebrate those enough in academic research.\n\n> So i still need to write the paper for my thesis, and pass a course (which consists of an exam and a semester assignment, usually a paper).\n\nThis is definitely doable in a semester. In my Master\u2019s, I wrote my thesis (only about 30 pages; I know some are much longer) while taking multiple courses (each with a capstone research paper) in one semester. But I was a fulltime student with no additional responsibilities. It\u2019s definitely going to be a difficult few months, but again I do think it\u2019s doable. \n\nSome suggestions\u2026 You\u2019ll need to make sure work isn\u2019t taking up any more time and energy than absolutely necessary, so that your best efforts are directed toward your studies. Realistically, you won\u2019t have any time for a social life, though you should definitely reach out and check in with people, so you don\u2019t become isolated from those who support you and add meaning to your life. Maybe you could create a writing group with other people in your school or program writing their theses. Some schools even facilitate these groups through writing centers or the like. Having support and not feeling alone in this can be so helpful.\n\nA final thought: just finding out two days ago that you have to finish *this* semester, if you weren\u2019t necessarily planning for that, is a really bitter pill to swallow. You might talk to advisors or admins about how strict this policy is and whether there\u2019s any flexibility. You also could consider \u2014 if you\u2019re very much struggling to manage this amount of work while also holding down a fulltime job \u2014 taking a leave from the program this semester and resuming next semester. If that\u2019s possible in your program, it would buy you a few months to keep writing at your own pace, then you can take the course and submit the thesis next semester, now your new \u201cfifth semester.\u201d But if that\u2019s not possible or something you want to pursue, I have faith you can finish the work you need to. But rally support from advisors, other thesis-writers, and perhaps writing coaches or your school\u2019s writing center.",

          "text": "Thank you for your encouraging words! You really gave me some encouragement to keep on going, and a realistic view that i shouldn't let my anxiety consume me and i can actually do it!\n\nTruth is i find the policy strict indeed, but the grad program offers two circles, \"full time\" and \"part time\". Only full time has that policy, as it is supposed to be for non working people. Part time circle though offers only 5 places each year, so people with many years of working experience on Computer Science field get them each year. I had only 1 year of experience when i applied, and was on a more flexible full time working position back then. I was laid off because of project redundancies 3 months in the program. Therefore i had to take a job with more strict workload. All of my fellow students were full time students indeed. \n\nProfessors know that i work full time. They don't know my family situation but they know i try to combine both. Some have helped me with that, by only asking for the paper assignment and not for the extra, smaller assignments. I will be forever grateful to them. \n\nSadly i cannot pause the program right now. This course can only be examined at Winter semester, and program doesn't allow two consecutive \"vacation\" semesters. So i have no choice but to finish this semester.\n\nMaybe i will talk to professor of the course i have left and explain the situation. Maybe he will help me a bit by not requiring the exam (i passed the exam part when i first took the course but failed the assignment part). If not, well i know the material already, it just needs a good brush up. I will dedicate a month on the paper and i think it will be ok. The paper for the thesis should take me about two months, as i have already analyzed the maths behind the algorithm and i just need some theory to fill in the paper. \n\nAgain your comment made me see the situation more clearly. So i owe you a big thank you!",
