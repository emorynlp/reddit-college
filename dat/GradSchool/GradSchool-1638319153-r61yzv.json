      "text": "In the U.S., adjuncts at universities are not usually paid well (or given benefits, or long-term contracts) because the position is not intended to be a full career. It's intended as a side hustle for industry workers. An adjunct position at a university isn't something I'd recommend anyone plan to do full-time.\n\nIs it the same at community colleges? Or are they more stable positions? Have you looked into the pay scales yet at a few places?",

              "text": "Yeah, in my field (physics), $3000-4000 per class is normal, and 4 classes per term (3 terms/year) is the upper limit of manageable. Some schools restrict how many courses they'll give you (so you don't earn benefits) and you have to get a few classes at one school and a few at another.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend you dive into the math to see how viable an option it is for you. Probably depends on your desired lifestyle and how much you enjoy focusing exclusively on teaching.",

          "text": "Exactly this.\n\nI'm in cyber security, I have taught as an adjunct on the side for years (community colleges and a 4 year university). I work for a Fortune 500 company full time. It's much better in my opinion to have adjuncts for rapidly evolving areas, sometimes academia is very disconnected and it doesn't set the students up for success.\n\nThey post them like any other job, but I had to interview and then give a short lecture for them to evaluate. \n\nI pick up online sections of intro classes, there are always plenty and more senior teachers get tired of them year after year. It's easy for me to run a few sections at a time when the assignments are the same and the courses are prebuilt (mostly). If there is an evening class they need me to teach my day job is fine with me moving my schedule around to accommodate (back when we were in person).\n\nIt's 2500 per class after tax in the Midwest, my previous college on the east coast was more like 3500/4k. Not enough to live on, but a nice addition for me to shove into my IRA or fix up the house. The limit is 9 classes a year (but if they are pressed to run a class in a specialty you have, they will make acceptions).\n\nSchools are all different in working culture and approach to education. Some focus on hands on skills, others academic. Some give you standardized courses with no set up (or flexibility), others expect you to build everything each semester. \n\nYou could call up a local community college and chat with the dean for your specialty area. They are usually happy to talk about opportunities, as adjuncts in some disciplines are hard to find. If they don't have a position they probably know another local school that does.",
