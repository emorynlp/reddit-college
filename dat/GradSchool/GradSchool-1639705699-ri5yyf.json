What plans should I make? Or is relaxing the \"plan\"?\n\nDo you have any exciting ideas to unwind? I'd love the inspiration.",

      "text": "I\u2019ll be taking two weeks off and not doing anything particularly exciting. I find making a few plans helps a lot to avoid defaulting back to thinking about work. I\u2019ll be reading some books I\u2019ve picked out, figuring out how to bake macarons, playing board games, and sketching stuff. Going for some hikes. Maybe I\u2019ll re-watch one of my favorite TV series! Looking forward to seeing what other grad students will be up to :)",

We'll probably hang around the beach, watch some movies, play some games, and eat some good food at the town. I'm not used to this style of rest and relaxation, usually my vacations are spent exploring a busy new city so it's definitely a change for me",

      "text": "I\u2019ll be playing copious amounts of Halo with the family, watching silly movies, going for long walks/hikes, reading some books, and soaking in the feeling of having absolutely no school-related obligations until I go back in the new year. Oh, also big breakfasts, every single day, since I\u2019ll have nowhere to rush to in the morning. So nothing exciting per se, just the small things I didn\u2019t get enough of during the semester.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for ideas, what do you like doing? What helps you unwind? What have you been wanting to do/try, but didn\u2019t have the time before? Maybe you can do some of those things. Or maybe not; in the end the only necessities are eating, sleeping, staying hydrated, moving your body, and getting some sunlight.\n\nI would also say, take as much time off as you can. Four days isn\u2019t a lot of time to truly unwind.",
