My weakness right now is conveying my experience and interest clearly because Im not used to it.\n\nI can run experiments independently at this point and am preparing a first author pub. But presenting things succinctly and being in interviews is not my strong point even when Ive read the faculty members papers and see how we relate and what I could contribute. I become nervous even thinking about it.",
