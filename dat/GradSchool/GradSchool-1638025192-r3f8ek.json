  "title:": "Personal life imploding a bit, considering PhD -> Masters.",
  "text": "I came on this summer as a PhD student (first-time grad student), working on a project I was really excited about and had/have a lot of interest in. I had thought a bit about a PhD before, and project was marketed as PhD, so I went for it. Bonus was that school is close to my parents; I had lived away for a bit and don\u2019t plan on being close after school, so this was a good way to spend quality time with family. \n\nSince then, a lot has changed; some to do with school (advisor left my school and the project, though project is still moving forward with a new advisor, also the co-PI has left for another institution but will still be managing the project), but big thing is that my parents are going through an unexpected and extremely messy divorce (like reevaluation of childhood messy). I found out a week before I started and it\u2019s just been chaotic since then. I\u2019m doing fine enough with classes, but this semester I have pretty much been on autopilot, just getting through the day. Keeping up on research, along with TAing, has been a lot.\n\nAll this to basically say that I have zero desire right now to get through a PhD. Parents divorce is ever-present, and I just can\u2019t imagine having the energy to get the PhD done while I\u2019m here. I wanna get my masters and get TF out, especially considering I still have a lot of interest in masters-level work in my field.\n\nAnyone else have experience with life-altering events early on in grad school that made them want to switch PhD to masters? How did you go about it with your advisor? I definitely don\u2019t want to get overly-personal, but I\u2019d also want to make clear that any decision to leave early has to do with what I have going on and not the program.",

It\u2019s a struggle, but the inertia of getting through to a masters is real, especially since I moved across the U.S. specifically for grad school. But it\u2019s definitely something to consider.",

              "text": "Understand.\n\nBut a semester off to work with a counselor on what you're experiencing with your parents divorce. While also making sure you're eating right, sleeping right, and getting plenty of exercise, might help you to turn the corner. For the very least, it's more time to gain clarity if leaving with just a master's is the right thing to do.",

The book talks about the apprentice master relationship and how important that is, you are currently an apprentice with your advisor, that relationship at its best should not be detached, you should be able to have a real deep emotional relationship with them.",

      "text": "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re dealing with all of this at the beginning of your studies. In my experience, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to feel fully engaged in graduate school when there is emotional processing to do, and I empathize with feeling like you\u2019re going through the motions right now. It definitely can make studies feel stressful rather than fulfilling. I am personally grateful I gave myself the patience and time to go through an emotional processing period, which involved essentially a summer away from work to spend time with my family. On the other side, I feel present, more confident, excited and focused on my learning. This is all to say that feeling disconnected from graduate school happens and is not abnormal at all. Take some time to process, be gentle with yourself and spend some time asking yourself what you really want and need from your education and you can\u2019t go wrong.",

If you can\u2019t get a good answer to yourself, I would just take a semester off so that I can do that re-evaluation. Additionally, you should see if the co-pi can help you transfer over the new institution or if you still want to stay, then you should talk to them and ask for advice. As with other suggestions, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to make any important decisions when you are very stressed. Take care!",
