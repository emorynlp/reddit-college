      "text": "I love this joke.\n\nIt reminds me of my very first Physics teacher. I started at a Junior college and he had been a NASA Scientist for awhile before retiring. He told me I would never make it in Physics and that I was a horrible student.\n\nHe was right about one thing.. I was a horrible student.... but he was wrong when he assumed I wouldn't make it in Physics. He was so arrogant.\n\nNow I am almost done with my degrees. I would say \"that will show him\" but honestly I couldn't care less what he thinks. I didn't value his opinion then and I don't now. His criticism didn't deter me.\n\n\nNote to anyone else: If someone provides you criticism, take it. Then dissect it, find anything of value or importance, and throw the rest away. If the criticism was constructive, try to take your emotions out of it and utilize the lessons there. If their criticism is not constructive, ignore them, your actions will prove your merit. There will be people who are so full of themselves and so arrogant that they believe themselves to be the gatekeepers of their field. However, as much as they believe themselves to be gatekeepers, you can just walk right past them and leave them in the dust.",
