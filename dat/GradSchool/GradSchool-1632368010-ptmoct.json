  "text": "After submitting the piece in January 2020, getting an R&R April 2020, returning it in May 2020 , getting the formal acceptance in November 2020, and then making the final edits in August 2021, my very first journal article has finally come out.\n\nIt's super exciting to have an actual citable thing out there in the world now, especially because it all started just from some positive feedback on a course paper in my second semester of my (first) master's degree.\n\nI'm also pumped because it's exactly where I wanted it to be and that journal is not only good but open access, so no paywalls for sharing the work.\n\nFeels good.",

The journal is an annual publication that usually comes out in the summer, but COVID pushed last year's edition back and that, in turn, pushed the organizational processes for this year back too. Hopefully they'll actually catch back up to the normal production schedule at some point.",

Specifically what's the purpose of the paper, purpose of the journal, reviewers, editors, how controversial, the field, etc.  \n\nThere was a paper that took 1.5 years to publish by a famous professor in my field but he had some external factors at play.  But it happens every now and then that it's not \"insane\" to hear that it took 1.5 years to publish a paper.  On the other side of the coin, a colleague of mine published his paper with minimal revisions within a month.  But all of these scenarios happen more than \"rarely\".",
