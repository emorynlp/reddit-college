  "title:": "Final semester of my Master's - Feeling super burnt out",
  "text": "So, the title kind of says it all. I'm in the last semester of my masters (I can literally see the finish line, I'm so close) but I'm also very burnt out (most of my degree happened over COVID). Because I'm working on a thesis-based masters coming directly from my bachelors (same university), I have all sorts of paperwork to fill out regarding graduation, defending my thesis, publishing, transfer credits, etc. etc. etc. I don't really have any desire to stop, but I'm debating on dropping back to part time while I finish the last little bit of work (frankly, I'm broke). But I'm worried that if I start working, I just won't finish my degree. Is this sort of endgame burnout normal? When I finished my bachelors, it was during the first months of COVID, so I just wrote off any anxiety as pandemic-related stress, but now I'm wondering if it's stress from burnout?",

Try to incentivize yourself to finish.  Like take it day-by-day.  \"If I finish this section this week then this weekend I'll take it off and go hiking\".  etc.",
