  "title:": "Is anyone else tired of living with roommates?",
  "text": "I know a pandemic caused roommate situations that no one really signed up for, but man I'm tired. I'm tried to the passive aggression from a long string of roommates. You know, the sort of people that you try to compromise with but they always seem to get the better end of the deal. \n\nThe lack of options, at least in my area, is also frustrating. I'm in a college town and have a pet. Because of that, rents are almost as high as a proper city and places that allow pets are either literally in shambles or 70% of my income if I want a one bedroom.  \n\nMaybe I would feel a bit less frustrated if there was an end in sight, but I'm only a third year, and I suspect this pandemic will make working from home way more common.  At least for 2021. Which means more roommate conflict.\n\nHow have you all managed to get through this? Did you just bite the bullet and spend most of your stipend on rent?",

My preference was actually for having roommates but was allocated a single bedroom apartment. At first it was a bit lonely, but I quickly realised I had heaps of friends around and having a sense of complete dominion over a space that it truly my own is something I've come to enjoy. I would say bite the extra cost for the benefits if you are sick of roommates.",

Not for everyone, but it was a delight for student me.  I joined a meal co-op on campus, but also sometimes cooked in the camper.  Rent expenses went from like 60% of my income to like 10%.  I used the extra to buy a laptop, tinker with solar electricity (panels were a lot more expensive then), and even go backpacking around Europe.  I got used to using the gym to shower.\n\nWouldn't do it now that I'm older, live in a place that gets quite cold (Colorado), and have a family -- but it was the perfect solution living in a mild climate (San Francisco area) at that time in my life.",

My desk was in my room, and spending the whole day in my bedroom was depressing.. Our lease was up in July and I moved to a 1bdrm, I pay about 70% of my income on rent, but I make it work. My mental health has been so much better. Even in the case that when I'm feeling depressed There is nobody else in my space, and my depression mess isn't bothering anyone else but myself.\nIf you can make it work I would try to find a 1 bedroom!!

Eventually I developed ways to wean myself off of leaving kitchen or living room lights on. \n\nIn the end, I just got a dim night light (sounds lame but I dare anyone to tell a woman who lives alone that her coping mechanisms are lame) and fell asleep with Netflix or Hulu on playing really quietly in the background. \n\nI totaled four months living alone. I\u2019d do it again, and all worked out fine. I finally began to feel safe. But having a roommate again, I don\u2019t think anything beats knowing there is someone else there, especially at night. \n\nI agree with the above commenter that it helps being alone in an apartment complex because there\u2019s still people above you and in the hallways.

Well, I always have, I guess, but it was a mess and I'd work up at the University instead. \n\nWhen everything happened, I learned at some point over the summer that I needed that office since the school was no longer available. So I went in there, cleaned it up, got a second bookshelf to get textbooks off my desk, and I found myself in some semblance of normalcy.\n\nThen a few weeks later, a friend from undergrad contacted me, said he needed to get out of his state with everything going on, and I took him in under the impression he'd be out in a few months time (he said he could find somewhere in a month, I said he could have a little longer if need be). Half a week later, I had made up the futon in my office and he had traveled cross-country, moving out of his parents' place (he'd quarantined in their RV for several months and got frequent tests).\n\nAs soon as he got up here, though, reality set in and he said he didn't want to sign a lease without knowing what he was going to do. I understood and said it was fine, but winter would probably be crowded.\n\nA semester full of aggravations, miscommunications, and asking myself, \"Am I the jerk in this situation?\" later, he's still here but is looking to move out in a month, as per my request.\n\nIt's been nice having someone to pay half of everything in the meantime, but I really prefer my space. I can't focus in the living room or the kitchen, and I'm in the middle of my thesis right now. I need focus. I can get classwork done without an issue, but research is a different matter.\n\nBesides, I don't see much difference between now and before, but I'm pretty frugal by nature. I cook my own meals, I tend to use blankets or open windows/doors for temperature maintenance, and I really don't splurge on myself too often. Of course, your mileage may vary.\n\nThe pets certainly make things more difficult, but I do have caged pets that were approved despite my apartment's typical policy, so it may be worth asking places even if their policy says otherwise. Cats and dogs may be a little harder to get in, but if your pet is caged, you may have a shot.\n\nIn any case, good luck, OP, and hopefully you figure out what's best for you, both financially and mentally!",

I think maybe this is  because of the perception that if you have a house then *clearly* you are partnered or related to the other people living there. This isn't true, obviously, but I'm in a fairly rural area where that is still more the norm.",

At first, I wanted to live alone after two years of living with four other people. However, now I wouldn't mind having another roommate or two when I look for an apartment next year.\n\nMaybe you just have to look harder for compatible roommates. Maybe someone in your cohort?",

In my opinion, the pros outweighed the cons (the only con was cost) and my mental health has fared much better than ever before.

To top it off, he was a master gaslighter and made me feel like that bug infestation was not a \u201cbig deal.\u201d Moving to a one bedroom, while forgoing most of my paycheck, was still the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.
