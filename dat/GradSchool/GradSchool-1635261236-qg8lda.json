  "title:": "Would not teaching be likely to affect my chances of getting into a postdoc position?",
  "text": "Currently doing a PhD. I haven't been able to teach yet, although I keep asking about it. My suspicion is that some subtleties of my personality are to blame (I have autism and certain things like smiling don't come naturally to me). This is because I have a few articles and I've almost completed my thesis, so there's really no other reason that I couldn't teach. I don't mean to compare myself with other PhD candidates, but none of them have as many articles as I do, and my supervisor constantly praises my work. I have also done marking, lectures, and quite a few conferences which would suggest that I could cope with teaching a class.\n\nShould I be worried about this? I'm not sure if I should confront my supervisor about it. Worst part of this all is I just plain want to take some tutorials, career be damned. It feels like I am missing out on part of the phd experience.",
