  "text": "A few weeks ago, the director of my program forwarded a fellowship posting to all of the PhD students. I fit the requirements, and it would be a great funding and career opportunity if I got it. I forwarded the posting to my advisor, who wasn't very supportive of me applying for the fellowship because the organization behind it mainly worked in a different field. However, I had scoured their website and realized that a lot of their publications and briefings were not that far from what my research interest is. I let my advisor know this and he (apathetically) agreed to write a recommendation letter for me.\n\nI knew that the chances of me getting this fellowship were low, but I thought that if I wrote my application the right way, the organization would see that my research was relevant to theirs, and that I could make a contribution to their work.\n\nToday, I found out that I received the fellowship.\n\nI wanted to share because in the last few years since I've been working with my advisor, I've struggled with deciding if it was okay for me to do what I thought was right, even if it meant disagreeing with him. Personally, I have a hard time questioning authority (thanks, mom and dad!) to the point that I often resign myself to following requests or suggestions that don't make sense. I'm really happy to have received this fellowship, not only because it's a great fellowship, but also because it taught me that I shouldn't limit myself/blindly follow others' opinions. And you shouldn't either! Apply for that program/fellowship/job posting that you've been eyeing but have been too nervous to because you, or someone else, thought that you wouldn't get it. You never know!",
