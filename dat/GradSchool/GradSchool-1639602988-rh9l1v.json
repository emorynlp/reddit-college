  "title:": "Winston Churchill suffered from imposter syndrome.",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently listening to to the audio version of Andrew Robert\u2019s biography of Winston Churchill. Based upon his account it seems that when Churchill was a young man, he suffered from imposter syndrome. He always felt like he was no good, or never good enough. Even though his school records demonstrate he did very well in school. \n\nI guess the point I\u2019m trying to make is, all great people often don\u2019t know how great they are.",

      "text": "I'd be wary of any account that claims to retroactively diagnose someone, and wouldn't do that myself either. Unprofessional and unacademic. Also, Churchill was responsible for some pretty horrendous stuff. But in terms of sheer, unmerciful ambition to gain and hold onto power, yeah, he did that. \n\nHistorical accounts, including actual quotes from Churchill, inform us that he believed he was destined for greatness rather than that he was just working super hard to fulfill a dream he didn't believe he could achieve. He had his insecurities just like any of us, but he certainly did not have the self-reflection or self-imposed limitation that your average grad student puts on themselves.",

      "text": "He was also anxious about public speaking. Which you would never know from listening to some of his speeches. \n\nOne trick he used was to write out his speeches in poetic form rather than paragraphs. So he would know where to pause. Never tried it myself, but it sounds like a great technique.",
