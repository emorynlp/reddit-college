  "title:": "[QUESTION] Incomplete just after submitting applications?",
  "text": "Ugh fuck. I'm going to have to take an incomplete on one of my classes this semester and I am freaking the fuck out about it. I have already submitted most of my applications with unofficial transcript that say nothing about my current grades. I am not terribly far behind on the class I'm incomplete on and it's not something in my major, it's for a certificate, but I really screwed the pooch and myself on it so that I had to take an incomplete. I don't know how incompletes work, so how quickly do you get a grade after turning in all your late work? Do grad schools know it's an incomplete after you get a letter grade? How much do they care? Please help, I'm seriously panicking. Thank you\n\nEdit: I guess it might be relevant to mention, I genuinely had an insanely busy semester and, not making excuses, it's not entirely my fault that it all played out how it did. For the majority of the semester, I literally did not have enough hours in the day to make everything fit, and this class just happened to get left out. I can explain it to any professors or schools who ask about it, but idk if ill even get a shot or if theyll care or believe me. Could someone tell me about this too? Thanks",

      "text": "Incomplete are reserved for cases just like this; any prof on an acceptance committee will know this. If you were slacking and just straight up not doing the work you\u2019d just get an F, but an I is for when a student is good but for some reason they can\u2019t quite finish the class. Like I said: it\u2019s only used for students who are otherwise in good standing. \n\nI took an I and the prof gave me a year to turn In the work. I\u2019ve been told that sometimes folks in my department will ask for an I for their term paper and finish it up over the break. Idk how common that is tho. \n\nSo, don\u2019t freak over having an I. Just do the work over the break. Grad schools should be understanding. If they aren\u2019t then that\u2019s actually a red flag",

              "text": "Sure! Once you get your worked turned in, the prof will grade it and then change your grade to what it would have been if you had done the work originally (that sounds snarky but it\u2019s the only way I can think to say it lol). So you won\u2019t end up with an actual I on your transcript",
