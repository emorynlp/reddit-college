  "title:": "First time seeking travel funding",
  "text": "I'm applying to a summer school being co-organized by a prof from my department, and the application asks about travel funding. (What other sources of funding do you have? How much will you need?)\n\nNow, I can apply for funding from my department (after asking my advisor), but I'm not sure what kind of success rate I should expect from that. I'm also not sure how I should estimate travel costs: there are multiple possible flights I could take with radically different prices (think $600 vs. $1200). I'm hoping that some of y'all with more experience can share your wisdom with me.",
