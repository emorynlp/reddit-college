  "text": "You know what grinds my gears. I've had a paper a few years back that hopped from journal to journal. The same phrases kept popping up. This is not novel enough. We know this already. We don't need to research this. \n\nI do a lot of replication work, replication with extensions, and meta-analysis. Though I'm thinking I'm going to have to stop, it's ridiculous what publishers and reviewers want. Science should be built on more replications!\n\nI peer review too, and there are tons of great papers out there that should be published but they aren't because of a variety of reasons from my co-reviewers or the editor. Most I disagree with and they are often highly nitpicky often times. I hate it when good science gets rejected.\n\nI also recently got one comment, different paper. This is too controversial. We think this is good research, and it should be published somewhere, but we don't want to do it. Everything is sound. etc.",

I know you're not necessarily soliciting advice here, but if I may be so bold as to offer some anyway?\n\nYou said that you often do meta-analysis or replication with extensions. Perhaps that exact work would be easier to publish and to please reviewers and editors alike with if you simply reframe it to focus less on what has already been done and more on what your work adds. You can (and should!) discuss the way that your work confirms or does not confirm prior work, but that should not be presented as the core contribution when writing titles, abstracts, and introductions unless confirming or not confirming this is a really big deal in itself.\n\nInstead of, for example,\n\n\"We performed an experiment according to the methodology laid out in So-and-so et al. Our results were in agreement with theirs, so we then went on to extend their approach by...\"\n\nWhat about,\n\n\"Building on the contributions of So-and-so et al., we explore the potential for extension of that methodology to a new domain, ...\"\n\nFraming is *super* important in pleasing reviewers, who often times are not giving the work their full attention and will judge you on the gist they get from skimming.\n\nEDIT: Typos",

I was one of the replication reviewers. I think it was published close to a decade ago now. I think the poster is frustrated that publishers who we know are the real enemies will favor novelty over any replication and that\u2019s what got the social sciences in such a mess that they have been trying to dig out of since then. The chase for something novel, when science happens in incremental steps, building on other people\u2019s work. And he/she is also correct that they also favor safe non-controversial publications that will improve impact factor and won\u2019t get often times the editors in hot water. I was an editor, not the managing editor, for a small fry journal, and his sentiment of some journals playing it safe is correct.",

You're saying editors want to have that cake and eat it too? If the problem is mostly with the editors/publishers, then why don't reviewers (who have alligience to neither) treat replication studies with appropriate favorability?",
