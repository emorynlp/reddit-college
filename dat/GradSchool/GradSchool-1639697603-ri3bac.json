  "title:": "As someone who is a PhD drop out and now has a job doing research - don't worry about dropping out if you have to. It was one of the best decisions of my life",
  "text": "I just wanted to give my story, because I know how easy it is to get tunnel visioned about getting into a PhD program and staying in one. My entire life was focused on academia and building up to get into a PhD program.\n\nI did end up getting into a PhD program at a decent R1 institution. And it was one of the worst periods of my life. We had to take three hard classes for each semester, along with a really hard TA assignment(we had 96 papers to grade every week + teaching 2 labs). Along with that we were expected to get research going our first few years. Our stipends were ok, but we weren't guaranteed funding for our entire PhD. Our health insurance wasn't fully covered.\n\nIt was a very stressful time of my life. Between working 50-60 hours a week, stressing about paying my rent, having the uncertainty of having funding for the future, and then the isolation on top of that, my mental health deteriorated. I had PTSD when I was younger(but went through years of therapy to heal). Grad school was the only time my PTSD ever came back.\n\nIt took my friend telling me how bad I looked to realize that I was not healthy. I was so obsessed + hyper focused on getting a PhD I kept ignoring the red flags and in turn breaking my own body down.\n\nI made the decision to leave(still had a masters) and I ended up getting a position doing research and design for the federal government(the fact I dropped out didn't even come up). I'm paid better, I'm treated better, I'm way less stressed out and I am able to still do research. Having this position really put things into perspective. A PhD is not an end all, and a lot of departments truthfully don't treat you well.\n\nIf you are able to get into a PhD program that you like and you enjoy definitely go for it and do great research. But don't make it your identity. I did and it almost ruined my life, and took awhile to make me realize there's a life outside of academia.",

      "text": "+1, similar story. *Easily* the best decision i ever made career wise. It took me *months* to adjust to the fact that people around me not only didn't assume I was a failure until proven otherwise, but actively respected me above others in my peer group for what I perceived as an absolute bare minimum level of effort. In retrospect, this was simply adjusting to being treated like a human being again.\n\nNot to mention the fact that I make more now than I would have ever made as an academic by... A factor large enough that I'm honestly too embarrassed to state it.\n\nThat said, don't leave without a concrete plan.",

The power structure some departments put in is very unnecessary because in the end we are our professors colleagues.",

A PhD isn't a guaranteed pass to a great job in any field, but leaving isn't a guaranteed career-breaker either if someone isn't looking at staying in academia.",

There's also an interesting inversion in that humanities generally has a much higher proportion of trust fund kids than STEM ime - a reverse of the sides in this analogy. Neat.\n\nIn any case, the drop out before/after finding a job isn't a STEM/humanities divide, that's a rich/poor divide that affects all of us in any field. I'm in a field with some very lucrative jobs after I graduate, but I couldn't afford to jump ship tomorrow if I decided I wanted to drop out. I'd have to plan carefully a few months ahead, looking for work while I'm still in the programme and skimming the monthly budget down to the bone to stash away some emergency savings to cover relocation, etc.\n\nI still think it's good advice for both disciplines with that caveat about extra planning for those of us from low-income backgrounds. It's not a career-breaker to leave a PhD course given there's a world of opportunities out there, which was the main point of the original post imo. If what you're saying is true and a humanities PhD course really leaves someone with so few marketable skills that they can't find a job at all before they graduate, that just sounds like a bad decision for most people except the independently well-off tbh.\n\n> You seem hung up on this projection that I\u2019m whining about having chosen to be in the humanities, which I haven\u2019t done at all.\n\nSomeone studying humanities should know about subtext, no? There's a lot of bitterness in general through your posts (and cheeky wee downvotes :) ) - it might not be about that specifically, but there's definitely some hangup here.",

I wouldn't have posted that specific comment if you weren't snarky and condescending in your original comment either, if I'm honest.\n\n> Guess the stereotypes about STEM chuds having no social graces is true too huh?\n\nScraping the barrel a bit here though tbh :')\n\nAnyways, if you want to keep limiting your options, cool, but OP's general advice applies to humanities as much as STEM people. My honest opinion when I'm not on the wind-up is that a humanities PhD does give folk marketable skills and the students themselves are often determined folk to begin with - looking for work and dropping out (in either order, depending on finances) will likely still lead to an above average range of careers. Your posts give the impression you think otherwise for some reason, which imo is weirdly devaluing the skills of your course and looked like bitterness to me.",
