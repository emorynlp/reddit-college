  "text": "Hi all!\n\nI'm looking into applying for a [FLAS](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/iegpsflasf/index.html) grant next year. I'm wondering if anyone can give me insight as to why FLAS funding has not been guaranteed at some institutions. It is kind of scary to apply for funding for the academic year, only to find out (if accepted) that I won't get to do the research and get the funding. I am willing to take the chance because I am very motivated to work on this language.\n\nThanks!",
