  "title:": "Hoping to graduate in May but unable to finish my last project",
  "text": "I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever finish my degree at this rate. I'm a 6th year experimental physics PhD student, trying to wrap up analysis on a project I've been working on for an embarrassing amount of time so that I can finally submit the manuscript for peer review. I've disliked this project since starting it basically, but I got stuck here and now it's apparent that it's the last thing I need to finish before I can graduate. I just really don't think I can -- and that's not me being a pessimist. I think the project is a failure and quite frankly a fraud.\n\nMy advisor is extremely hands off. We meet every 2-4 weeks, and every once in a while he'll play devil's advocate (for good reason) while editing my manuscript and I'll have to go back and redo the whole analysis because his questions change the structure of the model that I'm using. This last time I haven't been able to reconcile the flaw in the model, and I'm seriously doubting the integrity of the project as a whole. \n\nHow can I ask to abandon the project and still graduate? I've been working part time with a government lab over the past 1.5 years and I'm pretty sure I can get a postdoc there regardless of what my advisor has to say. I just need him to let me graduate.",
