  "text": "Times have changed and the odds of getting a job as a professor or even a lecturer seem nearly impossible these days. I didn't really believe that until I actually saw what the inside of a university hiring committee looks like.  My professors did try to warn me that I shouldn't keep my heart set on working academia. After spending some time in grad school, I have finally realized that my only chance of realistically teaching at a university is being an adjunct for pennies. So it may be time for leave of absence instead of getting in further debt. Just a rant I guess.",

Those kids will reach college age (18) in 2025 and then it\u2019s all downhill (and downsizing). \n\nIt\u2019s 2021, so even those who finish a PhD today will still struggle to get a job as universities downsize and tenure lines are cut in the coming years. The biggest upside to hiring lots of adjuncts is you can cut them loose when enrolment declines.\n\nAt this point, I think any plan that seriously considers academia a viable (and likely) option is a stupid plan. Everyone needs a backup they are happy with. And if you\u2019re only doing a PhD because there\u2019s an academic-only job that requires it, you have to accept that you may have wasted all those years.\n\nThe job market never recovered after 2008. It will not recover from this for at least a decade or two. The job market right now is the best it\u2019s going to get for a long time.",

                  "text": "At my university we used to have a job talk. Grad students were *encouraged* to attend as it was considered A) good learning experience for when wed have to do our own talk and B) a good showing of support and enthusiasm towards a new prospective prof. Good all around I suppose. I dont think it was ever discussed or talked about, but students assumed that they could participate in the talk like any other. Namely this meant ask questions of the interviewee at the end even if the question might be consider potentially adverse. At the second to most recent job talk a grad student asked a question at the end. I was not there so cannot reproduce the question here, but as it was explained to me it was something to do with how the interviewee (who was eventually hired) had interpreted some of their data. Basically coming down an a matter of opinion and theoretical preference and how that might affect the data set. People who were there say it was also very respectfully asked as, if you knew the person personally, they were just about the nicest person you could meet. Fast forward two weeks and the grad director received a student complaint that the question was totally inappropriate for a talk of that nature and it should never have been asked. The GD, who was a total douche, decided that \"yeah that was wildly inappropriate. No more grad students at job talks!\" and banned us, banned us from one of the last functions our department still provided alcohol for I might add. Weve had a few hires since that fateful day, only one got a job talk though. None of the grad students were permitted to attend.",

          "text": ">Do you have any stories or numbers you're comfortable sharing?\n\nI've been on search committees at SLACs since I was a student in the 80s. For the last two decades we'd typically see 200-300+ applicants for any position in the humanities, similar for social sciences, more for business, sometimes fewer for some STEM specialties. Of say 300 applicants about 250 are generally \"qualified\" and we have to cut that to \\~20 in a single meeting of the committee. That's the pool everyone agrees are not only viable, but for some reason desirable. These are almost always from top 10 or at least top 20 programs; all have extensive teaching experience, excellent references, and these days usually some publications as well.\n\nThat group of 20 is quickly cut to ten that we interview via Zoom/skype and rank; from there the top three are invited to campus for multi-day in-person interviews. In my experience anyone in the top 20 would be qualified and able to do the job; certainly the top ten would be solid candidates for tenure down the line. So the process usually comes down to fit, i.e. how closely do the candidates match not only the publish job requirements but the unpublished \"fantasy\" ones, i.e. \"It sure would be great if the new English hire could also teach intro to gender studies as well as composition and Shakespeare.\"  Add to that the intangibles-- the impression they make during the campus visit --and it starts to look pretty damned arbitrary in the end.\n\nBut 299 applicants won't get the job.",

          "text": "The Public Health dept at my university (a university generally ranked top 15-25 in the world depending on the year) has had 2 tenure track placements out of all the PhDs graduated from that department in the last ten years. They were looking into doing a placement analysis and making it public and then were like, better not. They keep pushing for PhDs and convincing them that they'd have a fighting chance but then basically only hire from Ivies/Oxbridge/Stanford et al. \n\nMoving forward, tenure track is only really a feasible option if you come from the elite departments in your field of study, unless you're willing to live in the middle of nowhere. 8 universities account for half of all tenured history profs, 11 universities account for half of all poli sci profs, and 18 universities account for half of all comp sci profs. It's an increasingly stratified realm. It's not to say that's it's impossible, but if your goal is tenure and academia, and you're not at one of the top 10 departments in your field, it's a really hard uphill climb. \n\n[Here's a 2015 study on the school hierarchy and hiring bias](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005) - it definitely contributed to my decision to master out and go commercial/private sector.",
