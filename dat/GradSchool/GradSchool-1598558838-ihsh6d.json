  "title:": "What even is dating during a PhD?",
  "text": "So I'm in my second year, just about to enter the third year (ahh) of my 3.5 year PhD program. \n\nI've never been in a relationship or have any experience, but as of this week I'm trying things with a dating app. It's a bit of a weird experience, but I think I'm using it well enough. Not really sure what the hell I'm doing, but okay.\n\nProblem is, I'll be done my program in 2 years and then have to move to go \"somewhere\" for work. Then after a Postdoc (or whatever) finishes, I move again. and again. How do you even try to build/start a relationship under those conditions? I'm almost 27, it does feel like life is passing me by, but I can't really shake the feeling. \n\nI don't think this would be an uncommon feeling for people in Grad School, does anyone have experience in this area?",

Let them know about your life and your plans but make sure they know that you want to go on a few dates with them and see where it goes. Some people might not want to go for it (I've had some girls flat out refuse to date any grad student), but you're not going to date them either way with your life/career trajectory. Communication is the bedrock of any good relationship. Start there and see what happens.",

              "text": "Well, right now its a bit difficult because of the pandemic. But, It really depends on what you want out of the relationship. If you're only want to find someone to day, I'd recommend Hinge. Its probably the best dating app for people that don't just want to go to the bone zone. I've had some success on it, but I've realized I just don't give a shit about dating right now and would rather focus on my studies. That's just me though. \n\nIf you're more interested in just expanding your social circles and finding people with like interests, look at various clubs/social leagues in your city. I'm pretty lucky because I live in a big city, so there's a lot going on. I joined a local community choir because I love to sing and I met people through that. I have one friend that joined a juijitsu gym and has been loving that. Another friend joined a kickball league. Ballroom dancing classes, local shows, getting involved in your community, etc. can all help a lot. \n\nIt can be hard, believe me I know, but you kind of just have to put yourself out there and try some new things. Worst case, you don't enjoy it and you don't go back. Not the worst thing. Making friends is hard outside of undergrad, but you can do it!",

      "text": "Lots of great advice here! I\u2019ll add my 2 cents though. 1) Chill out and meet people, don\u2019t think about the future, just enjoy the company as you would a friend. Don\u2019t get discouraged if it doesn\u2019t work out, it didn\u2019t work out for a reason and you learn a bit more about what you want.\n2) Let\u2019s say you meet the love of your life and post doc comes up. If this person is the one/worth it, you two will find a compromise. Maybe they move, maybe you stay local. Either way, when you become a serious couple, it\u2019s no longer about you, it\u2019s about us.\n\nThe best advice I saw here was stop planning. That will let you live in the moment and enjoy your time. Dating is really fun when you don\u2019t take it seriously. If someone really draws you in, relationships are fun in a different way.\n\nVacation wise - Dating is like backpacking to Machu Picchu: adventurous, tiring, fun, long, exciting!\nSerious relationships are like an all inclusive resort on a tropical or Mediterranean beach island: quiet, comfortable, relaxing, luxurious, safe, peaceful, rejuvenating.\n\nEnjoy life, let people in and let them out.",

      "text": "Lots of great advice here already, but I wanted to chime in to say pick the right dating app! My husband and I met on OkCupid! I liked it because it gave both of us a lot of prompts to write about ourselves and a series of questions to answer that helped match us. When I was using the app I specifically searched for prospective dates with match rates above 90% because I was tired of going out with people only to find we had major differences in values or beliefs. This obviously is a very different experience in online/app dating than tinder. I saw someone wrote to indicate in your profile that you might be moving around. That\u2019s a great idea! Then dates know what to expect. You might meet someone who finds the idea of moving with you to be exciting and feel like an adventure. \nI want to mention that dating apps are a very different experience depending on gender. As a woman, I received a lot of interest (including some I didn\u2019t appreciate) when I was doing online dating. My husband received much less. \nI\u2019m just saying this because I don\u2019t want you to get discouraged if you don\u2019t immediately receive lots of interest or if you get lots of unsolicited messages that make you uncomfortable. My husband and I would both say it was a thousand percent worth it for the incredible relationship we have together.",

      "text": "Happens all the time. I got married during my Ph.D. program...so did a lot of our friends. The majority are divorced now. I've seen fairly high rates of divorce among my academic colleagues/friends as well, and it's often due to conflicting careers, the two-body problem, or distance mandated by jobs that are far apart.  Those that survive *tend* to be couples in which one member has the sort of job that is portable and in demand (health care, tech, etc.) so they can follow the academic. The least likely to make it-- in my personal sample --are couples with two academics in the same general field, which makes it almost impossible for them both to have traditional academic careers without one or the other sacrificing opportunity if not entirely abandoning their aspirations so the other can take that once-in-a-lifetime TT job.\n\nOn the other hand, I've also seen a *lot* of faculty find love and get married in their 30s, 40s, or even 50s for the first time. I'm a minister and have even done some of those ceremonies myself. So there's nothing about your 20s that's magical or will expire when you turn 30.",

      "text": "I'm kind of surprised at the high ratio of advice-givers to empathizers. It's true, long-term relationships don't happen by convenience, and there's no reason to get down on yourself about a future problems years ahead of the present. \n\nBut, there's lots of people in your shoes. Another common thread I see are people in a relationship where both people are in grad school and one or both are relocating, and they ask for advice about breaking up or staying together or one person feeling more/less prioritized in their SO's life, etc. etc. it is a difficult reality to navigate for lots of grad students.\n\nA couple things to consider are, 1) how is your work-life balance? it's easy to think you're supposed to be on a 7 year grind with your whole life dedicated to your PhD, but try to see if you can advocate for more flexibility with your program and evaluate your personal schedule to see where you can make improvements. 2) do you absolutely have to move somewhere for each of those stages? it's easy to get caught up in academics and research and neglect the professional side of a PhD - try to see if you scout future companies/schools you'd be able to work at at each stage of your PhD to minimize unwanted life changes. reach out and make connections now! 3) just start dating. a PhD can feel burdensome, like a wall that blocks you from other things you want. while it's certainly a unique situation to be in, realistically everyone has a potential wall that blocks them from long-term relationships. past trauma, relationship baggage, depression, family problems, etc. which goes back to, no long-term relationships happen by convenience. you just have the meet someone who is at the same level of prioritizing a relationship as you are, and see if it keeps going. it takes some luck for sure, but you don't get lucky staying at home thinking it's not worth trying.\n\nlast side note - you say it feels like life is passing you by. what drove you to start a PhD? what joy or practical benefits does it bring you? any long-term goal risks some burnout, and everyone experiences a grass-is-greener feeling now and then with their life choices. but remember choosing a path and walking forward is better than walking in circles feeling unsure that any path is worth walking at all.",

Honestly, I'm pretty tired of the moving and constant uncertainty myself after living in different cities for undergrad, masters, and PhD.

I\u2019m in a phase of my life where I feel like I want to be able to focus on my work, but not be tied down to something serious. Sometimes you also have to acknowledge that things will happen when they do. I\u2019ve been using apps with absolutely no expectations and I\u2019ve had some great conversations, but it can be super draining to keep up multiple conversations while working and studying. If someone comes along and wants something casual, I\u2019m all for it. If the girl I previously dated wanted to get back, I\u2019d consider it.  Figure out your priorities and think how much effort you\u2019re willing to put into dating.

      "text": "I feel like you're having my exact experience. I hadn't really dated at all (except for a long distance internet relationship in my teens lol) until grad school. I was in the habit of going off and on dating apps, mainly for entertainment/distraction, and nothing had ever really come of it except momentary validation that I was still a cute person lol. But the summer after my 1st yr of PhD, I fell very quickly into a relationship with someone I met on a dating app and it's been just over 2 yrs with him now. \n\nThe beginning of the relationship felt literally traumatic. No one tells you that ending your relationship with long term singlehood can be genuinely painful even though you want to spend time with a person. It was hard adjusting to the reality of sharing space and time, making compromises, coming to terms with the reality of a human to replace my fantasy of a forever-love-of-my-life, and understanding that just because they don't tick your imaginary boxes doesn't mean you're being untrue to yourself. \n\nI thought I had to break up with him over and over again. Every doubt I had became \"should I just finish it? Am just in this because I can't face being alone again?\" The only thing that kept me from letting him go was the fact that the idea of it made me sadder than I thought it would, and it didn't seem to be for the wrong reasons. \n\nI'd constantly wonder what the future would be like if we went into this. I'm an international student and he's from the country of my university. One day, I would have to graduate and take next steps. I had to talk to a lot of my friends who have been in long term and short term relationships or just had more experience dating to understand that it's fine to not know. I had to understand that I can enjoy what I have now and wait to make decisions when it makes sense to think about them, when we know what's coming next. That it's better to have this than not have it, regardless of the future. \n\nI like to think of it as a phase of my life. I'm not sure if he will be coming with me into my next phase, but I will always have this phase. The experiences I take from this phase will never be a waste. No phase of life is a waste. Everything you fill it up with colors your experience of that phase, and if I can make this phase as good as I can, that's great. That doesn't mean that if I start the next phase with all new things - new location, new people, whatever - that that next phase will be somehow tarnished because I didn't carry something from this phase along with me. \n\nMaybe this means that I'm stopping something in my heart from making a solid connection with him now, but that also doesn't mean that if he DOES come with me into the next phase, that I can't strengthen and solidify that connection THEN. It's okay to defer commitment I think, and it doesn't feel like doing that has tarnished my current phase either. (It helps that he lives in the moment just as much - in fact, I've picked up a lot of this outlook from him!)\n\nLife is just a long ass journey, man. Every part of it is valuable and valid, and clinging to things and permanence can often be futile, when instead you could allow new things to come in and fill your life up every single phase of it you go through.",

      "text": "I think one thing to note is that there are a variety of dating strategies and no one of them is the *right* strategy. \n\nBy strategy I don\u2019t mean how you go about finding/attracting a partner, but the dynamic you choose when you\u2019re in relationship(s). \n\nSo a large part of it is based on your own cultural norms and what makes you you. As such it\u2019s not always a choice. \n\nBroadly I would say the two biggest features are how many people you date at once, the duration of your relationships, and whether they are local or long distance. Obviously the feasibility is an issue. By being on your track it pretty much eliminates the choice of long-term and local.\n\nFor example a common dating strategy is to be serially monogamous. Date one person at a time. If you choose short durations you can still date lots of people. There is an exploration/exploitation trade off with how many people you date (dating more people let\u2019s you learn what you want and what\u2019s available, but limits enjoying the relationships you do find). \n\nOr in the flip side you could date many people for long durations, or any sort of combinations you like. \n\nSo long as you are honest and upfront with the people you date about what you\u2019re looking for, I think all dating strategies can be practiced ethically. It\u2019s a process to figure out what works for you and what makes you happy. \n\nSometimes you have to compromise on what you want in terms of career or relationships. But there are often more options than we first think. Just because a choice isn\u2019t right for someone else doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the right choice for you. \n\nTL:DR an evolutionary game theory perspective on dating can be fruitful.",

Personally, I've had more success going through friends, members of my extended cohort as a means to find a partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How do you even try to build/start a relationship under those conditions?\n\nHere's the thing: your partner needs to know the requirements/demands of your program and \"life after the PhD\". This could mean, 60-80 hour work weeks, frequent travel, conferences, the possibility of relocating for work and the possibility of a meager salary. If you are upfront and honest about these matters from the get-go, you will be more successful in dating and finding a healthy relationship. Be realistic, but more importantly, be honest about your circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm almost 27, it does feel like life is passing me by...\n\nI'm 32 and I have only just begun the road to a PhD. I'm not married nor have a had a serious relationship in like 5 years. I live with my parents. I don't make a lot of money, I'm not particularly pretty and my eggs are dying by the minute. You'll have likely a PhD by the time you're my age. You are likely, out on your own and living fully functioning adult in the middle of a pandemic, before thirty. You are light years ahead of me and many, if that is any consolation. Remember that romance and partnership is not a race, that all good things take time to develop and hopefully, come to fruition with time.",

How do you even try to build/start a relationship under those conditions?\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am leaving academia. Not the only one, but the overall uncertainty is something I am no longer willing to deal with.  \nThe uncertainty your describe never goes away, either you (and your partner) are willing to accept that or you get out. There is no magic solution to make that go away. And this isn't a problem with new relationships, even if you would have a partner for years you would have to discuss how to deal with all the moving. Do you go long distance? Is one person sacrificing their career to move around with the other one? Do you both make compromises that aren't ideal but at least allow you to stay in that same place? When do you want to have kids, pets, a house, whatever? When can you even afford that if you don't even know where you will work next year and under which conditions? And not having secured income for the next years comes with other problems, too, e.g. if you ever need to take out a load.  \nAnd not having a partner also does not make it easier, you still leave a lot behind, every time you move. Family, friends, communities... You constantly uproot your life to start over somewhere else, often without knowing for how long exactly and where your career leads you next or if maybe the next stop is your last one because you might ultimately fail to secure that rare tenured position. And until you have that, a long time will pass. For tenured professor, most people achieve that in their forties, so you still have more than 15 years of uncertainty ahead of you. If you get lucky, you might get another permanent position in academia somewhere but to be honest some of these are even rarer than professorships, although achievable earlier.\n\nSo yeah, I can't really give you advice, there really is no good solution to this problem. You just need to start dating and be honest about this problem with your partner from the start, so they can decide whether they want to deal with that or not. There will be people you really like that will see it as a deal-breaker and again, there is nothing you can do about that. If you want to be an academic you need a supportive partner that is willing to either move with you or go long-distance, no way around that. It makes dating a lot harder, obviously. It makes anything harder.\n\nAs said, I will leave academia soon and the moment I realized that now I can actually make plans what I want to do or have in the next years was great, because for the first time in my life (and I am 32 now), I actually have an idea where I will be in the next years.  \nSome of the professors I know had that with 45 or even 50 years, when they finally got a permanent position.",

I don't mean necessarily have sex, I mean, you can if you want, but when you start talking to someone, or go on a date (online or irl), don't worry about what it would be like to be in a relationship with that person. Honestly, you will probably meet a lot of people you just don't click after the first few dates. Instead of planning too much, just enjoy the moment. Talk about yourself, ask questions, have a good time! As someone mentioned, you can make it clear on your profile you will move in a few years, and that's ok! I did that, met my now bf two years ago, and in a month he's moving with me across the country because I got a job there! There are things in life that are out of your control, so just enjoy what you have atm!",

Dating is one of those things where you're going to find that some people jive with your personality, others don't, sometimes it's amazing and mutual, and sometimes it's one-sided and you might be a little disappointed or heartbroken from time to time.

There comes a point when it stops getting easier, but simply becomes \"Oh, this again.\" Always great to be reunited. And honestly much easier now in general due to the internet than it was in the early 90s when our long distance was $.50/minute!  I think our long period of LDR years ago (almost two full years with only two breaks together, as we couldn't afford to fly) was a test...after we made it through that anything less seemed inconsequential.  By contrast we have friends that have been together 30+ years that have never spent more than a weekend apart and it's actually created friction for them, i.e. hard for either to travel for professional purposes without the other going along.",

And don't take anything too serious until it is\n\nThis. \n\nI was in a long term and long-distance relationship during my first years of grad school until I broke it off before my final year. I didn't know if I should try dating again, but I put myself out there. I struggled at first and regretted it since I was going to be leaving in a year. But after overcoming that, I figured I should just give it a shot and go with the flow, you never know what will happen.\n\nSure enough, I met and started dating my now fianc\u00e9e just as I started writing my dissertation. She was incredibly patient with me when I was stressed and gave me the space I needed when I needed it.\n\nDating in grad school is hard, and it's harder when you start dating someone when you're trying to do your prelims, quals, defense, etc. It's not for everyone, but if you do start dating someone in grad school, I think the key is to find someone who is at least understanding, kind, and patient with you. \n\nEvery couple also has to merge their separate career paths and goals too, but our paths forward may seem a bit more cloudy and narrow. But I don't think that's worth worrying about now other than your first postdoc and your potential partner knowing that our paths aren't that defined more than 3-5 years out.",

But like, waiting in line to pay at the cafe or taking a water break at the gym, where I\u2019m not particularly preoccupied? That\u2019s a better opportunity and just feels like a much more natural time to strike up a conversation. People make small talk like this even if they aren\u2019t attracted to the person they\u2019re chatting to, so it\u2019s low-stakes and doesn\u2019t come across as creepy or anything (in my opinion at least).\n\nEdit: as for bars... idk, I go with friends and still meet people pretty easily. However I personally like to socialize with people at bars beyond my friend group because it\u2019s more fun that way imo. I do agree that girls can be predispositioned to stick to their own group and have their girls brush off guys that approach, but that seems to be more of an 18-20 year old thing. As I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve seen my own friend group get more and more lax with socializing with guys at bars, probably just because you get more comfortable and confident in a bar setting the more you go.",

It's not that easy to move somewhere else anymore. It sounds to me like OP doesn't want to date to hook up. It sounds to me like they're looking for someone they can have a deeper connection with and some people looking for the same thing would be understandably hesitant to put themselves in a situation where they have feelings for someone who is going to leave basically. \n\nOf course there are people out there where this wouldnt be an issue for them. And if you find someone you share really strong feelings with it might not matter anyway. It's just a matter of finding them. Which makes dating that much harder in grad school.
