  "title:": "It took being a grad student to finally get an ADHD diagnosis",
  "text": "I feel so validated. I\u2019ve struggled with my ability to focus for my entire life, but it went under the radar because I was a shy and academically achieving kiddo. And a girl (we\u2019re statistically under-diagnoses!). \n\nGrad school has been such a wake up call. It\u2019s only my first year, but it\u2019s become glaringly obvious that I can\u2019t get by with my work-around strategies that I didn\u2019t even realize weren\u2019t normal. Now I finally understand why I was never able to read a single text book during undergrad! \n\nMy psychiatrist gave me the diagnosis today. I\u2019m going to switch meds and tailor my therapy sessions. \n\nThings are looking up. :)",

I remember in high school one of my professors told me I had selective hearing. I was an overachiever and took like 4 honors courses, 2 AP courses, and 2 extracurricular activities, and there was so much work that I couldn't handle it and did none of the work, so I went on a downward trend... I wonder why I couldn't handle the work? My friends could.",

Instead of going to traditional behavioral therapy, it turns out that I came up with my own coping strategies to make studying easier.\n\nI majored in a subject in the STEM field, and my 'strategies' worked when I only had 1 science/math class per semester. There are always those classes where there is no creative work-around; the only way to do well is to just sit down and do the work. But during my later years of college, it got really hard when *every* class was a science/math class where the only way to pass was to sit down for hours and work practice problems over and over. \n\nEnter grad school. Enter someone willing to take me seriously. And here we are.\n\nBest of luck! You are valid!",

That just doesn\u2019t fly now. From there I started to realize I met a lot of the other criteria. \n\nI didn\u2019t have to go anywhere, but I did have a telehealth appointment and did some assessments! When the world stops malfunctioning I might go to see a neuropsychologist.",
