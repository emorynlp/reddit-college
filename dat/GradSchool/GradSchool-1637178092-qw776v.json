  "text": "My whole life, I have been a pretty outgoing and fun guy, then I got into graduate school. During my first year, I was ready to tackle the world, I have taken 24/26 units each quarter, went the extra mile, and did all the extracurricular classes, organizing events, being part of journal clubs. The pandemic hit, I finished all the coursework required classes, and lab work became my life. 70+ hours of work every week. I got this huge sense of failure and impostor syndrome. I thought that I would be able to help people, be useful, and in the end, I feel like I am a glorified lab tech. I order items to maintain the lab functioning, take care of the inventory, process blood (PBMC's, plasma, sera), keep check on how the animals are doing, and design experiments checking the antibodies staining, some tissue staining, but in the end, nothing really is important. Every week is a rush to make up something to present to the PI, which I feel blessed compared with other PI's I have heard of, and I have my weekly reminder from the lab tech that I won't graduate. \n\nQE is scheduled, the anxiety is ramping up, my 5 hours of sleep became terrible 2/3 hours of sleep or 12 hours, and the feeling of not doing anything. I have no desire to come to the lab, and honestly, I just feel like thanking my professor for the opportunity and walking away. After 1 year of therapy and a lot of debate, I am finally going to get medicated since my blood pressure is through the roof, and I am having physical manifestations of severe anxiety. Anybody else?",

      "text": "Quals are scary for everyone. In my program, you get to retake them once before you are dismissed from the program. When I was preparing for mine, I was taking them at the same time as someone in my lab who failed and was retaking them. Their mindset was to remind themselves that if they failed again, it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that it happens to lots of people. That did *not* help me, who wanted to believe \u201cit\u2019s ok, almost everyone passes\u201d. The incompatibility of mindset for something that mattered so much with someone I saw every single day really ramped up my anxiety. \n\nThe weeks leading up to quals were some of the worst for me anxiety. Take advantage of the time that you have to study, focus on the areas where you\u2019re weakest. My quals covered three areas with 4-5 courses worth of material in each exam (some courses built off of others though). I would study one area per night for a few hours, focusing on either a course I never formally took or a few lectures worth of material I\u2019m not too strong in. It really divides up the workload into  manageable portions. Try your hardest to not let it consume you, and it\u2019ll feel like a huge weight is lifted once you\u2019re done. \n\nWhen it comes to the exam, don\u2019t worry too much about little mistakes. I was asked a question that had multiple routes to getting to the right answer. I picked the shorter one, got the right answer, and was asked to show how to do it using the longer way. With the longer way, I was so nervous I forgot how to integrate the function but knew what to do with it after\u2026some intro to calc stuff. My examiner totally understood, didn\u2019t hold it against me. If you\u2019re worried about little mistakes like that, people will be understanding that you\u2019ll blank because of nerves.",

But they are looking to see how I would deal with the problems they throw at me.\n\nI am not so confident about not letting it consume me. That ship has sailed. But I am trying to work out, and meditate every day now.",

      "text": "QE is made out to be some super intense thing so people study really hard and get a more well rounded background. Some of the physics programs that don't pair you with an advisor until after QE are insane as they use it as a way to cull some applicants. But you have an advisor, they know your examiner! and if you do shit your examiner will call your advisor and ask if you are an idiot or just nervous. When your advisor says you are a great student they will say you passed the exam.\n\nYou can prep for 2 weeks and pass QE. It will be stressful as you are under prepared and relying on your advisor to bail you out, but you will pass.\n\nTl;Dr; you'll pass, go for a walk each day and focus on keeping a consistent sleep schedule. \n\nEdit: This is for eng, phys, chem and bio, I have no idea what math or arts QE is like. Also if your QE was/is researched based that is a different ball game.",

Thank you for all the info. I do feel like I should definitely go out for a walk or a run. It will probably be helpful.",
