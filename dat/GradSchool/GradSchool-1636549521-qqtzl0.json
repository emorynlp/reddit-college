  "text": "Simplest way to put it really. I no longer believe that what I\u2019m doing in grad school is going to make any sort of significant impact in my own life, let alone anyone else\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m getting a PhD in biomedical sciences, and I\u2019m supposed to be writing a resubmission for an F31 right now - I\u2019m meeting with my professor later today to discuss my progress, which I haven\u2019t made - and I just can\u2019t fucking lie to myself or those reviewers that what I\u2019m doing matters. \n\nIt might matter if I could actually get something done, if my advisor hired some postdocs or senior scientists which could actually train me and my 5 grad student colleagues who don\u2019t have a fucking clue what we\u2019re doing. I haven\u2019t really learned something valuable in over a year. I\u2019ve spent all of 2021 fucking around with test tubes proving absolutely nothing. I\u2019m supposed to be about halfway through my program. I\u2019ll be close to 30 by the time I\u2019m done with this, if I make it to that, and I\u2019ll honestly think I\u2019ll have nothing to show for it.\n\nI recently got a car, and have done some maintenance and repairs on it, and rediscovered why I\u2019ve always loved cars my whole life. And also discovered that this whole scientist bullshit was a lie I convinced myself I wanted to pursue. What a fucking joke",

I just don\u2019t get excited about trying something new or retrying something in a different way. Just honest to god don\u2019t care, because I don\u2019t think it matters in the big picture, and I don\u2019t feel that I can affect it with my own hands and will.

I do think our places in the world are more than our careers. I think a career is a small part of our lives. I think we should enjoy what we do but I do believe that once you monetize a passion, you might lose passion because you are chasing that bag.  And I didnt like grad school that much. It was hard as hell and it was isolating because much of it was spent during pandemic times, but I saw the forest for the trees - I knew that with a degree in biomedical science, I could do A LOT. I didnt have to go into academia or even research. The work I was doing and the people I was with were likely nothing like what I would be doing down the road. \n\nI also never said its a pipe dream, but its a hobby/passion. Also, the proportion of people in trades who make it big is very small compared to those who run small businesses that arent super lucrative. If you are happy working on cars regardless of income, go for it! But going into it thinking because you have passion that you will be some big shot making more than you ever would as a scientist is foolish. \n\nAnd no, Im not a workaholic, but Ive recognized that my career doesnt define me. I go to work and I definitely dont enjoy every aspect of my career/field and that is exactly why I separate what pays my bills from what brings me joy. The pandemic definitely shook up my priorities a bit, but Im not about to sacrifice years of hard work toward financial independence so that I can chase a passion that *might* pay off. The financial independence Ive worked toward allows me the financial resources and time to do everything I enjoy and more.",

I\u2019ve talked with professors, VPs of Thermo Fisher, founders of biotech companies, consultants who are direct alumni from my program.

I want to do something I care about and enjoy, and have lots of time to watch my kids grow up. \n\nMaybe sticking with it would be a better choice for me, and allow me to do that.

                      "text": "Thanks for sharing this, OP!! I (24F) find myself in the same boat. My interests are a bit different from yours; I'm a semester in to an advertising grad program, and I have this haunting feeling that I'm putting aside my passions that I've always wanted to pursue, like writing, singing, making art, to have an art adjacent career, which feels maybe \"safer\" for the long term. Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever be able to make money off of these passions, but I really want to have time to fully pursue them, at least as hobbies. As I work full time and am also in school I'm pretty burnt out and all my creative energy goes to projects that aren't solely for me.\n\nI'd also add that I got into this field to communicate culture shifting, social justice oriented ideas, but it all feels very cheap to me because it comes on the back on selling products. I'm sure there's a path to be found in this industry that feels true to me, but I'm just like, why? Do I need to be in school for this? Analysis and strategic thinking comes naturally to me. Like, I could be good at this, and could feel happiness but... I can't turn off the part of me that is like girl, wtf are you doing (I was sitting in class the other night and all my brain was saying was I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE).\n\nI earnestly believe I have bottled up personal creative dreams for my whole life because I've been taught they aren't practical and I could never make money off of them. I'm considering dropping out of school, getting a job that pays the bills, and having all the free time to focus on art and cultural experiences.\n\nBut it's all very scary. From this post you would think I've made up my mind. But I'm extremely conflicted. Actually I was talking to my therapist about this and she said \"I think you're retramatizing yourself by being in school.\" WOAH! My parents are teachers and everyone else in my family has a masters degree and all my life I've gotten so much love and approval by putting my whole heart and creative energies into school, and now that my creative inner artist has had a taste of daylight it's freaking out and being like \"You suppressed me forever to do school and now I'm angry because you're doing school again but what about me?\"  I put myself through so much pain in high school and undergrad to excel in school, and now my therapist basically told me I'm in an abusive relationship with school. Because what do traumatized people do? They retraumatize themselves, because they think they can handle that known pain in favor of the pain of the unknown (which you know, might not even be painful at all, maybe the unknown holds thrilling joy! But it's scary. What if what if what if!).  And yet! Just last night I had a class where the creative juices were flowing and I was like this is fun I can do this! But, like every abusive relationship, there are points of love and care that keep the abused coming back.\n\nAll that said, I still don't know what I'm going to do. Will I take a risk, quit, and explore art? Or will I keep going, convince myself it's worth it? Like I said, even though this post clearly says GIRL YOU GOTTA GET OUT, I have no idea what I'm actually gonna do. Cuz yk, the practicality! The potential regret! The judgement from family and friends! Dear God, give me a sign.",

He said that he treats this like a job so it isn't a big deal but to me work life balance is not something my PI nor a lot of PIs really value for their students.

              "text": "Tl;dr: absolutely consider moving programs entirely of you think that is what you want. Think critically about the kind of job you want and do it in terms of how you want an average work day to look and THEN factor in your current field/background and what you could move into without having to start at square one. What kind of jobs fit that? Sounds like applied research/development would be a lot more meaningful to you than basic research (and what academia considers \"applied\" is still more basic than industry \"applied\"). You probably hate being told this but NETWORK. \n\nPost written before the TL;DR that I think is genuinely worth your time:\n\nI have no idea what kind of biomedical research you're doing or how far you are in your PhD (sorry if I missed that in the OP) but I was thinking about something like this for you. Changing to some sort of applied engineering would be a way to potentially keep some of your momentum and credentials and do more problem solving and possibly working with your hands, etc. \n\nWhat's your bachelor's in? Could you get an MS in biomedical/biological/etc engineering and not have to start from a BS level again? Ideally, you could master out quickly but the close second best would be a program at your current school that would let you transfer in and keep a lot of coursework. Not sure how far you are on your research but could you finish up this section and publish? Even in wildly disparate fields, momentum is momentum. Changing direction is easier than stopping and starting over. \n\nYou may have already thought a lot about what it is you like about working on cars but if you haven't, give it some serious thought and figure out what you would like in a job, in a day-to-day sense. \n\nHave you ever worked full time before? (not counting school/the PhD, which is def full time work but it's so different) I dropped out of grad school and am working full time at a university in an outreach support position and it's been really eye-opening, as my first full time job outside of directly academia and research. I thought that working full time over summers and breaks gave me a taste of fulltime work and discovered... It did not. I'm still trying to figure my shit out - actually just got accepted to a program I realize I don't really want to do - but I know a lot more about the non-content part of what I like & dislike in a job. \n\nExample: For me, I need the flexibility to set my own schedule and cycle out of task that's boring (hi, ADHD), I'd like to get away from full-time desk, I probably wouldn't do well FT WFH, I really prioritize the freedom to run an errand in the middle of a day or take a long lunch or leave early (!) even if I have to do some WFH to catch up. I also desperately need to have some human contact every single day - sitting at my desk and doing my little tasks with little to no contact is really getting to me. Ideally, I would be in some sort of helping role. Now that I know that, I'm looking around within my field (and related fields I could branch into) to see what kind of jobs fit those.\n\nI still haven't got that quite nailed down but I think that's a good approach for job satisfaction.\n\nAlso, a tip: network. I know, I know, that's what everybody says and how often does it do any good? But it's how I got my foot in the door as a student worker years ago - and *that* got me a job this year when I quit grad school with no plan. That might be your ticket into an engineering/technical program or job (or, potentially, both) if that's what you want. \"Yeah, I know narkbackos doesn't have the background that we'd normally want for this position but he's (he?) got a lot of biological process knowledge, higher-level research experience, and connections in the biomed realm. Plus, obviously he's proven his systems thinking. If he agrees to get X degree/certification/whatever (that we'll pay for), I think he'd be a real asset.\"\n\nI'm making shit up to fit what I understand your scenario to be but you get my drift. And I truly don't think I'm being overly optimistic here. I also wonder if part of disillusionment is that you're working on too basic of research and you need to be on the very, very applied end of the R&D spectrum. Like... Development! My mom is diabetic and every time I administer her shot (with the disposable needles) and attach her glucose monitor, I think how elegantly they were designed. Something in that realm - basically a UX engineer for medical products - might be very satisfying to you.\n\nI know how shitty and uprooting it is to not believe in what you're doing anymore. I know how disorienting it is to see the future you'd planned suddenly seem completely unpalatable. I truly believe that you'll end up in a much better situation but it's honestly a pain in the ass to figure it out, do the work to make it possible, and also the unpleasant task of... Quitting. If that is indeed what you want - and it sure sounds like it. Fwiw, I also support starting a BS in mechanical engineering or becoming a mechanic or whatever it is you determine is right for you, this was just a lot me trying to figure out how you keep your momentum.",

I\u2019m basically in charge of a whole research project, since literally no one works on it in my lab but me. That means every little thing - reaction protocols, purification methods, experiment design - is on me. That also means that when any one of those things goes wrong and needs optimizing, which they always do, I have to do it. And after a year of basically doing only that, with nothing really to show for it, I am through with it. Some people, maybe yourself, are very well geared for that kind of work - it takes a specific kind of person to want to do it. It\u2019s very much a rat race, especially in academia when publishing first and prolifically directly contributes to career success.

Not everyone graduates from a PhD program, not because they aren't good enough but because a PhD and academia aren't for everyone. Perhaps you could talk to a careers advisor or consultant to figure out how to transition out of your PhD into a job you want. On the flip side, I'd say be careful of wanting to suddenly make your passion or hobby your job - some people have said that tends to drain their motivation to do what they once loved instead of using their passion to continuously drive their work.

No one to talk to. Even my advisor is not very helpful. Took a lot of time and introspection to convince myself that I'm not dumb, I'm just in a bad situation. Every paper in this field is fielded by a lab that ONLY works on this topic. I'm learning and publishing but nothing I do can match the quality of the content thats coming out of other labs.

It\u2019ll give you a needed break and a change in perspectives. \n\nThe second thing that I can tell you is that, based on what you have stated, even if you resubmit you may not get the F31. My advisor sat on the F31 committee this year. One of the things committee members look at is whether the advisor is suited to training graduate students, whether they\u2019re truly involved, and whether the application was actually written by the applicant and not a ghost writer (i.e. the advisor). People who sit on SRGs aren\u2019t stupid, they can pick up on these things. A1 applications from top institutes like MIT have been shot down for the above mentioned reasons. Your advisor doesn\u2019t seem to be guiding you very well. The best person to understand your situation is you so now is the time to ask yourself whether it is worth it to resubmit. \n\nThe last thing I can tell you is that COVID has had a huge impact on F31s, culling the number of applications by 2/3. Thus, last year's application had the highest chance of getting funded because of the same budget but smaller applicant pool. This year may be different as IC's will likely pare back funding to match the number of applications. This just a rumor, chances of getting funded can go in either direction. The only I can say here is, again, you have to ask whether it\u2019s worth it to try resubmitting or not.",
