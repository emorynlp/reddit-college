Shut your ego, put your head down and put in the work.\n\nDon't fool yourself. If you feel like a failure, no amount of kind words from acquaintances will make you feel successful. Prepare to accept that the fault can sometimes lie with us, not on circumstances. Own your actions. Only then will you learn to love yourself and fight for yourself.",

      "text": "I'll summarize :\n\n1 : Time and effort management. Learn how you learn best. Structure your way of getting and processing information. A couple of hours on how to manage your files, articles, work and project management tools will save you TONS. For me, Zotero and Obsidian are life savers. Learn their more advanced functions.\n\n1b : Read / write every day. Journal you thesis. \n\n2 : Social. Even in COVID times, you can reach out to people. Be seen. Twitter, LinkedIn, present abstracts in conferences. It will help you later. Find your \"crown\". There are key people in the world having a conversation on your subject. Find them, listen and contribute.\n\n2b : social personal. Doing online game via Discord or whatever with friends and family weekly helps also. It's surely a lot better than nothing.\n\n3 : Health. Sleep, eat well, exercise. No need to put in 1h each day in exercise. Just a 15 min run around the block daily will do a whole lot to your physical / mental health. Some free weights on the floor near your bed. Do 2-3 sets of whatever each day. Don't think about it. Routinize it and in one month you'll see that you feel better. For food, planning in advance can help. Cooking a batch of quinoa, rice or whatever. Just assemble some veggies, spice, olive oil. You can have a tasty healthy meal in 15 minutes. (less than walking to a restaurant !)\n\n4 : Find something to relax your mind. I just took back chess (on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org)). Each day I play a couple of games. Takes me about 10-15 minutes, I realize it keeps my brain sharper. Also, I took back learning a language on Duolingo. again, 10 minutes per day when I'm on a break or eating, whatever. \n\nYou can see from this that in short : Prepare and routinizing are key. Shortcut your anxiety by not even having to think about what you have to do each day. Don't be afraid to try something that doesn't work. If you are not sure what to do, just do something that can work. At least you'll have feedback on which to build. Surely beats staring at a white page all day.",

This can mean partners, children, parents, pets, etc. You cannot do your job well if you're worried about your kids not sleeping.\n\nRule #3. Do your job (scientific research). You're a smart guy, capable scientist, and clearly contribute to the lab. I don't trust you to do this if you're not doing Rules #1 and #2 first.\n\nRule #4. Have something outside of your work/family life that keeps you sane. (for me this was BJJ). Extracurriculars help you de-stress from work/family life.\n\nI teach these rules, and the order of operations to everyone that works for me.",

Hard work's worth nothing if you don't put thought into what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how you can do it most efficiently. If you invest time in working these out, you'll save a lot of time and effort. Always study a task/project/... before actually doing it. This might be your whole degree or just an exam/assignment. Try to figure out what is useful to know beforehand, and what's the best way to get relevant tasks done. At worst you'll have spent a few hours in vain, at best, you'll save incredible amounts of time and effort.\n\nThroughout my higher ed adventure till today, I've always been baffled with how often people just seem to opt for raw hustle instead.",
