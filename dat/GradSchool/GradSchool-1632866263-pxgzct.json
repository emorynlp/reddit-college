  "title:": "I keep chickening out of sending emails to potential advisors. Any help?",
  "text": "I\u2019m applying this cycle and most of the programs I\u2019m applying to recommend reaching out to a potential advisor that you would study under for your masters and doctorate. I\u2019ve drafted up letters and researched who I want to be supervised by but I keep chickening out of sending the emails? Is there any thing you can think of to help? \n\nI guess I\u2019m just so nervous to approach them and I\u2019m not entirely sure what to say. A person in the program I\u2019m applying to showed me their templates for the letters they sent and I used it to guide mine. It was pretty basic, letting them know your interests and how they connect with the supervisor. Should I add my personal backstory? \n\nI guess I\u2019m also worried I won\u2019t be able to tie my interests into their interests as some of them have large interests of \u201cmental illnesses\u201d but then go on to research very very specific things that aren\u2019t my top choice. Then I also run into the worry what if I email this advisor and lose interest in the topic, or if I\u2019m caught between two advisors for a program I can\u2019t decide which to pick. I\u2019m also so nervous they will be mean, and that I\u2019m not a good candidate. \n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much. \ud83d\udc9c",

      "text": "Keep your email on the shorter side and ask to meet briefly to hear about their research and discuss further. Talking about your interests and potential intersections is great. \n\nI think it's important to hear about a professor's research interests in their own words. You can get a sense for what projects they're most excited about, including newer stuff coming down the line that they haven't published yet but will probably be their focus when you're in school. \n\nAlso, most professors get way too many emails and their eyes are likely to glaze over at a long email from a prospective student. Something simple and to the point will get their attention sooner.",
