  "text": "Yeah my supervisor announced a new grad student was coming for next year and everyone welcomed her but I couldn't avoid feeling jealous and insecure about this.\n\nIt happens every time a new person comes... I don't know why! I don't act upon this though, I try to be supportive and welcoming, but I would like to know if I'm the only one that feels this?\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: I want to add that I think I might feel insecure because I am actually new in this field of research whereas the new students already arrive with some experience and publications. So it makes me feel like all my efforts are going to be unseen??? I honestly don't know, maybe I have to look at how I look my supervisor...",

Plus, students graduate and new people have to come in eventually? It never occurred to me that someone could feel this way. And from the other comments it seems more common than I initially thought. \n\nThat\u2019s just my take, everyone is obviously entitled to their opinion.",

          "text": "You might not have experienced this yet because you\u2019re a Masters or first year PhD at most at this point (since you messaged me [less than a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lcfel1/advice_pursuing_a_phd_in_the_uk/) asking about applying to UK PhD programmes), so you haven\u2019t been around long enough to experience this yet.\n\nUnfortunately, things being unhealthy doesn\u2019t make them uncommon or unreasonable in grad school, eg working weekends. \n\nNew (PhD) students below you mean that you are becoming an old student, which means you transition to a position of less support and guidance usually. If you\u2019re not ready for that, it may be tough.\n\nE: and it actually does seem a little founded for OP, who\u2019s worried that they\u2019re going to fade into obscurity or be seen as worse in comparison to newer students with (apparently) better skills. Imagine being afraid that a first year PhD might legitimately outperform you, a 4-5th year. Imagine how bad that would make you look in comparison. It\u2019s just imposter syndrome, and you can\u2019t possibly say that\u2019s uncommon.\n\n\\* link",

              "text": "I\u2019m a 3rd year grad student and have never felt this way, so I disagree with your first statement. I also didn\u2019t say bc it was unhealthy that it was uncommon or unreasonable, I just said it hadn\u2019t occurred to me. \n\nI guess your 3rd/4th points are fair. But I feel everyone is aware, or should definitely find out soon, that a PhD is largely a solo effort. It\u2019s not really even about the problem, it\u2019s about how you problem solve. Your advisor should absolutely need less time with you the longer you\u2019re in the program, if you couldn\u2019t stand on your own 2 feet that means they haven\u2019t done a good job (or maybe it wasn\u2019t really for you in the first place, hard reality but sometimes true). \n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s imposter syndrome, it can feed into it but this specific situation sounds more like an insecurity to me. I\u2019m not saying these feelings aren\u2019t valid, you\u2019re 100% entitled to feel how you feel. The poster just asked for perspective and I gave mine. \n\nI do think the worry that a 1st year would outperform you is a massive confidence issue that should probably be addressed. Imagine if someone was playing basketball for the first time and you\u2019ve been playing for 5 years. It\u2019s insane that you would be afraid of them reaming you, they don\u2019t even know the rules! \n\nI obviously don\u2019t know all the specifics, nor am I a psychologist. But this sounds like anxiety more than anything to me. Which is a serious issue that needs attention. Or maybe a case of jealousy, which is human nature but usually not great.\n\nAnyway, hope OP can determine the best way to address their feelings. And same to everyone that finds themselves in a similar state of mind",

We\u2019re not competing for position on a team, new guy comes in and is brilliant doesn\u2019t mean you get kicked out of the group (if so that\u2019s fucked). \n\nYea idk if you got into a program you acknowledge isn\u2019t your area why would you be surprised some people are going to be more capable than you from the get go? Seems like that\u2019s to be expected. \n\nI don\u2019t think taking the perspective of the new guy is \u201cirrelevant\u201d if the concern stems from the new guy..? Seems like a logical comparison to me. I\u2019m also not a first year PhD, not sure why you\u2019ve brought that up so many times. Even if I was it doesn\u2019t discredit my viewpoint. \n\nAt the end of the day this isn\u2019t nearly enough context for either of us to offer any meaningful advice. We\u2019re obviously interpreting what they\u2019ve said differently, so unless we got more info this is pretty pointless. \n\nI will admit my advisor is more conscious of mental wellness than most so my viewpoint is probably a little skewed. But either way the only actual advice I can give, regardless of the specifics, is that if you don\u2019t voice a concern you can\u2019t expect anyone to know.",

      "text": "absolutely a normal way to feel, I don't understand people saying that it's something to be concerned about lmao. In life generally, insecurity, competition, and jealousy probably go hand in hand. don't be too hard on yourself, these are extremely normal and human ways to feel. don't act on them obviously and over time, I'm sure your new lab member will grow on you! everyone has their own distinct strengths and weaknesses and maybe reassuring yourself about your own strengths will help (also at some point, I swear the new member will look to you for help/as a mentor figure, and putting that kind of small investment into developing someone can take away feelings of jealousy)",

      "text": "It's human, but I am glad you are aware of it and try to behave friendly. \nI've been on the \"receiving end\" of work jealousy (not grad school, but very similar. In a professional and quite competitive environment).\n\n I got along well with somebody elses, call her Sally, superiors/close co workers, call them Anna and Adam, and it was obvious for everybody around that Sally couldn't handle it.\n\nSally was a very ambitious and competitive person, and I think she felt I was stealing her spotlight. Which I obviously wasn't, as her role and her expertise were more vital to the workplace than mine. We rarely worked together. About 90 percent of the time they did their brilliant work that was vital for the very existence of the workplace, and then I would come in and help them with communication and marketing. But without people like them, I wouldn't even have a job. I did a good job there, and I'm proud of my profession, but each workplace has its \"core employees\" and \"support employees\", and although you need highly competent people in all roles, some are more vital than others. My expertise could be changed out with any other communication person, theirs were directly related to them as people (they all had phds and amazing networks). \n\nIt got really hard, actually, as I eventually became actual friends with Anna and Adam, but every time Sally was there, she either made me feel invisible or she was straight out rude. I didn't know what I'd done. I tried everything to make her like me. I was super friendly and accommodating. The others and I were friends. But she was just ice cold.\n\nIn the end I confided in Anna - which was difficult, as they were all good friends. She told me straight out that Sally was jealous of me as I'm quite chatty and outgoing, and she's more nerdy. She was literally the star of the workplace, but for some reason she was still scared that I constituted some kind of threat and it didn't seem like she could handle it. \n\nIronically Anna and I ended up collaborating on something which was hugely successful and did wonders to her career thanks to my help with communication. This came about as we had an open and friendly dialogue and could challenge each other. I never managed to do more than the bare minimum with Sally. So this attitude can be potentially damaging to your career. You need to contribute to other people's success in order to receive something back.  \n\nSorry, you got the whole long story here, but this was really upsetting. I wish Sally had been more mature about her jealousy. I ended up giving up. When I left that place, I kept in touch with Anna, but I have next to no contact with Adam. I see all 3 of them doing fun social stuff, and I know if it hadn't been for Sally, I could have been part of their life. I feel like great potential friendship was lost as I just \"quit\" to save myself from the constant humiliation. \n\nI can also completely understand where Sally's jealously came from. We all have it in us. But it's one of those instincts we have to challenge in ourselves.\n\nI can feel the same, but I try not to see people as competition. There is enough success in the world for all of us, it's not a zero sum game. I think dealing with these feelings is what makes us mature.",

      "text": "It\u2019s normal and perfectly healthy too. What would be unhealthy is to hold on to those feelings and not move past them. A lot of our social behaviour is based on group dynamics from deep in evolutionary history. It\u2019s normal to feel defensive and jealous when a new individual joins a group - those feelings are a part of the process of integrating the new individual and establishing a new group structure. Try to resolve the integration in a peaceful way.",

It must be uncomfortable and distressing. \n\nI can't relate, thankfully. \n\nI have only felt jealous/ insecure a handful of times in my life (thankfully), but on the few times I *have* I remember that I 100% DID NOT LIKE IT. \n\nIt feels bad, painful and it sucks.\n\nI don't know how common it is, but I do know that you don't deserve to feel this way. \n\nAre you able to see a counsellor on campus so that you can work through these feelings?",
