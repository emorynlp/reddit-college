      "text": "I know how you feel. Even though I prefer online classes due to my work hours being later in the day, it annoys me how much money I\u2019m essentially paying someone to teach myself material that was created by a third party education company. I\u2019m toughing out my last year before graduating in May. \n\nBut you can definitely transfer, it\u2019s not very common but it\u2019s a thing. The only problem is that most, if not all, graduate schools usually accept a maximum of 6-9 credits to be transferred (and that\u2019s if their curriculum has an equivalent of what you already took and they are willing to accept it). If you have less than 6 credits, go for it. If you have more than 6 credits, you need to understand that you could be potentially throwing money down the drain by losing credits.",
