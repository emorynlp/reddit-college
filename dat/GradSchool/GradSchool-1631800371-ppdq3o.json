  "text": "tl;dr at the bottom\n\nSo I'm a phd candidate at a humanities department. The chair of my committee is sadly very well known for taking long to reply, but it's been my experience that they would eventually  reply or at least that they would reply to my second email.\n\nThis time, however, not even my second email is getting a reply. I first wrote to them in mid-August, telling them I wanted to apply to some postdoc positions; I heard nothing from them. Then, last week, exactly a month before the application to one program is due, I wrote to them again, and I thought for sure they would reply, mainly because a friend had just told me that she had gotten an email from them. So I immediately wrote to the advisor, thinking that if I didn't get a response in a couple of hours, *for sure* I would get a reply the next day. It's been 4 days now, and no reply.\n\nThis program I'm applying to doesn't even need a recommendation letter right now, only if I'm shortlisted the committee will then ask candidates' references for reco letters. But I need from my advisor at least an acknowledgement that they I'm applying to this program.\n\nI now I need to write to them *yet again*, but I'm not sure what to say in the email: should I be upfront and say \"hey, I need at least an acknowledgement from you that I'm applying to this and that come the case you will send a reco letter.\"? Needless to say, I've been losing sleep over this situation.\n\n**TL;DR** How and what do I write to my advisor *for the third time* in order to get even an acknowledgement? I forgot to add: I'm not on campus, I'm away doing archival work, so email is the only way of communicating with them.\n\nEdit: pronouns\n\nEdit 2: I can only contact them through email.",

      "text": "Does your email ask for an acknowledgement of receipt? You shouldn't need to ask, but it could help.\n\nFinding a phone number and calling is a good idea, especially as urgency goes up. It sounds like you've not heard anything for a while - is it possible something could have happened to them?   \n\n\nTalking to the department chair could be a good next step, though it risks looking like you've gone over their head to their supervisor, something that can perturb many people. If you do this, you might frame like you are unsure if they were okay, especially in the time of COVID.  \n\n\nGood luck, I hope the uncertainty is resolved soon!",

          "text": "Thanks for the good vibes! Pretty sure they are fine, I wrote to them when I did because I had learnt a few seconds before that they have written to a friend of mine, so I knew they were sitting in front of their computer... Anyway, it's a good idea to write to the chair of the dept framing it that way, but I'm gonna try to see if I can call them first or even a third email. Pretty sure after three emails I can make a strong case to the chair of the dept saying \"look, is my advisor ok? I haven't heard from them in a while.\" Anyway,  thank you for your reply!",
