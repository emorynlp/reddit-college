  "text": "I\u2019m a new PhD student and I just finished a masters at another university. My masters degree went super well. I was in a biomechanics lab and I investigated if reduced limbs in an animal were vestigial or not. The project was super easy to develop- put the animal through multiple trials and try to find something the limbs contributed to. The proposal was quick, the trials were easy, can\u2019t complain. \n\nI am stuck. So stuck. I\u2019ve been sitting in my office for hours trying to think of a project idea. I\u2019ve wanted to work with metamorphic salamander biomechanics for AGES and now I\u2019m in a lab and have a committee that is backing me for this and I can\u2019t think of a single way to tie this all together. I\u2019ve had my first committee meeting and trying to express my ideas to them for the response of \u201cwell we really need you to go back and figure out what any of this really means\u2026\u201d\n\nThe problem is I think I\u2019m trying to add too much in. I really don\u2019t want to ask something like \u201chow does species x walk differently than species y\u201d because I\u2019m under the impression that, as a phd student, I should be bringing so much more in. \n\nI\u2019m also finding this incredibly frustrating when comparing to other branches of biology. For instance, phd students in my cohort (this is our first semester) in virology and micro are already running experiments?? How in the actual fuck do you design a project that fast?? It\u2019s more confusing because my committee remarked that \u201cI\u2019m ahead of the curve on communicating\u201d yet I\u2019m literally seeing students already pipetting in their labs?\n\nSo I\u2019m having a hard time gauging where I should be. My advisor is incredibly hands off (I\u2019ve seen her only a handful of times) and doesn\u2019t impress upon me any sort of expectations. \n\nIs this \u201cnormal\u201d \u201cI suck at grad school\u201d thoughts?",
