  "title:": "PSA: REMEMBER TO BACK UP ALL YOUR WORK THROUGH MULTIPLE SOURCES!!",
  "text": "My husband was working on some D&D stuff on my computer when my computer displayed a message that it needed to be reset. When it fired up again it said MY ENTIRE HARD DRIVE WAS WIPED. Thank the universe that when we restarted the computer again everything appeared fine (doing an anti-virus scan now). \n\nBut if the worst was to happen, I THANKFULLY had copied everything to my G Drive. I just finished my first semester of my grad program so it wasn't much work but it was still important for my ePortfolio. So after my anti-virus scan is done,  I'm going to back up my computer on a hard drive. \n\nRemember to have separate backups of your work!",

A bit paranoid but worth it I think. \n\nAlso, note that if you use google drive or Dropbox, in theory anything to do with lab should be on an account from your university, definitely human data.",

Basically, you choose which folders in your computer you want to be synced and everytime you add or modify something within these folders, it is automatically synced to your Google Drive. And the plus is that it also works the other way, meaning that if you add something to the corresponding folder on your Google Drive, it gets magically added to your computer.",

Most cloud services I have used are not archiving your data so if you are autosyncing and you delete a file or it syncs a corrupt version of the file then you are screwed. You have to also have another form of backup that does not overwrite your files.\n\nThis is important because if you ever corrupt or accidentally delete/overwrite something on your cloud backup you can easily go grab the old version of the file from your archive.\n\nI use an old computer that I sync once a week or two, then I archive the synced files to a 7zip file that cannot be overwritten. Once every two months or so I also archive all my files to an external drive that I keep in a separate location.\n\nIf you're tech savy and have the hardware you should set up a NAS (freeNAS is a good OS choice that I also use) and tell it to sync a primary directory to your cloud, then to automatically archive (without overwriting) all the files within to a redundant array every so often.",

              "text": "*\"It's a feature\"*\n\nNo joke, I think it's either a \"feature/bug\" or a use case scenario that Microsoft hasn't thought about. I generally use my desktop (Windows) when I'm at home which I have Microsoft Office programs installed with files being saved into OneDrive. \n\nWhen I'm on campus, I use my MacBook for pretty much the same tasks. I sometimes leave a document open because I was working on it or I had an office hour and a student came in and then I needed to get to someplace else and I just close the lid. It just so happens that closing the lid on a laptop is something we do on a regular basis. It's also a lot easier to do this accidentally with programs open in the background. \n\nAs a result, when I go to my desktop, I get confused as to why I'm looking at a file that seems to be from a few days ago, only to realize that I still have the file open on the Mac which I need to slightly panic because a) I hope there's still battery life on the machine and b) I hope I don't get an error when I try to manually save the file and close it out AND have it synced to OneDrive.",

          "text": "You can never be too paranoid. Best to have two separate backups; you want to be prepared for your cloud storage password to be stolen or the software corrupting your data or a virus eating everything or whatever. Also, even if your cloud storage saves the important documents, it's a pain in the butt reinstalling all your programs if you have to switch computers, so a full disk backup is great.\n\nCloud storage is definitely better than nothing. In my five years of grad school, I knew two people whose laptops were stolen, two or three who spilled liquids on their laptops, and one who melted his graphics card until smoke came out. Cloud storage would have saved all of them.",
