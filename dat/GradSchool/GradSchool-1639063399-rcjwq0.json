  "title:": "Losing My Funding Over a Misunderstanding",
  "text": "So I'm a history graduate student at a tier-one university in the U.S. and I'm taking three courses. \n\nThis semester, I took a course with two professors who have each been with the university for over ten years. They've taught the course before several times, including the final assignment. \n\nThe final assignment was different than any other course I've had, and every other student I spoke to was confused about the requirements for the 30-page essay. We were allowed to ask questions in class, but weren't sure what to ask because the syllabus outline was so vague. Regarding topic choice, the syllabus language was, \"Choose any topic related to race or ethnicity.\" \n\nMy mistake was not asking the professors directly if my topic idea was appropriate for the assignment. I finished my assignment two weeks before the deadline, before anyone else in the class, and sent the finished 30-pager to them for review. It was an analysis of Critical Race Theory bans in U.S. schools. Their response (via email) was that my topic did not reflect the \"spirit of the assignment\" and that I had to restart and submit a different proposal. When I asked if anything could be salvaged and if they were available for an in-person discussion about my submission, they said my assignment was completely unacceptable and declined to meet with me. When I told my peers about it, they said I \"took one for the team\" since none of them knew what to do, but my rejection helped them understand the assignment better. \n\nI met with my advisor completely panicked. (I had finished the proposal 2 weeks early so I could spend more time on revisions for an academic journal publication). I cried during the meeting, and she told me to \"grow up and grow a thicker skin.\" Great. Even so, she helped me choose a new topic and outlined how I should approach the second draft, which was incredibly nice and charitable. \n\nI finished the second draft on the day it was due (it took me 6 days total to pull it together). When I submitted the paper via email, I sent to both professors: \"Dear Drs. \\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_, Here is my second grant proposal. Thanks, Allie\\_turtle53.\" What I got back, however, was extreme. The professors responded to my email with a page-long, scathing review of my consistent disrespect of them. They said my use of the word \"second\" in my submission email suggested that they had wronged me in some way, when in fact my \"first\" submission had not met the requirements for the course. They ended that email by stating that they would be \"grading accordingly\" relating to my disrespectful attitude and the faulty first draft. \n\nMy response to them was standard: \"I'm so sorry... I never meant to disrespect you... when I said \"second\" I was only meaning to clarify that the first paper I sent would not be my final submission,\" etc. \n\nHowever, I checked the grad student handbook, and we are put on Academic Probation if we get one \"B\" in a course, which includes losing tuition funding and assistantship stipend. I'm almost certain I will get a \"B\" in this course, and I can't afford to go to school without having a stipend. \n\nJust a rant, but if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it!\n\n\nETA: the original project was an oral history harvest of school teachers who have had to adjust their teaching methods due to the CRT bans. How have they continued to teach CRT? What materials help them work CRT into their teaching?, etc.",

If they give me a low grade and I suspected that they were not grading based on merit, they could just argue that my work wasn't \"A\" material. I believe my final submission met all of their requirements and did what they had originally intended (albeit still a bit hazy on that part), and I followed the instructions laid out by my advisor (head of the department) to write the final draft. I still wrote a paper that I scraped together at the last minute, under extreme stress, and after I'd already wasted 5 days of hard work just exhausting myself.

The point in situations like this is to have a neutral, third party, provide an unbiased assessment of your work. If one professor wrote the email, but the other one approved its wording, then both professors threatened your grade, both behaved unprofessionally and inappropriately, and neither should be allowed to grade your final paper unless their grade was approved by a third, unbiased, supervisor.",

If the assignment instructions are not clear, then you can't be penalized for not following instructions. Professors can't just keep things vague and then penalize people for not being psychics. If your professor was too lazy or incompetent to craft a clear assignment, that is their problem and they need to fix it. \n\nSecond, your topic seems *extremely* related to \"the spirit of the assignment\" (which was vague, by the way) and your professor needs to provide a justification for requiring an additional topic. Your professor having a personal bias for or against that topic is not a good enough reason. If they let their personal biases get in the way of their responsibility as an educator, they should be fired.\n\nThird, sending you a page-long manifesto in response to a perceived sleight over a word in an email seems absolutely unhinged. This is the type of behavior a person with severe mental health problems would engage in. If your professor's mental problems are too severe that they can't competently perform their duties, they need a medical leave of absence. I'd keep the email for reference and to show to relevant parties later on. \n\nFourth, your adviser is a problem. Someone telling you to \"grow up\" after being subjected to an unhinged reaction by a person in a mental health crisis is toxic behavior. Your adviser needs to learn how to advise students. \n\nFifth, your professor saying they would grade your paper \"accordingly\" to your attitude is an admission that they cannot adequately judge your assignment on its merit. I would require that it be graded by a neutral third party. Someone who your professor does not collaborate with and has not published with would be a starting point, but this person should not be allowed to grade your assignment.",

Half of the master's students (1/4 of the class) are *not on the thesis-track,* so the \"spirit of the assignment\" requires that they invent a fake dissertation/thesis project to write about. So, if that's the case, why was my project topic rejected for being something I could not use later by their standards? (For the record, I was very proud of my first draft and considered actually creating a project out of it.... as in, it was something I could use later.)",

Fortunately, through a series of events, I did finish, although way behind schedule.\n\nAfter grad school, however, I learned the value of better communication practices. In my opinion, in academia, there is too much communication over written channels, and it is easy for emotional writing to get distorted. Fortunately in my postdoc, my PI and office staff understand that some detailed or potentially sensitive discussions are best handled over video call or in-person. If an email ends up being longer than two paragraphs, I usually handle it as a call (unless it's a detailed email containing step by step directions/requests)",
