An MBA (in most companies) won't help you jump to management without actual work experience. The best way to get into management is to work at a company and get to lead a couple of projects and have people love you, do some side courses/certifications on management and then hope a position in management opens. I've seen plenty of people without MBAs get promoted into management over those with MBAs based on industry experience alone.",

Work on non profits or join a startup or something. Hell, create your own udemy course and sell that. Marketing is one of those fields where you can get solid experience without needing formal roles or qualifications (as opposed to say, chemists or economics). \"Fresh grads with 5 years experience\" in marketing isn't uncommon.",

You have 6 weeks to learn a class while working FT. Only one class per week. Sorry, but 6 weeks isn\u2019t enough time to master a course. Pre 2010 classes were double their current length 10-12 weeks and classes met more than one time per week. Tests were not open book and open notes. Learning modules were often approved prior to the start of the year to include new material. \n\nI started data science this year and noticed the changes. Schools are completely disorganised. One class in and I\u2019m already convinced I\u2019m in a junk university.\n\nFor example: I\u2019m in SQL. We\u2019re using exam # 70-462 MCSA MCSE (2012 edition) Well that might have been fine and all in early 2020 as microsoft hadn\u2019t yet retired this exam. They now use a different version making the material outdated. I\u2019m paying 2400 to learn outdated material!? I relayed this information to CS office and they stated they found out this late and couldn\u2019t require all the current students to re-purchase new books. \n\nWell its not our f-up. Its theirs. They should be supplementing the material for their oversight. But they don\u2019t because I\u2019m now convinced they care more about head-counts and revenue than they do about student outcomes.",

Would you like your job if your manager was more supportive? Would you like your job if you had more face to face interaction with colleagues?

As someone said above, check the box: has masters degree. You mention not liking coding, I will warn you that is the way most fields are going/are. Marketing is already focused on predictive analysis, machine learning etc. I am in chemistry and my analysis is dependent on coding. It really is everywhere. What specifically do you like about that field, can you work on some project in your current job to get different experience?
