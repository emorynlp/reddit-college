I was given this advice by another professor when I asked him about working in his lab. He said he might be able to fund me, but I'd probably be better off with the professor I ended up working for and collaborating with him, because their research areas overlapped.\n\nI guess I was fortunate to have an advisor who was well connected in his field of study and has a lot of former students all over the industry. We consider ourselves a big family and we look out for each other as much as we can. There is a certain conference we all attend that is kind of like a \"family reunion\".\n\nMy advisor never really had too many former students go into academia. He's not sure why, but it is what it is.",

There's also the possibility that the candidate could perform poorly which will make it harder to recommend anyone else in the future.\n\nI've seen a handful of occasions where professors nudged students to certain opportunities. These were cases where the students were clearly high potential, and it was the professors who approached them, knowing they'd be a perfect fit for something.\n\nProfessors are professors, not job recruiters. Go to your school career center or network at relevant gatherings. If you're having problems finding a job, that's completely on you.

The other problem is that most professors seem to overly promise graduate students that there is a high chance for them to have a full-time job with a high salary after graduating from their programs, which is farthest from the truth. In other words, many graduate students are being deceived from the truth. Also, another problem is that people within academia look down on graduate students who want to pursue a career that's outside of academia.",

Anyone at the graduate level has no excuse for neglecting to put in some due diligence.\n\nUnless a program has outright lied on their employment report, professor/program opinions are just that, opinions. Even with matching personal research, program employment report, and professor opinions, industry is always at risk of a sudden downturn.\n\nWhen it comes to finding an industry job, it isn't the smartest students who get the best offers, it's the students who work the hardest at networking, job searching, and interview prep. Hopefully your program is ranked high enough to be competitive in the current environment, but you'll still have to be ready to prove why you're different and add more value than anyone else coming from an equal or higher ranked school.\n\nI've been working in industry a few years now and only 2 out of 6 recommended students from my school have made it to a job offer. I personally thought all six were outstanding, but there are over 200 applicants for each opening. If I referred every student who pinged me on LinkedIn or the school asked me to consider, the hiring managers would tell me to stop spamming them with mountains of crap.\n\nIf one of them performs poorly, it will reflect on me, and my future credibility to recommend great candidates is shot. If any of your professors saw you as the perfect fit that would boost their reputation, they will approach you. If you're not where you want to be with finding a job, the likely remedy is to take more personal responsibility and give the job hunt everything you have.",

For people who know they want to go into industry after a PhD, it is pretty important to get 1-2 summer internship experiences under the belt. \n\nI think it is usually easier to find postdocs than industry jobs or academic jobs. If postdocs last long (3-4 or more years), that usually hurts while trying to go back to industry (people assume you wanted to be an academic, couldn't, failed and now you are switching). But I've heard postdocs of 1-2 years (if you are gaining valuable skills for industry) tend to help with job search. If you can't find a job right away, you might want to do a short postdoc instead of volunteering (I'm assuming you are finishing up your PhD?).\n\n I agree, it's quite shocking for your advisor to tell you to volunteer. Firstly, most companies would not want to have volunteers: that's just too complicated work law-wise (since it is free labor). Secondly, have they never had to support themselves and depended on rich parents or something? Weird.",

So was her spouse.\n\nI think many faculty would like to help more, but they can't. For those who would like to help more, you'd have to wonder what kind of training they would need. I think even just learning how to talk to students about their career options would be helpful - like basic career counseling skills. But how many would do it?\n\nI do think there's no excuse for them to not be aware of the crisis *within* academia. Almost every school subscribes to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Higher Ed, or something similar. But I do think that those who've been successful in academia, especially those under 40, put their blinkers on in grad school saying \"la la la there is no crisis I'll be fine\" and that ignorance/denial carried into their TT jobs, and now it's validated their beliefs.
