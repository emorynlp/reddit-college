  "text": "It's nearly 3 am and I have no one in real life to tell, so I just wanted to put it down here.\n\nThis summer I taught my first solo class as a graduate student: it was a new prep, outside my area of expertise, nearly triple over-enrolled, and newly online and asynchronous due to Covid-19. Since Covid hit right before I started, none of my advisors or department even had a chance to give my syllabus a look. I did my very best recording videos, providing feedback, coding a modular structure for my course website.\n\nDespite it all, I finished grading the last exam tonight and the student work/feedback has been universally awesome. I never really fancied myself a teacher, but I'm feeling pretty proud tonight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS/o to all us graduate students making it happen!",

More students in my department want teaching experience than we have classes for them to teach, since generally only faculty teach classes at my school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll be honest, my advisors suggested I do it (even though I wasn't sure I wanted to) for job market reasons & to make sure I would be okay doing it as a career. Was a lot of work, but more fun than I anticipated for sure.",

          "text": "Yeah, so in brief: I did what I thought was a good idea, given the context of the pandemic.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe class I taught is usually a 2 lectures per week and a lab class, but I was to offer it async, which immediately makes engagement an issue.\n\nSo I set the class up in weekly modules, where I would have: lectures, readings, a practice quiz, and a reflection assignment (i.e. a fun & flexible essay lol). I then gave absurd amounts of feedback, open-world midterm and final essays (untimed, use the internet, you do you). I made everything in the class due at 11:59 PM every Sunday, but basically said I'd give you an extension if you communicated with me before the deadline - no late work with no communication. The class was worth 100 points, so no dumb rounding or anything either.\n\nSo I had (from a class of 55) with 5 practice quizzes (graded on completion), 4 reflection journals, a midterm and a final...only 1 missing assignment. Only 3 students ever asked for short extensions - all of which were covid 19 related and didn't impede my grading at all. I held synchronous office hours and always had between 6-10 students even in non-exam times. They would come with questions about things both inside and outside the purview of the class.\n\nThey expressed gratitude that I didn't make them do discussion posts to each other, they liked the flexibility of the writing assignments, they liked that I didn't micromanage them into daily engagement but kept them 'in the game' with weekly engagement. I made sure that my recorded lectures touched on relevant things in the news that week and had a box of myself chatting away in the window: they liked that and said it made it more engaging and less artificial. I talked about my own research and papers once in a while and they really liked that - said too often teachers don't see themselves as experts. I assigned an 8 dollar book that was available in electronic or physical form & worked with the library to get all other readings on E-Reserve and linked to my course page.",

I have been there and I find there are two types of graduate students..those who enjoy teaching and those who don't after their first experience. \n\nWhat we should really congratulate you on is your resilience. My wife and I moved our two kids out to Arizona last year for a job opportunity and I am still in grad school. We moved away from all our friends and family. We tried to stay but in the end it was not in the cards with the way the job interviewers were progressing. Being on your own, not being able to just talk to someone who knows what you are going through, not having a steady mentor or coach nearby is tough.\n\nBeing alone is tough, being able to put it all together to teach and empower others is resilience. Keep up the good work. Continue to hone your teaching process and delivery. Check out this learning method if you like: Universal Design for Learning Link here [UDL](http://udlguidelines.cast.org/)",
