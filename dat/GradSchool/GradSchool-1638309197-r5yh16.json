Download it, create your items by dragging and dropping the PDFs of the papers, or by using the Zotero button in Google Chrome (very useful for citing webpages), or by looking up the paper in Zotero with the magic wand button and some identifier like the ISBN or DOI. Once you have your citable items, you can generate citations from them in any style you need.",

Endnote can organize your citations and list them in whatever format that you prefer using different citation styles that they either have in their library or that you can get directly from the publisher that you will need. And it will also update your citation values for your in-text citations as it needs to be updated to have them be in that chronological format that most scientific writing to use. You can also change your physical reference list to use any abbreviations that you might need, you can create groupings of citations and make notes and download the abstracts, and you can use it for footnotes and any other citation features that you might require. I would highly recommend the use of end note, it has vastly improved my citation experience when it comes to any of my writing.",
