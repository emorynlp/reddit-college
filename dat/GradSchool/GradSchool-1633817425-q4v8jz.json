  "title:": "Undergrad invited to take anthro grad seminar...terrified, need advice.",
  "text": "Hi all, \n\nThe short version is that I\u2019m an (older) undergraduate anthro student who was invited to take a graduate seminar and I am badly intimidated, primarily by a presentation. I\u2019m trying to figure out strategies, and before this coming Wednesday, whether I\u2019m better off dropping the class. Thanks in advance for any advice. \n\nI worked with this professor last year on an undergraduate research fellowship in anthropology.  It did go well, but I was nonetheless surprised when she invited me to take her graduate seminar this year. Normally I would\u2019ve hesitated more, I think, but the topic of the seminar is maps and cartography, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with maps my whole life. It felt fated. I also felt fairly confident in my ability to understand and appreciate the material of the class. I suspect the reason she invited me to the seminar had to do with my consistently reading and synthesizing academic literature (mostly ethnographies) on our topic for the research fellowship. \n\nI started the seminar two weeks ago, and I\u2019ve realized that in considering my ability to understand the material, I overlooked some other aspects of the class I might not feel ready for. First and foremost, we\u2019re tasked with presenting and facilitating one day of material for the class. It\u2019s around an hour of being on the spot. The assignment:\n\n\u201cEach week someone (or several someones) will be responsible for facilitating our exploration of the materials. These presentations should not be summaries or lists of questions, but rather critical commentaries and exercises that engage the readings and situate them within larger debates and issues. You are encouraged to be creative and incorporate activities that draw us into the materials, debates, and issues.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the longest presentation I\u2019ve ever done has been about ten minutes, and it was done as a group. For another, I am finding myself intimated by the people in my class, many of whom are several years into their Phd programs, were my TAs in other classes, and have a level of confidence and casual use of academic and intellectual vocabulary that I just don\u2019t have. I'm a good writer, but that doesn't always translate to speaking. Many of these folks have been teaching undergrad discussion sections for years. They all have their own (very specific) independent research projects that seem to tie in to the class. \n\nIn this sense, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m in the wrong place. Imposter syndrome for sure, but with some definite basis in reality. I need to decide if I\u2019m going to drop the class by the deadline this Wednesday. I\u2019ve emailed the professor since I have another class during her office hours, but she\u2019s hard to get in touch with. I\u2019m going to try to talk to her after class on Monday. But I\u2019m interested in any advice about whether I should be in the class at all, and if so, strategies to present/facilitate and get used to this environment. Has anyone else felt this way in their first grad school classes?\n\nI do have my own plans for grad school next year, but it's a professionally-focused applied anthro MA program at a state college, rather than an advanced, academic Phd program at a major research university\u2014which this seminar is a part of. So I'm guessing it will be a bit less intimidating than this. But I could be wrong. \n\nThanks all.",

      "text": "Hi! I used to be in exactly your shoes! I was an undergrad who finished all of my major courses and was invited into a graduate level course - now I am in grad school at a different institution and let me tell you: the class is intimidating to everyone! It\u2019s going to feel like it\u2019s just you because you\u2019re the undergrad (the odd man out, you somehow fooled this professor into thinking you\u2019re smart enough to do this, etc etc) but even if you don\u2019t have that distinction, grad classes are scary when you\u2019re starting out! \n\nMy own experience in your situation, I just tried my best and the graduate students were very welcoming and I realized by the end that we were actually all at similar levels (I wasn\u2019t quite equal on all fronts but like any other students there were somethings that I did better than others and some I did worse). So, while I can\u2019t tell you what to do obviously I would recommend you try to stick it out. You\u2019re feeling normal grad school feelings with a little extra fear because of the feeling that you \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d. You do belong! You were granted admission to the course based on your merit and scholarship just like all of the actual grad students in the program. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this! Don\u2019t sell yourself short.",

      "text": "I haven\u2019t been in your shoes, but as a fellow anthro person (psychological anthro) I wish I would have had the opportunity to do something like this as an undergrad! Take the opportunity. As another person already said, anthro people *love* to discuss. So it\u2019s most likely not like you\u2019ll be giving an hour presentation, just you\u2019ll take on the role of facilitating the discussion for that time. That\u2019s completely different than giving a presentation. You just gotta get the ball rolling and people talking.\n\nTo give you a few ideas on how you might lead the class on a specific week: My current (phd) program\u2019s approach to leading the class is to have little blurbs prepared about the main argument of the piece, info about the author (I suspect to establish their positionality), and criticisms. Lately it\u2019s been some interesting discussions on the author\u2019s positionality and how that may have impacted their arguments or observations, or how that impacted their work in general. Plus a discussion on ethics like who can/should do research, where can they do it, how do we mitigate harm. Oh yeah and questions. Very important. My last program (masters) was more vague, just basically you had to introduce the reading with a short summary and the main points, followed by whatever questions or discussion points. \n\nAnd yeah it\u2019s intimidating, but people are kind. Don\u2019t sell yourself short! But of course make the decisions that are best for you.\n\nEdit to add some sentences",

      "text": "Specifically about the large presentation, let me soothe some of your fears as someone who took a grad seminar in archaeo. I had to do an hour teaching twice -- I was prepared but it ended up not mattering much. Because oh my god, grad students love to discuss. You bring up one discussion point and they'll discuss for the full hour if you let em, especially anthro people. There is just so many different things to explore in anthro and different sides of discussions to explore. And if they have fleshed out research already, they'll discuss that and how it relates to the topic that is brought up. So, when developing the discussions, make the questions something that relates to the material but asks for introspective discussions to keep everything flowing. Let's say your topic is climate refugees or something. You could pose a question like \"How does anthropological research create solutions for complex political and social problems, especially with something that is still considered controversial, like climate change?\" This allows for people to discuss politics, social structures, management, climate discourse, science communication, etc... That is how you create a larger debate and discussion. I hope this helps a bit, let me know if you have questions!",
