  "text": "I am in the worst group for a group project now. One of the girls is constantly ghosting us and cancelling meetings and the other girl is constantly being short with me (rather than the other girl, who isn\u2019t pulling her weight). Maybe it\u2019s just a difference in communication styles, but the second one I mentioned always comes across short with me, or just heated in general. I want to cry right now. One of them pushed back our meeting, and the other girl is being really short with me because I suggested something that she didn\u2019t agree with.\n\nI hate group projects. I understand that they are a part of professional life, but i find that group projects I\u2019ve experienced at my professional jobs differ vastly from those in graduate school. It seems like a lot of people in my program don\u2019t give a shit, constantly take shortcuts, and the majority don\u2019t speak/turn their cameras on in class.",

For example, I worked in a small company one time where you could count on the son of the company founder often doing nothing if you had to collaborate with him.\n\nAnd same is true for grad school. Some students in some grad school programs will be better than others. But certainly, people can be a little more invested when they're getting paid for their work and they might have to work with those people in the future.",

      "text": "It must be nice to work in a job where people are responsible. Throughout my 8 years working in a consulting firm (group size ranging from 2 to 20, projects lasting from a 2\\~28 months), I was assigned to a responsible and cooperative group once.  Don't know about OP, but for others interested in joining consulting, I would say those school group projects (for the most part) are great ways to learn about \"real-world\" group projects. \n\nI want to share my experience, just in case anyone ends up in a field where most of the work is done in projects. \n\n1. Project groups will always be a mixed bag (by design)  \n\\- Management wants as many projects running simultaneously as possible. To guarantee quality on all the projects, rather than putting all their best employees in one project, they spread them out evenly across different projects.  \n\\- If you find yourself pulling a lot of weight, and we assume your professor knows about your work ethic and commitment, it is possible that your professor put you in that role on purpose.\n2. There are so many ways to be irresponsible   \n\\- During a project in a foreign country, one of my directors was caught living with a mistress. When his wife found out, he hid in the countryside for several weeks causing the project to be delayed.  \n\\- I was assigned to a project with a senior staff member. turned out he was hired because of his family connections and was incapable of performing any of the necessary tasks he was assigned (and he admitted this to me too). I just had to do his job since one of our firm's partners assigned him to my project. \n3. Dealing with people is usually the most challenging aspect of a job, but you get better with practice.   \n\\- If you find your core duties to be the most challenging aspect of your job, you may want to consider a different profession, or your employer may make that decision for you.   \n\\- Aside from your core duties, dealing with people was the most difficult aspect of my job. If I knew how closely my professional life would resemble group projects in school, I would have used those opportunities to test different strategies dealing with those issues. \n4. Some suggestions (no guarantee they will work)  \n\\- Don't be a pushover, but don't be a bully: if you don't stand your ground, she may trample you  \n\\- Listen to her suggestions but take out the emotions: conflict is not always a bad thing in projects. If she's passionate about the subject, but lacks communication skills, try to focus on the points she's making and try to ignore the tone. you may find new directions that improve your project.
