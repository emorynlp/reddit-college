  "title:": "Does Dartmouth MPH interview invite = acceptance?",
  "text": "I was invited for an interview for the Dartmouth accelerated MPH program and someone on SDN said in a webinar they mentioned all accepted candidates get a 20 min phone call with an alum.\n\nThis has led many people to wonder if the interview invitation informally means you were accepted to the program, and will receive acceptance shortly after. Is this true?!! This is my dream program for so many academic and logistical reasons so I\u2019m trying to hold my horses before jumping to any official conclusions. Any insight is appreciated!!",
