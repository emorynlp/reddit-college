  "text": "I\u2019m doing my MA online because of COVID and family obligations making it impractical for me to move somewhere for in-person school, and it\u2019s absolutely killing me. This is my second program. I dropped out of the first after a semester, and as I near the end of this semester, I just feel so\u2026 cut off. \n\nI think as far as online programs go the one I\u2019m in is basically as good as it gets. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be happier in a different one. I think I just hate online school. But it\u2019s the only way I\u2019m getting a degree any time soon. \n\nAnyone else feel like they\u2019re trapped in the world\u2019s most expensive book club, while peers in \u201cthe real world\u201d are going to classes and building careers and being the adults we want to be?",

I took a brain composition test about 4-5 years ago I just recently retook it and my stats improved by a lot since starting grad school. Skills like planning went up to the 99th percentile. I do see that in my every day life I do feel like planning skills have improved and has helped in every aspect of my life. So I don\u2019t think I really can be mad about my time investment.",

Even though I *know* I am interested in the topics being discussed, I just can't seem to care as much as I used to. Plus it definitely doesn't feel real tbh. It's so hard to communicate when most of my classmates are attending in person! It's made my anxiety worse. So yeah, I get what you mean.",
