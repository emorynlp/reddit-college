  "text": "I'm not sure how competitive I am at the graduate programs to which I've applied. Determining relative competitiveness seems much harder for grad school than for undergrad, especially for more specific subjects ( ie not law school, med school, business school etc). I'd really like to avoid the scenario where I don't get in anywhere because I didn't apply to enough math/safety schools. \n\nHow do I go about gaging how competitive I am for any given school and making sure I apply to enough realistic places that I'm not left with nowhere to go? I can provide more detailed info about my particular situation and background as needed. Thanks!",

      "text": "I think a good idea would be to gauge the core curriculum that should be available through the school\u2019s website. Do you have a good grasp on the subjects? Have you taken these courses before or have been introduced to them? If not, look through short videos on YouTube and see how well you can understand the material. How much research they require and funding situation. I added in funding situation because if you had to work through grad school that\u2019s also another \u201cdifficulty\u201d that\u2019s associated with grad school. Also look at the current and past students profile pages (eg LinkedIn) and see how they compare to yours. Do they have lots of honors or research under their belt prior to the school? What about during or after? Also consider the average time it takes to finish, that may also allow you to gauge how difficult it may be to graduate and if it fits your timeline. Just some things I would consider when choosing schools (for fit).",
