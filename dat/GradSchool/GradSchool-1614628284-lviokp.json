  "text": "My lab recently learned that we lost a labmate due to a probable suicide. I am wracked with guilt and regret that we could have done more to support her. We have a nose to the grindstone lab culture that does not leave ample room for social relationships. As a result I don\u2019t feel that I knew her on a deep level but I am profoundly shaken by her death. I don\u2019t know how to cope with these feelings or how to move forward. I feel angry at myself and my lab that we let her down. It feels wrong to throw myself back into my work and work towards research deadlines again but I don\u2019t know what else to do.",

I know how hard it can be to leave a position when you worked so hard to to get there.",

You\u2019ve gotten some comments on this post that offer great advice and I hope that you\u2019re able to take the time you need to process this event and move forward. \n\nThere\u2019s a graduate student organization at my school designed to help students early in the program and prevent these things from happening. There are also similar organizations at other schools. As one commenter said, having a purpose and something to do may be helpful to you here, and if that would work for you, getting a group of students together and starting an organization like this on your campus could be something you could do to satisfy that need.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you and your class.\n\nMy closely-knit program lost one of our peers to a horrifically violent murder last year. We were obviously devastated, and our program faculty found itself in a conundrum due to the rigor of our program curriculum  that seemed to exist in conflict with our need to grieve and process this loss and trauma.  They did grant us some leniency with our assignments for a few weeks following the event, with the expectation that we would take the initiative to reach out to them if we needed an extension on a deadline. \n\nSomething that was tremendously helpful in giving us space to process our loss while staying on track academically was to hold a group counseling session with our school therapist.  I honestly felt apprehensive going into the session, but I noticed a major shift in the energy and outlook of my group as a whole, and feel that many of us turned a corner after that.  It\u2019s so important to have space to fully process and move through these experiences.",

      "text": "I'm sorry for your loss. I think your feelings are normal, and I would definitely talk to someone about it, whether it is your therapist or a grief counselor, or both. I also think it's important to practice self care, whatever that looks like for you. Someone mentioned to be wary of advice suggesting that you throw yourself into your work, and I agree depending on who it's coming from. If it is helpful for *you* to take your mind off of things rather than watch Netflix and eat takeout, then I'd consider that part of self-care. If your PI is the one giving that advice, I'd look at it with some serious side eye. Work *can* be helpful for individuals experiencing a loss or some trauma, but it isn't always or for everyone, so I think the focus should be on your mental health, what you want to do, and what is best for you. \n\nI also very much agree with others suggesting that a serious look at the lab culture needs to take place. It's a huge red flag to me that you said your lab culture does not leave room for social relationships. Your PI's work is not that important, regardless what they think or what they say. You are human beings, not slaves or drones, and you have social needs as any human being does. If the lab work does not leave room for social relationships, then the lab work needs to change. I also feel like it's handicapping you and your labmates, because part of the educational experience in graduate school is networking. Unfortunately, it's not always what you know that helps secure a job, but who you know, so I think networking should be an integral part of any graduate education.\n\nIf your PI's work environment is one that gives you anxiety and depression, or contributes to it, that is a toxic environment. I know someone who was in a toxic lab and justified it for years before finally having a breakdown. They were diagnosed with PTSD. Any PI that contributes to a culture that gives their students the same mental disorder combat veterans get should be jailed, and blacklisted for all academic and research institutions for life. It's honestly not that hard to not abuse your students. I'd pay critical attention to how your labmate's suicide is addressed moving forward. Serious changes *should* be made moving forward and things should not just go back to normal in a week or two. This is a serious and traumatizing experience and needs to be treated as such, not just like a break from research or an inconvenience. It's good that he reached out via email, but the conspiratorial side of me wonders if he did that because email is official university communication and he reached out so there'd be a record. His actions moving forward would shed more light on whether this was genuine or something he felt like he had to do in case there was any questions.",

One of my colleagues committed suicide about ten years ago and afterward all of us wondered if we could have done something. But in all honesty, we had no idea what she was dealing with in her personal life. We had no idea why. All we could do is celebrate the time we had and tell her family stories about the time she worked with us. That meant a lot to her family and to our work group.

I can only relate to the labmate, where I felt really alone and isolated in my grindstone lab/department culture, and have seriously contemplated suicide. I don't think it's your fault, and I think a lot of it can be blamed on the culture of your lab. Sometimes, this kind of behaviour and culture was started from a few extremist students a while ago and just perpetuates for a long time, long past their graduation. Support and guidance for this kind of thing needs to come from the top-down, too, so the PI of the lab needs to also do more to foster a more open lab. If anything, I'd try to focus on yourself first to make sure you feel like you have enough social support so you wouldn't be next to suffer poor mental health, since it's apparent that your lab culture can cultivate it. Maybe also try to push for more openness in your lab now to try and prevent the cycle from perpetuating.",

One of my middle school students took his own life. I was the last teacher to talk to him that day and I was not in a great mood for a variety of reasons. I wasn't outwardly rude to him or anything, but I was usually a warm and fuzzy teacher and wasn't that day. If I'm totally honest, I still feel a twinge of guilt, but I have come to the realization that I was just one slice of my student's life. My interactions that day did not cause a young person to take their life. He made his horrible mistake based on a combination of factors that I probably could not have individually have stopped. \n\nI don't say any of that to gain sympathy here, but to say that I feel like you are where I was those years ago when it happened.

I can relate to what you're feeling right now, I was in an extremely similar situation a couple years ago. A couple months after I left my undergrad lab to go to grad school in a different state one of the grad students committed suicide. Our lab was extremely close, everyone (21+ undergrads, grad students, the PI) would go for drinks a couple times a month and we would hang out together outside of the lab often. None of us knew the grad student was struggling and even with being across the country I felt like I let them down because we texted the day before and I didn't sense anything wrong. I just want you to know that it'll get better with time and to reach out to a therapist/grief counselor or even your PI/lab members because they are likely feeling the same as you are right now.",

Luckily my lab mates were able to cover my next time point so I could go home and bawl. But that night, I felt the overwhelming need for some kind of control or action in my life, and because there was absolutely nothing I could do about my father's death, I decided to go back into lab and finish the last late night/early morning time points. Probably looked crazy from the outside, but I had already talked on the phone will all my (small) family, couldn't start planning any services (everything was closed), and I don't know how to describe it, other than that accomplishing anything that day felt important for my soul?

Even physical machines in the lab need maintenance, and humans do too, beyond just a bare existence. I realize it is easier said than done as this may come off as \"just don't feel guilty\" which one cannot really exactly reprogram. But there are maybe forms of self-care that you don't often access that you could and should right now so that you don't accidentally trigger the \"reward\" association in your brain. Long term part of taking care of mental health is allowing yourself to make space for the human needs of life beyond producing a tangible output that can be recognized and rewarded by others. It sounds like you are not in a work environment that allows that, and for that I am absolutely enraged on your behalf. I hope you can allow yourself the generosity that it sounds like you would absolutely extend to anyone else in this situation. If a friend came to you, what would you advise they do to take care of themselves? Maybe see if you can kind of step outside of yourself and pretend like you are giving someone else that permission, and then really you're taking it for yourself.",

I ended up taking a few days off because I couldn\u2019t imagine going back to work (to me it felt wrong to just return to normal and I also really didn\u2019t want to face the people in my lab that also knew about her passing away because it felt like acknowledging it and I wasn\u2019t ready to yet). I don\u2019t really remember exactly what I did during those days. I know I spent some time in bed just doing nothing but thinking about my memories with her and crying. I attended some zoom memorials (and a small in personal candlelit vigil) and eventually I got to the point where I was watching Netflix or something and just kind of crying intermittently (especially as things in the show would remind me of her). I also took some time to connect with other friends of hers. And I wrote a letter to her. \n\nThen I needed to get back to work because I had a presentation to give the following week, but I took it easy. I only did as much work as I could. \n\nThis definitely doesn\u2019t have to be your approach. If you feel like working will help you, then go for it. But if you need time off, I think you should take it. And I think any kind of self care you can give yourself doesn\u2019t have to be thought of as a \u201creward\u201d, but can be a way to take care of yourself during this difficult time. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope you do want you need to, to take care of yourself \ud83d\udc99",
