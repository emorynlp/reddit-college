  "text": "Hi all! I\u2019m in my second year of my PhD program, and I just took and passed my qualifying exam. My research is at the intersection of applied math, robotics, and classic mechanical engineering, and all of the questions asked in the closed session were very philosophical, which I was not prepared for. I rambled incessantly and constantly overstepped my \u201cbounds of knowledge\u201d. I passed, but did not feel good about it.\n\nI\u2019ve always been good at \u201cschool\u201d i.e. doing the prescribed work. Until grad school, I haven\u2019t needed be scholarly and develop academic critical thinking, and it shows. I often feel like I don\u2019t have \u201cunique\u201d thoughts, in that I just compile a bunch of thoughts collected from others. How to I practice being an \u201cextrapolatory\u201d thinker, not just \u201cinterpolatory\u201d thinker?",

      "text": "Good for you, for realizing that you need to grow in this area.\n\nMy advice is to read more, and to read more critically.  Find a difficult paper in your field and really go through it in detail.  Derive all the equations, look up the references if you need to, ask yourself whether you agree with the conclusions drawn from the data.  Go back to the foundational papers if you need to.  The more deeply you engage in the material, the more connections and gaps and issues you start to see.  This takes some time to develop but it's very rewarding!",

      "text": "They're had already been a lot of good comments on here and you should realize that this is because most of us were in your same exact situation some time ago. \n\nI came from a mechanical engineering background into a chemistry heavy, materials science group and I felt like you did, except I even feel I was an inadequate compiler of other's thoughts! :P you have to remember that head school is still school and you're expected to learn more of the unique creative thinking as part of your candidacy. \n\nwhat's happened to me and what I often see happened to other grad students is that you go should I process to eventually get to be a unique and creative thinker in your field. It takes years of research and being deep in your feels to get to this point and to feel what you feel where you are now is perfectly normal. If you play a musical instrument it's a very similar analogy. You first learn to play other people songs badly then you learn to play them well then you make really bad music that you created yourself and then you actually start to write and create good music. You should realize that you'll go to the same thing in grad school where first you're able to recreate could work well which sounds like it's where you are now (congrats you already on number two!), Next you'll come up with either bad ideas or ideas that other people have come up with already and that will be discouraging to but just remember it's part of the process. then you actually start to come up with ideas that are not that bad and then you actually start to come up with really good ideas and then your advisor kicks you out of grad school because you're done :)\n\nHope this helps in some way!",

Then, keep reading everything you can get your hands on so you keep you knowledge base broad while also deepening it with your studies. \n\nTry reading the philosophies of whatever you're studying. This is where the professional thinkers will model their process for you, and then you can learn to apply their method to other situations.",

      "text": "This question largely depends on the scope of your ambitions. A few comments here are pointing out the incremental work that makes up the backbone of normal science. Becoming an expert at this is the most sure fire way to become well known as an academic thinker in your field.  \n\n\nHowever if you want to be *original* in the sense of creating paradigm shifts, you need to be on the lookout for areas where data imply a deficiency within the current conception of the system. Investigating these discrepancies can lead to the creation or destruction of new theoretical entities or, more rarely, a complete recasting of the theory of the field.  Sometimes you can see these coming: solving the problem of dark energy is a clear example of where someone will become known for (likely) doing the former. For information surrounding this process I always recommend *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* by Kuhn.   \n\n\nSecondly, you noted that the problems raised in your qualifying exam were philosophical and beyond your scope. This may sound glib, but that means you should try to find classes or mentors or both that can help you in the philosophy of this field. Without going too deep into examples, new sciences or new perspectives on old sciences *almost always* precipitate from someone being familiar with the philosophy of the field. Philosophy (properly practiced) is the foundry of new sciences. Newton, Turing, Einstein, Fodor (who you might be familiar with as a roboticist)  all brought philosophy to bear on their fields. If, as we implied in the first paragraph, revolutionary ideas are the ones we haven't figured out how to measure yet, then it makes sense to look to philosophy for the next step.   \n\n\nOne note: Not all fields are at a place historically where this kind of revolution is possible. Mendel got lucky with his research on pea genetics, but the field at large couldn't assimilate this information for a long time after his death, and he was ignored. So... good luck.",

It doesn't make you twice as marketable; it can often make you less skilled if you have to spend all of your time learning two fields at an ok level versus one at an exceptional level. Double majoring like that may make it difficult to find time to get involved in the sorts of clubs, activities, and research which are more marketable than a second major. You can also look at just doing a concentration within your original major to focus on what you feel is most of interest.\n\nI did my undergrad in materials engineering with a minor in physics, but I focused on electronic materials and mostly took classes within the physics department which supported that (mostly pre-reqs then quantum, some extra thermo, and solid state physics). Taking classes on string theory honestly wouldn't help me in what I wanted to do, so I didn't bother with them. Instead I worked for a few professors and participated in professional society chapters.\n\nEdit: I should also mention if you do go to graduate school to do research, what you learned in undergrad is really only the start of what you'll need to learn. Your undergrad degree with give you a way to look at the world, and that'll give you your own, unique way of approaching the problems you want to tackle. My lab had materials engineers, physicists, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, etc. Each of us had a different way of wanting to approach a research project, and that, itself, helped me start to look at problems in a totally different way.",

      "text": "A few posts here describe incremental advances and a less of the need to be a \"unique\" thinker; to an extent, I agree, but I think the answer isn't so simple.\n\nWithin our research, it is important to make the incremental steps; but great research questions come when you stop and see a problem from another perspective... a, \"that's weird...\" moment. From my point of view, I feel that the chances for this increase when you DO develop this \"academic thinking\" you describe. And I should say, there are plenty of successful people in research that don't necessarily evoke this academic thinking; it all comes down to what YOU want out of it.\n\nSo, how do you go about it? Well, it is different for everyone. But here is how I tended to go about developing some level of a skill like that; first, I acted as a sponge for all sources of information. Several mandatory seminars are not always related to my work / field, but I still took notes and tried to understand \"how did they arrive at this conclusion, what steps did they take to identify the problem?\" If someone has a question that you think is good, write it down and look it up later. Casting a net like this, though it seems like so much of it is \"useless,\" at least exposes you to the idea. It will be very difficult to make new connections between ideas if you only know one side.\n\nSecond, surround yourself with people who tend to think this way; not just your peers. Find the people you can have conversations with about new ideas, that seem like they have a curiosity. Not everyone you meet in grad school has a deep drive for curiosity and trying new things.\n\nThird, question everything. At least in STEM, there is a pressure to get the student up and running, get in the lab, start generating data! That pressure leads to these monolithic dogmas that are the protocols and calculations. Do this, it works, here is the calculation, run it through there and get your result; well, sure. If you want to be a human robot / calculator, then that serves its purpose. But, ask why do it this way, what happens at this step, what can go wrong, why does it go wrong, what else could you do, why does this calculation work at each step of the way, what do the numbers going in and coming out represent in the real world? Understand the concepts, that will inevitably promote a deeper line of questioning.\n\nFourth, Think! Just think! In presentations, etc, think about what they could do next, what could this mean? Do any concepts you know interact? If you had an idea, how would you show it? Look it up! Take some time to go through the literature and see if there is any supporting evidence for your idea. Remember, almost every idea anyone has is a bad one; but you can only know it is bad by referencing the evidence.\n\nAnd, lastly I guess, keep an open mind. Just because someone says something, that doesn't make it true. Just the other day I gave a presentation where someone said something that I disagree with. That is their position, they are my senior, but that is still just an idea. Just as my position is an idea. Be open to changing your position, but don't always accept something purely based on someone's seniority.\n\nOne more thing! Think about the future of your field; where is it going? What seems to be the next frontier? Do you have a lot of stock in that? If you feel that there is a future in this or that, try to understand why you think that. It takes introspection, but that can be very rewarding. My caution here is that it can also put you at odds with others who don't feel that way. It can also be isolating, and you could very well be wrong. It is the future because it hasn't been adopted as the norm yet, or there are things left to iron out. What is holding it back? How can you address that?\n\nMost likely, our gradschool work will not be the earthshattering publication we always hope for. But, at the heart of everything I said, there lies two concepts: curiosity and understanding. Memorization is not understanding, but rather a piece of reference information that you get from being introduced to the topic. Understanding can only happen when you start piecing the puzzle together yourself; something that requires curiosity and the willingness to invest your own time to ask \"why\" and get an answer.",

Most of us come from the background of being good at school, but taking it to the next level is foreign and can be challenging, especially when so much of school up to this point IS a regurgitation of knowledge.\n\nI can\u2019t pinpoint an exact moment where I started to think rather than just regurgitate or study, but I remember going into one of my committee meetings (after my qualifier) and feeling like I had crossed some barrier of thinking like a student to thinking like a scientist. Somewhere between writing fellowships and finding an aspect of my project I was so excited about that I was teaching my mentor about it and what I wanted to do, I found the academic in me. Keep at it, and I assure you it will happen! Best of luck, and congrats on passing your qualifier!",

Try an advanced English course, or an anthro course, something like that (your school may even have science focused humanities courses). It will give you practice in a field where novel and unique ways of looking at things are, in effect, the life-blood of the discipline. In these courses if you put something out there that is already well-trod you're not going to do very well. So it forces you to find new ideas, even ones you may not feel totally comfortable with, and try to make them work. \n\nAlso, try taking big swings when the game isn't on the line per-say. What I mean by this is if you have an idea like @mandypu says feels \"cheap,\" go for it anyway. See where it takes you in a low risk situation. You'll miss a lot, or not hit the home run you expected, but you'll be more comfortable flexing those muscles when it actually is game time.",

      "text": "As scientists/engineers, our goal is to incrementally add to our field.  I would argue that the size of the increment determines how good of a researcher you are.  For example, if you think about Einstein or Newton, they were so many leagues ahead of their contemporaries that we recognize them as some of the greatest scientists of all time.  In other words, their \"increment\" or \"leap size\", the amount they jumped past the current knowledge all alone, is very very large.\n\nMost of us will never achieve a leap of that size.  Some of this creative thinking is simply understanding where your field is at, where it needs to go in the abstract, and how you could make that happen in the abstract.  For example, think of computing and Moore's law.  Advancing this field was about decreasing transistor size for awhile, and there were tons of materials science and processing advances.  Now as we are getting close to quantum dimensions, some researchers probably thought, \"Okay.  So at this point we start getting quantum effects.  I WONDER if we can actually use those quantum effects to our advantage!\"  And then they start thinking about how that is possible and executing.\n\nThe remaining part of this creative thinking is simply genetic, in my opinion.  People are all wired differently, and it's obvious that some people are just smarter and more creative than others.\n\nSo bottom line, in my opinion, there are parts we can control (understanding our field, learning, and questioning what the future would look like in the abstract and what that would require), and other parts we can't control (innate intelligence/creativity).",
