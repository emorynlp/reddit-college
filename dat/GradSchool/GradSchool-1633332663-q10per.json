          "text": "This is surprising, because I've perceived that PhD positions ought to be reserved for the most succesful, but maybe the perception has changed to e.g. that not all \"succesful\" students are interested in phd due to being low pay and stressful. So maybe it has become more of a \"who wants to do it\" kind of thing vs \"who has the highest score to do it\".",

              "text": "What you seem to be implying is that the thesis grade should heavily outweigh all of the other things that admissions looks at. Whereas PhD candidate selection is a holistic evaluation that looks at a lot of criteria.\n\nFurthermore, some programs/fields ask for writing samples. So the admissions committee would base their judgment on what they read, not what someone else decided.",

                  "text": "The prior theses should predict the future theses, if the applicant has really learned from them, right? I would therefore predict myself that a B. Sc. thesis is not very important, since it's often the first one of such large piece of work and therefore allows for a plethora of \"learning\", but a master's thesis should already display maturity. Therefore a lacking master's thesis should not indicate aptitude towards a quality phd thesis. Since phd thesis may be viewed as e.g. \"3x master theses\". And master thesis should already display maturity in scientific argumentation, not just referencing. Thus it should indicate aptitude in producing original results.",

Hopefully, you'll learn in graduate school how to *know what you don't know.*",

I've read examples of \"A students\" failing  a phd thesis, just because it becomes too much for them or they lose motivation. So maybe they're also interested in gauging, whether the applicant truly seems like they will stay with it for the next 5-7 years. That's a long time.",
