  "text": "My advisor has suggested that we work on extending the analysis in one of their recent papers. I have read the paper multiple times, and I can find serious faults in that analysis. In fact, one of my upcoming pre-prints (work done before PhD in a different group) precisely points out the flaws in similar analyses.\n\nI have already told him that I hesitant about doing this project, and that I need some time to think it over.",

      "text": "Sometimes it\u2019s hard to suggest alternate projects or tell advisors no. But you absolutely have the right to say you would prefer to work on something else. You don\u2019t have to sit there and tell them that you think their work is crap. But if you have an alternate project that you can suggest working on, it will be easier to say you would prefer not to do that project. It\u2019s important to remember that they\u2019re your advisor and not your boss and while it doesn\u2019t always feel that way, you do get to control what you work on (for better or worse)",
