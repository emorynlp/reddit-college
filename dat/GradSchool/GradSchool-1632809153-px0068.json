  "title:": "Is it weird to wear your undergrad merch in grad school?",
  "text": "This is probably a dumb question lol. I got some cute and comfortable undergrad sweatshirts (a couple even say alumni) that I\u2019d like to wear. But even if they say alumni, they\u2019ve still got the huge school name embroidered on it, and I\u2019m obviously at a different school. My undergrad and grad schools are both in the UC system, so not technically rivals and relatively at the same ranking, but my undergrad is usually agreed to be a bit a more prestigious for undergrads, and I don\u2019t want to get dirty looks from my current school\u2019s undergrads (especially when I look like an 18yo freshman and not an older student lol). But do they actually care? I dunno, and I\u2019m almost too afraid to ask here lol. What do y\u2019all think? Serious answers please.",

It can be a great conversation starter. I wear whatever\u2019s lying around so frequently it\u2019s a sweatshirt from my partner\u2019s alma mater (and I even wear an old one from his public high school sometimes).",

      "text": "On the contrary, people actually like it. I'm from the upper Midwest and I live in the Northeast now. I wear sweatshirts from the university where I grew up and where I went to undergrad and I always have other students and professors mention it because they're like, \"oh you're from Minnesota, I have a collaborator at the U and visited him last month!\" And I usually wear something on the first day I teach and I *always* have an undergrad who's like, \"omg I'm from Wisconsin hi neighbor :')\"\n\nThey're not rival universities with mine though lol I don't think we have a rival. But I don't think they'll care, at my undergrad, if someone wore merch from our rival, most people didn't *actually* care and just joked about it.",
