  "title:": "Is phi beta kappa worth joining if I\u2019ve already been accepted in grad school?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior working on my last semester that\u2019s gonna be over in a few weeks. In the spring, I\u2019ve been accepted to start working on an MS. I just got an invitation to join PBK, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the $50 fee. \n\nI\u2019ve heard overwhelmingly good things about PBK, but I don\u2019t know if any honor society is worth joining if I\u2019ve already been accepted into grad school. What do you guys think?\n\nThanks!",
