  "text": "I go to a pretty good school for research in UK (as an American grad student). I got a job doing research on pre-clinical and clinical trials of hep-b treatment since my masters is in drug development (essentially pharmaceuticals).\n\nThe position is super interesting and I'm very excited about it, but when I asked if it was a paid position I was kind of laughed at by the post-doc and she said nobody here is \"paid\", but you get published and that's worth its weight in gold if you want to continue for a PhD. And if I do take the PhD position, it will be fully funded but that doesn't mean I get a paycheck.\n\nI'm going to continue with it since I was literally offered a PhD position on a silver platter, but the fact I'm not paid at all kind of rubs me the wrong way. Is this normal for masters students?\n\nEdit: I should clarify, it's certainly not a full time position. Per my student visa I can only work up to 20 hours a week, but I only plan on working like, 10.",

Doctors in the UK do a lot of work for free, particularly in their foundation years. It\u2019s common for them to be in the hospital at evenings/weekends when they\u2019re not rota\u2019d doing audits for their portfolios.

However, I am an RA as that is what my position said on the paper I signed for employment.\n\nBy fully funded I mean they'll pay for your tuition and anything that is required to do work in the lab, but you don't get a paycheck. The PhD student I was speaking with (you're right she was a PhD student), said that she gets her tuition paid for and anything she needs to perform her job is paid for (ie PPE, materials), but she doesn't get paid an actual wage. I pressed and said \"you don't get a stipend or anything?\" and she said \"who do you think would pay us?\" like...I don't know, the school?\n\nI wasn't sure if this was normal or not, because my undergrad institution literally cut their entire grad program from the school of nat. sciences so that they didn't have to pay grad students anymore. I figured maybe that's just the norm now.",

Many of the funding sources available will only cover home fees, which leaves most of the international fee uncovered and makes those funding streams practically useless. Many grants can only afford home fees as well. You generally have to apply to specialty \"international\" pots of money if you're foreign and want to do a PhD in the UK, you can't rely so much on the research councils, grants, DTPs, CDTs, the majority of university scholarships etc. \n\nThose who don't get scholarships don't come to the UK. That's why everyone you meet is funded. You can't study in the UK if you're not funded and not exceptionally wealthy. I mean, my PhD costs $300,000+ AUD and to get the visa and be unconditionally accepted by the university I had to provide proof of those funds (my full scholarship). I literally could not enter this country if I did not have a stipend.\n\nI'm guessing the student OP talked to was a UK resident and so didn't have to provide proof of full funding. There are a few of those who will try to work to support themselves since they can legally do that. It's uncommon (and a terrible idea), but not unheard of.",

And of course the competition is now insane since everyone can apply, and all the Europeans are competing with non-EU for everything else, so I think the effective number of awards available to non-UK residents has taken a nose-dive. \n\nAt Cambridge, I think only 10% of accepted applicants get any funding at all, and of course some of those will be rich people who can afford to cover gaps.

We are paid by many different sources, with some getting independent scholarships (charities, foreign governments, departments, businesses, perhaps sourced through the university/department), and others either being paid through e.g. the UK research councils or doing specialised programmes like DTP and CDT. There are some positions that are funded by an academic's grant money, but these are advertised as a position on that specific grant-funded project. You have to apply to these individually, through e.g. [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/united-kingdom/?g0w900)\n\nIn short, funding is something **you** need to organise separately to your PhD application unless you are very explicitly applying to a paid PhD position. If it is not abundantly clear that the position is already funded by a grant (and in that case, you are applying more to a specific project, not the PhD programme generally) then you should assume it is unfunded and you need to secure funding on your own. That may mean applying to the research councils or applying to scholarships.\n\nIf the PI is funding you from a grant and you're foreign then they may not be able to provide a stipend or even cover your full fees because the grant doesn't allow them to. Not paying you would probably be illegal then, though, because they'd be manipulating and circumventing the conditions of the grant.\n\nWhich university are you at? Is it Russel Group at least? This doesn't sound like a good place to be",

Does that mean you're not even getting tuition waiver for you're MS??? Why in the world would you pay for a MS in STEM that's not a professional degree (e.g. MBA), let alone not get paid? \n\nComing from a US perspective, but advisor, committee member, and post doc were all from the UK and said it was the same there: if you're STEM you get tuition waiver, insurance, and stipend for all post grad/BS work (MS and PhD). Publications are generally a requirement to graduate, not a privilege, e.g., my MS required 1 first author, PhD required 3 more first author. If you are an RA v TA, you generally got another few co-author papers from that 20 hr/week work.",

There are sometimes unpaid volunteers but they are often given less important, more menial work.\n\nAlso, in my experience as someone who has held many RA positions and who now hires/supervises RAs: not paying someone for this type of work means it will be lower priority for them. In terms of hours and commitment/effort, unpaid work ends up being less important than your paid positions and your coursework or thesis. \n\nStudents sometimes reach out to our lab and volunteer to do unpaid RA work but I don't even think it's worth it to \"hire\" them like that.

Don't grind away doing tedious stuff without compensation. \n\nIn the US, nearly all STEM PhDs come with a stipend. A PhD is a full-time obligation between research and coursework, so you shouldn't be working a job to support yourself at the same time.

      "text": "I'm coming from being a Psychology PhD Student in a Cognition and Neuroscience program at an R1 university in the US, so maybe it's different, but I would never do that full time in a million years. I did unpaid internships as an undergraduate and I even feel a little uneasy about those, being on the other end of things now, but I get their place.\n\nI generally feel if the labor is important to the Principal Investigator, it's worth them paying someone adequately to do it. Sometimes that payment comes in the form of experience, but too often people in positions of power are taking advantage of younger folks with dreams, so it's very important to make sure you aren't in that situation.\n\nThere is absolutely no guarantee they will accept you as a PhD student when you finish, or that your papers will get published, and if that's the case, you could be left with little to show for your time. I see that it's only 5 to 10 hours a week which honestly isn't too bad, but just make sure they aren't taking advantage of you. You, your time, and your contributions are worth far more than a few publications which may or may not work out.  \n\n\nSome additional unsolicited but related advice: If you have a graduate student union, join it. If you don't, start it. \n\nEdit: Once I saw this was part-time and not full-time, I changed the tone a bit. NEVER do this full-time. You need to take care of yourself.",
