      "text": "I think it would be okay for a PsyD student to include a training provided under presentations as long as it is clear what it is (given that this is not a research-focused degree-- for a PhD student this should definitely be separate, IMO), or to create a new section \"Trainings Provided\" that only, at this time, includes the one item. IMO, it depends on what you want to emphasize on your CV and what you think you might do from here.\n\nHonestly, CVs in health service psychology are a bit of an art, so I'm not sure there is a single \"correct\" way of doing this.",
