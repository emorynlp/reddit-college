There's something about how it takes the vast majority of your time and energy in order to just get through it, so even the smallest of flubs have been pretty all-encompassing for me. And since this is grad school, IE the most challenging school on the face of the earth, flubs are going to happen A. LOT. It's been tough for me, to say the least.",

It really helps. \n\nAnd always keep in mind that the struggles you are experiencing now are temporary. One way or another things will come to an end. Remembering that has helped me out a lot.",

      "text": "Yep. Had a misunderstanding with my PI where I thought he wanted me to contribute to a review paper but he intended to make me first author (despite me never having written a paper before). Killed my self-esteem and made myself a depressed, anxious wreck over the summer, didn't manage my stress well, lashed out verbally a couple of times before deciding enough was enough and I wanted therapy. Now I'm late on data collection and working on not viewing the rest of my Master's as me trying to redeem myself both academically and socially, and one of the main things I'm working on in therapy is trying to curb the fear I've made my lab hate me (there is no evidence that they do, I'm just scared they do so imagine things if I don't watch out). I'm happy I have a bit of time before deciding to do a PhD or not--I would like to stay at my current lab but part of me is scared to know for sure if my PI still wants me or not. I cope by telling myself that 1. it's a learning experience and I'm happy I'm learning these lessons when I'm in my 20's and not in my 50's, 2. I've already learned a lot, so worse comes to worse I will not be wasting my time, and 3. if I stop worrying about what others think of me and remain collected, professional and focused, I will do the work and the \"redemption\" part will happen naturally. Basically I must spend my energy worrying about the process and not the end result.\n\nSo... Therapy. Therapy is everyone's friend. CBT works wonders for me. My main goal is to manage my life and stress well enough to not fall back into being the \"vast majority of grad school students who are depressed and anxious\" category.",
