  "text": "Has anyone completed a residency or presented research virtually? I was originally supposed to fly across the country to complete a residency and present research in April '22, but I spoke to my advisor last week and that's all up in the air due to the pandemic and faculty is contemplating the possibility of our cohort doing this all remotely somehow. She said she might be able to give me a more concrete idea of what's going on in January, but there are no guarantees.\n\nSo. Obviously this is a tad stressful for me. If I'm flying out, I want to make arrangements well in advance so I don't end up on a red eye and staying at seedy motel. I also have a family I'm responsible for and need to ensure they're my priority, which is more difficult to do when I'm not sure what my spring is going to look like.\n\nThe above is my greater concern, but I'm also unsure what it would even look like to do something like this online and my advisor didn't seem too certain either. I suppose I could present my findings in a Zoom meeting and see clients in a telehealth type environment, but what have other people done?",
