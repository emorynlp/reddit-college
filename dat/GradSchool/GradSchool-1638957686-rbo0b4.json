  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my final year of undergrad and am about to fail my second class ever in college. Unfortunately, the class is not too popular and it looks like they aren\u2019t going to offer it for the next two quarters, which by then I will graduate. I\u2019m thinking about applying to either law school or business in a few years. How bad do you think this will affect my chances?",

Depending on the program you could explain your situation but either way you\u2019ll have to retake the class to show you can handle the workload \nBest of luck",

      "text": "From my experience, it depends on what type of school you're applying to and if you failed a course in the same field as your intended grad degree.\n\nFor example, let's say your bachelor's degree was in biology and you got C's (and couple of fails) in the upper level courses, but you got all A's in every math course you had ever taken including advanced ones like real analysis. If you were applying to a mathematical MS or PhD, they'd only care about your math grades. I know plenty of people who got into grad school because of good grades just in the intended subjects even when the other grades were bad. PhD is even more holistic than MS as they want people \"who are a good fit\" for their potential advisors.\n\nMBA programs, unless they're an ivy league or near ivy league, will accept just about anyone who has a bachelor's and is breathing. Medical schools are crazy and want excellence everywhere. Law schools usually just look at overall GPA's since everyone usually has very easy/non-quantitative majors to where you should be able to get As and Bs in every class. If you have a quantitative-based major and are applying to law school, you don't need an insane, but you still need a good gpa.",

      "text": "I think it depends on how competitive the school is, how much it reflects the rest of your academic career, and what you can show elsewhere. My undergrad was... spotty, to put it gently, but I had related work experience in the program I originally applied to, and my program director told me during my admissions interview almost directly that GRE scores are what saved my ass.",

They were in pre-Med and I switched by major to psychology to get into counseling school. \nWhen I applied to MA programs I made sure to note in my personal statement what happened with my grades. It worked and I got into an MA program.",
