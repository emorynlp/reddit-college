I\u2019m trying to figure out if I should do a paper or poster presentation for abstract submission. since my thesis wouldn\u2019t be published by the time the conference comes around, I prob wouldn\u2019t qualify for a paper presentation? Is there any real difference for career or job prospects between the two?",

Probably a bit more info than you were looking for :)\n\nThats a really good point, feedback at every stage is always great. Are you by chance heading to the AAG conference next year?",

      "text": "At least in my field they usually *aren't* published beforehand, but are some sort of draft or even a works-in-progress that you are sharing to get feedback for at the conference. Some conferences even forbid you presenting on previously published material or material that is under contract to be published. Again, it's field specific, but poster presentations aren't very common in mine and don't mean much, so that might be something you would ask your advisor or someone else. But I don't see why you couldn't do the paper presentation.",

I did a paper presentation at AAG as a grad student awhile back and didn't have anything but a half draft of a thesis chapter, and mine was probably the most polished of the papers in my session.  Most of the people I saw present seemed like they were flying by the seat of their pants, cobbled something together for the happy hour tickets and the chance to see somewhere new.  Wouldn't stress too much.",
