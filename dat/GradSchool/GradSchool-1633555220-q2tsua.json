  "title:": "how much do master's grades matter for a PhD in ecology/ecological modeling",
  "text": "Just started a M.S after not being in academia for about 4 years, and I feel like I'm falling down the rabbit hole of worrying about grades. Such as the difference between As and Bs vs straight As. I imagine PhD advisors care more about work ethic and published papers, but generally how much do they care about grades? What do they care about and look for besides grades and papers?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you friends",

      "text": "I'm a 4th year PhD student evolutionary bio/ecological genomics and came in without a Masters degree. It varies wildly by advisor. There are some potential advisors I talked to when I was applying to grad school who cared a lot about my grades (undergrad GPA was 3.4 so it's not like it was *low* but it wasn't high either). Meanwhile a lot didn't care at all and openly told me grades and my GRE score only needed to be above the department cut off (3.0-3.4 at most places I looked at) because they were far more interested in my research experience.\n\nI think it comes down to casting a wide net and reaching out to professors to get a feel for what they think is important in an applicant. I knew personally that I don't agree that grades and standardized tests correlate with how well a person does in research, so I specifically wanted to find an advisor who values research more and I did.",

      "text": "Evidence of strong research abilities and publications will matter more than grades if you're looking at As vs Bs. Supervisors also care about the quality of your ideas for future research. For competitive full scholarships (in the UK at least) grades matter more, but you basically need to be strong in your overall profile - not just grades - for those.",
