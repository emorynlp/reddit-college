  "text": "Seeing as I\u2019m in the uk I\u2019m considering bringing in a couple of boxes of tea for people to share since we\u2019re all tea drinkers. \n\nI\u2019ve been working in the office a few months now but I still feel like I haven\u2019t made the connection with them yet. They probably think I\u2019m some kind of weirdo because I don\u2019t tend to talk the much. The reality is I\u2019m just introverted  and tend to observe and think more than I say",

You can ask their opinion on whether they did something similar and had any advice on it. ( \"I'm thinking of going to the foreign film festal in the city next month, have you been to it?)",
