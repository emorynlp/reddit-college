  "text": "Seeing as I\u2019m in the uk I\u2019m considering bringing in a couple of boxes of tea for people to share since we\u2019re all tea drinkers. \n\nI\u2019ve been working in the office a few months now but I still feel like I haven\u2019t made the connection with them yet. They probably think I\u2019m some kind of weirdo because I don\u2019t tend to talk the much. The reality is I\u2019m just introverted  and tend to observe and think more than I say",

You can ask their opinion on whether they did something similar and had any advice on it. ( \"I'm thinking of going to the foreign film festal in the city next month, have you been to it?)",

Ask them questions about themselves. It shows your interest in them as people, and people do love to talk about themselves. It's the subject we all know best!\n\n\"Hey Im looking for such-and-such movie/book/place to shop/whatever. Do you have any recommendations?\"\n\nDepending on your office...we used to play board games during lunch. One department plays You Don't Know Jack.\n\nAsk the group of they'd like to get dinner after work one day. Send out a Doodle poll to get best availability.",
