  "text": "Sorry in advance if this question isn\u2019t relevant to this sub. I am currently a first year at a large for year institution and I am super interested in research. I was considering reaching out to grad students for research opportunities because you guys have to do a lot more research and publications and professors are not under such pressure. I\u2019m not trying to be published but I just want some research experience. What would be the best way to reach out to other grad students for such opportunities?",

It sounds kind of brutal, but just \u201cteaching\u201d someone can be a waste of time. If I hear someone is motivated to publish etc. it makes me feel like there\u2019s a better chance of getting a return on that investment (I.e. this student will work hard to help me publish)",

If they approve then I decide if I want to interview them.\n\nAlso, you can totally get on a publication. My former undergrad is second author on a paper I'm submitting soon, and I'm planning to have my current undergrads as co-authors on a lot review next semester.",
