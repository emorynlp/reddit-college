      "text": "I work in UI/UX. It's not exactly looked down on, but as a younger field you'll find a lot of different ideas of what UI/UX design is among non-practicioners, practicioners, employers, etc. Be prepared to define what it means for yourself and to have to work to understand people who see it as something completely different. \n\nThis is, in part, because it is not yet a profession in the formal sense, there's no governing body/association as with engineers, doctors, lawyers, etc. Anyone can call themselves a UI/UX designer and the skillsets found in this field are wildly diverse. This is both a strength and a weakness, depending who you listen to.\n\nBut, even if it was looked down on, does that really matter if that's what you want to do? Don't let others sway you to make choices different from the ones that make you happy.",

However I do want to get a masters degree and I was wondering if ui/ux is looked down upon by the cs academia and they wouldn't accept my application coz of that goal, coz I really want to get the degree AND learn UI/UX design.",

If you did have someone in mind at that school who's work you've been following, it's not too late to reach out with an introductory email to express your admiration and eagerness.",

And there are masters degrees that focus totally on UX/UI. Probably would have been better to apply to one of those programs if that's really what you want to do.",
