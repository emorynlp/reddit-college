  "title:": "How to react if my advisor brings this up again?",
  "text": "My advisor recently snapped at me over email because I asked if he or my fellow master's student could possibly check if there were colonies growing on some selective plates, so I wouldn't have to drive 30 minutes to the lab then 30 minutes back just to check them for 10 seconds (it was the only in-lab thing I needed to do that day). I explained I was very sleep deprived from doing overnight feedings for a baby squirrel that had fallen out of the nest, and didn't want to fall asleep while driving. He responded that this was an unacceptable excuse, and that I needed to have a better work ethic. (Though he has previously missed a scheduled experiment to bring a chicken to the vet, so I thought he would be more understanding). \n\nHe has been writing grants recently, so I understand he's stressed. He hasn't said anything about it in-person to me. We usually have a good working relationship. \n\nI'm worried that he's unhappy with the amount of in-lab time I'm spending, even though most of the work we can do right now is reading literature online, since the benchwork can't be rushed and isn't every day so I don't see the need to waste an hour of time + gas driving when I could use it for more productive things instead. I'm handling all of my responsibilities, and when I try to take on more or make decisions on my own he gets a bit upset since he wants to have final say.\n\nDo you have any advice for me on how to handle this?  What should I do if he says my work ethic isn't good enough, or that I need to be in the lab more even if there isn't anything to be done?",

It's highly possible that they've already moved on/forgotten about it.\n\nIn the future I'd say offer far less detail as to why you're absent. Call it personal reasons, unexpected situations, whatever you want. But by giving reasons you let them judge whether or not your absence is valid. \n\nIf it does come back up, just accept that they want you there more. If it's just to do office work, then go in and do office work. Sometimes we just have to bite the bullet and accept it's their lab group and if they aren't demanding insane hours or being otherwise abusive, they get to set the rules.",

Right now is a nice low-stakes times to practice different techniques for getting there.",

(a lot of PIs will mess up your experiments anyways). My advice is to show up to lab and be seen. My PhD advisor once told me that if they didn't see people in the lab/lab office they assumed they weren't doing anything productive with lab work or computer-related lab work. I'm sure it's not an uncommon thought. When I started my postdoc we were having problems getting the chemicals I needed to start my project so I had very little lab work to do. I was still doing 40 h sitting at my desk reading, making plans, etc. I understand that you work better at home and live kind of far away, but being present and making your boss happy by showing them you want to work is very important",
