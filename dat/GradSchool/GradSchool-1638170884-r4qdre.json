  "title:": "In Person Transition Kicking My Ass",
  "text": "It\u2019s my second year of grad school and I finally am experiencing class IRL and teaching live sections. I didn\u2019t anticipate how difficult this would be- I moved two hours north yet I feel like I am in a new world. It\u2019s been frustrating teaching, commuting, and coming home with a few hours left of the day to do work. I feel exhausted and defeated half of the time, which has led me to procrastinate on some important papers due in two weeks. I\u2019ve done an ample amount of research and prep work. However, since I have the privilege of utilizing my library\u2019s plethora of books/documents and technically have access to so many resources, I feel like I have no excuses to write a piss poor paper. I\u2019m so overwhelmed by my background research and intimidated by my peers that I can\u2019t even articulate my own thoughts clearly. \n\nAdditionally, my university has done a good job at keeping covid-19 cases at bay, but I am constantly on the edge of my seat- one of my professors and two of my students contracted it already. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, take meds, all that good stuff. I know a part of this feeling is me being burnt out as fuck ( I was taking a language intensive, doing research, and working a part time job this summer while dealing with family issues). I know this will pass and Christmas Break will be a nice opportunity for a breather before I grind out my MA paper, but i would love to know that I\u2019m not alone.",

      "text": "You're definitely not alone. I personally am struggling HARD with burnout and have no idea how to recover from it. It also sounds a bit like you are adjusting to being back in person and the impostor syndrome that comes along with that. Just remember that you're in grad school to learn more, so it's okay to feel like you don't know everything you think you should. Good luck!",

      "text": "I started TAing in person this semester for the first time and found it hugely stressful for the first 6 weeks or so. All my teaching strategies from Zoom kind of didn't work in person and I felt like I had to reinvent everything from scratch which was annoying and time consuming. My school gave us a week off for thanksgiving and being home and letting myself relax for a bit made me realize how exhausted I am... it's frustrating because I had been looking forward to be back in person but now I feel like I was more productive last year when everything was online. Guess I'm saying that you're not alone!",
