Even though I totally expected it and even planned on it (knowing it would take a miracle to get in anywhere) it still sucks. It's very discouraging. It's sad to think how exclusionary the whole process of obtaining a high level degree in psychology has become. There are so many students out there with passion and intelligence who could absolutely contribute and help grow the field but they'll never get a chance because of the huge bottleneck created by this applicants:positions ratio. \n\nIt's important not take it personally because it's definitely a system-level problem rather than an individual issue. But it still sucks on a personal level, so thanks for this opportunity to bitch with you!! \n\nI hope things get better for you soon!",
