I originally sent him an intro and methods last spring and said \"Is this worth finishing and submitting?\" He said yes, so I finished a draft - wrote every word myself. We met up and spent two hours going through it, he made small changes and suggested some things. Submitted. Reviews back August. We met up in October to chat about how to address them for half an hour. I spent a few weeks implementing them and wrote responses to reviews myself. We met up for two hours and he helped me polish the new version and the response to reviews. Resubmitting in a few days. \n\nHe would have helped me more if I needed it though. In your situation I would recommend setting a meeting and putting the laptop in front of him so he just reads it in front of you. And if he makes comments you can scribble notes.",

From conception, core writing, math, programming, and revisions, he offered almost no help. He paid me to be an RA and paid the paper submission or conference fees, and offered a smattering of wording edits - especially the title. \n\n>**How much feedback do they give?**\n\nHe wouldn't offer any feedback until the full rough draft was complete. Then offered some wording feedback, figure positions, and occasionally a sentence edit. \n\n>**How much writing do they do?**\n\nNone whatsoever. \n\n>**What is your joint writing process, if you have one?**\n\nI write everything, he looks at it (maybe). For bigger papers, occasionally offered wording or adding a sentence. \n\n>The motivation for this question is that my advisor contributes nothing, barely gives feedback, and can't be relied upon to even read the paper to discuss it. I feel very on my own and unsupported and want to know if this is a common experience or if others' advisors are more active in the writing process.\n\nYou are being unsupported and it's honestly bullshit. Your advisor is supposed to be teaching you how to be a researcher, which includes effective experiment design, and communication of results to the wider community. Even though many of us face(d) similar advisor experiences, it is still bullshit.",

I know that some others in my cohort whose advisors are very hands off have been able to form relationships with other faculty in the department who are willing to do that with them in an informal capacity. \n\nI also try to participate in voluntary groups or sign up for courses where you workshop papers (how helpful this is varies some but usually at least helps with editing/revising).",

We will often send back and forth several drafts, we will meet to discuss anything that comes up, and we both decide together when it's ready to be submitted. But, this is also because she is usually second author on my papers, which involves obvious contribution criteria.
