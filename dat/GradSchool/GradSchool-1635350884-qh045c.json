  "title:": "Changing NSF GRFP proposal after acceptance",
  "text": "Up front: I have reached out to the staff at my university who are familiar with the NSF GRFP and asked them this question, but I wanted to post on here as well. I also searched this subreddit for similar posts and didn't see any. \n\nI am a Masters student and I've been awarded the NSF GRFP in the field of Geosciences - Computationally Intensive Research.\n\nMy research proposal involves high temperature geochemistry and computational modeling. Now that I am finishing my Masters, I am looking into PhD programs and I have been considering projects that are not directly related to my proposal. For example, I have been looking into project that *are* geoscience focused (e.g., weather, coastal dynamics, etc.) that involve computationally intensive work, but *are not* related to high temperature geochemisty.\n\n**My questions are:**\n**1) How much \"wiggle room\" do I have to adapt my NSF GRFP proposal now that my proposal has been accepted?**\n**2) Is the NSF just interested in funding me so long as I stay within the boundaries of computationally intensive geosciences or am I essentially restricted to what I originally proposed?**\n\nLet me know if I can clarify anything, and thanks in advance.",

      "text": "First off, congratulations!\n\nMy understanding is that no one is holding to your proposed project at all. No need to change it,l so long as you stay in the same field, i.e. computationally intensive geosciences. In fact, I'm not even sure you'll be held to that.",

      "text": "The GRFP funds the individual, not the proposed research! Obviously your reviewers liked your research proposal, but NSF is most interested in funding people they think will contribute to science, rather than specific graduate projects. Your PhD program also only needs to be 'consistent with the field of study indicated' in your application, so in your case I would expect you'd enroll in an Earth Sciences, Geology, or Geochemistry program. So lots of wiggle room here!",

      "text": "My understanding is that you don't have to actually work on the thing you propose. The proposal is more to show that you have the thinking required to engage in scientific research. My only sources are anecdotes from friends who've had the GRFP and did research other than their original proposal, so do with that what you will.",

Maybe helpful for others to know.",
