  "text": "As grad students, we are probably one of the most sensitive groups to changes in cost of living, as our income is typically fixed. \n\nI'm sitting in my room, sick possibly because of the lack of COVID protocol at my university (although I'm not fully convinced that I have COVID), and not having eaten a real meal since Monday, with $40 in bank that is supposed to last till the first of October.\n\nIt is amazing how little the University cares about its grad students. I have 300 students and was forced to cancel class twice this week due to a possible super spreader event. Is it against University protocol? Idk but I'm not gonna subject my students to unnecessary exposure to COVID, especially when I can't even regularly eat.\n\nI'm tired.",

      "text": "I've been incredibly grateful for the position I'm in; if anything Covid has improved my life, though I acknowledge I'm very fortunate and know other grad students are not doing so well.\n\nI'm at a satellite facility of my campus about 2 hours away; prior to Covid I was required 2-3 times a week to take a shuttle to attend classes in person. However, to make up for this inconvenience those of us assigned to this facility get an extra 5k a year stipend. Additionally, our cost of living is lower than if we were at the main school. I am able to rent a room in a nearby house from my research facility for 400/month which includes all utilities and internet.\n\nCovid in no way affected my income but allowed me to attend remotely which freed up my time significantly. I was able to work from home (I mostly do data analysis) for a very long time, and they also got around to making a deal with a nearby school in the same system so now we can go to their Campus Health instead of traveling to our own. Further, because Covid precautions and low recruitment numbers no new students have come here for over a year, so I've not been given a roommate- aka I've been renting a 2BR/2B house 2 minutes from my lab for 400/month.\n\nThen the stimulus checks were a cherry on top.\n\nSeveral times during the pandemic I have metaphorically looked around and realized how incredibly fortunate I was to be in the position I was at the time this hit. My heart goes out to those who are suffering.\n\n(As an added \"Dodged a bullet there\" note, I finished my comprehensives during the pandemic so will never have to go to campus again, meaning I don't have to worry about the absolute buffoonery going on up there about in-person attendance and Covid lack-of-precautions.)",

Through the ARPA program each PhD student at my school could apply for $7800 and MA students for $5400. Literally anyone who applied (one paragraph explaining how covid derailed your degree progress and a signed form from your advisor) got the money. That is literally what we get paid every semester so its been amazing to have. Every undergrad who was eligible for any financial aid was just automatically sent $3000 by our university. \n\nI have been incredibly lucky that covid has just meant a bunch of free money from the government for me because otherwise my finances haven't been affected. \n\nI am pretty sure every US school got ARPA money so it might be worth looking into if they have any aid for students through that.",

I don't know the details because I haven't needed such support, but a friend of mine, who is a single mom, was able to get some money from them to pay for groceries. The Dean of Students office at my university also offers zero-interest emergency loans of up to $500, so if you had a bunch of sudden expenses and don't have enough for food, it might be worthwhile to see if your university has something similar and then you can start paying it back once your income stabilizes. I did use that program, and they were willing to work with me when I couldn't pay it back by the end of the semester so they extended the repayment by a whole semester.",
