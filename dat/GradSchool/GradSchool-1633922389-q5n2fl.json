  "text": "I just started a fully funded master's program this year in chemistry (tuition covered and a healthy stipend). It's a two-year program, so technically I don't have to apply to PhD programs this cycle if I don't want to. However, this program is at a poorly-ranked school and I have hopes of getting into an R1 for my PhD (I did undergrad at an R1) and eventually going straight into academia. Yes I know it's unlikely, but I'm trying to best maximize my chances of getting my dream job.\n\nMy program is generous in that they let us collaborate with PIs at other schools, any school in the world, if we want as long as we take initiative and we find someone who wants to work with us. I'm really trying to do this, and I've made contact with a professor at my dream grad school by cold-emailing him. I'm just now looking for advice on how to proceed? How do I actually progress from an initial interest meeting into proposing a project and establishing this PI on my thesis committee? How do I convince a top-notch professor to work with me when I'm just a 22 year old who wasn't even competitive enough to get into PhD programs on their first try? And also, is it even a good idea to collaborate with a PI that might be sitting on the admissions committee when I apply? Like, if I have any hiccups, they might just think I'm not a good researcher and I'll never get admitted.",
