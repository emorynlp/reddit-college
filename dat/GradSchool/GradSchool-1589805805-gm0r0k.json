  "title:": "My dad doesn't believe me when I say I'm expected to be on-campus for research in the Fall even if classes are online (I'm starting a PhD at Texas A&M).",
  "text": "He's supporting me a little bit financially but he doesn't want me \"to be the only one on campus\" even if it's for doing research for my assistantship so that I can get paid. His reasoning has to do with paying for an apartment (he's helping me out just a little bit to help lessen the burden of getting a very secure apartment so he doesn't have to worry). My dad doesn't believe me to the point where he says he's going to call the Office of Research to see what's up (I don't know if FERPA comes into play with that because research is different from person to person).\n\nI already know I have to show up in person to start the onboarding process (which I have told him multiple times), and I asked my graduate advisor (not faculty advisor) about it and am waiting for her response. I just don't know what to do about this. My research isn't considered essential and doesn't have to do with living organisms. Could someone please give advice or input on this?\n\nUPDATE: He apparently told my sister and not me (she's way older if that gives insight) that he's not actually going to call them. Yay for scare tactics. He has a past of being controlling like this.\n\nUPDATE 2: He got mad at me for making a smart Alec comment, which I admit was wrong. It escalated to where I told him how messed up it is he would threaten something like calling my school. It hit the point where he said, \u201cI won\u2019t lose sleep if you never talk to me again\u201d after I told him he was at risk of losing me as his daughter. I might end up posting this to another reddit because I honestly don\u2019t know what to do now.",

      "text": "This is a unique situation given the pandemic and I think you\u2019ve gotten some solid advice here. I agree that if possible, it\u2019s best to create some distance from your dad if possible especially financially. I will say that I remember my parents being highly skeptical of the grad student model where you get paid to be a GA and free tuition on top of it. My dad had a four year degree from a smaller school and wasn\u2019t particularly great at it, and my mom earned an associates, so it was simply something they didn\u2019t know or understand. It became more real for them once I did get my first offer, and even though our relationship had become fairly strained, the space helped us a lot. After four years, they still don\u2019t fully \u201cget it\u201d but they have a much better idea of how academia works than they did. \n\nWith that said, if you are required to report, make sure you do. Like others have said, get an apartment. Make sure you think about expenses like parking assuming the university will require you to pay, and how you\u2019ll cover transportation otherwise if you don\u2019t drive. You can always take out student loans if you need them, even if you don\u2019t accept all the money they offer. You may want to check to see if you\u2019ll have to pay fees as well; I was unpleasantly surprised with a $1200 bill due in October my first semester. A lot of universities are making announcements right now to try to reassure students about what their future in the fall might look like, but the reality is that we won\u2019t entirely know until we get closer because things are somewhat unpredictable. So, plan to move into your apartment and begin graduate studies as if it were normal basically and play the cards your dealt as they come. Best of luck!",

Am I glad I\u2019m home? Yes, especially since dad was asking for me. Am I glad that I have to fight my mom about my job currently? Definitely not. \nMy suggestion is to try to relate your assistantship to working a job as much as possible to see if that helps things and see the magnitude of your situation/responsibilities. That seems to help non academics get it a little better than referring to yourself as a student. \nAnd the other is to get into therapy as soon as you enroll!",

Since you are just starting there may be things you can do at home that your advisor would count as part as your RA. For example doing literature reviews, working on a prospectus, etc. If your work doesn't involve dangerous chemicals you may also be able to do it at home. For example my lab (and others) have allowed students to take home microscopes to continue work from home. That will vary on a lab/PI/ type of research basis though. \n\nIn terms of campus conditions though at my branch since labs are shared we are supposed to report when we enter the building and what rooms we were in/ using so the room can be cleaned after we leave. On top of that most lab PI's have their own cleaning protocols and the university is requiring basic ppe, masks, and social distancing while you're on campus.

I know they vary dramatically, the cities in which you spend them in vary, and people's definition of what's livable varies, but I went from a job earning about $50k to my current stipend of $27k and found it a very easy adjustment, given that a lot of my old paycheck was going to student loans, which are currently on hold (which I also understand is not a luxury many get if their loans aren't subsidized). That being said, I live in a great neighborhood in Philly. My rent is about 1/3 of my monthly stipend. I eat out semi-regularly and I don't generally worry about making ends meet. Frankly, I've never had much of a financial safety net (only person to attend college in the family and all that), but I'd argue, from my experience, stipends are very liveable if you have reasonable expectations, and the frugality is a small price to pay for the independence to do what you love for a living.",

We likely wouldn\u2019t call a dad of a 16-year old abusive for saying that he won\u2019t let his son or daughter work during coronavirus. We\u2019d call that a scared dad who may or may not be overreacting. For the parent, there\u2019s probably very little difference when their 22-year old who they\u2019re still paying for wants to go to work. Is the dad right? I don\u2019t think so. But abusive is also entirely the wrong description (based off of what we\u2019ve been told so far).",
