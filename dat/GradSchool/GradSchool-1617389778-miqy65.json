  "title:": "A success story for the COVID dropouts: I left my PhD program with an MS, emailed a *huge* lab in my field about a postdoc opening, and they created a different listing to accommodate me.",
  "text": "Some positivity for the scores of us leaving due to COVID:\n\nI was **terrified** to master out, but beyond tanking my mental health, COVID impaired my research timeline, has made it so that I\u2019ve still never attended a conference, and has robbed me of the meaningful ability to network.\n\nI cold-emailed a lab about a postdoc listing, explaining I was their literal perfect match but was dropping out due to COVID. It was a complete non-issue. Asking why I was leaving grad school took maybe five minutes of my interview.\n\nThis is the job I would have gone for after completing my PhD, and I got it with the same salary. They\u2019ve already assured me that if everything works out they\u2019d be happy to help me do a PhD when the world returns to normal.\n\nAnyway. I know a lot of people are freaked out like I was. I just wanted to share how well it worked out for me despite how totally helpless and despondent I\u2019ve felt as a COVID PhDropout. Hopefully it makes someone feel better. :)",

In fact, it may be the right move for you.\n\nFor some people, it is possible to make more money, and work on more interesting problems, in industry than in academia. If this is the case, it may make little sense to remain in your PhD.\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves in academia was the pressure imposed on all of us to *remain* in the PhD path and to never drop out. Forget about these people, do what's best for you.\n\nSeveral folks I knew from my PhD cohort dropped out w/ an M.S., and are working at my current company. Sure I have a PhD and they don't, but honestly it doesn't matter much...",
