  "text": "I'll try to keep this short:\n\nLast week a student in my class wasn't present, so someone, naturally, asked where the student was.\n\n\\*I should quickly specify that I'm in the secondary education literature track. So we all want to teach middle/high school English literature.\n\nMy teacher replied, \"Oh he switched to science \\[concentration\\]. Which is good for him. This clearly wasn't right for him anyway. He'll do much better over there.\"\n\nI don't want to overthink anything, but I've recently been having doubts and questioning my place in the program. (I don't want to switch concentrations, I'm just unsure of what I really want in life right now.)\n\nMy point is, now I'm worried my teacher might think the same about me. Not that I would do better in science (because I hate and suck at it) but what if she thinks I don't belong and just isn't saying it to me? \n\nLike I said, I've been having doubts, but if I do decide to do something else I don't want it to be because I'm terrible at this. I did fine in undergrad, and though I only started grad school over the summer, I think I'm doing alright.\n\nI realize I'm probably overthinking, but I wanted to get other opinions. Should I ask her what she thinks? Should I brush off the comment, consider it pointless, and try not to obsess about dumb stuff? I feel lost.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

      "text": "While some people do make assumptions, it is likely that the professor only came to this conclusion after having a conversation with the student who left and hearing their inner thoughts and preferences. It would be very unlikely (likely, impossible) for your professor to know that about you until they gather context that only the student has.",

      "text": "This is way overthinking and if you want to talk to your professor do it from a place of having your doubts about the program and wanting to get their advice. Don't bring up the other student, and don't compare yourself to the other student. \n\nYou should also know that while your professor is likely happy to help with career guidance, they are not a therapist. If you went to them with concerns as you expressed here, they'd likely be unsure of what you wanted and would direct you to campus support resources. Your professor is not your therapist, and is not the right person to help you figure out what you want in life.\n\nEditing to add: it's probably worth figuring out a relatively stable therapy routine now, especially if an offhand comment like this can send you spiraling. I taught middle School for a year and the number of times students said \"I hate you!\" or other things like that was surprisingly common. If you find yourself unsettled by fairly routine comments, it's worth figuring out how to become more resilient with the help of a therapist",

Most professors are willing to talk about your plans and where you are headed, based upon your performance in their class. Even if they're not your advisor.\n\n>I don't want to overthink anything, but I've recently been having doubts and questioning my place in the program.\n\nI think a lot of people do that in the middle of the first semester of grad school. Better to put your energy towards getting ahead on end of semester projects right now. That'll make things easier on you in the last couple of weeks, and you'll be able to enjoy Thanksgiving better.",
