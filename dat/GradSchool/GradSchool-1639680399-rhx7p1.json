  "text": "I'm currently an engineering Master's student who is all set to graduate next summer, but I've been stuck with a situation that seems like a lose-lose.\n\nBasically I am in a university program letting me \"intern\" at a defense company, though legally I am employed by the school. As such I cannot become a paid research assistant because that would be two separate cases of employment at my university. If I were to stay with this program, there is a solid chance I could transfer from it to an actual internship with the company, which could then lead to a job. Only issue is that internship applications open up in the summer, which is when I would be applying to the doctoral program...and my professor is unlikely to sponsor me on to the PhD program if I slack on my research and take a long time off after my Masters. Though if I drop this internship and commit to my PhD, I lose a valuable future employment opportunity, and will likely have to play the game of finding a job with no industry experience all over again.\n\nI dream of a future job with JPL or NASA in general, and I think a PhD will go a long way towards that...but I think job experience would go a long way too...I just don't know which I should commit to.",

      "text": "Personally, I would prioritize actual work experience and stable income over a PhD. Having practical experience in the field is a lot more appealing to employers than academic credentials unless you plan to go into pure research. \n\nIt'd also be worth looking into if this company offers so.e kind of tuition reimbursement program so you could continue school while working. There's a number of programs now that incorporate work projects into the thesis or capstone and where your supervisor can serve on your committee.",
