I\u2019m lucky that they are mostly nice people, and tolerable enough to hangout with. However, as for making close friends outside of your comfort, well, hopefully someone will let me know that they figured it out",

I have seen other folks in these forums discussing competition and personality conflicts within their graduate programs. However, my grad school experience included zero \"popular\" people and zero dating.\n\nI did my MA in an intimate program in rural Indiana, over several summers in residence, so we really bonded; my experience was atypical, and incredibly religious. We still have a group text going, and it is active every week. Thank God someone was there to wake me up for class every morning.",

      "text": "Part of this will depend on the department culture and just how you luck out that year. The groups are smaller, so you see each other around more, which means more potential to know each other better. At the same time, everyone is busy so it isn't like undergrad where you can spend a ton of time going out. Most folks I know go out sometimes, but spend more time working or at home. \n\n\nPeople-wise, grad students are just people, so you get a whole range.\n\n\nIn my master's program, the cohort above mine is pretty chill and they seem close-knit after surviving COVID together. My cohort has some tension, I think from a combo of personality differences and anxiety over grades. No one is really \"popular\" or \"unpopular\" as much as all of us found 1-2 people we vibe with more and don't reach outside of those groups much.",
