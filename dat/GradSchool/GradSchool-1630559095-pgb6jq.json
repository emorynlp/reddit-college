Once they become you students they don\u2019t feel like peers and hanging out with them is weird.\n\nAs for partying amongst themselves it really just depends on your department and the field itself. Some field, like philosophy, tend to have a higher than average number of alcoholics because there is a long history and culture of philosophy & alcohol going hand in hand. But they rarely party like undergrads, they usually just go to whichever bar is closest to the department and get hammered with the other phil grad students while arguing philosophy. Other fields and departments vary, with usually the bigger departments having less out of work socialization.",

Like many others in this thread I find it really depends - on the department, the students, and really the campus as well. One school I went to was in the suburbs of a major city and built on the top of a literal mountain, so it was pretty dead there after 5pm, and to make matters worse the graduate student pub was closed for several years. My current school is much more lively, in no small part because the campus is in the middle of a major urban area\u2019s downtown, so it\u2019s much easier to go out and grab a drink after class etc. \n\nAlso - if you build it, they will come. If there\u2019s not much of a party/socializing culture, create it yourself! People are often waiting for someone else to take the initiative. \n\nBest of luck if you do choose to pursue a masters!",

Not exactly partying, but there was sweet fuck all to do besides drink and campus was far from downtown, which was overrun by crackheads anyway. I am not a heavy drinker, and I dislike \"drink to get wasted\" bars, so I was a real outlier. Everyone was all up in each other's business too and it was just a weird gossipey department with way too much internal drama. I just found it depressing. I transferred out.\n\nWhere I'm currently studying it's a metropolis. Many students are total nerds who play board games, some are wild after hours seeking party animals, then there's me who really vibes with the small plates and wine at busy places. International students tend to complain about the lack of \"department life\", but it's one of the greatest cities on Earth.\n\nPoint being, there's going to be a huge range and most departments are going to have a \"culture\". There's little you can really do to change that. If partying is important to you, you'll find a way.",
