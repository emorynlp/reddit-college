      "text": "I'll suggest trying to figure out why you are feeling that way, like is it because your supervisor is an authority figure and you are intimidated or afraid or making a mistake, are you stressed out about your work not being good enough, about likely changes you will have to do, etc.\nOnce you can sort of pinpoint the reason you can come up with bridge statements or positive affirmations to ease your mind, also you can come up with stress relief strategies among the week like a reward system or something that allows you to relax even if just a bit.",

              "text": "Seconded. Anxiety is a normal human emotion that everyone has in some form or another. Everyone just has different triggers and response behaviors. More detailed identification of specific emotional triggers can guide the development of productive responses. Therapy can be a good option to get professional support, but there are also free online resources like [this workbook](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Self-Compassion) that can provided structured exercises if that appeals to OP.",

Is it possible that if you detach your work / study from your self worth, you may feel less anxious?\n\nhope that helps\n\nI really like this TED Talk on Getting Free of Self Importance. This seems to help me a lot.\n\nMore resources here for future reference. \n https://www.xoxial.com/lists/list-profile/5fd651b0e513374a548b8253\n\nHope things will get better with you soon.",

      "text": "I also got nervous before meetings, especially early on when I didn't know what to expect. For me, it helped to take control of the meetings a little bit. I write down an agenda of exactly what I want to talk about, including what I've done that week, what questions I have, what administrative tasks need to be done, etc. If we're short on time or it's a particularly heavy week, I'll email my advisor the agenda in advance, which also makes me feel more like I know what I'm doing lol.   \nI definitely still get anxious (especially on my less productive weeks) but I think having a better idea of how the meeting will go and feeling like I have more control over it is helpful!",
