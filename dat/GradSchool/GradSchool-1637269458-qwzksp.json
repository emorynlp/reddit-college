  "text": "I don\u2019t want to speak prematurely, but I genuinely think that the worst might almost be behind me. Next semester I\u2019m just doing an independent study (to wrap up my class hours) and three thesis hours. Basically just research and writing for my thesis. \n\nYea I still have a bunch of stuff to do in the last weeks of this semester. But next semester I shouldn\u2019t have any annoying weekly assignments, no midterms, no final exams, no term papers, and no presentations. Next semester It\u2019ll be all thesis work. And what makes things better is that my proposal is on the verge of being completed, I got a lot of research done over the summer, and I\u2019m planning to integrate two of my term papers into chapters for my thesis. So I should be able to hit the ground running starting in the Spring, hopefully get a lot of work done, and then wrap things up and graduate over the summer. At least that\u2019s the plan\u2026.\n\nI just hope I\u2019m not speaking to soon. Am I speaking to soon?",
