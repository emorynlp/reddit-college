  "text": "I re-read the paper and a voice in my head says I got things completely wrong. My professor gives very vague instructions and it\u2019s stressing me out. Also i\u2019m afraid of her. Deadline is on friday and i\u2019m still in the middle of writing. This is stressing me out as it\u2019s the final requirement for the subject. I\u2019m very competitive and I don\u2019t want to get a bad grade but i\u2019m really starting to lose hope.",

      "text": "Email your professor right now and ask if it would be possible to get some feedback. Or if it will be possible to meet in person to discuss it. Be sure to include the draft when you email them.\n\nAnd you'll be more likely to get assistance if you are specific about what you feel like might be wrong with it.  In other words, write a couple paragraphs of referencing the text explaining where you think the problems might be.",
