  "text": "Hey guys, I hope this is the right place to be posting this but I need some advice. \n\nSo last year I applied to a couple of grad schools for I/O psych and didn't get into any of them. Since then, I started working at a job that can pay for my masters and acquired a project management certification. \n\nThe issue lies in the fact that this job is awful, and I don't want to stay at it. My options then branch out to changing jobs or staying and having them pay for the masters. Then my other issue is that since I didn't get into an I/O psych program, should I apply for something else? Everyone says an MBA should be my way to go and it *does* make sense, logically, but I don't know if I should change on a whim. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice you can offer would be amazing. Thank you in advance.",
