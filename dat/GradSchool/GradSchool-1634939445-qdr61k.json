  "text": "Hi all,\n\nApologies if this isn't the right sub to post this question. I've been toying with the idea of getting a masters and am now a little more motivated since I found out my company will pay for it. However, I never considered grad school in my undergrad so I wanted to get more context to decide if it's something I want to do. \n\nA bit about me: I got my bachelors in applied math and data science from a decent public school in California. I mainly did internships over the summer so no published research.  My senior thesis was the main long term research I did where I used recurrent neural networks to predict activity patterns based on accelerometer data. We worked with a public health professional who was conducting an experiment on how activity patterns (walking, running, sitting, driving, etc) affected health outcomes. The scope of my involvement was to take the data from accelerometers that the participants wore and try to predict  what activity they were doing. Lastly, I got a 3.4 GPA, 3.6 major GPA and I took one practice GRE where I scored 156 verbal, 168 quant. \n\nI currently work as a quant trader at a hedge fund. Apart from daily trading activities, I've focused on strategy research for the fund where I get a data set of relevance (financial data of the assets we trade), do analysis to identify a signal and test for decay/cross exposure to existing strategies, and find a way to forecast the signal to trade on it. The researchers at our firm have PhDs so I would assume that they conduct research in a manner that is consistent with the research they did in grad school. \n\nI looked into a few math, cs, and stats masters programs and I'm still unsure of what the mix of research vs courses is. Also given I don't know too much about the grad school process. I'd assume GPA and GRE are the primary things looked at for applications, but how much do things like work experience and letters or rec matter?  Specifically for LOR, would it be better to get them from my former professors or professionals that I've worked for? Lastly, I think if I prepare well enough I can score in the 90th percentile for verbal and 99th percentile for quant. I'm more so worried about my GPA affecting my admissions outcome. My colleagues that I'd ask for a LOR did masters at HPY. Does the alma matter of the person writing your rec considered? Based on this info, what tiers of schools should I consider? Are Ivy leagues out of the question? \n\nThanks!",

GRE scores are for doctoral programs, not for Master's programs. Although good scores could help you. In my program, what mattered was grades and letters of recommendation. Few people had any work experience because we mostly were all straight out of undergrad.",
