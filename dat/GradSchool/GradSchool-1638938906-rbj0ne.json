  "text": " I am currently working as a part-time RA in a neuropsychology lab. The grad student I am working closely with is offering me an opportunity to get authorship on a poster she is planning on submitting soon for a conference. I keep hearing that having publications looks really good on a CV if you are planning on applying for grad school, but I am still unsure how to achieve this. Is having authorship on a poster presentation the same as having a publication? Should I strive to get certain publications to add to my CV?",

      "text": "The abstract for the poster will be published as part of the conference proceedings. It is something that can be cited, so technically it is a publication. I have a section on my CV that lists \"Conference abstracts\" that is separate from publications. As an undergraduate student, I think this is a great opportunity and gives you credit for work you have done. If you are applying for grad school, it shows that you are closely involved with research projects which may help set you apart from other applicants.\n\nSo no, a conference abstract is not the same as a peer-reviewed journal publication, but it's still a great thing to put on your CV! If the grad student is putting you as a coauthor on the poster, they may also intend to put you as a coauthor on the research paper at some point and that will look really good for you!",
