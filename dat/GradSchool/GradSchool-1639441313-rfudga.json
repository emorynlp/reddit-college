  "text": "How did you make friends in grad school that weren't rich?? I love my friends but constantly being around wealthy people gets draining after a while. I feel like I never truly fit in and want to meet people who have a similar background to me. Maybe this is a dumb question. I'm wondering if this is an issue for anyone else in grad school.",

Still have no friends tho but definitely no wealthies here. \n\nI did go to a private university for undergrad but ended up having to work full-time at cafes or restaurants and that\u2019s where I made most of my friends. Maybe you can volunteer.",

Honestly maybe they aren't even ridiculously wealthy, maybe I just grew up very poor in comparison so the contrast is startling lmao.",

      "text": "We have a mix of backgrounds at my school, but I tend to gravitate towards people who are similar to me. If you're first gen, going to a group for that if your university has one maybe helpful; not everyone from that background will be poor, but many of us are. It could also be worth going to free events on campus, getting involved with local organizations, anything you can do that won't take much money.",
