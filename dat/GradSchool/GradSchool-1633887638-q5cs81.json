  "text": "Hey all, first time posting here, but I thought this would be the best place for my question. A bit of background information first. Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate at a large public university studying sleep circuitry at the systems level. I have decided that I do not intend to go into academia after finishing my degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo with that out of the way, I would like to have a good fall-back plan if I end up not being able to complete my Ph.D. degree. My program allows one to \"master out\" if they decide to end early. **I do not think this will happen, and I have the fullest intentions of completing my degree**; however, I would like a backup plan just in case. If I have learned one thing about life, it is that it does not go as planned quite often. So with that in mind, what jobs/careers are available to one with an M.S in Neuroscience? I hear the platitudinous word \"industry\" thrown around a lot but without specifics ever given. Googling this has not gotten me very far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I knew someone who did master out of a neuroscience PhD and was able to find an industry job at a company specifically looking for someone with slice electrophysiology skills. Among neuroscience PhD students it seems this expertise as well as sometimes experience coding can be specialized skills that can help you get your foot in the door. \n\nEven if you don't do these things, one place to start might be thinking about which wet lab skills you have or will develop and search for jobs/companies where those are in demand. Conversely, pick a few companies that sound cool to you or even ones you've just heard of and look at job postings and see what types of skills they're looking for. You'll have that in mind if you're ever presented with the opportunity to learn those skills. \n\nIn addition to lab work, if you enjoy organizing events, leading teams, advocacy, science communication, etc., keep doing this work as much of it will be useful to a wide array of future careers regardless of your wet lab experience.",

          "text": "I wouldn't be as worried if I had marketable wet lab skills. Most of it is just IHC, surgeries, and DREADDs. It seems that research scientists at industries want things like slice electrophysiology, pharmacology, and molecular-based techniques, things that I do not have. Luckily, I CAN code.\n\nI am also involved in extra-curricular things like scientific communication to broaden my skill-sets.",

              "text": "Honestly, it sounds like you've already built a great set of skills! Even something that may seem small like IHC I think is applicable at many of the antibody companies and the R&D side of big companies like Pfizer, Genentech, etc. Also the coding and sci com skills are going to be very versatile and applicable to whatever you do. \n\nIf you're worried about mol bio skills could you pick up a small, low-risk cloning project for something you could use but don't NEED in lab? Alternatively, you could look for other non-lab activities geared toward what you might want to do after PhD/masters. For example, I know many grad students who've gotten involved in consulting clubs and have really enjoyed the teamwork and business experience they have gained. I also know people who've done a lot of educational outreach which is both rewarding and good experience for a potential teaching role.",

      "text": "Maybe you can reach out to someone in an industry position you can see yourself in and ask to chat sometime? I'm not in neuroscience but coding, critical thinking, and research design are all skills that can go a long way in industry. Also consider you are probably valuable to people who aren't in neuroscience, such as data science or finance... if you decide to not stay in this field. These jobs are also considered \"industry\".",
