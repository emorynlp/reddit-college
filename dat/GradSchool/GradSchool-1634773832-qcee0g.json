  "text": "I guess that its really. My supervisor refused to help me and was very firm with brushing me off and im the last person who should be doing research alone.\n\nI did complain but the institution werent interested. After that i lost heart.\n\nI sincerely tried my best but they covid kicked us all off campus and i was alone in every way.\n\nI handed in my thesis 3 weeks ago today and waiting for my result is making me feel terrible.\n\nIf i failed (likely) i will not be able to move forward with my career.\n\nI feel devastated and depressed.",
