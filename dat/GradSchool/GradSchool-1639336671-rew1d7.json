  "text": "I myself am not a grad student, but I was dating one for 8 months up until about 24 hours ago. Not sure if this is allowed here, I guess I just need people who understand the situation and his workload. He's doing a PhD in chem at one of the nation's top programs and we had mentally prepared for everything and I was okay with seeing him twice a month and seeing him intermittently, but he told me over text yesterday that he couldn't do it and couldn't be in a relationship right now.\n\nMaybe it's for the best in the long run, but I feel so lost and I don't even know how to feel or what I'm feeling. Nothing happened, he just...doesn't have the mental capacity or the time. I never thought it'd be like this and while I do see firsthand how his work is completely consuming him...I'm kind of like...you can't text me twice a day or facetime at night for ten minutes? I just hope he's well and I really hope he'd stay in touch but with how little he uses his phone to begin with, I wouldn't be surprised if I never heard from him again. He was planning things for my birthday too which was last week and he was asking me things for a gift and the whole situation just...sucks because it's due to time.\n\n\n\nEdit: basically, he doesnt have the mental capacity for a relationship (not so much the time), he\u2019s overwhelmed and cant balance work and his personal life. I do want to clarify that he\u2019s always been really straight forward and hasnt ever had any unspoken motives, so im just going to take it at face value.",

That is obviously not a happy time and will hurt one or both people, and even those of us with autism know that well. He *chose* to break up with her over text with that knowledge.\n\nBreaking up with people in-person isn't an unspoken social rule, it's a very widely spoken one.

Part of being a good partner is understanding that the relationship may take second priority for a few months at a time, but you also have to trust the person to not bail and break up every single time things get tough.\n\nReally sorry you're going through this!

There's always less time than you want to do everything, but it's about time management and setting priorities.

The unfortunate truth is that he simply stopped caring about you. Maybe because he got overwhelmed and had no more space to care about you, or maybe it died a natural death with distance. But either way, he does not care and he broke up via text because he does not care.\n\nWe autistic people tend to be a little selfish by design (not our fault, it's the way we are) what with all the monologuing and having difficulty understanding other people or forming connections, but that just means we have to be mindful of others and keep our behaviour in check manually. He could not be bothered to do this for you now when he *has* previously bothered. You were simply considered to be less important than everything else in his life right now, and so you got no consideration and no discussion and none of his actual time or attention.",

You won't have his best.\n\nThe reality is that, currently, he is not in a good place to dedicate time to school and you. And that is not a good or bad thing. It's just the situation. It sucks, but he isn't a dick for calling it off. An alternative would be he continues the relationship with you and then you both begin to resent each other to the point where no relationship is salvageable, which is where I found myself. \n\nGive yourself some time to recover from this. Keep in touch if you want. I am sure a couple of texts saying \"wish you well\" won't hurt, but y'all need a little bit of time. Give a month or two before you suggest talking in person again.\n\nEdit: Because I'm reading through some more of these comments, take everything that says \"He's a dick\" or \"Don't talk to him.

She didn\u2019t care where I was, what I was doing, or if we even saw each other Monday to Saturday. I was in the lab 9-9, 6 days a week. I took 1 hour to each lunch and 1:30 mins to eat dinner and go on a jog and shower. Then back to it. I did this for 4 years and not once worked on Sunday. It worked for us. I was at an extremely demanding lab, in a very high tier institution.\n\nIf you are committed to a relationship, you can make it work. You will find a balance that works. Saying he doesn\u2019t have the capacity is not true. I am sorry y\u2019all broke up but this is probably for your best interest. If you still love him, just keep showing up. You don\u2019t have to jump back into a relationship but just be there. Go over on Sundays and hang out. Get drinks together once a month. There are ways to see someone in the interim periods.

I felt the same way with wondering why they couldn't even send a quick text saying hi every once in a while. Especially when it's someone you like and want to talk to or spend time with.\n\nHonestly it's the reason I stopped dating, because most of the people I matched with were other grad students and this happened pretty much every time. Chem seems to be particularly brutal with respect to work-life balance. Virtual hugs because of how much this entire situation sucks, but if it's any help it does get better with time. And now you'll be able to find someone who can prioritize you :)\n\nEdit: I can't type on mobile apparently",

Why you two would've succeeded. \n\nThat's nothing more than a cowardly answer, maybe I was raised with high standards but my old man went to a top med school in DC. He ALWAYS made time for my mum and mind you this is when there was NO cellphones at all. \n\nHe always says unless you're a prospective student or candidate in medical school, what's your excuse? He would spend time with my mum every week and made efforts to write letters or drop by her home after. \n\nListen sis I'm in my masters, my ex was going to be a heart surgeon and I didn't want any part of it mostly cause he couldn't even fix his own heart. Don't long for someone who doesn't know what they have. Cause they'll let it go. And on your end, I've been there and it sucks.\n\nIf you are important in someone's life or a priority, efforts meet. You have people in different time zones who have jobs, family, life, etc. You can make it work.",

Yet, it's conditional upon completion -- someone who made it halfway through a grad program almost risks having less to say than on their education than someone who never started one at all -- after all, you either hide that information, or need to have a very good answer to the obvious question. Neither case is ideal.\n\nSo, you do your thing, you fight for the finish line, and I think a lot of people start cutting other aspects of a normal life out (I know I certainly did), because of how much is at stake -- even a semester delay means thousands of dollars in cost, and months of time that only means as much as you learned. That has plenty of personal value, but limited in a professional future. \n\nI'm sorry you had to deal with that, and I don't think you have any obligation to wait until the work is done -- I don't think I would.

      "text": "I don\u2019t agree with the majority of posters here. Saying that they were immensely stressed in grad school and still managed to maintain healthy relationships. Well good for them, but people are different. I\u2019m a bit like your ex, when I get consumed by work I don\u2019t want to see other people and the mental effort that it takes, or feels like it would take, is hard to convey because I understand that it\u2019s not most people\u2019s reaction in that situation. My instinct is simply to withdraw, and it\u2019s not conducive to a good relationship. I think it\u2019s quite presumptuous to say that him doing that is because he doesn\u2019t care enough, that\u2019s simply projecting yourself onto him. Admittedly, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing but simply with the intent of offering a counter example. For me social interaction takes energy, and that\u2019s true for my family, friends and partner. The problem is that with a partner it\u2019s much less justifiable to withdraw. I don\u2019t have as much of a problem telling a friend that I can\u2019t come to some event, but telling my partner that I just wanna stare at the ceiling and be alone is a lot harder.\n\nAnyway, breakup method aside I think it\u2019s possible he\u2019s actually being honest with you, and you know him better than we do.",
