  "text": "I am specifically looking into applying for the Symbolic Systems major at Stanford. I have a high GPA (3.87) and majored in Cognitive Science (basically same thing as Symbolic Systems) in undergrad, but no research authorship. \n\nI have some research experience, but nothing to necessarily \"prove\" it. Also, It's been a couple of years since I worked with the professor I did research with, and I'm frankly not sure if they'd be willing/able to write me a letter of rec? I'm always so awkward when it comes to asking.\n\nI thought about emailing her to ask about volunteer/employment opportunities, but with the deadline for the app Feb 1st, 2022, is that too little too late? Right now, if I were to apply, I'd likely have 3 letters of recommendation from the same place, and no actual professors (but one would be a certified psychiatrist.) Thoughts? Will my GPA/coursework matching SymSys be enough, or likely not?",
