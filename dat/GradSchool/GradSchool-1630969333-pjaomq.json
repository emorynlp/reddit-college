      "text": "I hate doing this too, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Your three letter writers will have different working relationships with you, so you can emphasize different strengths in each letter.\n\nHot tip for making the three letters sound different: ask your friends/labmates for their letters. This gives you an idea of the verbiage and different motifs of the LOR. Take what's useful, discard what isn't, make a Frankenstein's monster of a letter. This is what I did. Alternatively, make a letter writer ring with 2 other people whose CVs you know well enough. (This is what I want to do.)",

I think all he changed was putting it on official letterhead so I\u2019m glad I did a good job writing it :). The other reference I had worked with more revelry and he wrote his own.

Unless you've worked closely with them on a research project, they might not even really know who you are beyond looking up your grades or whether or not you actively participate in class. They need you to remind them who you are and why you deserve a reference letter. The professors who know me well and have had me do this always edit the letter into something much more impressive than the draft I write.\n\nWhy does moving states matter? I did my bachelor's, master's and now PhD all in different countries, so my references all came from countries other than the one I was applying to. References are not restricted to a particular country let alone a particular state. Ask the professors who know you best to be your referees, no matter where they are.",
