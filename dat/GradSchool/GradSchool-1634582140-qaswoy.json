  "text": "I am looking for some advice on if I should pursue the thesis option of my graduate program. \n\nFall 2022 I am attending a Master's program at a high ranked US public school for (without getting too specific) biological sciences. This program offers the choice of a non-thesis degree or working with a faculty member to work on a research based thesis. \n\nI do not intend on pursuing a PhD after getting my masters. My intent post-MS is to go into industry work, possibly as a lab manager type position. \n\nIf I do not pursue the thesis option, I would just be taking classes and TAing for funding. This would allow my schooling to possibly be less stressful and more focused on taking classes that can expose me to as many skills/techniques as possible. There are a number of very hands-on, skill based on classes. \n\nPursuing the thesis option, while I do think is probably better for me overall, would be most likely be a lot more work. I may even still have to TA for funding even when pursuing this option, but thesis research can account for a certain number of my MS class credits. And I may be in a lab that exposes me extensively to some techniques, but not to as many lab techniques as some of the hands-on classes I've looked at. \n\nSo, is a thesis option worth the extra work and possibly being more specialized given that I do not plan on getting a PhD and want to go into industry? I'm leaning towards yes, but would love to hear some outside opinions before committing to the extra work load. Thanks!",

      "text": "I recommend the thesis option. Even when I interview for industry jobs I get asked many questions about my research. I think this is because it's much more engaging and formative than classes. Remember that successful research demonstrates so many skills: creative thinking, writing, communication, project management, and all those hard skills associated with the sciences. Honestly, I have a hard time understanding how a solely course-based master's program demonstrates mastery and not just an extension of undergrad.",

          "text": "Thanks for the answer. I haven't actually worked any in industry as of yet, I only went on a couple interviews in not very related before accepting a job in a more related academia lab, so it's very interesting to hear that even the industry jobs are interested in your thesis and research.",

      "text": "I'm not sure about the biological sciences. I got my Masters in EE, but I went the non-thesis project route. My advisor told me that the thesis is best if you want to get into a different school for a PhD program, but a project would better show employers what it is I can do, and as it is engineering, more specifically, what I can make.\n\nI suggest you talk it over with your advisor, tell them your plans post graduation and find the best fit for you.",

Could be a good half way point if needed. Thanks!",
