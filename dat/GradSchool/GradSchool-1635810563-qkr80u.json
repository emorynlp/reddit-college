I\u2019ve emailed people and they have responded, but there\u2019s this bit of an awkward \u201cok cool we\u2019re both interested we\u2019ll see what happens next\u201d feeling afterwards.

After the initial \u201cWe want to work together\u201d talk, ask detailed questions about the school and application process. Ask about funding and lifestyle near the school. Ask to do a Zoom call and talk in depth about different projects you could participate in! Keep the conversation going so when it comes to decision time you are confident in your choice.",

Even then we tend to wait until we've joined the program and are deciding on rotations. You'd have to be really exceptional for someone to go out of their way with the admissions committee, and if you're that great, then you'll get in regardless.\n\nThough, if you are deciding between multiple schools, having been offered admission, then it would make sense to contact people you are interested in to see if they are accepting students. \n\nI'm sure people do contact faculty before applying, but I don't think it makes a difference at most universities?\n\nBut I say this as someone who only applied to R1 programs with guaranteed funding. Maybe it's different in other circumstances? (But you shouldn't do it without full funding...)",
