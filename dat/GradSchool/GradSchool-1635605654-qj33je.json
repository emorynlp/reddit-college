  "text": "Hey there!\n\nSo, I\u2019m applying to graduate schools for PhD programs in microbiology/biology. I have two outstanding letters of recommendation so far. \n\nI\u2019ve run into a slight problem: I can\u2019t decide who to have write my third letter of recommendation. The options are:\n\n1. The veterinarian who taught me most of my animal handling and surgical techniques. Problem: she is very anti-academia, and though she\u2019ll write the letter, she wants to convince me to join her in industry instead. \n\n2. An old public health professor, and a member of my master\u2019s degree committee. Problem: He\u2019ll write the letter, but it won\u2019t be stellar- we don\u2019t know each other quite as well as I would like. \n\n3. A former boss from when I worked as an Residential assistant, as an undergraduate. This will be the most enthusiastic letter of them all, because he\u2019s one of my closest friends at the moment. It will also cover all of the diversity and inclusion areas that graduate schools seem to be looking for, and will explain some shakier areas of my undergraduate transcript. Problem: it\u2019s not an academic reference. \n\n\nAny suggestions as to what you would do, if you were in my shoes? My current thought is that #3 is the best, but I\u2019d like to hear some outside opinions. Thank you!",

      "text": "I'd dig around the application requirements/policies or even contact someone in the department if possible to see if it's an explicit \"no\" or if this is a \"we'd like to see X but don't mind Y\" kind of thing.\n\nI know with my school they say that you need three academic letters but after looking and using their own application guidelines they said they didn't actually care that much and wanted more specifically to see people who can speak well to your performance.\n\nI'd lean toward three as well because the ultimate purpose of the letter is to illustrate why you'd be a strong candidate, so getting a mediocre letter isn't going to do you any good. That's why if you can rule out having a non-academic advisor as an issue, 3 is the easy pick. \n\nIf it turns out that it's a hard \"no it has to be academic only\" then 1 is probably a better option and you could even fill them in on some of your academic background details that 3 is aware of. It's pretty common for someone to ask for a copy of your resume and any relevant details they should be aware of if they're writing you a letter. \n\nEven then, the main reason you're doing that is so that you don't do something that'll immediately hurt or disqualify you from the pool, so a bit of research or followup with the department and their trends goes a long way.",
