  "title:": "I had a meeting with my advisor and it was a desaster",
  "text": "I barely got anything done this year, and ever worse: I didn't quite understood the entire scope of this project I'm working on (more his than mine, because the project I submited in the selection process is ***very different*** from the one I'm working on now).\n\nWe've talked about what I wrote and basically it's pretty bad. When I accepted to work on this project, I couldn't antecipate how much I would hate it at the end. I feel zero will to go on, the only thing is: if I drop out, I'll have to compensate all the funding I got so far, which is arround 1600 dollars (maybe doesn't sound too bad, but in my currecncy that a lot of money. There's a few conditions were I don't need to pay, I'm not gonna go into detail, but I'm just gonna say I don't really qualify right now), so I'm basically stuck.\n\nThe program I *really* wanted just openned its selection (public uni, no tuition). I've though of submiting a project, but I'm not sure I would be able to abandon the one I'm currently in. I regret *so much* picking some program solely based on the name of the institution and feeling miserable just because I wanted something to look good on my resum\u00e9. I did my undergrad on some not-so-good uni and just wanted to level up, but it's dragging me down so much. I'm losing my interest in research in general and even questioning if I ever had some interest in it to begin with.\n\nIt looks like a lot, but all of this was resolved in my head before this meeting lol and now I wanted to drop out again, because I never quite understood what my advisor wanted me to do and now I feel very dumb and undeserving of being there. It's been a whole year and I couldn't do nothing good.\n\nI low key wanna die.",
