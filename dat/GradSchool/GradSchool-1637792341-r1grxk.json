  "text": "It\u2019s my first semester of grad school and as things draw to a close I feel even more overwhelmed. My cohort and I have been bombarded with projects and assignments that are due next week. It\u2019s the final week of classes and I\u2019ve put in my best effort to manage my time but I still have so much to do! Because of this I feel so stressed and borderline guilty if I take a day off for Thanksgiving. Does anyone feel like this or am I just putting undue pressure on myself?",

I'm in my fifth of six semesters and my fuck-o-meter is at an all time low. It'll get done! You have to give yourself time to shut off your brain. You can't go all the time always or you'll snap :) One of the most valuable things I've learned in grad school is how to listen to my body when it's asking for rest. You'll get it done.",

Im home for the first time in months and my seminar papers are spinning in my head haha. You deserve your break. Take a day off and relax. \n\nPrep yourself and prioritize your tasks if it\u2019ll help you ease the tension. I\u2019ve got a list of TO-DOs with days and times that I\u2019ll be working on after the next two days of break so I can at least feel better about not doing any work. \n\nCan you ask for extensions? Maybe an extra day or two if your professors don\u2019t have grades to input yet? At least asking is better than not and finding out you could have been helped! \n\nAnyways, enjoy your time off. It\u2019s important to put your needs first! No need to feel guilty about it. \u2764\ufe0f",
