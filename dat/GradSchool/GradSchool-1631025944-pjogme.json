  "text": "It was a pretty simple one, where we had to discuss the relevance of our research topic. I'm a few months into my program and had to change subjects to get funding. I kinda misunderstood the topic and wrote more about a secondary element of the research than the main thing, going as far as mentioning how many publications this secondary element have (which isn't a lot).\n\nI'm at lost now. I'm trying to convince myself that's not much I can do now, while questioning why I never asked for help from my advisor.\n\nI guess I need advice lol",

      "text": "A discussion of your topics relevance probably isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world to mess up, if the subject of the related secondary element you speak of is in fact relevant to the work, then I don\u2019t really see why your adviser would be upset, you discussed a portion of the work that is relevant in your own understanding. \n\nIf worst comes to worst and your adviser does take issue with your work, then discuss with them and be open about finding a solution. If you just misunderstood the nature of the assignment, I doubt any (normal, respectful) adviser would fault you for coming to them seeking guidance for future endeavors. \n\nMessing up isn\u2019t the end of the world, but how you respond to it is what makes a difference. You are there to learn, not to get everything right all the time the first time. \n\ntl;dr it may not even be a problem, and if it is, then be forward and honest, then discuss how to improve for the future.",
