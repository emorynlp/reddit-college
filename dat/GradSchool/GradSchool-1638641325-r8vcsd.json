  "text": "I've been traying to find a copy of NATO's 2001 'Open Source Intelligence Handbook', but the only thing I've been able to get is this: [https://archive.org/details/NATOOSINTHandbookV1.2/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NATOOSINTHandbookV1.2/mode/2up). Anyone know how I could cite this in Harvard? I'm missing the publishing location most of all. I don't understand why this document or information on it is so hard to find online.",

I've cited sources where all I had was the title of the article and the web address, because it was undated and there were no authors listed. In my experience, you'll find this with government and policy documents.",
