  "text": "Hello, I was just seeking some advice from those who have completed a masters or anyone who might have an opinion or knowledge on this subject. \n\nI completed my university degree earlier this year and did not want to do masters after due to a variety of reasons. One of which being, I wanted to work rather than spend another year in education. \n\nI graduated from England and as with other establishments (I assume), when you become an alumni you are given a discount if you chose to pursue a post graduate degree. \n\nAfter careful consideration, although a bit late I\u2019ve been looking into a postgraduate degree, (digital marketing and business transformation) however even with the discount, the tuition fees are still somewhat expensive. \n\nI\u2019ve known Europe to be relatively cheaper and wanted to know whether I should take an online course from a university in Europe to pursue the degree. \n\nI am also looking for work and I am unsure how it will affect my work life. What do you guys recommend? Should I put it off? Was I too late? Can it be done together? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.",
