I recently found out that in France, they're called a \"Cubie\" (~cube). Ergo: Cubie, or not Cubie. That is the question.    *\n\n  \nStressed, depressed, burnt out  \nStraw that broke the camel's back  \nCatatonia. \n\n    \nThis next one is way too classy a poem to just spontaneously pop into my head while sitting on the toilet, but apparently I wrote this:    \n\nA life of purpose or a life of pleasure,  \nA life of learning or a life of leisure,  \nIf truth and knowledge be ones treasure,  \nThen matters not which rule you measure    \n\n    \nOn the other hand though:    \n\nI fear I exist  \nAt a level of wit  \nLocated betwixt  \nThe extremes of a twit  \nAnd a self-righteous git  \nThat denies me remit  \nTo find peace in my bit  \nAs my brain won't permit  \nMe both mirth and merit    \n\n\n\nI also just thought of this, while cleaning up and thinking of which poems to share here. I am currently incredibly sleep deprived btw ;).     \n\n\nA quixotic daydreamer with a scholarly tilt.  \nA laptop's my stallion, my pencil's a hilt.  \nI began so resplendent; gaudy and bedazzled.  \nNow my cloth is in tatters, and my tatters are frazzled.    \n\nOh the loom I've constructed, all up in my head.  \nBut when courage is mustered, I'm all out of thread    \nMy framework's exquisite, reasoning watertight   \nBut a glance at my fields, yields a vista of blight      \n    \n\nIf anyone's interested, there's also my existential haiku cantos, or for something more fun, Poohemian Crapsody, a parody I wrote. Yes, it's pretty much exactly about what you think it's about...",

What characterizes a haiku is usually that they are few in syllables, and that they involve a new change of idea appearing thats sort of unexpected. So, maybe by that definition, these still aren't haikus (or they're just bad haiku).",
