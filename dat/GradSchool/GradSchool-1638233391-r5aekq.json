  "title:": "Should I transfer to another MBA/MPH program?",
  "text": "I am in my first semester of a dual-degree MBA (Masters of Business Administration)/MPH (Masters of Public Health) program and am underwhelmed. I'm wondering if I should apply to other schools. \n\nI moved to the city my school was located for a job seven months ago. I had intentions of applying to an MBA/MPH program in a few years but applied to my program literally 2 weeks after finding out about it because it was close, and I could complete the degrees without loans (thanks to my job). It's a state university in the Midwest - the MBA program is unranked, and MPH is ranked in the low 50s. My UG is from a top 20 school. \n\n I started in August but realize now that the school is only regionally respected and I don't feel challenged in the program.  After looking at LinkedIn of people who graduated from the same program, their careers are not as ambitious as I'd like mine to be. When I applied to the program, I was not informed about how much the school you obtain your MBA from matters. \n\nI'm not sure if I will stay in the area upon graduation, but I want to ensure that my degrees can be respected if I move to another part of the country. I have a remote, part-time research assistantship at one of the top public health schools, which I hope can help me resume-wise, along with my full-time job and previous job (healthcare) experiences. Luckily, my part-time assistantship is through one of the schools I'm considering. My position can be converted to a graduate assistantship if I'm accepted and enrolled in the school. \n\nI have varied interests and am looking to go into healthcare consulting, pharmaceutical, or biotech. I am also interested in potentially going to get a PhD in health policy/management. I realize that most employees in big 4 consulting firms, pharm, and biotech have degrees from top business schools. \n\nThe huge benefit of my current program is obviously that I can graduate with two degrees without any debt. The programs I am thinking about switching to have steep tuition prices (ex. $135k for 2 years at Hopkins), but I also understand another school's prestige and network can provide a much higher earning potential. \n\nIs it worth it for me to apply to another MBA/MPH program? If I stay in my current program, do I still have the potential to make $150k after graduation like those from other schools? If I stay, is there anything I can do to make myself more desirable in the fields I want to go into? \n\nOther MBA/MPH programs I'm thinking of applying to:  \n\n\\- UMichigan, Johns Hopkins, UC Berkeley, Yale, Emory, Columbia, University of Minnesota, UNC, UCLA, Dartmouth, Yale",

      "text": "The only people I know who have MPH\u2019s who make $150k also have an MD or DO. \n\nI have a great salary at $120k+ and I\u2019ve been working for 15 years for public health at the Federal and state levels. \n\nCurious if you\u2019d DM me the school you are at. \n\nI\u2019ve hired many people in public health and the MPH school typically doesn\u2019t matter if accredited The school isn\u2019t a tie breaker, or matter at all really. Bottom line is experience is what matters (e.g. I had an applicant from an Ivy, Hopkins, and a southern state school and we hired the state school student because they had the best experience and were the best fit).",
