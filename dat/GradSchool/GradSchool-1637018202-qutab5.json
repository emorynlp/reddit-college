  "text": "Advisers are human beings. They end up having students who are favorites, maybe who they have better rapport with, maybe some are really just superstar students who are ultra productive and outshine others. My PI last week made some offhand comment that reaffirmed to me that he does compare us grad students and while I probably knew it in the back of my mind, it was a still a bit like, \"oh, okay.\"\n\nIt makes me feel inadequate. I don't want to be compared to other students in the lab. I'm never going to measure up that way. The thing is that my adviser isn't toxic or anything, he just slipped up, and he did quickly try to recover, \"oh but you're great, too.\" \n\nI was reading a paper earlier last week called \"The flip side of the attrition coin: Faculty perceptions of factors supporting graduate student success,\" and one of the PIs they interviewed said something about not necessarily wanting to foster jealousy between his students, but to maybe get a sense of competition going. Lol I can't imagine anything that would make me more miserable.",

      "text": "It\u2019s true, advisors are humans and end up with favorites even if they don\u2019t want to. So do parents with their kids. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll treat the others differently in either case. \n\nAt the end of the day, who cares? Would it be great to be your advisor\u2019s favorite? Sure. But are you still going to end up with the same degree at the end of the day if you\u2019re not the favorite? Yes. It is unlikely that your advisor ever works against your career, even if you\u2019re not the favorite, so ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter much. Your worth is not defined by their favor.",

          "text": "I guess I extrapolate to the favorite student getting better opportunities sent their way, likely stronger letters of rec, etc, but even in the meantime, I know that our lab favorite gets a lot more of our adviser's attention (time), which is unfair since this also means that their project advances faster than students who aren't able to command his attention as well. Inevitable, but still shitty.",

      "text": "Lols I know the feeling. Sometimes I feel like my advisor has a favorite too even though he vehemently denies it. I think you have two options to make:\n1. Find out what makes that student your PI\u2019s favorite and try to do it 10 times more.\n2. (Better option), vent about it with the non-favorite lab-mates and keep doing what you do. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter as long as your PI treats you all the same way. If not, you might consider speaking up if you\u2019re close to them.",
