  "title:": "Am I doing grad school wrong? Someone please tell me what grad school is all about.",
  "text": "When I was about to start grad school, I knew school was more than just studying. It's an opportunity to network, join clubs, competitions, make friends, etc. But it all seems to be out of reach now that the reality is all I do is school work and study, even on Sundays and the holidays. \n\nWhy am I doing this? I'm not doing this so that I graduate with great grades. I just want to graduate. However, I do want to actually learn something and take some skills with me. And that goal, along with the workload, require me to do \"overtime\". It's like I have to do school anytime I can, otherwise it won't cut it.\n\nI'm too busy, too worried sometime, to even enjoy grad school. I live and study in a very beautiful place but I'm like, \"Traveling? Huh, no time...\" \n\nBut I know, absurd as this experience might be, we won't get it anymore after we graduate. So can someone please tell me how should I do grad school more healthily? What should I focus on instead? And how can I be more effective with my study so it doesn't take up so much of my time?",

      "text": "I felt similarly a while ago. The workload and the academic culture make it seem like working longer hours and weekends is the only way to go. \n\nHowever, I noticed that I am just not productive (and even less motivated) if I work long hours continuously. I need breaks to function well and to do meaningful work. So, I tried to be more mindful of when I needed a break and set a time at which I would stop working in the evening (inspired by the [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) book from Newport). This worked quite well for my productivity, motivation and work-life balance. Of course, I still have many unproductive days, but I felt it was a substantial improvement. Maybe something like this could be useful for you too?\n\nI also talked to some more senior people about this. Some live for work and some do not and have a life outside of academia. This means that it is possible to have a better work-life balance, but academia might not be an easy environment to manage that. \n\nMaybe, it could also help to determine, where the pressure to work overtime is coming from. Is it coming from your supervisor, your comittee, someone (or something) else, or yourself? In my case, I was mostly pressuring myself to do things. As an example: I had one semester during which I just could not manage everything (because too much coincided) and I had to half-ass some things. It was stressful and the quality of my work suffered a bit, but in the end it was really not that big of a deal. This brought me to the conclusion that it is okay to half-ass some (ideally the less important) things. Maybe you could try to work out which aspects of your work you (and your professor) place value on, and which not, and then focus on the important ones.\n\nHope you find a way to be happy during grad school!",

I am like 30 right now and I wish I had made more friends and networked more in college. Those connections, even with minimal maintenance, can last a lifetime even if just casually. \n\nI was in industry first and then came to a phd. The one think I got (reinforced by watching my father work in academia) is that collaborations, funding, jobs, introductions, etc will all come from connections. Anyone who tells you not to network should have all of their advice taken with a grain of salt.",

      "text": "Something my supervisor told me earlier this semester, which has led to much healthier work balance: you will *never* hit a point where there isn't another book you could read, more research you could do, more work, all of that. Things will take as much time as they are given, so make sure you set aside time specifically to not work. \n\n\nThat can be hard, since grad school is an environment where being overworked is normalized, but you've got to set those habits, particularly if you want to stay in academia. I've started treating it like a job; there are hours and days when I just *will not* work. Setting those boundaries is going to give you more energy, for your work and for your personal life, in the long run.\n\n\nI find it's also helpful to be accountable to someone on this if you won't easily do it on your own. At my house we try to do movies, and sometimes I've gone to do coffee or food with cohort members if everyone is collectively freaking out.\n\n\n\nLastly, I think it's really beneficial to be in therapy during grad school so you can learn skills for stress management and work-life balance. It can be so helpful to have this objective party who can pinpoint ways for you to improve while acknowledging the inherent workload that comes with being a grad student. Definitely recommend it to anyone, not just those of us who already had mental health stuff to work through.",
