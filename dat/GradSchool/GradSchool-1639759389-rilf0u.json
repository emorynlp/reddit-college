  "text": "I wish to leave my research group, and I didn't sign any contract or anything so my \"employment\" is at will. However, the prof did say she wanted a commitment of 2 semesters but it has only been 1. I do not mind her not liking me b/c I will not ask for a rec or anything. \n\nWhat should I do to leave? Do I give a 1-week notice before I leave, or can I just email the prof right now saying I'm done? Also, how do I word the email? Should it be short\n\nThanks so much",

She might be at a conference in a few years and someone from a place where you're applying says, \"oh hey Dr X, you're from XYZ U, right? Did you ever know /u/Comfortable_Load_928? What did you think of them, any red flags? They're on the shortlist for this position with me right now.\"\n\nIt's not ethical, but it 100% absolutely happens (at least in my field). Usually in an informal way during post-conference drinks.",
