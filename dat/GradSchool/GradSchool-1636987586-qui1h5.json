  "text": "I give my program pretty much everything I've got, all the hard work and sanity I can muster. And what I get back is sometimes good but other times is just pure abuse. \n\nI spent my birthday studying for my latest exam and walked out of it feeling relieved, thinking I had turned the corner in this difficult class. I honestly felt like I was \"getting it\" more thoroughly than before. NOPE. Did real bad, worse than the class average, even. I should have enjoyed my birthday instead since the effort I put into my exam at the expense of enjoying my special day meant nothing in the end.\n\nWhy you gotta be like this, grad school? I give you so much of what I have and you just slap me in the face in return. I'm starting to feel convinced that I won't even be happy when I finish, I'll just be *relieved* and ready to walk away from this bullshit that made two years of my life a living hell.\n\nFuck.",

I don't spend a lot of time worrying about doing the work -- I just get started on it. Yeah there's still procrastination, but I have a full time job so my time has to be well budgeted. I remember spending a lot of time in anguish in undergrad because of all the \"work\" I had to do, instead of actually sitting down and doing the work consistently.",

There used to be a time I felt bad for not going out with my friends, but after a very frustratring experience I decided it was not worth it.\n\n**What happened:** It was my friend's birthday, it took me three hours just to get there (it was a hour and a half commute, but there was a lot of traffic). She invited a lot of people to the restaurant, which is fine, honestly. I spent all my time there chatting with some people I barely knew because she was obviously busy (again, to be expected).\n\nI had to leave early to catch my bus, so we said goodbye and I went home. Now it's where the sh\\*tshow begins: the next day got a message saying she was sorry we didn't spend much time together and then inviting me to another b-day party in the same place the next week! I said no, because I was busy with school and she was like \"but it's the weekend!\" yeah well guess what, it's a lot of school work. I spent many productive hours of my day to go to her birthday and her behavior the next day showed me she had really no respect for my time.",

Most people don\u2019t say it out loud and older academics don\u2019t want to hear it. But that needs to be the norm. It needs to be said and affirmed. And frankly you can\u2019t change the system by turning down the underpaid job offer unless everyone does it. What I can do, having accepted the underpaid offer, is get my colleagues together and demand a housing allowance to effectively pay us all better, but most importantly to pay younger profs appropriately for their skills and talents while not closing the salary gap (nowhere can you pay an entry level hire what the 20 or 30 yr senior person earns in terms of salary; fucks shit up to do that)",

So in a sense, there's no \"wasted effort', even if I started reading the same paper at a different time, I would still misread that inner product as a 2 tuple, because I haven't learn that mathematicians actually use parenthesis instead of brackets for inner products yet - not until after I made this mistake and waste a whole day on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, your time spent on the exam wasn't wasted even thought you got it wrong, because this was a necessary step for you to learn the materials, to learn time management, to learn to allow yourself to take breaks for things that matter more than graduate school - all things that will make the rest of your studies more sustainable.",

Some key things:\n\n- Grad school makes people kill themselves. For real. People literally end their lives over what they experience here.\n- I thought also about one's freedom to \"walk away\" and realized that the same sorts of beliefs that keep people in toxic relationships are actually very similar to why people stay in grad school. They are led to believe that their identity is tied to what they are involved in, that they will be \"failures\" if they walk away, and the constant justification of abuse rather than either working out something better or just leaving entirely, which, to be honest, IS sometimes justified in grad school.\n\nI don't mean to minimize anyone's experiences. FWIW I was raised in a mentally and emotionally abusive household, and honestly it is because of my experience with it that I see the parallels to what I'm going through now.",

This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and hunger, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior. Institutional abuse occurs within emergency care facilities such as foster homes, group homes, kinship care homes, and pre-adoptive homes. Children who are placed in this type of out of home care are typically in the custody of the state.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

I got points of for missing a dumb rubric requirement- think like missing the right number of research questions in my lit review. Kind of stupid, all my extra work went completely unacknowledged. Now I just follow the rubric and do my readings, and get A's. It is alot less work than trying to produce something brilliant and I am much more relaxed, and feel like I have the time to really learn the material.",

I'm sure every one of us has that voice in the back of our minds, so it's a major dick move to try and validate that voice. OP is having a rough time and needs to vent, and it sure looks to me like almost everyone here got to vent also. Venting is healthy.\n\nTry to be more respectful with your communications. This is the shittiest thing I've read on this sub and one of the shittiest things I've seen on all of reddit in quite a while, and I'm (depressingly lol) on reddit quite a bit.",
