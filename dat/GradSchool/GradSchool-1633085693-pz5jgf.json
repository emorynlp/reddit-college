  "title:": "Should I take a gap year before grad school?",
  "text": "I am a senior in college wanting to get a master\u2019s degree in evolutionary genetics to work in industry. I do not want a PhD at the moment because of the time, grant writing, and funding issues. I\u2019m doing research for a chemistry and an ecology professor of mine and they recommend I apply for master\u2019s programs right to attend in Fall 2022. Is it normal to feel unworthy to go to grad school? I have severe imposter syndrome; I have research experience, a good GPA (3.9), and a passion for science. Some days I just want to back away from applying because I\u2019m so anxious about it. I feel that if I take a gap year I will be too nervous to apply later on. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know if professionally/academically it would be best, but I do think with COVID there\u2019s as good a reason as ever to take a gap. I will say I took a whole semester (spring, so a semester plus summer) off before starting my PhD, and I haven\u2019t really missed a beat since starting last fall. \n\nAs far as your concerns, it is super normal not to feel worthy and it is also totally wrong. You wrote your qualifications here, I believe you know they are good. Trust yourself. I\u2019m a year into my program and the self doubt hasn\u2019t gone away, but I also haven\u2019t done anything but succeed either\u2014for the most part. \n\nSo yes, self doubt is totally normal, but that doesn\u2019t make it valid or a good reason to put things off. Sometimes you just need to remind yourself what you\u2019ve accomplished to this point, how you\u2019ve responded to challenges before, and that there\u2019s no reason to think you won\u2019t be able to handle what\u2019s next. Imposter syndrome is a constant battle, but it can be managed I think.\n\nYou should apply, if you want to. Best of luck to you.",

      "text": "I took a gap year and did a formal post bac research program. It was the BEST decision I could have made. It taught me new skills, boosted my confidence, confirmed to me that research was my passion and that I truly wanted to go to grad school, taught me how to stand up for myself, let me discover who I was outside of school, and taught me what a good mentoring relationship looks like and how to find that in grad school. \n\nUndergrad teaches you to have no separation of life vs studies. That\u2019s pretty unsustainable in the long run. Taking some time in between undergrad and grad school can help you learn boundaries. \n\nAnd FWIW most of the people in my program took time \u201coff\u201d (it\u2019s not really time off bc we were mainly working in research or in post bac programs). I really don\u2019t think it counts against you in applications especially you can explain how your time off will make you a better grad student.",

I only took a gap year because I have to do \u201cpayback\u201d work for a scholarship I accepted. I regret it every day. \n\n- If you go into industry or public sector to work for a year, don\u2019t tell anybody your intentions unless you really like your job and want them to pay for it. They will be exceedingly annoying about wanting to pay for your graduate study, even if you hate your work there.\n\n- You deserve a seat at the table as much as anybody else. You work hard, and you\u2019ve gotten yourself to the point that you are eligible to apply to graduate school, so if you want to go- you should apply. \n\n- Worst case scenario, apply now and then differ if you really are feeling stressed out about going. \n\n- I am 60-40 in regretting gap year. I have a lot of money saved up, I have learned a little about what my life will look like after my PhD, but I miss academic research and having control over my own destiny every day. Most work is pushing papers around.\n\nI would only take a gap year if you know you will be gaining money + research experience during that time.",

If you want to for financial reasons or because of the current global pandemic, or personal reasons, I don't think it would hurt you're future career.

      "text": "I took 3 years off, even though I always knew I wanted a PhD. I think if you want to wait and work, you should, but not because you won't get into grad school. If you'd have to pay for your master's, I'd get a job in industry first- many companies will pay at least part of the tuition.",

      "text": "So the imposter syndrome may never go away, you've just got to look at your great accomplishments and inform your brain that you ARE performing even if it's being a butthead and making you feel like an imposter. Even my grad profs have talked about their imposter syndrome. And these are the people teaching ME (PhD program). That being said, I took a few years off and I'm glad I did. I needed a break. But you also need to know if you will restart because I knew that I would but I know now that if I took a break now I would never restart. So it's kind of up to how well do you think you can keep going in the future if you take a break?",
