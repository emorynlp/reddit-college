  "text": "Never sure how to handle this. I told them when my grandmother passed away because I had to go to the funeral (the rest of my family couldn't travel bc of covid). At that time I told professors of classes I was taking that I had a \"family emergency\" and I didn't go into detail. \n\nI didn't tell my advisors when my aunt and uncle and friend died (all separately). My dad was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago and I didn't tell them, now he just had a stroke and I'm unsure if I should say something since it's unclear if I'll have to travel at a moment's notice. \n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "Oh sweetie, I'm very sorry to hear about this. My mother was diagnosed with a rare cancer about seven years ago, so I understand how stressful and how heartbreaking it can be to hear this type of news. I'm sorry you've had to deal with these personal matters.\n\nFrom my own experience, I can say the best thing to do is to explain as much as you feel comfortable explaining to your advisors. This semester for grad school has been very stressful for me, especially with news about my mother's health and other family matters. I eventually broke down and told my advisor legit everything (I have the unhealthy tendency to bottle up my issues and glass only holds so much). They were very, VERY understanding with my issues, and fortunately I was able to work with them and my theory class professor to audit the required course rather than withdrawal from it. So, for your situation, I would seriously consider explaining every possible detail you can; your advisor is there to not only be a mentor but for you to build a good relationship with. Advisors don't just have to fulfill the role of an academic advisor, but they can also become a big portion of your support system. The more details you can give your advisor, the more they can advocate for you with what your decisions in the future could be.\n\nI do understand the concept of seeming unprofessional by explaining your situation to your professors and advisors, but life happens. You can't take into account all of these situations that life will through at you. It's a university's job, as well as the professors and advisors there, to be compassionate enough to consider the welfare of students and how life's unexpected events affect them. If your advisor/professors/university are concerned and seriously care about their students, they will completely understand your situation and support you in any way they can. Reaching out to explain how your life is changing is NEVER unprofessional; if they don't try to be compassionate and work with you during these hardships, they are unprofessional themselves.",

If your advisor is unwilling to give you leeway to do so, there are often offices and programs at universities that help students with this kind of thing and you should definitely look into it. \n\nIn your shoes, I would tell your advisor as soon as possible that you need to visit family, and if they ask for further explanation, provide it and just go if you can afford the travel. Work will be there when you get back.\n\nI'm very sorry for your circumstances, and I hope things become more positive for you. I lost my grandfather recently to covid and I definitely understand how hard these things are to deal with.",

In my PhD program we usually progress in the degree to having advisors around year 2 or 3, and until then are just doing coursework \n\nI am on a leave of absence because my mom died of cancer right before the current semester, and I had only completed one year in my program (so no advisor). I was able to share everyone with the graduate directors and my previous professors, as I am currently trying to transfer to a school closer to my family. This transfer may not even go well, and I might very well leave grad school for an industry job. Everyone has been pretty supportive and the previous profs are willing to write letters of rec transferring. Overall it has been a helpful response to a shitty situation \n\nI'd imagine this situation only improves if you currently have a candidate-advisor relationship, rather than a simple student-prof relationship. Advisors/profs can seem overly professional and scary sometimes, but at the end of the day people are people, and they tend to help you do what you need to do to succeed. \n\nI'd share as much as necessary to get the severity of the situation across. If you trust your advisor on a personal level, then it could be appropriate to lean on them emotionally. However, this is a function of your dynamic with them.\n\nAdvocate for your needs and how much time you need to handle this. Try not to frame this as a question, be assertive and concise to prioritize your mental health.\n\nSome more personal words of advice from someone who recently lost a parent while in grad school:\n\nTake more time than you think you'll need, if things don't go well for your dad then this is going to be awful. There is a lot more to deal with logistically/emotionally than you might expect.\n\nSchool does not matter right now, and you can always pick it up when you're ready. Time for these things moves quickly, and time with loved ones may be limited. Admittedly, I may be projecting my own situation onto yours, and I don't know what your family dynamic or professional life are like; but, If I were you, I'd try to travel now, proactively before anything gets worse. Best case, it's a waste of travel time and he recovers. Worst case, you make effective use of limited time\n\nIf your parents are divorced/your mother is deceased, then you and/or your siblings may be inheriting some stuff, /r/personalfinance has a decent wiki post describing handling the logistics of this/funerals/death related things\n\nI'm sorry that you're going through this, and I hope your father can make a recovery.
