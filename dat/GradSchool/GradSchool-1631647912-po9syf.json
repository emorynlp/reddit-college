  "text": "I've posted a few times here before, and maybe I just need to vent at this point, but I was hoping to maybe get some advice. \n\nI'm in my 5th year of a PhD. program and I'm completely burnt out. I made some poor decisions in my first year and ended up agreeing to work with an advisor who probably should have retired a long time ago. I had to get a co advisor 2.5 years in, but other than that things seem mostly ok on paper (average time to degree is about 7 years in my program). \n\nI'm just completely miserable here, and COVID certainly hasn't helped. My first advisor is basically absent and my co advisor is both micromanaging things that I feel like should be very minor (fonts used in presentations, margins in working manuscripts, etc...) And ignoring the big things like interpretations of data or getting people trained on equipment. \n\nI have two first author manuscripts basically ready to be submitted, but I'm struggling to get anyone to even look at them. I'll ask for help and get ignored. I'll say I think it should be submitted as is and I'm told to not do that. On top of that I'm constantly asked to help build equipment/help with data analysis for other students. I'm quickly approaching the end of my rope.\n\nI know I probably haven't provided enough information (I'd like to try and remain anonymous) but has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? I don't want to master out after so long, but I'm just so tired.",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation and realized I absolutely did not want a career in academia. The next thing I asked was whether having a masters versus PHD would help me with goals outside of academia. In my field - not at all (though I imagine this varies). I was so disappointed to be leaving without the degree when I was so close but didn\u2019t want to burn one-two more years of being unhappy and not advancing my career options.\n\nHowever, when I went to quit, my department actually came back with an offer of me finishing up ahead of schedule. I\u2019m now finishing up in one semester rather than four, and without collecting new data. I think the department was having some problems with too many people leaving, so it\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nAll this to say - will the degree help you get where you want to go? Will the department work with you to finish up quick if you aren\u2019t planning on staying in the field? If not, I am a huge supporter of \u201cquitting\u201d. Life is far too short to spend so much time on things that aren\u2019t helping you advance on the path you want to take.",

          "text": "Thanks for your comment. I did actually have this talk with my new advisor a few months and he promised to get me out with the degree. He's (mostly) keeping his word, but I still just can't find the energy to care. \n\nI know I won't go into academia either, and honestly I have no idea if the degree will help me more than a masters. Probably not, but it's hard to admit that after so many years of work. If everything works out I'd have about 1-1.5 years left if I stayed",

              "text": "Was looking through your post history and came across this. I see you're dropping out of your PhD, which seems to be the best idea for your mental health and if it's not going to progress you any further than a masters would, then you're making the right choice. However, just a note for your resume--a Masters degree is typically 2ish years, yeah? and you've been working at the PhD for 5. Don't let those extra 3 years go to waste. Personally, if I were you, I'd be putting something like \"research assistant\" or \"research specialist in X lab from 2018-2021\" on my resume still. Just so you at least have those extra years of research shown on your experience!!",

The guilt from abandoning what I'm working on is real though.\n\nI had one offer that looked good on paper for a bit, but then they reduced compensation by like 50% in between me informally accepting and signing the paperwork. I didn't want to work for a company that did things like that so I walked. The entire situation was demoralizing. It's just nice to hear someone think me leaving is a good decision. The",
