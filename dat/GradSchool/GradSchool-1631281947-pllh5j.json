  "text": "Hey all, \n\nI have started my second year of graduate school. yay! \n\nI am going to see a specialist (orthopedic surgeon) for a health issue I have been having for months. They were able to see me sooner than expected- again  Yay! \n\nI explain the situation to my professor who said Dr.s appointment are not good reasons to miss class. I explained it was not my annual physical- I was meeting with a surgeon. Still, not a good enough reason I suppose. She told me to refer to the program handbook on the attendance policy, which I did. The handbook tells me to check my course syllabi about acceptable absences. I check the syllabi, and what do is see \"absences will be evaluated on a case by case basis\" \\*face palm\\*. \n\nIn the REAL world- no employer would give you a hard time for meeting with a medical specialist for surgery- and if they did I would quit.",

Worst case scenario you get the ombuds office involved.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I would contact your university's disability accommodations center. You might not have a disability (or maybe you do), but if you have a health issue that warrants surgical intervention it may fall under their purview. If it *is* something that they deal with, they will be more than happy to educate this person.\n\nYour professor is wrong. A major surgery is an exceptional reason to miss class, and she needs to educate herself oh her own programs policies, procedures, and learn how to be an empathetic person. I would also speak with your adviser about this too so he or she can be aware of the situation, because refusing someone an excused absence for a necessary medical appointment seems contrary to common sense, if not department policy, and unnecessarily spiteful. \n\nEven if she was a doctor, she is not *your* doctor so she is unqualified to have any sort of opinion on whether your healthcare appointments are necessary or convenient.",

Though I should not have to disclose private medical information, this is not an annual physical, and I will be missing class. Please let me know if I need to speak to the chair or Dean in order to get this as an excused absence. Thank you for your understanding.\"\n\nKeep it short and simple, and including the line about chair or dean lets the professor know you won't be intimidated into cancelling your appointment. And don't reschedule! You should go to the appointment and not deal with the stress of trying to rearrange.",

This approach puts the professor in the position of having to say yes or admit, in writing, that they are being unreasonable. It's coercive, but it isn't as in-your-face-debate-me as the approach of sending the quotes from the handbook. Treat your need to miss class as perfectly reasonable and totally normal, and let your professor be the one to make themselves look like a jerk.",

This may be an ongoing medical thing so I appreciate the help if this continues. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is horrible in every way. Never gives feedback. Tells us all to quit our jobs and not get pregnant- seriously! you can't miss class if your child care falls through (lol covid??) and you cant bring your kid to class. She is so unreasonable it is hard to describe, but what she does is borderline if not work place harassments. you can't demand medical notes and tell us we can't get pregnant.

I would also try to talk to your advisor or chair, and recommend reaching out to accessibility services.\n\nIf you contact accessibility services, I would say something like 'I'm hoping to get advice on how to deal with a professor who is insisting that I reschedule my necessary medical appointment. While I try to schedule them outside of class hours, she is drawing a firm and hostile line around this. I would love to not have to go through the accommodations process, since this is graduate school, but was hoping you could advise me in this situation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It sounds like she is batshit. I usually don't recommend escalating complaints, but the stuff about not missing class and not getting pregnant is just wrong, and I think people would be rightly horrified to hear what she has been telling you!",
