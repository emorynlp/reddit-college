I\u2019m considering taking it pass/fail because a C+ isn\u2019t a great grade.\n\nHowever, I might consider applying to graduate school down the line (not sure in what, maybe biology, statistics, or economics). All these are math-adjacent fields so I\u2019m not sure if a pass/fail would prevent me from applying in the future.",

              "text": "Many schools have a grade replacement policy where if you retake the class and receive a better grade the second time they will replace the grade on your transcript. \n\nIt might be worth discussing your schools policies with someone and retaking the class if you need a gpa boost toward the end of your degree program. \n\nI think one low grade isn\u2019t going to stop you from getting in if you get really good grades in the next calc classes. ( and have a good major cumulative gpa)\n\nIf your taking calculus as a personal enrichment class and it\u2019s not required, it should be acceptable to take a pass/fail. Make sure to check with an advisor before you make the change (just in case)!",

I was under the impression that schools typically required you to begin the class that way. Not change to pass fail in the middle or at the end.\n\nSo nothing wrong with having a past fail or two on your transcript.",
