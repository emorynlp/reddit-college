I used it for r, complex excel codes, large excel datasets, taking notes, normal functions and its been great. \n\nAlso if u r into computer building (my partner is) they made me one for like 500-800 (cant remember) that is so fast with r and excel codes that take a while.

      "text": "You'll be hard-pressed to find everything you're looking in a laptop that costs less than $800. Laptops are always more expensive than desktops and have less computing power to boot. If you really want something decent that will last you through grad school plus gaming, you're going to need to spend closer to $1k to $1.5k, perhaps $2k.\n\nI would recommend a newer Lenovo laptop as they are generally more affordable and have a reputation for quality; the usual complaint is about their keyboards, which some actually love. If not Lenovo, a lower end Dell XPS laptop might be within your budget. Other brands I'm not so sure about.\n\nIf you are comfortable with Linux, another option to try is installing Linux on your current laptop; Linux can revive old computers in no time.",
