  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nI\u2019ve been involved in research for about three full years now. Started in last year of undergrad, then two years post bac, and now in my PhD. My focus area is developmental psych.\n\nI\u2019ve helped with so many projects in my three years and kind of had publications dangled over my head like a carrot. At least three projects I was offered authorship on just up and died cause the grad student stopped caring about it. I have two first author papers in the works but data collection is so slow especially because I\u2019m no longer working at that university. Now I\u2019m starting two projects with my PhD advisor, but I can just tell that piloting, data collection and everything will take at least 6-8 months, and then we have to write it up, send for review, review takes a while....\n\nGah, I just feel like I had all this potential and I have lots of ideas, but I\u2019m getting worried that I\u2019ll never actually publish anything, lol.",

      "text": "It's hard. It takes literally years, and you have to stay focused the whole time to get it finished. Good news is once you get one or two published, you get a feel for what it takes and it becomes much easier. Try writing a manuscript from some of your previous work and show it to your advisor. Once you have a solid draft written you can start submitting to journals. You might get rejected but the comments will improve it. Before you know it you'll have one accepted and you'll understand the process much better.",

You just have to communicate that to the editor and peer reviewers.\n\nI had something similar where i did years of research as an undergraduate but nothing ever came of it. Looking back, i could have easily published with some extra work but I didn't have the guidance to understand what needed to be done. But that's okay that's what the PhD is for :)",

      "text": "I feel this. Year 3 into my PhD and no first author pubs. The ones I have in the works aren't on my dissertation topic so they aren't prioritized right now. I know I'll get some once my projects get in gear and then eventually wrap up, but the anxiety of not having one bothers me (and is a requirement for graduation). Especially when my peers have so many. Sometimes I worry that I don't work hard enough or want it badly enough. I just try to tell myself that everyone works at their own pace, it'll happen eventually, and sometimes it's just luck. Sometimes that works lol. Good luck",

I think something that helped me a little was pointing out to my research supervisors that this was a priority for me and they began to help work with me on it more. When you are more in charge of your own research projects through your PhD you will get more opportunities, as I will be getting now. Or perhaps there is some low-hanging fruit (like a review paper or a piece of a larger project) that you can claim.",

                      "text": "So literature review papers are super common in my field (health sciences). Your library website, or other sites, will/should have informatiin and guidelines about different types of papers. Basically involves coming up with a research question (bad e.g. what is the efficacy of physical activity interventions vs pharmacological interventions in older cancer patients), picking the review paper format that best suits the question you are asking (e g. Scoping vs systematic), and following the process for that format. These papers should always be done with multiple people, unless perhaps you are just doing a more casual narrative review. It's a good way to work with other people, not have to collect and analyze your own primary data, and gain foundational information about the progress and gaps in the topic you are exploring, and often this sets the stage for other research you can propose moving forward.",
