      "text": "Since you're at such an early stage, your CV will be short and in general the main difference from a resume is gong to be that it won't have any kind of fancy formatting like borders or call-out boxes or even horizontal lines. It also won't have any \"profile\", \"objective,\" or \"skills\" sections or anything like that.\n\nExactly which sections you ought to have can depend somewhat on your field, so you should just look up a few CVs of faculty and especially grad students in the departments you're applying to get a sense of what they include. They will have more to include than you, but you'll be able to see what they do include and don't.",

          "text": "Not OP, but generally asking, if you'd be willing to answer? \n\nMy CV includes my education (including high school), a section with research + course projects, one with my research interests, then awards and honors (both from my last year of high school), student society work including organizing contests, and some volunteer work from early undergrad+late high school. It's a full 2 pages long in total, but I can make it a bit shorter by removing my skills section (which I realized I should after reading this comment lol).\n\nDoes this sound like it's okay? Should I exclude anything from here?\n\nAlso, do people include relevant classes they've taken? Or is that not necessary?\n\nAND, can you add future experience? Like something I'm going to be doing next spring, but I haven't begun yet?\n\nI've looked at so many examples but they're all different so I honestly can't tell what's better anymore :/",
