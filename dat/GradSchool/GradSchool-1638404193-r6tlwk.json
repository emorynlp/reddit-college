  "text": "applying for graduate school\n\nThe application is asking **years of degree completed**? I initially started with a bachelor health program honors then transferred the credits to BSc Science Hons program in the 3rd year. So Basically I completed the BSc that is 4 years degree in 1 year?\n\nUncertain what to put on the application ? 4 years for the Hons programs or 1 year I actually completed it.\n\nPlease advise. Your time and consideration is appreciated. Thanks",
