  "text": "This is NOT a grad school interview, just starting out with that. I have NOT applied to grad school yet, but I requested info from a grad school I\u2019m interested in and they contacted me for a video call so I can ask them questions and they can give me info. I figured I would sign up just so they could get to know me and I can get to know them. But I don\u2019t know what questions are normal to ask. Anyone have any suggestions?",
