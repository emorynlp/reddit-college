  "text": "Hi, for international students in California, how much do i have to pay for taxes ? I received my stipend and they deducted 260 $ per month (the deductions are CA w/h and FNR ST) .  Do I have to pay another amount when I file the state and federal tax returns\u00a0? Also if anyone can tell me what is FNR ST deduction?\n\n\n** Note: my country does jot have a tax treaty with the US. \n\nThank you",
