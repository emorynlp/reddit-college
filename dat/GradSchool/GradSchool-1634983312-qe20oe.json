  "text": "Like every day I get a notification from arXiv of 15 daily submissions in my subfield alone and if you count the entire field (applied mathematics) you're looking at over 50-60 daily papers uploaded in total.\n\nThis is great and it's fantastic that journals and researchers are getting amazing work out there but I can't help thinking that the field is not *oversaturated* if that's the right word to describe it?\n\nLike it's impossible to really use an advanced search since some authors hijack keywords or \"sexify\" their titles to overstate the results etc. \n\nIs it just me? I understand this may be an unpopular opinion.",

      "text": "In short; no.\n\nSlightly longer; the focus on quantity over quality (which is not entirely unfair\\*) and focus on 'sexiness' of research subject (in order to get more grants and be competitive) has made it all but impossible to publish solid, comprehensive, *honest*, research.\n\nAs a result, all scientific fields are overflowing with half-finished projects wrapped up with keywords to look as cool as possible. And just a gigantic amount of genuine bullshit. In addition, there are simply more researchers compared to 20 years ago, so there is also actually more high-quality good work. But there are only a limited amount of hours in the day.\n\nProfessors in my department recently mentioned that when they were doing their PhD, they could reasonably keep up with publications by keeping track of new issues of a handful of journals. They noted that this is impossible now, as there are roughly a trillion journals that are all becoming increasingly broad in scope. The journal name means almost nothing any more (except to the funding agencies) which makes it even more difficult to keep up to date.\n\nEssentially, it is a gigantic bloated festering bubble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*^(The problem is that the people doing the hiring by the very fact of it being cutting edge research are not able to really judge a (senior researcher's work on quality. There is a good chance that the researcher is literally the world's authority on the specific subfield. So with no way to judge the quality, they simply look at metrics and go for the higher quantity. Can't really blame them. If you have 2 candidates who by the best of your knowledge are both equally qualified, you take the one with 30 papers over the one with 10 papers.))",

      "text": "You should quantify it and write a paper about it. \n\nIf that\u2019s your hypothesis, test it!\n\nI think the truth is that nature papers are better. The rigor and effort required to get one is often astounding. I\u2019ve written 5 and they are by far my best works. They also do not have sexy titles per say. They say what you should learn. \n\nBut you are right. It is often unsustainable to crank them out every year. It\u2019s more like a once every couple years thing for me. And often the culmination of a multi year effort.",
