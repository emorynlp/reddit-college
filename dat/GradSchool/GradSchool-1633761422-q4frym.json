  "text": "Aren't leaders and people in positions of power expected to be accomplished? Would you need at least a master's degree? I want to give and be involved,  be connected with the world, live out my potential, and work toward a position where I can help change things, but I don't come from a wealthy or even healthy family. My major is healthcare related. Based on your experience (you can tell I don't have much), do you think academia is the answer?",

Most MPP students I know worked in policy, government, or non-profit for a few years and then went back to do an MPP, it\u2019s very often a mid-career degree, and having a few years of work on your resume will boost your chances of getting in.\n\nEdit:just saw below that you\u2019re interested in health policy. In that case MPH might be a better path, but again, same advice applies, go work in the field for at least a few years until you\u2019re limited by not having a masters",

      "text": "According to Pew, two-thirds of US representatives and three-quarters of senators have at least one graduate degree. I guess the results would be comparable for major business leaders. For them, grad school isn't a requirement so much as an opportunity to learn more about how professional networks and power hierarchies are actually working in relevant fields.\n  \nAcademic professors don't usually play a prominent role in determining public policy, but can cultivate spheres of influence if they become particularly well known experts on certain topics.\n   \nOf course, there are plenty of ways of changing your local community without the need for academic credentials. It's just the case that in today's world that graduate degrees are a marker for a certain class of socioeconomic elites, and they open a lot professional doors for you that you would otherwise have to pry open (via some other, non-academic accomplishment)",

In some cases it\u2019s pretty clear that they\u2019re using the skills they learned in their PhD, in other cases it just seems like more of a gate keeping measure, but based on what I saw I realized I would need a doctorate to get where I want to go.",
