  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a senior in college finishing my major in Philosophy with a double minor in Applied statistics and Mathematics. Some context about me, I was initially enrolled in CS major in first year at my school, however due to severe depression (friend committed suicide), family problems, low gpa, and rising tuition costs for CS degree, I decided switch out to Philosophy and finish a double minor in stats + math (have documented proof of all of this). \n\nAlthough I switched out to a completely different program, I continued working on CS projects (nearly 20 hackathons), worked as a software engineering intern during summers, and have received a return offer (full time) from a major tech firm next year.\n\nI know I can't become complacent and I know need to work twice as hard as other CS grads to be employable (since almost all jobs require a Bachelor's in CS). The only viable option for me is to pursue a professional masters in CS to remain competitive if I want to switch out to a different company in the future. Problem is my GPA is low. I'm looking at graduating with a 2.6/4.0 (cumulative) which is terrible. I have done reasonably well in the last 2 years (3.5/4.0), so I'm hoping the improvement I have shown will outway my first and second year grades. Do I need to go back to school and take more CS courses? I feel pretty lost at the moment because all masters degrees in CS need at least 3.2 GPA.  I don't think my work experience or projects can outway a low cumulative GPA which haunts me since there isn't much I can do at this juncture to drastically change my gpa.\n\nCould use some advice because I am truly scared about my future. \n\nSide note: my school is considered as one of the top 10 CS schools in the world. I am worried that not being able to crack the curriculum at a top 10 school looks bad for grad school applications.\n\nTechnical courses I have taken: calculus, multivariable calculus (vector calc), Lin alg, discrete math, modal logic, combinatorial mathematics, intro to cs (did very poorly), theory of probability & statistics, advanced probability & statistics, statistical reasoning & data science, applied statistics, surveys & sampling, intro to stochastic processes, set theory",
