  "text": "I am looking to attend grad school for my masters in International Relations in about 2 years, but was wondering how fluent you should be in the second language you'll be focusing on for your language requirement. Most grad school applications state academic coursework in that language is required, but some with accept the equivalent if you are fluent enough. I am just wondering how fluent enough would one have to be? My language would be Spanish and have an intermediate fluency for the most part. Just wondering what is the expectation going into most grad school programs as far as the language requirement goes.",

If you\u2019re in the states, the department you\u2019re applying for will almost certainly have a directly of grad students listed on their website. Pick a few from that list and send them some cold emails. \n\nDepending on what you mean by \u201cintermediate fluency\u201d and whether or not you\u2019ve taken classes in Spanish before, the experience can vary widely",
