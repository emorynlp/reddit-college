  "text": "Wanted to share a musing I had today. Imposter syndrome gets talked about a lot in grad school, but no matter how many times people try to reassure me that (a) everyone feels it and (b) the people here deserve to be here, I don't feel all that reassured.\n\nBut it occurred to me today while talking with a friend that I've been/wanted to be a writer since I was 9 years old. I don't think anyone who knew me as a kid is surprised that I wound up in grad school for Writing Studies. I've literally been working towards this for most of my life. so why would I feel unworthy of this stop on that path? \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: if you can hardly make heads or tails of what you're learning, if you don't feel like you have a valuable contribution to make, you still bring something important to your field. You matter. You belong.",

What do I know that\u2019s even valuable to these people?\u201d \n\nThe director of my department also told me early on that he tells students when they graduate, \u201cHope you\u2019ve enjoyed the imposter syndrome. That part of your life is over. We\u2019ve prepared you to go forth and be capable and competent in the field.\u201d Which was really reassuring for me.

Plus I can't think of a good topic for my master's thesis (I only have an overtly general idea of what I want). And then there's work and all the pressures included therein.\n\nThese are some of the factors that make me think I just don't belong here. I just tend to doubt myself a lot because my friends have already published or presented at conferences and here I still am, at square one or two or whatever.\n\nBut thank you for this validation.
