  "title:": "Should I Attend the Funeral of a Professor Who Wasn\u2019t My Advisor or Supervisor",
  "text": "Hello. I\u2019m a PhD student in social sciences. Yesterday a professor I admired greatly passed away suddenly.\n\nI took 2 classes with him and enjoyed both. He answered every single question students emailed before class. I looked forward to his class every week. My friends and I joked that he was a walking dictionary because he just \u201cknew\u201d everything.\n\nHe and I both had an unusual long commute (3-4 hours each way) and took the same bus often. We chatted while waiting for the bus almost every week. He seemed to genuinely care about my progress in the program. I\u2019ve dog-sat for him and met his wife twice. He was on my reference list when I was applying to foster/adopt dogs.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone in the department is coming to the funeral because everyone lives far away. I don\u2019t think I had a strong professional relationship with him because I was not his advisee. Would it be appropriate for me to attend the funeral? Should I reach out to his wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edited to add the paragraph below)\n\nI would like to thank everyone who commented. I have decided to attend the funeral. A few students are carpooling and coming to the city for the funeral, which makes me feel better. This professor was really well respected by his colleagues and students. I have already cried so much in the past two days and will probably cry again at the funeral.",

It's not uncommon at funerals to see people the family don't know since folks have many social circles in their lives.\n\nOne of my colleagues took his own life a few years ago. I did not know him well. He was an acquaintance, but always friendly and kind to me. I went to his funeral. Didn't hesitate. I wanted to show support and respect for his family.",

      "text": "About 10 years ago I had a very strong bond with a pharmacology professor who was like a grandfather to me. He was genuine, knowledgeable, and cared about students. I still remember doing high fives when I scored well on his exam. Should he have been alive I would have worked under him for my grad school. The only common factors I had was taking a few classes with him.\n\nHe passed away with a heart attack and there was an invitation email for the \u201cafter party\u201d for the funeral that I came across. I still don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called but there were professors, friends of the professor, family, etc and had some finger food, etc. Granted I had some bitchy professors wondering why I was there but fuck that, I was glad that I could have an opportunity to honor his death and have a closure with him. That\u2019s the least I could to do this great man that I admired dearly.\n\nJust sharing my experience. I don\u2019t regret it at all. Do what your heart says.",

      "text": "Absolutely. The family will appreciate it. In 2019, the husband of the professor I was TA'ing for had a stroke and passed. My fellow TA's and I picked up a lot of extra lecturing and work to help her with the situation. The information for his funeral was sent out to the department. I had only met the professor's husband once at a department picnic and we just had a nice little conversation. He was also a well known academic in his own right, but had retired before our professor started at our uni. All us TA's went to his visitation and no one else from the department was there. We didn't stay long, but it really brought peace to the professor to see us there.  They had little info cards on him at the visitation and he had led an amazing life, so it was nice for us to attend to learn more about our professor and her husband. I always felt like I was closer to her because we all went, even though she wasn't involved in my work academically. You won't regret going, and you will probably regret not going. \n\nSo sorry for your loss, also. It's hard to lose someone you respect.",

I would encourage you to go to get closure for yourself unless you explicitly read there was an attendance limit or concerns for living relatives health mentioned in the notification of the service.\n\nIf you just want to share the memory of the man, snowblindalbino's idea of a letter or note sounds like fair idea.",

If there\u2019s a pandemic limit that they are close to, then don\u2019t attend, but please ask before you make that decision.\n\nWhen I talk about one of my good friends funeral, I often beam with pride while mentioning how it the place was overflowing and we couldn\u2019t all fit in the church, he was so loved by so many and such a great person. It makes me proud to know that so many people took the time to come pay their respects.\n\nIt meant a lot to his parents that I spoke at the funeral. Everyone loves knowing that their loved ones felt love in this world, and I felt like a part of something for seeing how many others loved my friend. There\u2019d be nothing worse in the world than if I lost a loved one, and I had to be alone at the funeral. My god I would cry so hard. But being there with others, hearing more stories, would bring me joy. \n\nPlease attend if you can, not just for your sake, but to be a source of comfort and bring a little light to share with others about how much happiness and comfort this man brought to your life. Do it for them, capacity limits permitting.",

      "text": "I don't see any reason why you shouldn't and I think it would be a lovely gesture for you to attend. Generally speaking, I think that if you'd like to attend a funeral, thought highly of the deceased, etc, it's pretty much always acceptable and polite to attend. The exceptions are famous people and closed funerals (or whatever it's called when the family doesn't want many people coming.) Lots of people at a funeral makes us feel good (or... Good under the shadow of very sad) and it hurts when nobody shows up to a funeral. \n\nFamily members might not know you but they always want to hear about how great their now-deceased loved one was. I imagine your professor went into academia at least in part to share wisdom and mentor young(er) people. It'd be very appropriate for you to go and represent (to some extent) all the students whose lives he's touched. It sounds like you were pretty close with him and honestly it'd be a little shitty if no one else from the department came, though ofc that's not on you.",
