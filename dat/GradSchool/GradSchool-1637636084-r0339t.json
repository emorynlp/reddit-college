I suggest prioritizing sleep asap. In your first year you might need to do it a few times juggling research and coursework, but it's not necessary, even though it may feel like it in the moment. Your health should take precedence; most professors will be accommodating if needed, and your assignment/manuscript/whatever will be there tomorrow.  \nSorry for really hammering in the point, I just definitely suffered from years of denying myself rest and don't want other people to do the same.",
