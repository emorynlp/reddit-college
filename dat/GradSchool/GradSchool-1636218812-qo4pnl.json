  "title:": "After 5 years in a PhD program, being forced to leave with Masters.",
  "text": "So about my situation. I started my PhD in genetics in 2015. Basically I all I had to do to graduate was finish a manuscript to the point of submission and if my committee was ok with it, I could graduate.  \n\nWell when covid hit, my lab became WFH (we do all computational work mainly).  Well I realized well into the pandemic I am not a WFH person. I have all the ADHD things and on the spectrum. My work and quality of work did decline significantly. \n\nSo a little over a year ago now I OD'ed, which kinda forced me into the position moving back home with my parents (I was living alone and working from home, so I thought it was a good decision at the time, for healthy and all the reasons).  \n\nDoing all computational work myself, we werent allowed to go into the lab (unless you were planning an experiment - I was not) .  Anyway things never improved work wise, and I just realized I need the structure of physically going to work.  WFH also increased my anxiety with every message or email relating to work. Like an anxiety attack making unable to function as a human. \n\nWell during this time, another manuscript (besides the one mentioned above) became another requirement before everyone would ok everything and allow me to work on my dissertation to graduate. 2 of my committee members were working on the paper as well.  When they sent me their \"working but almost final draft\" it was a mess.  I could not believe multiple senior PIs said this was even close to a \"draft\".  When my PI read the paper, he too was shocked and basically told the collaborators we'll take it over and finish the manuscript to make it acceptable. I mean the manuscript they sent us made no sense as a paper.\n\nEssentially I had to redo and do many more new analyses, and we are talking big datasets, the analysis on these things can take days or weeks just running one program. We've worked with these collaborators sooooo many times, they are on my committee!!! They know what I do, how it can takes weeks to run some of my analyses.  \n\nLong story short my committee member (who happens to be the director of the department), was very displeased that I wasn't done and did not have a finished product of this manuscript at that time. I am not first author of this paper nor was I ever going to be.  I was asked to help due to my specialty in my field. Yet every figure and analysis in this paper was done and made by me. \n\nBefore I knew that he was displeased with me, I was only going to be third author on this paper. But my PI said it was going to be a part of my dissertation so I needed to work on it. Yet no help from the first author at all with any of the extra analyses they wanted done, in fact they would refuse to help or be the absolute worst about helping. \n\nAfter I heard director was displeased with my progress on the random new paper that was all of a sudden part of my dissertation, My PI and I had a meeting that said I was going to have a committee meeting and you need to give a presentation proving/defending yourself that you deserve to graduate and get your PhD. \n\nI made the presentation, had it all ready to go, then when the meeting happened I was not even given the chance to present. They had all decided that it was better for me to just leave with my masters this semester.  \n\nObviously I'm more than devastated. I'm being told I can come back in to the program, but at this point I've been told so many lies, I don't trust any of them.  From everything I've been told this is ALL because of the director committee member, and of course everyone on my committee just does what he says. He tells them to jump off a bridge, they will. \n\nI'm looking for advice here. I know once I'm out, the chance of my getting my PhD, although not impossible, will be slim.  Is there anything I could do via the University? I got a letter written and signed from my PhD program saying I can reenter with the financial backing and ok from my current advisor. The letter also states \"and ideally your committee\" to be ok with me reentering.\n\nHonestly I should have moved back town sooner. I'm here now and I'm working on all the projects I can in my lab to prove myself, but I graduate in a month with MS.\n\nSeriously any advice would be amazing. My PI has been incredibly supportive, minus the not sticking up for me to the director committee member (who is literally the only faculty member he actually is scared of, I'm pretty sure it's because he wants his job when the director retires.  Is there any course of action I could potentially take to fight this?",

If your PI isn't supporting you by looking into program-level options, then you'll need to try the school level ones. (Although program-level formal appeals may still exist, in some sense I'd guess they've been informally tried)\n\nYour university may have an ombuds position to help students understand procedures such as appeals. Or perhaps the grad student union may provide advice along these lines.\n\nFor who the appeal will flow through, there is likely a VP with a portfolio that includes grad students (research? academic?), but also some university level office of appeal that deals with this.\n\nThe exact governance model of your university will determine the titles of these positions and offices but they all exist.

I have a letter signed by my program directors and the director of the institute my program is in (not the director on my committee causing all the issues) that states i can be readmitted into the PhD program with my current PI within 2 years after i graduate with my MS.  My question is if there is anything i can do to fight this awful committee member of mine and restart my PhD studies asap.  Like is there a way for my University to come in and deal with this issue?  the main issue with my PI is that he will bend over backwards for the director committee member causing all the issues.  If not for him, I wouldn't even be in this situation.  \n\nNot related to the situation now, but this guys is know for being notoriously sexist and homophobic.  I am a female, so he has never liked me from the beginning.  \n\nI'm just wondering if there is anything i can do (not my phd program since they were advising me to do this as well) to try to remedy this situation and get this guy out of the picture.",

Contact your university's ombuds office to find the procedure for academic program appeals. There will be a vice president or provost or similar position responsible for administration of grad programs. There will be a formal procedure for unfair treatment.\n\nIf you feel that bigotry affected your treatment, I'm sure that can be documented at some point in the appeal.",

After talking with my PI separately after, he said i would work in the lab after for a semester or so, he'll review my progress and i then could potentially restart my phd studies.  Well last week I found out, he said the best plan of action would be for me to get a job for a year and then if i want, i can come back and finish.\n\nFrom the way he was talking and from what i've heard through the grape vine, this is all the evil director.  I'm pretty sure he told my PI if i want to finish up my PhD iI should go work somewhere else for a year, and then he'll consider me coming back into my program.  This worries me because I know my PI, if i don't find a job in town, he will forget about me, just the way he is.  And he told me many times, i could work in the lab after i get my MS and then if he thought my work was good, i could start my PhD again.  Well that is not the case anymore.  \n\nThis is why I think i need to fight it.  I think they were all saying the \"coming back to finish your PhD\" is all BS and a way to make sure I didn't fight it.",

That's tough and you end up suffering the consequences. \n\nThe opportunity to reenter the PhD program with funding is unusual, so take advantage of that as a chance for a fresh start. Get the expectations for the degree hammered down from the outset. Since you will have a masters, you can get right to work on the dissertation project with a minimum of exploration and coursework. \n\nLook at the MS as an opportunity for a clean break. Perhaps work in a different environment for a bit. But start plotting your return once the worst of the sting has subsided.",

They had all decided that it was better for me to just leave with my masters this semester.\n\nI had the exact same thing happen to me with my PI. I won't get into it, but he was doing some really shady thing and breaking rules here. I eventually brought this up with my department chair, but he just said it was too late to do anything at that point. I ended up on my own and had to constantly fight to be able to finish my PhD, which I was fortunately able to do.\n\nFirst off, the constant adding of new requirements for you to graduates does not seems like something that is allowed. Forcing you to work on someone else's paper is really iffy as well. At the very least it is unethical. From what you've said, you should be first author. You should brush up on your school's rules regarding graduation requirements and co-authoring/collaborating on research. Start with your student union, but also check onlinen to see what the rules are.\n\nNext, you should document everything that has happened. Every request they made of you, what your response was, what you were allowed to do or prevented from doing, and how that added time affected you. Also include things they said they'd do but never did. Write it up as a letter that shows, chronologically, how you got to this point.\n\nAlso, if you have a documented medical issue then they cannot simply ignore that. I don't know how this works, so you will have to talk to someone at the school.\n\nI would say talk to your Dean of Grad students, but honestly I think you may have to get a lawyer here. I would suggest bringing this to your student union and seeing if they can help.",

You kind of glossed over the OD and claimed the only real impact was making you move back home, but substance abuse regardless is a big deal. If your PI was aware of NONE of this, the PI and committee are going to expect full productivity. Also, its on you to find treatment for your mental health. You cant just try to power through your dissertation and when you dont meet expectations THEN tell them what was happening. \n\nNow I would talk to the dean or provost about how the meeting went and why you think you shouldnt be forced to graduate with a masters, but I wouldnt expect them to take your side",

Like at the time they wouldn't allow me to work in the lab physically.\n\nI have taken completely responsibility, I messed up, but there was no \"warning\", no chance to explain to my committee my situation, which I was promised I would be given this chance.

Like if this man says something, everyone else is essentially required to agree with me.\n\nMeetings with the my other committee member, not my PI said he was completely shocked at this meeting, but director can and has destroyed many careers for people not agreeing and or/doing what he says. \n\nSay what you want. Call me lazy, call me an addict. I still think I don't deserve this. My PI had no problems with my progress, but he isn't willing to argue with my sexist unreasonable director committee member.\n\nNo case there right? Man do you have no empathy at all?",

This many has said some many derogatory things about women and the LBGT+ community.  Like he is a stain on the University.  He pays parts of other professors salaries  and you really thing they would automatically do exactly what they tell him to do? My PI personally told me he did not want me dismissed but he couldn't talk his boss out of it.\n\nI made mistakes.  My OD and and isolation really got to me, but i'm not where near alone on this issue (i mean the Covid years being tough on very one).  He also has no concept and understands at all what our lab does.  So the week this all happen, he kicked two of my other lab mates of projects because they were working too slow.  \n\nMy other committee member was completely shocked by the result of the meeting, and my PI told me it was 100% the director committee member. No one else brought up my progress and potentially kicking me out.  So no it was not the whole committee.  It only way because they are so scared that the director guy will pay them less if they go against his wishes.\n\nso am I still a lazy asshole that deserves this?",

Just because I pissed him off on not getting the results he wanted on one paper does not mean i deserved to be kicked out.  Or maybe for you i did does. If you're in academia and become a professor, I seriously worry for your grad students and post-docs.  They are walking into the gates of Hell.",
