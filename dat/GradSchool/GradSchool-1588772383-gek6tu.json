  "title:": "Who else had their whole trajectory thrown off by Covid-19 and wants to vent?",
  "text": "Obviously this is NOT the worst thing about the outbreak, but who else is having to totally rethink things and possibly end up without being able to interview?\n\nThis is my last year and there are two major conferences where Ph.D. students in their last year go to network and look for jobs (there are literally job interviews onsite). I have gone before, obviously, but everyone I talked to said that it was too early to hire me and to come back next year. This is fair as obviously they couldn't hire someone with 1.5 years to go. Then Covid-19 happened and those conferences are cancelled. Most job searches are cancelled. Travelling for an interview is a no-go, at least for a little while. Collecting data for my dissertation is a no-go. I don't even know if I should start trying to petition my committee to let me do an online experiment, or keep my fingers crossed that the university is open, and in-person, in the fall. We are already online for the summer, so I'll just be sitting around waiting to hear. Ugh!\n\nWho else?",

But the thing that has thrown me off the most is unreliable internet. My internet strength at home is bad (and it's also noisy and distracting where I live with family) and takes forever to load assignments, watch lectures, and it's nearly impossible to view mandatory readings. Uploading assignments is a headache too, luckily my professors lightened the load a bit. But I definitely miss going to the library to do my work, it was so nice and peaceful and I really think my work kinda declined near the end in the last few weeks.",

The conference waffled for a while but decided to go ahead as an online-only event. So of course we're still trying to make it. The thing is... The schedule we needed to maintain to pull it off has been pretty rough for almost a year. We were going to be cutting it tight before all of this. And now we're in the middle of a global fucking pandemic, work is simply not as efficient as it was, and the group leadership is *still* insisting that \"we will show our Big Result at this Very Important Conference\". Everyone is exhausted and burnt the fuck out and scattered to different timezones. No one really understands our results (even just what we have so far, which is far from everything we'd want to show) or whether they're correct. No one at the top seems to be paying attention or to give a fuck about whether or not the result is actually correct, as long as it's done in time for this conference, to the point that it really seems like it's bordering on scientific misconduct to me. I hate watching people that I used to respect push for this, I hate seeing what it's doing to all the grad students in the group, and I'm just generally incredibly bitter and angry. It's not necessarily obvious to me that it'll have a negative impact on my career in the long run -- depends a bit on how all the hiring freezes last. But still. Incredibly bitter and angry.",

I've been doing the lit review and planning the dissertation proposal for months only to have it all unravel. The good news is, that my lab has an extant data set from an older study that I can use for a similar analysis with only a small change in the research question. But the lit review has to be redone and its going to push back my dissertation proposal by several months. The program is having us essentially all switch to analyzing extant data rather than trying to collect new data since our studies are on hold.

We'd all been looking forward to this since it was announced 4 years ago. My friend and I were going to organize our own session. That is likely not going to happen now because even if domestic lock-downs are over, I can't see Portugal, which has done really well, wanting a largely American conference population traveling to their country even by January. The call for papers generally comes out in May and there has been no sign of that happening.",

I know that that doesn't mean I can't be sad, but, I know that it will all work out somehow! Glad that you were able to have such an incredible experience. My mother has been to Mongolia for a 1000 mile horse ride and she said that it was an incredibly beautiful country!",

I have a good job that I'm lucky to be able to work on from home, so I chose stability. I was devastated when I did that, but now I've accepted it. Not sure, given everything, if it'll make sense to reapply in the fall. I'll wait and see.",

Just mentioning this for others reading this\n\nAlso want to chime in to add that this is generally true, unless (and this is the only caveat, IMO) that you have secured your own funding from other sources (and generally not your own/family savings!).\n\nIn my field (High Energy Physics, UK) I was told that almost all of the students were either funded directly via their projects, via the institution or some other funding source they had been granted themselves (scholarships/industry secondments).",
