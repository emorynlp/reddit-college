Your lack of motivation may well be caused by a lack of direction so hopefully thrashing it through with your supervisor will reinvigorate your studies. \n\nGood luck!",

I 100% sent mine emails like the first, and worse \ud83d\ude02 Honestly, sometimes you just have to say what you\u2019re actually feeling. \n\nBut if it\u2019s not an option, I think the second is good, but I would be a little more direct. \u201cI\u2019m struggling with reaching/achieving (x particular method or project or experiment) because I don\u2019t feel confident in my understanding of (x). It would be really useful for me to clarify this with you in terms of the big picture of the project so that I can continue my work.\u201d\n\nOne thing my supervisor did hate was me complaining without asking for help with something concrete - she was totally cool with my ranting for 15 minutes about how I wanted to give up and work on inventing time travel instead so that I could go back to before I started a PhD, but I also had to specify what I needed from her to get over it.",
