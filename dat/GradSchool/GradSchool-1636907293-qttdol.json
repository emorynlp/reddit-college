  "text": "Hello everyone ! \n\nI am currently living in France teaching English (I have a USA passport) and I really enjoy European life and would like to stay long term, so I'm looking into completing my masters in either France, Belgium or Germany. I'm really curious as to how I could financially support myself for 2 years as a student and am curious if anyone has any insight into how the financial aspect of graduate school abroad works. \n\nApart from that, if anyone has completed a masters degree abroad in Europe and has general info/advice, that'd be great too. Thanks!",

      "text": "First of all, masters are consecutive in all of those countries, so will you be studying something in line with your bachelors? Campus France is the go to resource for finding entry requirements for any given program in France as an international student, and unless you can apply directly through the university, how you\u2019d apply. In terms of finances, you need to have the amount needed for the proof of funds aspect of the student visa, in addition to tuition, when you apply for the visa. While you can work up to 20 hours of week on the student visa, you shouldn\u2019t rely on that to wholly support yourself as you might not get a job right away, get enough hours, or be able to commit to enough hours to support yourself. As a student, you have access to housing assistance through CAF in France, but that may or may not cover a sizeable portion of your rent so you need to start your education with enough money to support yourself, or have access to someone (family usually) who can help you if need be. The living costs required for the visa for France are 615 euros for every month of your program (so 12 months for your visa, as they will only give you a visa for the first year at the beginning). Only ten universities in France are [eligible for FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/international) (and I think they're all, or almost all, private universities that are already going to be way more expensive than public). Keep in mind the tuition fee increase that you may or may not be able to get an exception from -- officially fees are now 3,770 euros a year for a master's program in France for international students.",

      "text": "Sometimes Americans with four years of undergrad can go directly into the M2 in France and thus get an entire master\u2019s degree in one year. Although employers might find it weird\u2014 French employers are incredibly risk averse and conservative wrt hiring since it\u2019s so difficult to fire & they have to offer a million and one benefits to their employees. I was able to go directly into an M2 when I was in France and can thus say that I have a master\u2019s degree from that :) \nIn some of France\u2019s cheaper cities, you can support yourself on working 20 hours a week while being a student. There are a lot of opportunities to teach English on the side and earn decent money tbh. What city are you in now?\n\nHowever, I will say this. I\u2019m not a fan of France\u2019s universities, and the 3770\u20ac cost is quite steep compared to what you\u2019re actually getting, quality wise. However, some unis do provide exemptions \u2014 I was at Lyon 2 the first year that policy was in place, and they exempted all foreigners from it, so I only paid 250\u20ac for the year. It\u2019s often worth it to go for Sciences Po or HEC or something like that, which is more expensive but also provides scholarships and has better job opportunities afterwards. Especially if you want to go into a field that isn\u2019t crazy in demand (eg you could probably get a job with a machine learning degree from any uni, but public policy means you better go to Sciences Po). I don\u2019t really know what the best unis for environmental science are. Maybe Polytechnique?\n\nI did a masters in two countries \u2014 France and the UK. The UK one was much more expensive but well worth the cost IMO. But if you want to stay in France forever, then getting a masters there is probably your best bet. You would have 2 years student visa + one year APE and then could probably find a job that would sponsor you if your French is good enough. I think you\u2019re gonna have a tricky time in Germany if you don\u2019t speak German, although their unis are cheaper than France for int\u2019l students.",
