  "text": "Hello everyone ! \n\nI am currently living in France teaching English (I have a USA passport) and I really enjoy European life and would like to stay long term, so I'm looking into completing my masters in either France, Belgium or Germany. I'm really curious as to how I could financially support myself for 2 years as a student and am curious if anyone has any insight into how the financial aspect of graduate school abroad works. \n\nApart from that, if anyone has completed a masters degree abroad in Europe and has general info/advice, that'd be great too. Thanks!",

      "text": "First of all, masters are consecutive in all of those countries, so will you be studying something in line with your bachelors? Campus France is the go to resource for finding entry requirements for any given program in France as an international student, and unless you can apply directly through the university, how you\u2019d apply. In terms of finances, you need to have the amount needed for the proof of funds aspect of the student visa, in addition to tuition, when you apply for the visa. While you can work up to 20 hours of week on the student visa, you shouldn\u2019t rely on that to wholly support yourself as you might not get a job right away, get enough hours, or be able to commit to enough hours to support yourself. As a student, you have access to housing assistance through CAF in France, but that may or may not cover a sizeable portion of your rent so you need to start your education with enough money to support yourself, or have access to someone (family usually) who can help you if need be. The living costs required for the visa for France are 615 euros for every month of your program (so 12 months for your visa, as they will only give you a visa for the first year at the beginning). Only ten universities in France are [eligible for FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/international) (and I think they're all, or almost all, private universities that are already going to be way more expensive than public). Keep in mind the tuition fee increase that you may or may not be able to get an exception from -- officially fees are now 3,770 euros a year for a master's program in France for international students.",
