  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m currently in my second year of a STEM PhD program and have really been struggling with how alone I feel. \n\nMy advisor in undergrad was literally the most supportive person imaginable, which I desperately needed at that time in my life coming from an abusive household. He was the first person that made me believe in myself and shoot for my goal of getting a PhD. \n\nBut now I\u2019m in grad school. My professor is well respected and a great educator but they are not very invested in the success of their students and pretty much only care about research progress. My group members are closed off and sometimes standoffish. I have support at home (a girlfriend, friends, pets) but I feel like none of them can really offer a ton of support because what I do is so far outside of their understanding. It is such a weird feeling to have people that care and still feel so alone. \n\nDo other people feel this way as well? If so, how have you combatted this?",

      "text": "I\u2019ve experienced this as well, so you\u2019re not alone (I almost could\u2019ve written this post, haha). One thing that has helped me was finding an advisor that is really supportive, has my back, and sees me as a person instead of a means of production. These types of advisors are not the norm, but perhaps you can find someone like that to mentor you if you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t switch to an advisor who sees things similarly.  Having an advisor like this was more important to me than specific research I was doing since I knew I needed something like what I had in undergrad to be successful. \n\nThat being said, even a supportive advisor doesn\u2019t take away the loneliness, and I think starting grad school during covid further compounds this. I\u2019ve been trying to get resources and support that seem so obvious to me that grad students should have, and it feels like screaming into a void. Make sure you take time away from stuff to take care of yourself. I also grew up in an abusive environment (that I only found out was abusive through training I did for grad school orientation), and healing that takes so much of my energy and makes tackling grad school and imposter syndrome all the more difficult. Try to find people that understand and encourage you to take time to take care of yourself. It may not be less lonely, but it does help take some of the pressure off when you need a break so you can come at your work from a better place (leading to higher quality work being done).",

We have an over abundance of colleg graduates who cannot grasp the lowest rung of employment ladder unwilling to climb the ladder to success and think a degree means they have earned the right to a high paying job merely by graduating what has become a childcare higher education system the last bastion of self reliance and discipline are the higher education degrees that require one to demonstrate excellence in research or ability. Once the requirement to demonstrate this independence of ability is extinguished by coddling MS and PHD level candidates we have truly lost the ability to compete in the world and such degrees begin the downward spiral to commonality and meaninglessness much like a BS or BA is now. \nAs holders of advanced degrees it is our responsibility to ensure that those under our tutelage have the wherewithal to carry on the torch of high standards of our discipline.",

      "text": "What I found out is that I lean on things to fill a void. Friends, activities, significant others. Coming from abusive or unsupportive households you get used to filling a void that is left by a lack of support, and most of us don\u2019t have the self awareness and guidance to use that time alone to enrich own own lives. \n\nIMO, pursuing a PhD is all about developing yourself through a mix of technical skill, scholarship, networking and existential reflection. Most URM students are great at developing technical skills and pursuing scholarship. Both of these can be escapes where we excel. Networking comes naturally because we grow up in large families, public schools, or take non-traditional paths that put us in low paying or service jobs where talking to people and managing social situations becomes second nature. But when it comes to self-reflection and reflexivity we lack skills. This is where we are our own worst enemies and our research-focused mentors are woefully lacking in providing support. \n\nYou, like myself, have lost a sense of belonging. What I did is find community outside of my cohort. That is ok. It won\u2019t always be like this. There will be new grads, new groups, and new opportunities coming your way. But this period of time will be lonely and will suck. Good. If your situation is close to mine loneliness is better than homelessness and hunger. \n\nUse this time to reflect on what is important in your life, what you value by knowing what is missing. You identifying that your previous mentor was a better fit for you is a great place to start. Ask yourself what made that relationship special and it can help to guide your nexts steps. \n\nYou are where you are because of the community you built around yourself before your PhD. Unfortunately to make that next step to a PhD, you have to leave that community and build a new one. It will take time. But as times moves on you will find your stride. Whether that lies in academia or someplace else, it will come.\n\nDo not mistake emptiness for loneliness, in the end, it is more room for happiness.",

I had an exam today that I was so nervous about, I could barely write when I started it. You should see the boxes I drew around my answer, they probably look like seismographs lol.\n\nBut I finished that fucking exam, I kicked its ass, and it felt AWESOME. I looked into the eyes of this fearsome beast and still came out on top anyway.\n\nThen I realized.... Nobody but me cares. Nobody except myself knows how scared I was, how much work I put into this exam, how triumphant it felt to make it through. I talked to my classmates and they were all like, eh, pretty easy exam, no big deal. I felt like Rohan at the start of Return of the King, but there's nobody around to really get that.\n\nThat's what kinda sucks about this process. I feel like I go through it all alone. And when I see my family and friends, I want to be like \"oh man, do you know what I've BEEN THROUGH?!\" But some of my friends won't even ask me about it at all... They're inured to a drab existence in our thirties and just want to shove away the misery with alcohol. Not me, though.\n\nIf you read this, thanks for listening.",
