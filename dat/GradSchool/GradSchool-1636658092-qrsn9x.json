  "text": "Ok, so I\u2019ve been working on my thesis proposal for almost a year now. I\u2019m hoping to be done with it by the time the semester is over. Unfortunately though, every time I send it to my advisor there are over 20+ things he asks me to fix and it\u2019s making me feel like it\u2019ll never be good enough and I\u2019ll never be able to finish it. Is this normal?",

      "text": "Yeah I was bogged down in endless revisions for my masters thesis. When it got to the point where my advisor was revising his own revisions back to how it was before, and then back again, I decided to be assertive in moving it forward.\n\nYou can *always* improve a paper, but there are diminishing returns with every revision. At some point you just have to say \"Okay I'm sending it out now\"",

I almost had a breakdown the other day because he bombarded me with emails asking if I addressed this or that, when I did but he just didn\u2019t read far enough into the paper. He even made a comment about a section HE TOLD ME to move around lol. It\u2019s normal. I\u2019ve also been wallowing in self doubt and impostor syndrome all semester so you\u2019re definitely not alone in this! It also doesn\u2019t help my committee twiddled their thumbs until the very last minute possible before deadlines so that\u2019s fun too. Keep going! You\u2019ll get through it. If my morbidly anxious ass has made it this far, you can too!",
