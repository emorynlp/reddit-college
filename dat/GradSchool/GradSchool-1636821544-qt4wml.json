      "text": "I have the relevant experience of having attended both IU and NEU (but not for BS or MS). \n\nI would  recommend waiting until the Fall and applying to more programs. \n\nHowever, *if* you really want to start in the Spring from these options, than Northeastern will probably suit your career better, *if* you can afford the cost of attending and living in Boston (which is ridiculously expensive). Thanks to its undergrad internship program, NEU is very well connected to  industry in Boston, so you could leverage the university's resources to get an internship & job during your MS. Plus, Boston is potentially the best  place in the country if you are interested in anything related to Biotech or Healthcare.\n\nI love IU, but for an industry-focused student, it doesn't offer nearly as much potential as Northeastern. This is largely due to its location, distant from any city with sizable CS industry. Indianapolis is ok, with companies like Eli Lily, and Chicago isn't that far, but even Chicago isn't really known for the kind of work you are interested in. One exception is if you are really interested in HCI above all else, than IU has a very strong Masters program.",
