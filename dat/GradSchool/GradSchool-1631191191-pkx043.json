  "text": "I\u2019m sorry, iterations of this question have almost certainly been asked. I want to leave my program, I am beginning my second year and, if all goes well, would pass my qualifying exam in April 2022. Professionally, is having an MS in biochemistry helpful? Has anyone \u201cstuck it out\u201d to qualify and regret it, feeling as though they should have bailed when they felt it was right? Can give specifics to my situation, just wanted to avoid it here to keep this from getting too long.",

Mentally committing to finishing it somehow made it seem shorter and more doable. Though dropping out seems attractive sometimes I realized I'll be closing way more doors than I'm comfortable with and really what is another 7-8 months? Also took up exercising and cut caffeine which has helped my mental state.",

Really what a masters does is allow you to move up more quickly in industry, but it isn\u2019t required. You may be capped at a certain position/salary though.\n\nBut as a fifth year PhD student, I\u2019ve wanted to quit so so so many times, but I\u2019m glad I stuck through it. I\u2019m unhappy as well but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.",

                      "text": "Right. So you have lost your enthusiasm for the program. And that's understandable. Grad school can sometimes feel demoralizing, brutal.\n\nBut since you still want to work in the field, you want to evaluate this in terms of how it will help you to pursue your long term goals once you complete it. It sounds like it could help you substantially in terms of salary and career possibilities. And probably long-term advancement. \n\nSo if you can see it as an investment with substantial payoff, then the trick would be to figure out how to reduce your unhappiness while you finish it. \n\nMaybe just treating it as a job is one way to do that, rather than getting caught up in the pressure that grad school often puts on people to perform because professors are trying to create academic mini-me's\n\nAnd then make sure you're doing the right things in terms of mental health, such as exercising daily, eating right, and getting decent sleep. Not only do those things help with mental health, but  over the weeks, they increase productivity. \n\nFor example, even a half hour brisk walk everyday makes a big difference over not getting regular exercise once you're in the habit. And cheating on sleep can work for a day or two, but then it can encourage a lack of sleep habit which will decrease your ability to function, so you have to work even longer (been there, done that as an academic, and had to learn the hard way).\n\nAs for that final class that fall, maybe you could set things up so that's the only thing you have to do to finish your degree work, and find an internship in your area to work on at the same time. That way you're building resume experience. And it doesn't even have to be exactly what you want to do in biochemistry. Something tangential that would help you to understand the industry could still be a plus.",
