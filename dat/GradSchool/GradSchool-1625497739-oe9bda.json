The stress from having to write was also a huge motivation to finish quickly. If I finished, then I could relax before I needed to start my next paper. Otherwise, I'd finish one paper, then immediately have to start the next without taking time to rest.",

First thing I would say is dont be too hard on yourself at first if you catch yourself slipping, It is is easy to lose motivation when you start to feel like you are failing, you are not, you are just dealing with growing pains. Secondly, find a time when you are most productive (that works with your schedule) For me I find getting up in the mornings and doing just an hour of work is good. You are building a routine. Do it for two weeks. Dont be afraid to make adjustments. Try to have a positive mindset. Even now, I find myself defeated before I even start my day but I work on reminding myself, \"i didnt get this far just to get this far\". Set reminders in your phone. This one is a super  big pain in the ass for me. But i have to do it because I am scattered brain.",

I am not an expert but I wanted to share a few things in case someone finds something useful:\n\n\n[Pomodoro technique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) - I was very skeptical at first, but it actually seems to really help for procrastination.\n\nWhen I get stuck or frustrated, I usually play some sort of game where I can more easily succeed (I\u2019m a dopamine junkie I guess). Could be shooting around a basketball or some quick game on my phone set to easy.\n\nListen to tangential podcasts while walking/exercising. I have a few podcasts that I enjoy and are similar to my work but different. It gets some creative juices flowing.\n\nWatch a YouTube video (just a shorter one or else you risk becoming victim to the algorithm and lose hours watching videos) that make me laugh. There\u2019s some science out there about laughing and making people feel good.\n\nCoursera has an interesting course in how to learn, which also discusses procrastination.\n\nTake some time to discover what may be causing you to feel this way (helps to talk to someone not involved). Could be connected to normal things like depression or anxiety.\n\nIf you do find something that works, it\u2019d be great if you can share it with everyone.\n\nBest of luck!",

My advisor likes to be pretty hands-off but is always more than happy to meet, and that works for me, but I know she has advised other students who needed her to impose more structure, and she was absolutely fine with doing that for those who needed it. Not all faculty may be like her though....",

      "text": "I recently got better at this after struggling with it for *years*. I had never been good at staying on task for anything or being able to get motivated to do something consistently. It took a lot of introspection, asking around, and talking with my therapist, but I figured it out for myself.\n\nI realized that in general, I always just waited around until I felt like doing something, whether it was something I liked doing (hobbies, gaming, etc.) or something I didn't (work, chores, etc.). Conversely, I would also have trouble interrupting myself from doing stuff once I started (including bathroom breaks, mental breaks, etc.), so even \"tasks\" which I liked would make me sick of them after a while (like getting sick of gaming after a binge-play or building a model kit for hours). To get any progress on anything, I was used to having to be in a hyperfocus-like state for hours and working on large chunks, with only huge leaps in progress being acceptable. This created a cycle of having no control of my time, leading to procrastinating on everything (work and play), increased how much \"revenge time\" I took at night before bed, staying up late because I felt like I didn't do things I wanted during the day, resulting in less time, energy, and motivation to do anything everyday. My bursts of interest and motivation along with my natural ability carried me through my education up to my Master's, but the PhD workload completely broke that down. I dropped to rock bottom in my 2nd year, nearly having to drop out. \n\nAs someone noted below, this is a self-regulation problem (emotional AND cognitive). I asked around for advice for a very long time, but I find that people who are good at time management aren't very good at explaining *how* they got that way. They usually describe things like using timers and schedules, which never worked for me because I couldn't get myself to start and stay focused during those alotted times for things to justify the scheduled breaks. Finally, I found the answer for myself after talking to my therapist - apparently, well-organized people have an \"internal pep talk\" to keep themselves going while they work. I always just assumed that you were either just good at focusing or not, but apparently even productive people lose focus all the time. The difference is that they learned very early on that they have to internally remind themselves \"ok just do a bit more,\" \"you can just do this little bit and then stop,\" \"just try to do some of it,\" \"see if there's anything minor you can do for now,\" etc. I went back and asked my organizationally inclined friends and family again to see if they did this, and *all* of them said they had that internal pep talk. They thought it was so basic, and were surprised I didn't do it.\n\nInternal pep talk takes mental energy to do as well, so if you're already overloaded with other stress, you won't be able to do it as much. My therapist told me that along with practicing this internal pep talk, I also needed to be compassionate with myself. I had to remember that I won't be able to have the mental energy to pep talk myself if I'm already stressed out, and beating myself up for not being productive wouldn't do much good. The thing is, you will always find people telling you to remember to take breaks and being compassionate with yourself if you aren't productive. But for me, that alone wasn't helpful because I didn't already have that internally-driven ability to make sure I started working. I could laze around forever if I constantly rested. So learning about the internal pep talk as well was really what I needed to even get myself to do consistent work in the first place to feel like compassion and breaks were ok.\n\nOn top of this, I worked on ignoring that feeling of having to do things only in large chunks of progress. I started treating it like how I save money - I love putting away small amounts of cash in my savings and watching the number grow (both in real life and in my games). So I started treating my work like this. I started working on things little by little, treating it like \"putting it in the bank,\" and not discounting it as insignificant work if I didn't finish a large chunk. Since I would always used to dread the exhaustive consequences of hyperfocus sessions, knowing that I didn't have to even enter hyperfocus to get things done eased my anxiety of having to start things in general.\n\nAfter all of this was in place, I'm now finally finding that the usually recommended timers, schedules, and notetaking actually work to help keep myself organized.\n\nSo in summary, this is what I worked on, and it has resulted in a relative boom of consistent productivity and feeling much more in control of myself and my time:\n\n- Being aware of my body (aware of physiological needs like hunger or bathroom) and attending to them as soon as possible rather than putting them off.\n- Learning how to internally pep-talk myself consistently to motivate myself to start and keep myself on task.\n- Being compassionate with myself if I don't have the energy to pep-talk myself to do work, including allowing long breaks and weekends to regain energy for more pep-talking during the week.\n- Doing small bits of a task/project little by little, putting the progress \"in the bank\" rather than doing large chunks at once all the time, to ease the anxiety of knowing how much work needs to be done.\n\nI'm sure this will be different for everyone, but I think the takeaway here is that we need to be introspective and observant of what is going on, try to understand the mechanism for why we have trouble starting or lose focus, and then target the missing part of that mechanism as the solution for it. There are many habits and behaviours that can change with enough practice, but it's not always just about \"wanting to do it enough.\" Treat your behaviour like an experiment, and go from there!\n\n_________\nEDIT: First of all, thank you all for all the attention, gold, awards, etc.! And I'm glad this was helpful and resonated so much with you. If you haven't seen my extra notes comment where I detail extra things I had to work on and build on top of to get to this point, [here is the link to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/oe9bda/how_do_you_beat_procrastination_during_grad_school/h45wutr/).\n\nI'd like to address the few comments who have brought up the possibility of me being not neurotypical or possibly having ADHD. I've already considered that I am not neurotypical, but it's also entirely possible it's a result of poor pragmatic language/other mental health weaknesses growing up (which I know to be 100% true from my own upbringing). I am a psychology PhD student, and while my primary work isn't in ADHD or clinical disorders, my work involves learning a lot about pragmatic language and how the the absence of it affects many later outcomes, as well as the use of pragmatic language in coping with autism. This is partially where my methods came from.\n\n**Regardless of what I am, the reality is that I was always having difficulty getting work done especially during my PhD and that needed to be addressed, and I found a method that addressed it.** Even those with ADHD are given these kinds of coping methods alongside or before getting medication, so I am on the right track regardless. I'd appreciate if incoming readers would refrain from speculating about my neurotypicality and/or suggesting I look into it. I've already put a lot of time and energy into investigating this possibility, I absolutely do not have the financial means to get a formal diagnosis at this time, and I would not like to constantly be reminded of this.",

          "text": "Other things I worked on that I didn't elaborate on above:\n\n- General awareness of my emotions/bodily sensations. Strong introspection and being able to label and describe your emotions is a key component of good mental health in general, which is what you will need to problem-solve most of your issues. \n- Especially since COVID started, understanding that all my meetings, classes, and anything else that isn't research is *still* work. It requires mental energy, so if you feel exhausted after a day of meetings and no research work, remind yourself that you still did a lot that day. \n- Setting boundaries for your emotional and physical health. This can look like \"no work on weeknights and weekends,\" or it can just be making sure that if you feel overly-tired/stressed that you take some time off when you can, whether that is napping or doing a hobby. I've personally started trying to keep a 10-6 schedule now, but I don't rigidly follow that. What's been more significant for me is that I'm finally feeling in control of most of the hours of my life.  \n- Meaningful breaks. YouTube, reddit, and other social media are ok for 5-10 minute breaks, but they're essentially the junk food of breaks - algorithmically-optimized content mimicking gambling-like psychological mechanisms to keep you hooked until you're drained and beyond sick of it. Have some meaningful me-time, like gaming, doing a hobby, making art, *something* that you are doing for yourself alone.\n\nIt took me about 5 months total to figure out and practice the awareness/pep-talk/compassion stuff alone to the point that I saw tangible differences in my productivity. And before that, it took 8 months for me to realize there was a pattern of always burning myself out quickly even for things I liked doing. Better mental health itself has also been a journey for me that has lasted a few years now. There doesn't have to be extreme trauma for one to get therapy; if there is a habit or behaviour you want to change, that's what psychotherapists are trained for, so consider getting some if you are able to afford it! Bottom line is that it took me time to discover these things about myself, and each discovery and self-improvement built upon previously-learned ones. My solutions might not work for all of you, but I hope I was able to give some insight into the process for troubleshooting these for yourselves!",

It leaves me a lot of time to read and write in the evenings but I feel drained and stressed from work so I have been procrastinating a lot!!! Also studying for another certification on the side, so I feel like I can't organize my time wisely or focus on my thesis research. Also just want to relax and do nothing after work.",

              "text": "I don't think it sounds like lazy procrastination though. If you're essentially working for 8 hours a day for your internship, of course you're doing to be too drained in the evenings even if you have a lot of time to do work then. Most people even in non-mentally-taxing 8 hour jobs will be exhausted by the end of the day, and research work is even more mentally exhausting than that. You're essentially telling your brain to run a marathon, and then even when it's tired, telling it to run another one right after. It doesn't sound like you're needlessly putting off work; it just sounds like you're exhausted. \n\nObviously this might not be possible for you depending on your situation, but if possible, I'd just say maybe take a step back on how many tasks/responsibilities you need to do, especially while doing this summer internship. You're only human!",

From what I've read it's even worse trying to get diagnosed as a woman (not sure your gender). \n\nA lot of professionals still hold onto the idea of adhd being the \"little boy can't sit in his seat\" disorder, which is just not right. From the adhd subreddit I've seen a lot of people told by there therapist things like \"oh you made it to grad school, obviously your adhd isn't a problem\" which completely ignores the difficulty and struggles of getting there.\n\nYour comment is actually the perfect example of an adhd coping mechanism. Youve identified a problem and a manual way of solving it that everyone else seems to do automatically. The truth is, if you do have adhd, you probably have many other of these coping mechanisms that you're not even aware of. And the thing about them is that they are mentally demanding and draining. \"Oh you made it to grad school\" completely ignores the fact that you mightve done so with both your arms tied behind your back\n\nIf you suspect you have adhd I'd say don't give up yet. If possible, find an adhd specialist. And obviously if money is an issue you can plan on doing it in the future",

They are functional states of human brains and nervous systems.\n\nPsychologists are not in the least qualified to deal with this - but they have managed to corner the market because $$$ and millions of people suffer as a result.\n\nAt best, psychological therapy can be used to support the extra mental health burden of being neurodivergent. But instead, it's primarily used to try and behaviourally bash neurodivergent people into being 'normal', something that never ends well.",

People are made to be miserable as unqualified people who have been told they are qualified offer 'diagnoses' based on shit like online questionnaires they click through while charging $3000 a pop.\n\nThis isn't a small issue, it's massive.

I had problems with both starting *and* staying on task. I solved both with training the internal pep talk for myself. (e.g. For procrastination, \"C'mon just start a bit or do a little bit.\") I also addressed the anxiety portion at the end, and in a separate comment as well.

It forms the basis of contemporary psychological understanding of neurodivergence, which is pretty much still in the Dark Ages.\n\nFor neurodivergent folks who have these issues to some degree - and please be aware the DSM is a goddamn Satanic document when it comes to screwing over ND people, so let's not focus on 'diagnosed' people - there is a very real, functional reason why they may not be able to do things the same way as NT people do - and trying to 'fix' that won't work and will just make you miserable.\n\nIf you're one of these people, then the important thing is working out whether you actually *have* to conform to these ideals, or is it healthier for you to try and chart another path through NT society and expectation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr 'productivity' isn't really a goal neurodivergent people should grind themselves up against if they have functional differences that impact on it.",

My advice would be to work under a schedule. 12-5? 9-4? whatever suits you best, but once you are out of that schedule then grad school is closed and time is yours.\n\nI would also recommend you to read this nice essay \u201cHow to work hard\u201d by Paul Graham . Maybe you can share your thoughts with us once you read it. \n\nhttp://paulgraham.com/hwh.html",
