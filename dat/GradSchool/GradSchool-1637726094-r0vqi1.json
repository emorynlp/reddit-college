  "text": "If there are two things I have gained from my time in grad school so far, it\u2019s those two things. \n\nI feel a lot wiser than when I entered grad school. And just as an example of the second one, I once had a biology teacher in high school who dropped out of a PhD program when he only had a few credit hours left to go. As a high school student I used to think that was foolish. But as a second year grad student, I understand now.\n\nEdit: No I\u2019m not leaving grad school. Lol!",

I think that certain aspects of grad school help facilitate wisdom, but I don't think this is exclusive to grad school or necessarily a greater contribution than simply aging. In some ways I even think grad school provides some amount of shelter from the world outside of academia.",

It\u2019s almost like going to war, loosing a loved one, or giving birth. Nobody can understand it without actually having gone through it. \n\nTrue it does provide some shelter from the outside world, even in the case of professors. Often times I am convinced that a lot of these professors and academics are living in their own little world, especially in regards to liberal arts professors. This and my own personal struggles have made me want to get back to the outside world even more. I worked a little bit before going to grad school and I enjoyed that a lot more than school.",

If you want to work on the subject and love the work get a MS. If you love the subject and would do it for free because it is your passion get a PhD. A PhD means that eventually you get to change a very small part of the world of your subject and guide others to help you do so. You won't, however, actually do the work involved with that change but it will be your ideas.",
