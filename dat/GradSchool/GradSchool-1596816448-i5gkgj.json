  "text": "For me, it has made me realize that I don't want to continue into veterinary school after getting my Master's. I don't want to suck another 4-6 years out of my life being in school. I don't want to take out anymore loans and rely on the government to give me financial aid anymore. I want to get on with my life, marry my girlfriend, and make an actual salary instead of a stipend. I don't want to worry about grades anymore or meeting deadlines on stupid papers or just staying in school life in general. I get jealous talking to other friends from high school and college moving up in their careers or being able to actually live with their SO. I miss my parents and I wish I could hug them, but we have this stupid pandemic and people here in the Southeast don't want to abide by something as simple as a mask. I don't want to go back to school and teach labs where there is a chance I am going to catch the virus itself. This whole thing is a pain in the ass.\n\nI'm just tired man.",

So, now I'm extremely skeptical of the whole you need a postgraduate degree to earn more/get jobs etc. I think had I just started working I would have had 2 yrs experience by now. \n\nI'm happy I finished before the pandemic. I'm sad I skipped the graduation though but I didn't care for it anyway. I have my degree and it's going to be a long time before I sign up for more education. I'm 23 and have merely a year of professional experience. I'm scared that I'm behind everyone else.",

International scholarships is the field of social sciences are scarce and there is no guarantee of a job and visa after the Doctorate there, even if I consider a loan. I got admission last year and then deferred it to this year, but this whole pandemic and the economic situation in my country has made me realize that spending so much money and taking unnecessary mental pressure is not worth it. I am in a decent job right now, I will again apply for Ph.D. next year only to countries and places with a chance for a scholarship.",

This was partially my parents' idea because I was struggling with depression after my divorce (i'm 35 now) and lacking drive and motivation. \n\nI've been accepted to yet another program but what covid showed me is that I can live off other funds and be happier. I am hoping the feds increase those funds for now, but I want a JOB. I want to WORK. I want a NORMAL LIFE FOR MY AGE. \n\nI realized during these months I don't want to live off student loans for a program I'm never going to finish. 4 more years? Really? So I'll be 40 by the time I'm done with school and just beginning to enter a new career?\n\nI HAD a career. It feels like I leaned too hard on others for advice on how to handle my money. I just don't want the debt anymore. I don't care what I have to do. When you haven't earned a single credit and are 40k in debt anyway just from grad school loans...it's time to give it up.",

I've been working toward this my entire life and right now with all this uncertainty it feels like I've wasted everything. I hadn't realized just how quickly things break down in my field when you can't do fieldwork or be in the lab. If I had samples to process or a paper to write it would be different but coming in at the very beginning of a project there's just nothing I can do but watch.

In my graduate career:\n\n- Fucking Donald Trump was elected and my entire field of environmental toxicology has been in funding turmoil ever since lol\n\n- 3 major hurricanes have hit, two of them delaying labwork.\n\n- Unplanned facility renovations leading to space limitations delayed my experiments for over a year.\n\n- While out of town, my labmate (the senior student) accidentally killed over half of my experimental animals and I had to restart the experiment. The delay was almost 6 months.\n\n- A global pandemic delayed my experiments by another 3 months and was the final nail in my graduation timeline. \n\n- When I finally was able to do one of dissertation experiments, it turned out the methodology is unworkable for my model species (alternative model, most of the work with it is novel) and the data is unusable. Now I\u2019m completely reworking the second chapter of my project in order to salvage it. *This* late in the game! \n\nAnd those are just the big things that have gone wrong. I\u2019ve just stopped caring about the students around me who graduate earlier than I do or are publishing more often than me. All I care about at this point is getting my shit done right while not losing my fucking mind. People in academia are focused too much on dates and numbers and not learning/doing good work. \n\nAlso my advisor is amazing and has really worked to keep me funded even though I have to stay an extra semester. \n\nIt is what it is.

I'm actually getting to a point now where I'm feeling thankful for the level of stability I have in grad school amidst the pandemic. I know the job market is gonna be shit for the next few years as well, so a longer PhD almost feels like a blessing in disguise.\n\nIn the end, you have to determine for yourself whether the reward is worth it. For me, somewhere about 3 years into the PhD, I realized that what I really value above all other things related to my work is the sense of autonomy. I can't imagine working for anyone else later in life (yes, I know there's always *someone* to answer to, but you get my point), thus I think I just need to be a PI.\n\nEdit: disclaimer since this is the general grad school sub: I'm in STEM, we actually get paid a living wage and funding is not a concern, therefore ymmv re: \"the level of stability I have in grad school during the pandemic\"",

I\u2019m in my late 20s, fairly introverted, and I thought I could benefit from my own space to breathe at this point in my life. Grad school turned out to be waaaay more isolating than I had anticipated, and in hindsight I spent much of my first year with my head barely above water emotionally. I had few, consistent social contacts and constantly felt a low-grade loneliness that, under times of stress, went downhill into full blown existential crisis. I was completely alone for 9 weeks at the tail end of my semester, and my mental health was decimated by it. I intended to stay on campus and work in the summer, but I was laid off and so able to travel home to stay with my family. My parents loved me and took care of me at my lowest. I re-evaluated my life and made vital changes to my living situation. I made renewed commitments to my physical and mental health. I leaned on people and disclosed my feelings to my stunningly supportive supervisor. I sought help, had a moment to connect with myself again, and spent time outside and in nature with my beautiful pets. Being totally rocked by COVID mentally and emotionally was not cool by any means, but it was the circumstances I need to take a hard look at the way I was living and decide that things had to change. I\u2019m starting my second year of grad school feeling optimistic, centered and ready. Thank you for asking. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling tired. I understand that completely. This is a really stressful time on so many levels. It is normal to be experiencing the effects of that stress, to realize that your values have changed, and to make changes to you life that feel congruent with what you need and want.

I don't think I've ever felt so alone - even the things I used to have fun doing alone brought me no joy. I was blessed to be able to do all my work on my laptop, but even my work quality had begun to diminish significantly. I decided to drive home to \"check on\" my parents, but really they supported me in my lowest low.  My supervisor I never realized even virtually, he cared that I was mentally unwell - not just that my work wasn't up to usual standards. I was embarrassed at first that counseling services was involved, but we all sat down (virtually) and discussed healthier coping methods.

The department has done as much as they possibly can to make sure we can do our research by arranging transportation to get our lab set ups to us as reasonably possible (I\u2019m in electrical engineering, so the circuits can travel easily). My advisor is super understanding of my mental health, especially bc he has been depressed too. \n\nOn my personal level, I really have enjoyed spending so much time with my partner and family. I also crochet as a hobby and started selling my items because I have been making *so much*. I really like how much everyone whole follows my personal socials looks forward to seeing what inanimate object I crochet and put a little smiley face on next. \n\nAlso scientific communication is *INFURIATING*. It really disappoints and upsets me how many people I know don\u2019t truly understand how research works and that science can change pretty quick - and it doesn\u2019t make us less trustworthy because of it. (eg in the USA Dr Fauci telling us not to buy masks in the beginning of March vs mandatory mask requirements now isn\u2019t hypocrisy, it\u2019s science doin it\u2019s job)",

The chair/moderator could click along through the slides and the audience could just listen to the presenter speak.  But, like, quality is going to be poor and plenty of sessions will get screwed up.\n\nIDK, I guess we could have people that want to attend virtually pay and if enough people sign up, we get an AV crew, and if not, they refund their money.  This is really not going to work for large conferences, though.  The coordination/effort would be massive.",

It's one thing to see the data, write down what you can, and then tell your army of post-docs \"Hey, try this one thing\" to scoop the other guy. It's another to have photographic evidence of exactly what the results should look like.\n\nLike, you know how annoying it is that every conference panel has *that guy* who takes photos of every single slide (and a moderator who doesn't care about enforcing anti-photography rules)? This takes the problem and turns it up to 11.\n\nI feel like recording or live streaming should be at the discretion of the presenter, for those reasons.",

Anyone can record a screen with a handheld camera, or they can purchase a videocable splitter and send the video to a recording device - this is how high-quality footage of non-emulated game consoles is captured, for example.\n\nAnd it's not exactly spy-level stuff like sneaking a hidden camera on your person into a conference room. You can accomplish this by just placing your camera slightly out of view of your webcam (assuming the conference organizers want to see the audience faces), to take advantage of the wide view angle on most modern screens.\n\nHosts disabling screen recording is more of a reminder to be courteous to the speaker by not recording",
