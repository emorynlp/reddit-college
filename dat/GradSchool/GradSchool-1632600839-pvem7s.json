My program is full of people my gender, the only people of the opposite sex are married or in relationships. I\u2019m a TA so I have to be careful who I go after at the bars in case it becomes a conflict of interest. Any ideas on how I might be able to find someone?",

First of all, calculate the odds of a random young-ish person you meet that you want to hit on, whether in bar or even directly on campus, ending up in your class. I doubt it's higher than \\~.03. Second, if it happens, deal with it appropriately (notify the professor or ask another TA to grade, figure it out). You didn't do anything at all unethical unless you handle yourself poorly. With that said, let me save you some time. If you are looking for a \"significant other\", do not look in a bar.",

We've now been dating for 10 months+ and it's probably my best relationship so far. She works in a grocery store but we have amazing chemistry ( pun intended)/interest in the same hobbies. \n\nDon't underestimate Tinder.

I moved to 4 different cities for community college, undergraduate, graduate, second graduate, and multiple jobs so meeting someone meaningful was nearly impossible as my adult relationships don't normally last more than a couple years (have been single for over a decade because of it with little flings here and there).\n\nBut then, I have graduate school and full time career + military reserve obligation at the same time so I don't think much of dating (although I do get jealous seeing couples walking in a park while I just walk alone or spend the holidays by myself while others either fight or make love lol).\n\nOn the other hand. I think about how I can just go to the gym, sleep and be on reddit without having to please someone while I have all that stuff going on to maintain 2 careers and finish my second Master's while most people barely ever accomplish one of those... so chase excellence not women! and I hope your school is going great and the students aren't coming to you with dumb questions, TA!",

      "text": "honestly, I don't date anyone affiliated with the university. Even if you avoid conflict of interest stuff, having a SO at your workplace becomes awkward, \\*especially\\* if it doesn't work out and causes drama.\n\nRemember, grad school is closer to a workplace than it is school, so I think it's kind of silly to treat the social dynamics like a school.\n\nDating \\*can\\* be done during grad school, just try to approach it less like a student and more like a working professional. You're not in high school anymore, and your social life doesn't need to revolve around your school.\n\nDon't restrict yourself to the specific town you live in either. Don't be afraid to expand yourself out a few hours drive in every direction when looking. Don't just go to bars either. I really hate that so many people keep saying that when talking about dating, because almost every happily married couple I've met \\*absolutely\\* did not meet that way. Shit, my parents met on a dive boat while my mom was seasick (both of them are avid scuba divers), and my brother met his significant other during a ballroom dance competition.\n\nI met my boyfriend through reddit of all places funnily enough (we frequented some of the same subreddits), and he actually lived about two to three hours drive away from my university when I first met him. Initially it was mostly online chatting, which turned to zoom/skype calls, which then became visits, and eventually it became serious enough that he moved in with me at an apartment one town over from campus. And he and I are in completely different fields. I'm a physicist, he works in k-12 education and afterschool enrichment programs (mostly middle and high school, but has been known to work with elementary schoolers from time to time) so there's no conflict or risk of conflict with our work.",

I 100% understand dating outside your own program, or at minimum your own cohort, but you would consider an MA student in humanities dating a PhD student in STEM to be a conflict of interest? Especially if there's only one university in your area and you're looking for someone intellectually engaging or who can empathize with your struggles, another grad student might be a great match. This is even more silly when you meet someone outside of the university setting, like at a bar or hobby, and really hit it off. Later you find out they're also a student and you should just break it off? Idk, just my thoughts.",

It could *easily* end up being the case if I dated say...a humanities student that they might not be able to find work anywhere close geographically where I end up employed.\n\nPart of the reason i got with my current boyfriend (besides the chemistry we have between each other) is that he works in k-12 education, which has job opportunities basically everywhere, so we are less likely to run into this problem than if I were dating say...a marine biologist or someone who studies native American pueblo cities.",

Sure your degree might be in biology, but you might specifically work with a specific type of rotavirus that is only researched at like three labs nationally.\n\nThat's what I'm trying to point out here. When you're already committed to a field that restricts your job opportunities to a certain geographic area, it can actually hurt your odds of finding a long term relationship  from a statistical standpoint if you focus your search  on people who are likely to have similar dynamics going on, where the location of jobs from one field to the next often has very little overlap.",

The chances of getting a TT position at any particular university are slim to none, let alone the chances of two people in two different fields. Not to mention most university faculty are actually employed as \\*researchers\\* and are expected to do a certain amount of research/ bring in a certain amount of grant money as a condition of employment. And research varies a \\*lot\\* from institution to institution. There's  less than a dozen or so universities in the US that even \\*do\\* the kind of research I do at all.

It sounds to me like you are \\*extremely\\* out of touch about how hard the academic job market really is.  You \\*cannot\\* guarantee an english faculty position \\*at all\\* let alone one specifically in DC.

You sound like an unfeeling robot.\n\nAnd to me, you sound incredibly naive and like you have never once put an ounce of thought about how you are going to make your relationship work long term and just decided fairies and pixie dust are just going to magically make it happen. In the real world, real relationships require work and long term logistical planning. You can't just rely on the magic of love and hope it will work out. I'm sorry that this isn't enough of a Hallmark movie moment for you, but this is how the world really works. In the real world, if you ignore obvious logistical issues like this in relationships, you are extremely likely to get heartbroken. I've seen it happen countless times, including in my own family.",

We became friends and he started inviting me out to his department's social events. Overtime, I became part of their department social group and I ended up dating someone I met through this group. There were only a couple people in my own cohort and department that were single. I also tried a dating app very briefly at the time with no success.   \n\n\nHow I met this new friend? I was at a dive bar one evening and saw my landlord while waiting in line for a drink. I turned around so he wouldn't see me and made casual conversation with the person behind me. I explained how I was trying to avoid talking to my landlord and said I was a grad student. He said he was also a grad student then invited me to join him and his peers. I read further down that you are (or were) a student athlete, so not sure how advice about checking out the local nightlife would work for you... Lol.",

I think most people have an idea of their perfect partner in their head, and they struggle to give people a fair shake if they\u2019re outside of that box. Obviously it\u2019s still really important that both people feel reasonably comfortable/safe, especially early in the dating game, but more of what I\u2019m saying is that if you think a guy is cute and enjoy talking to him - don\u2019t drop him just because you found out he\u2019s a plumber and not a fellow \u201cintellectual\u201d. If you hit it off with the girl at the dog park, don\u2019t balk because she\u2019s not in whatever neat little box you were hoping she would fit into. \n\nGive people a chance. If you give it a go and it just isn\u2019t right for either (or both) of you, no shame in saying you tried but it wasn\u2019t right. But a lot of people are automatically eliminating a lot of people that could potentially be great partners, then bitching about not being able to find a partner.",
