  "text": "\nSo my group and I presented in one of my seminar courses. All was well, my anxiety got to me but I feel like I voiced my parts in a good way that didn\u2019t require me to read off the research paper\u2014I had my notes on the side and referenced the slides only to explain the supplemental images. I was in charge of the first section of the  materials and methods and the conclusion. \n\nThere were 8 of us in the group and I would have to say that one of the members did read off the paper and didn\u2019t elaborate on the results at all and the professor made note of that. Another member presented the set of results very well, as they mentioned what it meant as opposed to what the results were. Anyways, at the end of the class (this was on 10/6 btw), one of the members of our group spoke to the TA and asked how we did. She mentioned that we read off the paper and didn\u2019t really add our own flair to it. She\u2019s basically grading us as a group and as individuals, along with a scientific and layman abstract. \n\nToday after another group presented, the professor asked them how they worked so well together (they did a WONDERFUL job. I learned a lot from their presentation) and basically, three of the members had research experience and they found out from our presentation to not read off the results and to elaborate. The TA told them that. Anyways, when this happened the professor mentioned to not read off the paper, and one of my group members overheard the TA\u2019s in the back saying \u201cunlike THAT group\u201d basically regarding our group. \n\nWe\u2019re really hurt about this because hopefully not all of us are penalized for this\u2026 I did not read off the paper. I had my notes and I read off of my own ideas. The summary cartoon was made by me and I even received good feedback from one of the students. We\u2019re all pretty nervous about our grade right now considering the TA\u2019s used our group presentation as the bad example. There really are advantages to presenting toward the end of the semester because you obtain feedback and you\u2019re able to see what\u2019s right and wrong. I don\u2019t know if this was a good sign or not, but I was never asked questions on my sections of the presentation. Plus, the professor came in a bit late minutes into me talking about my first section and there were times when the TA wasn\u2019t even paying attention. I don\u2019t know what to do from here except to wait for the grade. Really nervous.",
