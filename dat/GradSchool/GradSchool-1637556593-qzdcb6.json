  "text": "Hello, current undergrad here literally giving myself brain damage over thinking too hard about class selections.\n\nI'm finishing up my first semester of my third year. I plan to take a few years off and do some things I've always wanted to do before going to grad school. I'm currently working with a prof on an independent research credit + will be completing an honours thesis in my fourth year. \n\nIn planning out the rest of my degree nothing fits perfectly. I want to take all of the theory and methods courses but don't have room for them, I want to take an equal amount of archaeology and cultural anthropology courses but I also want to fit in medical and linguistic anthropology. Also, there are just so many different courses I want to take and I want to take as many 400 level courses as possible, BUT I work a ton and sometimes it's rough. I also decided to drop a class I was going to take next semester because the prof teaching is, while amazing, gives unrealistic and stressful workloads + stressfully vague assignments and I just can't handle that alongside everything else. I'm not beating myself up over it and worrying it will look bad to only take 2 400 level courses next semester.\n\nRealistically, does anyone actually KNOW if admissions boards are going to care? I'm doing lots of 300 and 400 level courses and might take some 200 levels in my final year to make the workload a bit more manageable.\n\n If I end up applying to an archaeology program, will it matter if I didn't take all the archaeology classes but more of a balance? Or if my honours thesis was more cultural or bio based but I still took many archaeology classes and have those research skills? I'm at a place where I just want to leave my options open and not seal anything away because I'm interested in EVERYTHING and don't know what I want to do yet.\n\nSorry for the ramble, I am insanely tired lol. Thanks!!",

      "text": "Are you in the US? Because if so I can only think of one archaeology specific grad program, UMass Boston's MA in historical archaeology (someone can correct me if I'm wrong and there are more, I think BU was the last one for a PhD and they combined back with anthro a few years ago). So if you are going into a PhD program and most MA programs, it will be in an anthropology department and you will almost certainly have to take cultural and bio classes for your degree even if you are an archaeologist. \n\nIf you don't know what subfield you want to do yet, take classes in all because you will have to know when applying to grad programs. Also, if you haven't already, get a field school this summer. The worst thing would be to go for archaeology and learn you hate field work once in grad school. Or if you already have a field school, work CRM this summer. I would do your honors thesis in the field you want to do for grad school though, once again to make sure you like that type of research. \n\nBasically, keep exploring until you know what you want to do before going to grad school. But, try to have that figured out and do your honors thesis in the subfield you want to apply to grad school for.",

Thanks!\n\nIt\u2019s the same over here, I would essentially be getting an anthropology MA with a specialization in archaeology and completing master\u2019s thesis in archaeology, but while still studying a little bit of everything. \n\nI really wanted to do a field school but it\u2019s a financial barrier for me (I can\u2019t really afford to not be working) AND they\u2019re all cancelled again this summer. There is an internship available that\u2019s CRM based but it\u2019s not very financially accessible for me either. I\u2019m really hoping that hands on/lab experience will at least make up for this if I do decide to pursue archaeology. :(\n\nWould you happen to know how common it is in the US for people to move into anthropology from other fields? For example, someone moving from a psych or classics undergrad to anthropology/archaeology.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re in North America going into CRM or commercial, rescue arch whatever you want to call it, having cultural anthropology classes will do very little for you in the long run. If you\u2019re anywhere else in the world definitely don\u2019t do anthro in most places outside of NA it\u2019s separate from arch. \n\nWith that in mind though people constantly move back and forth between degrees. It\u2019s common to see people with a wide range of degree types in archaeology because there\u2019s always some way that it is applicable. \n\nThe big thing however is getting actual experience. One of my biggest frustrations with archaeology are the financial barriers. Not enough people talk about how shitty the field school system is for getting experience when you\u2019re not coming from a stable financial background. \n\nI\u2019m sure someone will disagree with this but degrees at this point are a poor indicator of qualification and skills. Like I said earlier, if you want to be a field arch learning anthro method and theory is going to be unhelpful. Hell, even learning arch theory is not going to make much of a difference. \n\nIt\u2019s all about your practical abilities to excavate and having the relevant skills to do that as well as having whatever certifications and other quals you need. \n\nYou should try talking to your professors to see if they can\u2019t find a way for you to get onto a field school or get an internship that is financially viable. Not having had field school experience will probably set you back quite a bit and like the other commenter said, you don\u2019t want to get on a dig and find out you hate it. \n\nThe other thing which might sound shitty is that if you can\u2019t afford to do an internship now you might struggle to find a career in archaeology. I\u2019m from a lower income family and it\u2019s been a serious struggle to make a career in archaeology. \n\nAnyway, don\u2019t let this deter you! Every archaeologist has different experiences and different paths!",

              "text": "I unfortunately don\u2019t have much knowledge of bioanth and it\u2019s routes since that\u2019s one of those in between sub-fields of archaeology that I\u2019ve never really gotten to experience! \n\nBut I can ramble on about archaeology in general, either way archaeology redefines the phrase \u201cyour results may vary\u201d\u2026  \n\nIn my undergrad department in the US there was a stark divide between anthropology and archaeology. Nothing we learned in anthro classes ever translated to what we studied in arch classes. There were also major disagreements between the professors in the anthro department and the arch department (we were a \u2018standalone\u2019 archaeology program and degree). \n\nThe other commenter mentioned BU which recently closed down their arch PhD program and they have a pretty interesting multi-disciplinary approach to archaeology with a lot of professors and courses outside of the anthro department. \n\nThe big thing about all this though is that there is such a huge divide between the academic programs and what you\u2019ll actually be doing in archaeology. I\u2019m sure this is a bit different in bioanth being more of a lab-based thing and from what I remember my bioanth courses were very practically oriented. \n\nFor the most part, archaeological theory is wildly divergent from practical archaeology and anthropological theory is even farther removed. Theory is also really poorly taught in undergrad programs and not to anyone\u2019s fault really, it\u2019s an obnoxiously complicated and messy world that varies depending on who you talk to and there are so many unproductive debates that just leave you scratching your head. \n\nAs for methodology, in archaeology at least that varies from dig to dig and for the most part anthropological methodology has nothing to do with digging. Again, for bioanth I\u2019m not familiar with the landscape so you\u2019ll have to just ask questions to find out! \n\nThe big thing is doing exactly what you and the other poster are doing, asking questions to better define your career path. \n\nIn most cases in archaeology and it\u2019s related fields, experience and specialization are king. Getting out in the field, getting in the lab, and getting into internships will put you ahead of a lot of people. \n\nThis is mostly because the jobs that are available are very practical either in CRM or with the government and neither of those really bother with theory or more abstract thinking. \n\nSo the best thing you can do is try to get in touch with people who are doing what you want to do in your area, like physical area, and finding out what you need to get there. \n\n9/10 times it\u2019s getting an internship, getting out into the field, having certain certifications or qualifications etc. \n\nRecently I was talking to someone who heads up a CRM firm and they are hiring anyone that has a license and can physically get to an excavation (unfortunately in the UK). So it\u2019s important to also ask what other types of non-academic things are available to you that can give you a good foundation future opportunities. \n\nI wish I could be of more help! But this one is a bit out of my wheelhouse! At the very least, I can say that most people in archaeology and related fields are happy to answer questions and respond to emails. \n\nI\u2019ve had to email 70+ archaeologists whom I\u2019ve never met or spoken to before and most were happy enough to chat or at least respond!",

I've worked in CRM (state and local gov) and academia, my degrees are from the US and overseas.\n\nMy experience is that no, the admissions board won't care too terribly that you didn't take that one theory or methods class. Develop an understanding of theory and methods generally so that you can speak about them coherently. \n\nOnce you're looking into a degree program, finding someone you want to work with is key, it's \"fit.\" Finding someone who is interested in you as a student and a researcher can make the difference between success and burnout.\n\nGet field experience however you can. Be a shovel bum if that's feasible, volunteer to work in a lab washing artifacts. If you can't get into fieldwork, helping inventory connection backlogs or doing archival research can give you experience too.\n\nIf your heart is in cultural work, same deal. Volunteer to help with transcription or coding interviews--anything you can do. \n\nWhatever your honors thesis is, make sure it's an original piece of work with a strong question, theoretical foundation, and solid methods. That will translate well into anything you decide to do later. Do it with the expectation that this could be a writing sample you use for a degree application at a later date.\n\nYou don't have to have it all figured out right now, just be effective with your efforts!\n\nI wish you all the luck on your journey. \ud83d\ude0a",
