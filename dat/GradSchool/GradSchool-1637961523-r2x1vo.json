  "text": "So the title is the school I'm looking to go to for grab school to get my master's. I plan on being a therapist, after I graduate from my understanding I will be a Limited Licensed Professional Counselor, and after my 2000 of supervision I will be eligible to become a Licensed Professional Counselor. Does anyone on here know of MSP? It is now APA accredited but I know that's for doctoral degrees, they are not CACREP accredited but a regional committee of higher learning has accredited them. What's their acceptance rate? What's it like there? It seems perfect for me because I share very similar core values that they claim, and it's a small school with experiential learning, which is huge for me. What's their acceptance rate too, if anyone knows?",
