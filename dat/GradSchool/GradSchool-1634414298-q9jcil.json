  "text": "I'm currently a Software Engineering student, and I would like to do my Master's next Fall. I'm not sure whether to do my Master in Data Science/Data Analytics field or Computer Science/Software Engineering field.\n\nI'm fairly interested in both, so I have basically two questions?\n\n1. In which area do I learn more?\n2. Where is the assistance of Professors/Mentors more needed - Data Science or Software Engineering?\n3. Which Master Degree has more value in the job market?\n4. Which field is easy to get into?\n5. Any other thoughts?\n\nThanks in Advance",
