  "text": "My adviser wants me to start applying for jobs, but my resume is... pathetic.\n\nI got my bachelor's in 2019, worked for a year, then started grad school (MS in hydro) in Aug 2020 at the height of the pandemic. \n\nIn undergrad I was never able to get any internships, and I never got to do research with in a professor's lab (which was a result of not knowing how you even get into/ask to be in a lab in the first place combined with going to a tiny school with little opportunity for such thing). I had to do a senior thesis project but it was with a group of people and wasn't really impressive. I did do a study abroad \"research experience\" but it was only for a month and the professor was basically using students as extra hands for fieldwork, he never taught us of anything aside from how to do the fieldwork. The fieldwork was setting live-capture traps for rodents, which isn't relevant to my current field of hydrology. I didn't get to participate in any of the data analysis.\n\nStarting grad school in the middle of COVID, with all online classes, means I haven't been involved in any sort of student committees or activities really. As a masters student who came in with 2 years of funding secured, I havent written any proposals. I haven't \"collaborated\" on any papers, aside from class assignments that never ended up being journal-worthy despite the professors' wishes.\n\nI've done bits of volunteer work, but nothing consistent enough to be worth nothing on the resume due to moving so frequently and COVID. \n\nMy work involves using GIS, excel, and R a lot, but that feels like a very short and underwhelming set of hard skills. In R I mainly use scripts shared with me or scripts that are heavily based on help guides I found online, its not like I'm really making my own stuff.\n\nTL;DR - **Didn't get to do any undergrad research or an internship, only had a \"real\" job for a year, COVID has resulted in having 0 on-campus involvement. Are there any grad students out there in a similar situation, who feel they have nothing to put on their resume?**",

I\u2019m 40 but I don\u2019t have any relevant, verifiable work history. I worked with my university\u2019s career and professional development services department and they were SO helpful. With their guidance I created a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9, learned how to write cover letters, applied for a ton of jobs, went on a bunch of interviews, and just got hired.\n\nI seriously agonized about it for months before I finally reached out to that department. My only regret is putting myself through that much ridiculousness before asking for help.\n\nI suggest you reach out to that department at your university. You can meet with them as many times as you want, while you are a a student and later as an alumni. For best results, be very clear about what your challenges are, what you\u2019re worried about, all that stuff. \n\nGood luck! If I can do it, you can do it!",

Of course they dont know my own history or experience, but when the counselor looked over my resume she didnt even catch some obvious typos. I guess I shouldnt judge one career center based on a different one though.",

If the person you talk to at first isn\u2019t helpful, ask to speak with someone else. \n\nStart looking for job postings, they tell you exactly what they want. Highlight key words and skills. Use the same key terms in your resume. \n\nFor example, at a previous job I talked to people about their accounts. I would have hundreds of accounts I regularly serviced. The job posting wanted someone \u201cexperienced at managing a dynamic caseload\u201d. Boom. I wrote \u201cmanaging and servicing dynamic caseload of at least 100 cases per month\u201d. Typically I would have described my previous experience as simply \u201ccustomer service\u201d. \n\nAlso in my previous work I dealt with a lot of angry people. People yelling in my face all day every day. On my new r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I wrote something to the effect of \u201cutilized population specific interventions to de-escalate crisis situations\u201d.\n\nSeriously, you can do this. I\u2019m old AF and I have barely any and completely irrelevant experience and no experience related to my undergrad or grad degree. And I\u2019m happily employed in my field now. You got this!",

      "text": "Me.  I've been a stay-at-home mom for quite a lot of years.  What I did was brainstorm all the things I have done, volunteer stuff, off jobs, education, etc.  Just listed them all out and loosely categorized them.  It ended up being a couple of pages long.  That was my informal \"resume\" and it did the trick in getting me into grad school.  Then I paid a lady to write me up a professional resume using that information.  So there is still not much there that looks super impressive, but everybody has to start somewhere, ya know?  Also, err on the side of honesty and avoid padding the resume, prospective employers see right through it.",

      "text": "Are you using a resume or a CV to apply for jobs? I\u2019d probably put both together, but keep in mind that they\u2019re quite different. Either way, it sounds like you have a lot of great experience to include. \n\nBeing able to take an internship or work in a lab is a privilege, particularly when they include low or no pay. Plenty of people either have to work their way through school or can\u2019t afford to relocate for this stuff. I know they\u2019re viewed favorably in terms of experience, but I am increasingly see people acknowledge that plenty of people can\u2019t pursue these opportunities. \n\nYou said you had research experience abroad. Totally include it. It doesn\u2019t have to be more than a line, but what skills did you develop? That matters. \n\nWho cares if your fieldwork was setting mammals traps? Field experience is great to have. I\u2019ve done fieldwork in a couple different professions, and while the technical aspects vary, certain aspects of being out in the field are pretty similar. \n\nOf course R and ArcGIS are great to have on there! Just be ready to back that up, because I\u2019ve reviewed lots of CVS where people list R and when I ask about it, they saw it used in a class once and haven\u2019t used it again. \n\nNow you\u2019re working hard in a graduate program in a pandemic. I mean, this is a challenge. And you\u2019re doing it. Give yourself some credit! You\u2019ve adapted to make the most of things during a really tough time. \n\nIf there are any skills you feel like you\u2019d like to develop in the time you have left in your program, sit down with your advisor. You can always list those as in progress or bring them up in a cover letter or interview. \n\nLook, if you\u2019re new to putting resumes and CVS together, it\u2019s hard to do. It\u2019s another skill that takes some working. Expect your first couple drafts to be a mangled dumpster fire of text. That\u2019s okay! Find a couple friends to read it over, looks at examples online, and hone it. Ask lab mates for help if you can. Ask friends outside your field to see if they can understand it \u2013 particularly your resume. Reach out to your school\u2019s career center, or whatever resources they have available. This is what they do. \n\nAt some point, you\u2019ll have to jump into the job search. It\u2019s not the world\u2019s most fun process, but it\u2019s better to apply for more jobs than wait for your resume to be perfect.",

      "text": "Honestly it sounds like you have a fair amount you can put on your resume! I feel like education can take up almost half of it. Include all your some-what relevant experience even if it could have been even more relevant. That's ok, they still sound like cool experiences! Include your non-relevant job experience, even if it wasn't related I think future employees like seeing that you've had a job. I feel like those are very in-demand skills, so that's awesome! I think its fine to include volunteer work even if it wasn't a ton or consistent if you have space for it on a resume, would not include it if it makes the resume 2 pages. I've seen friends add volunteer work that literally consisted of 2 hours of volunteering one time. I don't personally have volunteer work or campus involvement on my resume. The only \"research\" material my resume includes in my thesis title. (And I've also not published anything and won't be either...). A lot of people include a relevant coursework section and that fills up a fair amount of space. But it honestly sounds like you have a lot of stuff to put on your resume! I'd just try to keep it to one page and see how it goes.",
