  "title:": "Should I Take a Gap Year Before Grad School? What are your experiences?",
  "text": "Hey everyone! I'm currently a senior in college, and I'm planning to study Higher Education and Student Affairs in grad school. My ideal position would be in academic advising or residence life. \n\nI'm very excited to start my master's degree. However, I'm already starting to feel some burnout due to my workload. I normally have a full course load, I work part time in my field, I sometimes work an internship (depends on the semester), and I hold leadership roles in a few clubs in my school. \n\nI love everything I do, but I'm worried if I keep pushing myself that I'll completely burn out in grad school. At the same time, however, I don't want to lose momentum in my career.\n\nWhat are your experiences with a gap year post undergrad? Would you recommend it? If so, what would you recommend doing with the time in between? I'd love to hear from everyone, but especially those in the  Higher Education Administration field. Thank you!",

      "text": "Absolutely take a gap year. I spent the time between undergrad and grad school working and traveling, which not only made me a better *human* but also really strengthened my application. My supervisors said they appreciated my work experience and I think I learned really important things about what the \u201creal world\u201d is like. It also allowed me to save up a small amount of money to cushion me while I\u2019m in grad school now. Absolutely no question, take some time. I even had a professor say he does not accept students who apply right away. It may be different for your field, but I\u2019ve never heard anyone say they regretted it.",
