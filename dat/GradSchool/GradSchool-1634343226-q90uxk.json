  "title:": "Common App Question about College Credits taken in High School",
  "text": "I took a few courses in high school from Syracuse and SUNY Albany that the school I graduated from accepted as credits. \n\nOn the common app, I have to list all the institutions I ever attended. Do I need to list that I attended Syracuse and upload a separate transcript for this even though the credits show up on my official transcript from the school I graduated from? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

      "text": "Think about what you're asking. \"On the common app, I have to list all the institutions I've ever attended. Do I have to list all the institutions I've ever attended?\"\n\nYes. You must list all institutions you've ever attended. Failure to do so counts as falsifying your application and will get it tossed out. There's a big database of everywhere you've gone to school (the National Student Cleaninghouse) that they'll run your name through. You need to be fully honest and upload transcripts from SU and SUNY Albany.",
