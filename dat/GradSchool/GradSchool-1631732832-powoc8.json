  "text": "How, if at all possible, were you able to estimate the amount, if any of your graduate financial aid? I am looking into master\u2019s programs and am trying to estimate if it will be financially feasible at this point in time.  Luckily my employer is willing to give a couple grand for me to further education, which I am grateful for, and is helpful. However, I need to look at all my options. I will be going scholarship hunting aswell soon enough.",
