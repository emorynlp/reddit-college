  "text": "My first post on here was asking advice about what to do if my toxic former PI showed up to my defence. I got excellent advice and reassurance gram several of you, and appreciate it greatly\u2014really put my mind at ease!\n\nAs a few of you noted, other faculty were TOTALLY aware of their behaviour and ready to shield me if need be. But former PI showed up and, instead of being petty, I think actually realised they were wrong that I was incapable. They asked a softball question and congratulated me. \n\nI ran into them a couple of weeks later at a conference and they were very friendly. Introduced me to some great contacts as a \u2018very impressive\u2019 researcher and later apologised for doubting me. Happy ending!",
