  "text": "I feel like at the start of a semester, we feel motivated as fuck and excited for new classes (especially if its a first semester).\n\nThe work is a challenge to get through and understand and its exciting. You are learning brand new concepts you never thought about. Or you are realising that you dind\u2019t know topics as well as you thought you did.  \n\n\nBut as you go deeper into a semester, the fatigue and stress catches up to you and now all that you want to do is find a way to graduate and a get a decent grade.  \n\n\nis that just me? Cause that\u2019s how I feel right now",

      "text": "It might be different for Masters students and between disciplines, but as a Physics PhD student the classes after the first year seem more like an annoyance that we have to do to check off boxes. They\u2019re taught by theorists and have little application to my experimental research. I spend most of class writing Matlab scripts or working on presentations for conferences.",

Hits around midterms and just gets worse from there and the more shit that's due the less motivation you have to do anything.",

I think it\u2019s normal. \n\nIm sure for most of those in their PhD, the defense is that \u201cend of the semester\u201d. By the time they defend, they are often burnt out",
