I'm don't think suddenly erasing existing student debt would fix systemic issues, but the very least they could do is dramatically reduce interest on education loans, and allow people to pay them when they're financially able to.\n\nMy partner in the UK has \\~20-30k in student debt from undergrad and grad school, but he only started paying it when he got a decent full-time job. There's a minimum income threshold, and I think the interest rate is quite low (at least lower than the predatory 8%)",

I was really interested in diplomatic history of the 20th century for instance, but most of the professors in the tiny history department were specialists in ancient or medieval history. Like there just wasn\u2019t the bandwidth to support my interests.\n\nBeyond that, I think a factor of it being open enrollment perhaps, expectations were just really low a lot of the time. Like if you glanced at the readings before class, that was good for an A pretty much.\n\nLastly, the advising was terrible. My advisor never asked me what I wanted to do after graduation, so they didn\u2019t help me plan for it. Every time I met with them it just felt like they were trying to rush me out the door. I met with career services to discuss grad school and how to make my application stronger and they pretty much said \u201cwow, good luck with that!\u201d Like it was beyond useless. \n\nNow my new classmates are all familiar with most of the major scholars in the field, most of whom I haven\u2019t heard of. And to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that private schools > than public schools. My classmates from better state schools (Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin, UCs, etc.) are in good shape too.\n\nI think the discrepancy is more between traditionally prestigious/expensive schools and not. And by private schools I\u2019m not referencing like small liberal arts colleges, I mean like Stanford, Princeton, or LSE.\n\nAll that said, my not prestigious undergrad school was good in a lot of ways and I loved my time there.

There's also no way of knowing if the program will even still exist in 10 years.\n\nYou may know all this and have met with a financial advisor or something to plan for this, but just want put this out there for anyone who's thinking they should go borrow $100k to work in nonprofit because they'll never have to worry about it. You should assume you won't be approved and plan repayment accordingly.

For master's, this is my experience:\n\nAs far as I know, if you're doing a Ph.D.,  the university will pay for it. For master's, this is my experience:h professors I'd be interested in doing research with, and got a funded research position. Now, my tuition is paid for and I get a stipend that works out to about $2100 per month. As far as I know, funding isn't something you should count on/expect as a master's student, it really depends on your major, university, and luck.\n\nYou probably know this so feel free to ignore, but: carefully plan your risk tolerance before going into grad school. I came out of undergrad with $20k in loans, and having a masters in my field increased the average salary for graduates from my school by $28k. With these in mind, I was prepared to pay for grad school with loans if I needed to, though I'd do whatever I could to get a funded position. Consider the employment rate for whatever field you're going into, what the average salary is, the average effect of a masters on employment rate/salary.\n\nAlso, graduate student loans are a serious problem in the US. Not saying you should or shouldn't be comfortable with loans because I don't know your situation, but don't go in figuring that it's worth however much it costs.\n\nAll that being said, grad plus loans are considered 'good debt' because the interest rate is usually fixed, and the interest rate is lower than the average performance of the stock market. All private loans are predatory, the loan companies exist to squeeze money out of you.\n\n\"Brookings estimates that while just 25% of student loan borrowers went to graduate school, these students hold about half of all outstanding student debt.\"\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/graduate-students-owe-around-50percent-of-all-student-debt.html#:\\~:text=U.S.%20student%20debt%20has%20increased,of%20all%20outstanding%20student%20debt.",

              "text": "Not a typo at all. \n\nCame from a poor farming family. My brother and I are both smart individuals, so we left our farm town behind for better things. \n\nI had a self-inflicted 5 year hiatus from my undergrad degree, but still had do 100% financial aid. My parents have paid not a single penny towards my education. \n\nAfter finishing my undergrad degree (Communication Studies), I struggled for several years barely making 40k/year. Couldn't afford to live on my own and pay student loans, so I deferred. \n\nDecided to get my MBA and as I stated earlier, couldn't afford to pay for that out of pocket, so I ended up taking another 25-30k out. \n\nWithin a few weeks of graduating I left my 38k job for a 54k position. Left that one for an 80k position less than a year later. Another 9 months I left that contract position for another for 92k. They hired me on as a FTE in June for 107k. \n\nSimultaneously, we sold my wife's house and got 165k of net proceeds. Bought a house together, paid off both vehicles and all our CC debt. \n\nWe should be able to have our student loans (~100k collectively) paid off soon. \n\nYes, it's an indictment on the cost of college. When I fist started at my small school in 2004, it probably cost, at most, 10k/year. Tuition was $1,800/semester. \n\nWhen I came back in 2010, the cost was 15k/year and tuition went from $2,600/semester to $3200/semester the 2.5 years I was there. Now, it costs nearly $24k/year to attend my small school and it's still considered a bargain price. \n\nThat's what happens when the government allows a publicly-funded institution to charge its citizens outrageous prices for attendance only for the citizens to turn to start and government-funded aid to pay for it. \n\nSo what happens? \n\nStudents take out private and government-backed loans to pay for college. This money mostly pays for tuition, cost of books, housing, and food as well as the amenities the college offers (tutors, advisors, gym, health/wellness, career advisement, etc). Based on subsidization, interest accrues. 4 years of it. Now you graduate and have 95k of student debt to pay with starting salaries under 60k with the cost of living continuously raising. \n\nI'm lucky and consider myself blessed to have been able to turn my financial situation around. \n\nRead the book \"Branded Nation\".",

I'm okay with making barely enough money to scrape by while I pursue a topic that I think is important, but going into debt for it would not be financially sound.",

Because of covid, our government ramped up the grant portion/decreased the loan portion of financial assistance until 2023. I have a permanent disability (ADHD) and so I get even more automatic grant funding. I got $9k this semester, around 3 of it was in loans and the rest grants. I should get around that amount each semester. I do have nearly $50k in student loans from undergrad though, but I worked during my degree and saved $30k\u2026 so I guess it\u2019s kind of more like $20k in loans.",
