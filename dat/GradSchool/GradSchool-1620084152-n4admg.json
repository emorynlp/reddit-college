  "text": "Before you deem me a piece of garbage, I know it is bad to feel this way.  I should be ambitious and excited to study but I'm not.  I want to spend time with my friends and boyfriend all day every day and have literal depression at the thought of sitting and studying and going to class.  I don't know or expect if anyone has ever felt like this while in school.  I am barely scathing by with my grades ( you need a 3.0 to be considered in good academic standing) but have already completed 2/5 quarters (in my 3rd currently) I have every intention of finishing the degree but how do I pull myself out of this pity party? i think it makes it harder because my friends are all working 9-5 jobs and have that routine but I have all these classes in the weeknights (zoom of course because of covid, thats a whole other annoyance) and my boyfriend just finished med school so he has had a the last few months to solely chill and travel and I just get swept up in his free time as well. I know this is such a chaotic question and explanation but any advice on how to get excited about school and really force myself to commit to doing well.  I'm 25 and live at home so you would think that would be enough motivation to hurry up and do well and get a job but clearly it isnt.",

      "text": "> I'm 25 and live at home so you would think that would be enough motivation to hurry up and do well and get a job but clearly it isnt.\n\nFor me living at home had the opposite effect. You're not forced to do things on your own, and it can make you more lazy. There's a vicious cycle where not doing much makes you lethargic, which prevents you from doing stuff etc.\n\nI was in a similar situation actually, had one year+ where I didn't study at all basically. Staying at home makes it way harder, I guess all libraries are closed now, but going somewhere else other than your room to study can help a lot. For me, what happened was that at some point I just decided to stop being useless and just did all the work plus made up for the missed work, I don't know exactly how I got over that mental barrier, but once I actually started studying hard it was easy to continue. One thing which I think helped, and will probably sound silly, was to take cold showers. I did this cold shower challenge where you take a five minute _cold_ shower every day for 30 days (not a bit cold, not cold half the time, full cold the entire time). I kept it up for about a year actually. Anyway, it's surprisingly difficult to step into a cold shower, and it was similar to how I just couldn't start studying. At the same time, it's just a five minute thing, it's nothing, there's no reason (aside from heart problems) why you couldn't do it. Forcing myself to overcome that every day I think made me better at overcoming these mental barriers.",

      "text": "Okay so your post is a mood. I should practice what I preach, but here are some cool things I've learned: \n\n\\-Boundaries. Don't *ever* work past a certain point in the day. Be that 7pm, 10pm, whatever works for your biological clock. Give yourself a marker for the end of the day. Like -- drink a hot chocolate or something -- idk -- at the end of every work day to have like a transition from one mode to another. There are other kinds of boundaries (intellectual, physical, emotional) but this time-flavored boundary seems extra important to me. \n\n\\-Fill up your cups (as my therapist says). You might have a \"family\" cup, a \"spiritual\" cup, a \"hobby\" cup (it's turtles all the way down: physical activity cup, socialization cup, etc etc). Take time to fill up those cups and also whenever you take time to do those things, make sure you're actually doing those things (if you call your family and talking to your family is exhausting, then you haven't actually filled that cup).\n\n\\-Study buddy // accountability partner. Reach out to other students in your cohort/program and/or to your advisor/mentor/whoever. If there isn't any sort of writing or reading group then see if you can start one. I'm a total disaster and this helped *even me* (yes, me!). So. Yea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm projecting pretty hard core onto you in this reply lol. These are all things I need to work on also. But your post is relatable, for better or for worse. I hope things get better soon. Just remember that the semester is about to end and then you can breathe for a little bit!",

This happens to a LOT of graduate students and it does not have to last forever. \n\nAs soon as it is reasonable, you need to take at least a week completely off of your subject. No study, no scrolling, no articles. Nothing. \n\nCompletely distance yourself from academic work and relax. Fill those days off with hobbies you used to enjoy, a hobby you\u2019ve always wanted to try, or any activity that will make you feel good. \n\nOne thing that helped me get back on track is to make a schedule for my time off. Set a wake up and bed time, make a plan for each day and try to stick to your schedule of fun stuff. Then transitioning back to school work, try to continue to apply that skill of sticking to schedule. \n\nSitting down and studying is only part of grad school.

If everyone liked working this hard then we wouldn\u2019t have burn out, we\u2019d also have more people going to grad school, and we sure as shit wouldn\u2019t have a majority of grad school students wanting out halfway through.\n\nI\u2019ve never met someone \u201cexcited to study\u201d, and you probably are ambitious otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even be trying. I\u2019d rather be walking around in a park or setting up new terrariums for my bugs or literally a thousand things rather than study. But we do- because we have to.\n\nI\u2019m also not a fan of the culture that says you have to work 80 hours a week to feel good about yourself- I have friends who have to constantly brag about it and it\u2019s like wow that\u2019s so nice that you\u2019re enjoying a toxic working culture that\u2019s destroying your life. \n\nI like my free time, I am currently getting some right now for a few weeks and my god, the burnout is fucking real. The best you can do is find a job with good hours that you don\u2019t hate and that has good benefits so that you can enjoy whatever free time you can wrangle up. Careers are meant to fund your life, so that you can afford to do the things you want to do, and for some of us it\u2019s a bonus that we actually find the work enjoyable and meaningful. But grad school is a totally different and more intensive environment than the actual workplace. Just don\u2019t expect yourself to love every minute of it- you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll likely have some days where you love it in between a lot of really mundane tolerable days when you\u2019re actually working.\n\nBut like others have said, look into ADHD. My husband has it and he was really having a hard time studying when he could do other things he liked that were stimulating. After medication he was able to focus and the urge to have fun instead was manageable.",

But when I was screened for it, they diagnosed me with anxiety and depression (which I already knew, I\u2019d been medicated for anxiety for years), but not ADHD. I was so confused and frustrated. My therapist told me that the method used to diagnose ADHD basically requires that anything else that could be causing the symptoms can be ruled out, such as anxiety or depression. Since those couldn\u2019t be ruled out for me, they couldn\u2019t diagnose with ADHD. So I\u2019ve tried to accept the fact that all of my ADHD symptoms are probably just anxiety presenting very close to ADHD. Or, I have ADHD, it\u2019s just \u201chiding\u201d under my anxiety and depression, making it hard to get diagnosed.\n\nI was actually put on adderall for hypersomnia. I fucking hated that shit. I was up all night and all day and i was miserable. I took it for maybe 6 weeks. So that makes me think that maybe I don\u2019t have ADHD since I didn\u2019t respond to it like others seem to. (The hypersomnia actually ended up being due to my anxiety medicine. I got off of it and onto a new one that is supposed to help with ADHD symptoms too, since it effects dopamine instead of serotonin like the first one, and I think it\u2019s nice. Not life-changing though, not yet anyway.) So that\u2019s been my experience so far, if that\u2019s any help. I\u2019m graduating with my bachelors in two weeks and start a grad program in the fall. I want to get myself in check because I\u2019ll be in a lot of trouble in grad school if I carry some of these bad habits over. \u201cBad habits\u201d isn\u2019t really fair to myself because my brain chemistry isn\u2019t my fault, but you know what I mean.

With adderall, they mix it 1/4 amphetamine and 3/4 dextro. Leaving out the amphetamine might be helpful if you ever went back on it. Obviously don't use any if you're taking an SSRI or other antidepressants. I'm not a doctor, just had similar issues with adderall because it exacerbates IBS and I'm really sensitive to stimulants.",

We are under a ton of latent stress every day, and everyone is finding themselves closer to their limit than usual. Executive function fatigue is a real consequence of this and you are not alone in feeling it. Grad school is the type of environment that brings people close to their limit in the first place! Managing grad school in this environment is a massive feat, and if you're able to manage well enough just to pass that is a lot. Go easy on yourself, take breaks whenever you need them, and be open with your supervisor about how you're doing because they can help figure out deadlines and game plans with you.",

Now that I know what life outside of school is like, I don\u2019t feel like I EVER recovered the same motivation I once had. I made it through the first year in what feels like a motivationless state. I honestly just don\u2019t gaf and I think I\u2019d be happy if I never had to read an article in my field again.

What does this mean? well in a few words it means that everything that's mentally taxing for neurotypicals is 10x more difficult for an ADHD brain. \n\nI mean it could be something completely different for you, but I'm just throwing that out there because it never even occurred to me that all these bad habits I've had for 28 years, and that made me hate myself, were actually symptoms of a mental disorder that hinders your daily functioning (including motivation). It was quite the epiphany realizing that my life could've been less miserable if I had been diagnosed earlier and had gotten the appropriate treatment. \n\nGood luck figuring it out!",

A lot of people (especially women) flew under the radar as kids because they quickly learned to mask their ADHD behaviors or their behaviors just didn't look like ADHD because most people were familiar with hyperactive little boys as the model of ADHD.\n\nOften doctors ask for report cards for evidence in childhood, and it often isn't there. You may have procrastinated on every assignment ever, but somehow managed to get it done at 2 am or during the study hall before class, so your grades never suffered. Teachers didn't write about any concerns they may have had because you were quiet and well-behaved. Nobody could tell you were daydreaming instead of listening in class because you made sure to look in the direction of the teacher. \n\nEven with the hyperactive and combined subtypes, there are things that you might not even recognize as ADHD symptoms. One symptom is an inability to sit still/fidgeting. You may think, \"no, I don't fidget.\" Meanwhile, you twirl your hair, chew on pens, tap your fingers, etc.\n\nSo yeah. When considering your childhood and even things you do now, it's not always clear what's an ADHD symptom, and symptoms you had at a very young age may have appeared to resolve when really you developed coping mechanisms.",

              "text": "I only recently was diagnosed with ADHD. It took me 10 years to get a bachelor's and it was a complete shit show. I got into a master's program and actually did quite well, then went on to my PhD. Things got a bit rocky here and there and I missed a lot of good opportunities because I didn't follow through on things, but I was able to push forward. It wasn't until I finished my coursework and started working from home that I hit a wall due to lack of structure and endless distraction. \n\n I legit thought that I wasn't going to be able to finish my research because I couldn't do anything school related except the bare minimum for my teaching assistantship. Like I would sleep until 11 am because I couldn't fall asleep until 3 am, I would feel like death getting up, and then spend hours scrolling on my phone trying to summon the willpower to do literally anything, but I couldn't. Then at like 3 pm I'd manage to do something, but it was so hard to focus. Sometimes I'd just declare the day a waste and binge watch Netflix. \n\nWhen I read an article about ADHD in women, my whole life made perfect sense. I got a formal diagnosis and started treatment - I went with a non-stimulant, wellbutrin. It really did change my life. It obviously didn't solve all of my problems, but I had motivation again, I could get out of bed in the morning, I could fall asleep at a normal hour, I actually had *energy*! I cut back on buying random shit and getting take out all of the time because I couldn't bring myself to cook. My apartment actually looks clean now. \n\nI'm also back on track with my research. I have to defend in the summer instead of spring, but that's OK. After I started meds, I finished a paper I had been working on for 8 months. I'm working on a second and I finished data collection for the third.",

I've been chronically *declaring my day a waste* for a month or so! I wonder if declaring a whole day a waste after being demoralized by ADHD symptoms is a tendency among people like us?\n\nI'm happy that wellbutrin has helped you with ADHD! My doctor prescribed it to me for depression and ADHD, and it did help with the depression, but not with ADHD. Even Adderall is not working for me. I'm seeing my doctor on Friday to look for alternatives.",

                      "text": "I've been there with chronic waste days. There was a really low point where I basically did nothing for like 2 months. For my assistantship, I do a lot of admin stuff that doesn't really take too long and my supervisor loads tasks into Asana for me. Basically, I'd get an email saying something was due that day, I'd go into a panic, do the thing as fast as possible, then retreat back to Netflix. I didn't even bother getting out of pajamas. The only time I wore real clothes was to get groceries.\n\nBut yeah, I do think declaring the day a waste is common with ADHD. Especially if there are lots of potential things to do - your brain just kind of shuts down from being overwhelmed and at some point you realize you've wasted too much of the day, so just write off the day. \n\nDefinitely keep trying different meds! I've heard that Ritalin often works well if adderall doesn't (or vice versa). Also SR vs XR can make a difference, too!",

              "text": "Not OP, but I was diagnosed in grad school. I had a few missteps in my diagnosis along the way, and was initially put on SSRIs that were more detrimental than anything. When I finally tried stimulants, it was amazing. I wanted to do tasks. I wanted to work. Suddenly I could think things through without feeling like I had to wade through a disco party of cats to connect two thoughts together. The potency of the effect of stimulants has waned for me over time, but I still find them helpful from time to time in my post-grad life, especially during pandemic times.\n\nI was a relatively successful student, which is why I  went undiagnosed for so long, but I had an intrinsic sense that I was different than my peers in how we approached studying and test-taking; it was like they knew some secret I didn't. I self-managed my ADHD up until that point by manufacturing crises after crises; the anxiety was my stimulant, the rush of finishing something at the last minute my reward. I still struggle with these behavior patterns all these years later, but it helps to recognize them and I have a better toolbox now than I did then. It still takes me longer to do things than other people, but the difference isn't nearly as large as it used to be. \n\nGood luck!",

If you need medication, there are people who can help you. At least set up an appointment and see what your options are. Your suffering is bigger than trying not to be stigmatized.

If you\u2019re still really not feeling it after those 10 minutes then take a break. A lot of times when I make myself start something I\u2019m dreading, it ends up not being so bad and I just keep going. Other piece of advice would be to make a to do list breaking up everything into small tasks so you can cross them off and celebrate each little accomplishment. \n\nGood luck!",
