  "text": "With variants running rampant in my state, and new data about one of my conditions being more of a risk factor than we thought, I am really worried about working in person. I asked my PI if we could work to accommodate that and was pretty much told \"no, you need to be in lab and interact with everyone\" when I am worried about becoming further disabled or getting severely sick. I'm reaching out to people who might be able to help me, but I'm willing to quit over the lack of care for my health and safety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else made it to this point because of Covid? Have any of y'all actually quit grad school over it?",

Unlike OP, I\u2019m lucky that the situation at my institution/in my research group is pretty Covid safe at the moment. But, I just had a professor suggest I apply to attend an in-person conference that seems less safe (in the South, for starters..) Is it ok to say I don\u2019t feel comfortable traveling yet?",

Even if it were feasible to renew my visa and continue on to my doctorate, family concerns forced me back to the States anyway. The way I see it, I can resume grad school any time I want, best to wait until this god-forsaken pandemic has come to an end. \nYour concerns are legitimate and don't let anyone try to convince you otherwise.",

To be honest, I was extremely afraid when the delta variant started running rampant but everyone in my lab diligently wears a mask, is vaccinated, takes the pandemic seriously and everyone respects social distancing as much as possible. I also reached out to my graduate advisor (I'm a 2nd year) who genuinely listened to my fears and allowed me to take only research hours this semester instead of classes so I have been considerably less anxious. I also now solely wear KN95's indoors from a refutable source.\n\nI think if your PI could enforce masks in the lab that'll make you feel a bit better. Could you reopen that conversation with them and see what they can do to help?\n\n\\*Edit: I forgot to answer your question smh. I definitely debated quitting during the summer but thankfully my PI and graduate advisor are very likeminded and really care about making me feel comfortable. So I feel safe enough to continue.",

I am so upset that I need to spend so much time and energy fighting for my own safety when I could be doing my actual work instead.",

First off, I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re having to through this - grad school is hard enough without dealing with an ongoing pandemic.\n\nCan you go in at a different time? Or work in different areas so you\u2019re not close to them? I know it\u2019s inconvenient for you, but it may help temporarily. One thing I will say is that there have been recent studies showing breakthrough infections shed less virus and are less transmissible. Successful mask usage will definitely prevent this as well, especially if they continue to wear them and you maintain distance. I hope that gives you some comfort in between all of this.",
