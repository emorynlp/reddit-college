  "text": "Hi,\n\nI've been thinking about entering graduate school to focus on economics and finance. However, many programs require one to have a minimum experience with economics such as having majored in econ or at least have taken intermediate micro/macroeconomic analysis. However, I went to engineering school for undergrad so I don't have any econ coursework. I do have coursework in intermediate mathematics (linear algebra, statistics, etc.). \n\nWhat would be the best way to get the requirements for entering into a graduate economics program?\n\nThanks :)",

      "text": "You just need to take intermediate micro and macro and show your commitment to econ. You can do this by taking undergraduate courses at a community college or by registering as a non-degree seeking student at a local university. If you can't take undergraduate courses then you can see if you can take MBA or public health courses in econ. Most non-econ masters programs require some econ type courses that are generally just a topic specific version of the undergrad courses. \n\nAlso if you are just considering a masters then you might be able to have an arrangement with the school to take the courses in the semester prior to masters classes starting.",
