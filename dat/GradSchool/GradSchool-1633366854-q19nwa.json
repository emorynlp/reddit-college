  "text": "In two weeks I have an interview with my dream school for a PhD position. I have a project in mind and I have been reading a lot of my potential advisors published papers. I never did an interview for my Master's (I was just hired on the spot) so I am not sure if it is different from any other job interview. Do y'all have any recommendations or tips to help with the interview?",
