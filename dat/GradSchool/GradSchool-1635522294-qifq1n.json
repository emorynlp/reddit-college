  "text": "I keep freaking failing my immunology exams and I try so hard. I just can\u2019t get it to stick to my head and now I\u2019m freaking failing the class because we only get graded from the tests. How did I even get into this program? I feel so dumb and stupid. The class average is great and the professor even sent out an email saying that if he removed one grade then the average is even better. I\u2019m the one test grade because the testing program we use gives you your score right away. \n\nI just feel so dumb and like I shouldn\u2019t have been accepted to this program. I feel like my spot in the program is being wasted on me.",
