I do have a lot of deadlines but I have had significant health problems in the two last years and a half which make it difficult for me to plan ahead what I can actually accomplish. Some days I'm just very sick and I can't work, so it's increasingly frustrating. At the same time, illness has taught me to be more gentle with myself and I'm more accepting of the fact that I'm not productive all the time despite good motivation and desire to work hard. I do have research scholarships so that definitely alleviates the feeling of wanting to finish my studies quickly.",
