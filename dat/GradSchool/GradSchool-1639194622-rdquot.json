      "text": "I don't think so. My undergrad GPA was like 3.2 or 3.1, and I still got into my top school choice and got accepted into a GA position.\n\nKeep up your good grades, but try to do some volunteer or extracurricular activities and have awesome references. I think many schools look at things like that.",

      "text": "3.5 is great for a first semester. You have 11 semesters to go so as long as you stay focused, you\u2019ll be fine. As far as getting into grad school, I got into my masters degree 1 year program with a 3.6 gpa and references. I was commuter student so I didn\u2019t do anything besides work and go to school.\n\nIf you add extracurriculars, I believe that will allow you to stand out. When top schools see that you have a high gpa (3.5 overall or higher), great references and you participate in school, that will stick you out among the rest. Best of luck!!\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "text": "As others have said; 3.5 is not bad and you still have plenty of time to increase it. In my field at least (physics) having research experience as an undergrad helps A LOT when applying to grad programs. So sometime in your undergrad career you should do 'independent study' (or whatever the equivalent is at your university) and/or apply to summer internship programs. And cultivate relationships with your profs as recommendation letters are required for most grad programs; this can be done through your research or by just being a good student and showing interest in your field (attend office hours, attend talks by visiting profs/researchers, get your face out there so when u need a letter the prof knows who you are and knows you're committed) Those things will help you stand out from others during the grad admissions process.",
