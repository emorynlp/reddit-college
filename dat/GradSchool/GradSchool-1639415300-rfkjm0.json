  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI have my first interview tomorrow, and I'm excited and also nervous. I've seen enough horror stories on here, and am hoping to avoid the types of situations that some people find themselves in. What are some questions I can ask to help spot red flags or issues that may need clarification? Maybe some red flags to spot from the get go\n\nThank you :)",

      "text": "Ask students in labs you're interested what they don't like about the lab. Ask what the advising style is like and the lab culture (is everyone expected to come in 9-5? Do people come in on weekends and stay late at night? or do people come in and go whenever). Is the advisor hands on? How available are they for meetings? Do they tell you what to do all the time or never give any guidance/feedback (or in the middle)? Also note that people won't directly say the negative things about a lab so you'll have to infer sometimes.",

I talked to one person, got some vague answers about it being a good, productive, interesting lab, and called it good. I am now in that lab and while it's definitely been productive and interesting so far, it's also come with way more challenges than I expected.\n\n Talk to more than one lab member, ask more than a couple questions. They might be a bit hard to get a hold of (they're busy!), but keep asking - don't get discouraged if it takes awhile for them to respond. Ask specifically about work hours/average time spent in lab, how PI meetings generally go, how the lab hierarchy/structure is set up. The more info the better!",

Find out if there's any beef between faculty, shady stuff from the administration, exploitative policies, etc. \n\nEvery program has some kind of bullshit going on. I'd be a little skeptical if everyone's telling you that everything is great and perfect. If you're dead set on grad school, knowing this stuff might not dissuade you (and it shouldn't, necessarily, depending on what your goals are) but it helps to walk into it with your eyes wide open.",

Mainly, they change a lot of dates last minute and we have to gallery sit a lot. The art program I'm in changes show dates all the time and they change the days and times of classes frequently too. They expect a lot of flexibility from us on this and it's pretty annoying.",

A good advisor will be honest about reimbursement (which often sucks anyway), supports presenting, and works to get students interacting with their extended network at conferences. \n\nStudents are honest about conference experiences, so if anything the advisor says doesn't agree with what the student says: red flag.",

For various reasons, current students may not tell you the whole truth or may not know information that was important to share. For example, current students often cannot comment on how helpful the advisor was in searching and applying for jobs. Former students can comment more fully on that. If they say no, consider why that might be. They may not have any former students to ask for one reason or another. However, they may be trying to hide a negative reputation that former students may comment on. \n\nIn grad school, there was a faculty member that was sexually harassing his students. However, no one at the university would talk about it (even though the vast majority of faculty and grad students were vaguely aware of it). When people talked to his former students, they would get a more accurate story. A little extreme but in general you can learn a lot about a potential advisor and program from people who already went through it.",
