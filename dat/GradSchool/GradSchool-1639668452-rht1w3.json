  "text": "so I just graduated college last week and now I have a bachelors in biology, yay woohoo go me. But I have no idea what to do next\ud83d\ude10. Now I\u2019m thinking about going to grad school partly because school is the most familiar option obviously, and partly because I\u2019m intrigued by expanding my knowledge/understanding of my favorite aspects of biology\u2014I really like genetics and microbiology and I could see myself working in a lab related to these disciplines. \n\nBUT, I don\u2019t know how to go about any of this. I\u2019m a first-gen college student so most things college-related I have to figure out on my own. All the advice I\u2019ve looked up on how to get into grad school is super extensive and ambitious because they\u2019re talking about getting into the top schools and programs, like yeah that\u2019s out the window bahahaha. I just want to know how to get into a regular grad school, for lack of better term?? Because my grades are mediocre and ended up with a 2.9 GPA bc I got a low C in my last class. I haven\u2019t taken any GREs and if I did, they probably wouldn\u2019t be outstanding. I\u2019ve had a little bit of research experience doing independent genetics lab work bc one of my professors reached out to me and offered the opportunity to me\u2014she had I had a \u201ccreative and insightful mind\u201d which I do believe I\u2019m smart and capable, but I\u2019m sooo bad with procrastination and executive function. \n\nPlease can someone with an average academic career let me know your experience with getting into an average grad school, if you did",

      "text": "The process of applying and getting accepted is similar for top programs and what you\u2019d call average grad schools. The top school will be more picky and expect greater achievements, but your application package will probably include recommendations, a personal statement, CV, transcripts, GREs, etc. regardless. I applied to programs across the rankings spectrum and submitted similar materials for MIT and WVU (to use just one example).\n\nUnfortunately, your GPA might disqualify you from many programs, unless you can find a faculty member to endorse your application.",

These are very common motivations for going to grad school, and they very often lead to disappointment. Grad school is not like your previous school experiences; it won't feel like additional undergrad years. What's more, a common (and correct) piece of advice is to go to grad school if an only if you have a specific goal that can only be achieved through grad school: gaining a particular competency or credential that's necessary for your desired career path, solving a specific research problem, etc.\n\n> I\u2019m sooo bad with procrastination and executive function\n\nThe most important thing you can do for yourself right now is to solve this problem *before* you decide whether to go to grad school. A search through the history of this subreddit will give you an idea of how terrible an experience grad school can be if you lack executive function. You will make yourself miserable. More important, though, is that you owe it to yourself to figure out this area of your life before you make commitments about your future. The you that has solved procrastination and executive function problems may be very different from the current you. Your whole energy and outlook on life will improve, and you'll be surprised at what you find yourself capable of doing. Work on that first, don't treat grad school as a way to delay having to fix yourself.",

          "text": "Thank you for the insight! I\u2019ve gotten a few responses telling me that I should only go if my desired career field requires it, which would definitely save me a lot of unneeded blood sweat and tears. I don\u2019t even have a specific job in mind, for some reason I just assumed grad school would be an easier segue into finding/obtaining a research type job. Most of what I hear about grad school is dissertations and academic writing is my strongest asset so I was like \u201cyeah I could do that\u201d lmfao\u2014I think I\u2019m looking at postgrad education through a really narrow lens. You make a lot of great points. I think I\u2019ll just job search for now and see how that works out\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

              "text": "I like making spreadsheets of this sort of info. Some of the info you might want to gather (so a column for each of the following, and each school is a row) includes: school name, department name, application website, general GRE required?, subject GRE required?, cost of application fee, link to apply for application fee waiver (if relevant), name of graduate program chair, name of a prof whose research you like, how many courses you will have to take, info about getting a teaching assistantship (TA), location (city/state/country), urban/suburban/rural. Aim to apply to between 3 and 10 grad programs, so you hopefully will have choices. \n\nTwo things to note that can be very field-specific: (1) in STEM fields, generally if you go for a PhD, you will be given a TA or RA position that will come with a tuition waiver. In some fields you can start for the PhD, and change your mind partway and leave with the Master\u2019s, thus getting a fully funded Master\u2019s, while if you\u2019d applied for the Master\u2019s only it would not have been funded.  In other fields, if you start for the PhD, they do not let you get a Master\u2019s, and this is to prevent abuse of the system by people who never wanted the PhD in the first place. \n\nAnd (2), in some fields it\u2019s expected that you have made contact with a professor and the professor wants to work with you *before* you even apply. I suspect biology may be one of these fields, but it\u2019s not my field so I am not sure. Hopefully someone else can tell you more about this. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that you can ask your undergrad profs for advice \u2014 I\u2019ve done so even years later since I\u2019ve stayed in touch with them and they remember me. \n\nBest of luck, and feel free to ask me more questions, here or DM. I just finished my physics PhD, so not bio, but still STEM.",

(Most people find it terribly frustrating.) You can also ask questions of people in various roles in the department to see how they fit in, how the got where they are and where they see themseleves in five years or so. \n\nFor someone with your academic record, the work experience is very valuable in a grad school application. So you would be strenghtening that case--should grad school be the next step, but you would also learn a lot of the tacit stuff you note that you are missing, and also make some money.",

Sometimes having a conversation with yourself about these sort of things and writing them down helps. And don't be afraid to get down into the weeds of it. How much money do you need to be happy/survive? When\n do you want to married/settle down? Do you enjoy helping people directly or indirectly? If you don't have a solid idea, make guesses, and you can always revise them or talk with a knowledge peer or mentor to see if your path is reasonable. I also find that watching YouTube videos on different career paths helps put things into perspective and actually let's me form the questions I didn't have words for previously.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nAlso from what I ascertain, lots of my peers are just in grad school because, but you should really think about what career(s) do you want? And does grad school require that? As a bio major, my guess is probably but who knows.",
