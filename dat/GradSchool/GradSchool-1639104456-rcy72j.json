  "text": "Hey everyone, so I got my BS in Aerospace Engineering from a top 10 school in that field, but it seems that I've proven myself incompetent (read: a fuckup lol). Graduated with a 2.94 overall, 2.6 major GPA. Was doing well enough in the program until about my second or third year, then just kinda spiraled down for a couple semesters. My last year I managed to make a jump back up, even made Dean's List my last semester. But the job search since then has sucked. Like really sucked.\n\nI want to apply for an MS in applied math. I'm also applying to programs in Aerospace Engineering and a couple other tangential disciplines, but I think I'd prefer math. As far as my profile goes:\n\nMath GPA: 3.37, 3.15 upper-division, but the sample size is small (calculus sequence, linear algebra and diff-eq).\n\nGRE General: 167 V, 167 Q, 5.5 AWA.\n\nLetters of rec: 3, but none are math professors. 1 was my capstone supervisor, 1 was my REU supervisor and 1 is a member of faculty who knows me really well from a non-STEM extracurricular.\n\nI realize I'm not the most compelling applicant, so is there something I can reasonably do to bump up my odds? I'd really prefer to start in Fall 2022, so I'd rather not spend extra time doing bridge courses unless it's absolutely necessary.",

      "text": "Your GPA has a high chance of causing them to bin your application but maybe you could squeak by if you say you will pay your own money. Even then it might be sketchy. GRE might offset it, normally work experience would also offset it(but you basically have none).",
