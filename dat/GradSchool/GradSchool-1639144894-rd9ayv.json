  "text": "I just finished my first semester of grad school. Prior to that I was working from home full time (occasionally going into the office but mainly wfh). I then transitioned into grad school primarily from home. We only met on campus 6 times throughout the semester. \n\nI am truly privileged and have no place to complain. I have a roof over my head, I am not food insecure, I'm going to grad school. I feel very fortunate to be in this place. \n\nThat being said, I'm really struggling with the isolation that has come with the state of the world that we are in. I live in a very red state and most people aren't wearing masks. My partner and I still don't feel comfortable going out really. I chat with friends consistently every day, but I'm rarely interacting in person with anyone aside from my partner and it is really starting to affect me. \n\nIs anyone else going through this or feeling like this? I don't know how to really combat it either. \n\nThanks.",

Actually hearing someone is wonders better than reading text at least for me.\n\n2) Try and hangout in-person like at someones house with a couple people who have a similar level of care regarding masking/going out.\n\nI definitely feel similar. A weekly DnD game(online) and ~monthly hangout with a couple friends is all that keeps me sane.",

If you like playing computer games or whatever, try discord. Even if you don't like playing games, having a bunch of friends on a party chat could help.\n\nMy friends and I play Warzone or Rust together a lot but during the height of the pandemic before we all had the jab, three or four of us would grab a beer and FaceTime for a little bit to get some \"face-to-face\" interaction.\n\nHope this helps and keep up the good work!",

      "text": "Im finishing a masters degree and worked full time during this whole covid time. Similar situation. I also found masters to be the worst as its really easy for professors to skirt interaction and throw textbooks at the class but you cant have anyone else to bounce ideas/study material off of.\n\nTo be honest I tried to set a routine and go out/interact with people. Even making small talk helped. Id go for walks, workout in my apartment as soon as I was up and made sure to eat right. I also put forth reaching out to friends/family to catch up. \n\nThe problem is grad school is already isolating. Adding a complete layer of seperation due covid makes things much worse. Its not you by any means. Academia is rife with putting people in a corner and watching them brake. To a lot of lazy profs and facuilty this whole time is a boon at the expense of students.\n\nDo what you can to interact with others. Take brakes between sessions. Try to reach out to your lab/team. All you can really do is your best. Yes it will be frustrating when you feel like youre in a box but eventually you will make headway.",

Now fortunately I'm \\*not\\* in a red state with those issues regarding masks and vaccines, \\*but\\* yeah...even when on campus these days I'm the only one actually on the floor in person doing research (my lab group does mostly computational research so everyone else is just remote working) and I got so isolated only interacting with my partner at home that I decided to get involved with intramural volleyball and basketball at the university just because it was \\*something\\* to get me interacting with people that grad students were allowed to participate in.\n\nGrad school is super isolating in general, and I've complained before that grad school has the problem of giving us research and teaching responsibilities like faculty, insecure financial stability and coursework responsibilities like a student, and the social life of neither.",

      "text": "I am in a similar situation but sometimes people stress me, so I don\u2019t mind spending some time alone for a while (but I am not a hermit lol), so the trick is to see this as a ***temporary situation***, only think from month to month or maybe from semester to semester - go out for walks or try some new things, plan occasional weekend getaways, etc. I like to focus on my work for a few weeks/months and then I like to take a short trip or go to a sports event. I think there are several ways to trick the brain, esp if you change the pace regularly, etc. Also, I try to plan major milestone highlights in advance (such as Xmas break, summer trips, heck I am already planning my 2024 Olympics trip to Paris - it\u2019s great to have sth to look forward). - You can use the pandemic as an excuse to invest in yourself (no current social responsibilities at all except for keeping somewhat in touch). The hectic lifestyle will be back soon enough.",

      "text": "ive felt like that all semester (1st year phd). i too now live in a red state and feel unsafe attending almost every extracurricular offered at my school because students don't need to wear masks and im high risk. i tried starting a discord for my cohort and only 2 ppl joined and i feel like i mostly post to the void. I have invited a few in my cohort to go to masked events or socially distanced things and they have not taken me up on the offers and always say next time. By November, I kind of just gave up on befriending people in my cohort. a person can only reach out so many times before its embarrassing. \n\ni'd say don't be afraid to reach out to people first by sharing your number/social media over email and invite them to do things they have expressed interest in before (EX: art, sports, coffee, t.v. show binge watching, etc.). If you have no success there, maybe it is time to look outside your department or cohort for friends. i've attended some smaller or masked events held by my school's graduate student organization, university services, and personal interest clubs that have small number of attendees and/or mask-up and it has been wildly more successful. still, takes time to make friends and feel less alone. hopefully there's online ways to get the support and friendship you need.",
