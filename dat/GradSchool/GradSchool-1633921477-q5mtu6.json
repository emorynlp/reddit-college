  "text": "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m over-thinking this but academia is not my area of expertise and I am afraid of saying something dumb.\n\nI\u2019m applying to grad school and asked an old professor for a letter of rec. I had to send him a follow up because he didn\u2019t reply to my first message, and when he replied he apologized as he is on his first sabbatical and just returned from a family vacation. In my response, would it be appropriate to congratulate him on his first sabbatical?",

      "text": "A sabbatical is not a vacation or it shouldn't be. A sabbatical is where a academic or scientist visits another lab or researcher in their area and does some research to broaden their perspective. As it's a paid period of time it is generally considered that the person on sabbatical will be learning skills to bring back to the job. \n\nTruly I would not congratulate a sabbatical.",
