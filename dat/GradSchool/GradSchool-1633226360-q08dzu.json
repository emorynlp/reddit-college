      "text": "I'm not in the MEMP program and I don't think I know anyone currently there, but I considering applying and have several MD and (non-MEMP) MD-PhD student friends in HST. I can confirm that the program is broadly very well supported by admin and quite orderly. You are formally affiliated with both universities, so you get the perks from both and don't have as many crazy hoops to jump through compared to students at one or the other when cross-registering. \n\nA major perk or downside, depending on your perspective, is the longer timeline because of medical courses you would be taking.",

So there aren\u2019t that many to choose from. The ones that are there are either super young, super senior in super groups, or drs. So not a great litter to pick from for what she was looking for.",
