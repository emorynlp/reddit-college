  "title:": "Is it possible to transfer/switch over from a Master's program to a PhD program in the same university?",
  "text": "I'm kind of sad I'm not applying for any PhD's right now, and instead only applying for Master's programs (because I have a very average GPA and not that many great recommenders), but yeah, I just wanted to know if anyone's changed their Master's into a PhD before, or if it's possible later at all? If you can switch over, would that mean that you'd only take about 3-ish years (+-1 year) after your masters to finish your entire degree? Or would you have to still apply separately for a PhD and then take a full 5-ish years to finish it, even if it's at the same institution?",

      "text": "Most of the time, it's very easy to \"upgrade\" from a master's to a PhD within the same program if you have a professor willing to work with you.  \n\nMy experience is in STEM so policies could be different for other programs.  But most if not all engineering/STEM majors it'll be pretty painless beyond some additional paperwork on your end.",

Thanks! \n\nSmall side question: how long after starting your Master's can you make the switch? And is it also possible to get funding for the later years in this case?",

              "text": "As long as you have a professor willing to work with you they'll get you figured out on making the switch (and mapping the paperwork/calendar road to get there).  So this is very dependent on your program and graduate school policies that it might be better to ask your department's administrative assistant on (aka your go-to department resource who's job it is to dot the i's and cross the t's for department <-> graduate school paperwork.  This individual is usually a point-of-contact for all faculty members for graduate student advising).  \n\nRegarding funding, this also depends on your advisor.  It's your advisor's best interest to make sure you're funded and successful in your endeavors in the program.  So I'd set up a meeting and chat with your advisor and see if they have any idea/advice/plan on your funding situation through graduation.  Maybe they'll refer you to another professor for your PhD or if they have funding available (or in the pipe) they'll be able to allocate it to you.  Or they might suggest you apply for grant funding through the NSF, NIH, or whatever popular funding source you have for your major.  \n\nIf your advisor is not helpful in this area, then you might have to do your own leg-work.  Either network with other professors and see if they have TA funding (professors usually find TAs for the next semester a month or so before the semester ends) or RA funding (if they already have projects).  Grant funding has it's own schedule that you should be aware of.  Each grant is different but I usually budget a lead time of 1 year (from submission to approval to funding).  \n\nBest of luck.  If you need additional help or more-refined guidance I'm open to PM.",
