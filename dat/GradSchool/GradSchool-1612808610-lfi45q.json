He let me know that I won't hear back about a decision until he gets word on a grant that he submitted. \n\nYour pi may be going through the same thing, so don't panic if some people in your department are getting acceptances and your not yet.",

If they say they \"might get\" funding ask what the key dates are for when they'll find out. Ask people in the year or two above you if anyone in their cohort rotated in this lab and then ask them directly if they were led to believe a position might become available, then not given the option to join. I hate seeing PIs do this to new students, and I hate that program directors don't do more to prevent it.",

If you already have a sense of where you're going to end up but want to learn a new skill or subject that the unfunded lab can give to you, then go for it. In some programs you're required to rotate in a certain number of labs regardless of whether you've already chosen one, and many students use the extra rotations to pick up new skills.",

The east bay guys finally got their grant awarded and invited me in \u2014 but by then I was fully committed to be a Silicon Valley farm school student.   I sometimes wonder how my career would have gone if the grant cycles worked the other way.\n\n(That was in the late Triassic but some things never change)",
