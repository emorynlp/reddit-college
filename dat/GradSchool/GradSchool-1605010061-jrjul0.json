I bet if you asked my colleagues here they'd say they think of me as one of the most knowledgeable mathematicians here. I've excelled in every respect as far as a teaching school faculty goes (administrative, scholarly, teaching). I still feel like an impostor. Probably because I am well aware of my failures and shortcomings. As long as you keep it well-regulated, it's natural to be aware of those, and can be a good way to keep yourself in check.",

I am (once I stop being distracted by the US election) going to be writing up ch. 2 soon.\n\nMy advisor thinks the chapters that will eventually be \"ch. 5\" and \"ch. 6\" don't require primary source data--or at least not as much as the other 4--so I can largely plan to consider those relatively \"easy\"/\"quick\" compared to the usual.\n\nSo, considering I have another 2 rounds of \\[data\\]->\\[writeup\\] left for substantive chapters, I'd say about another year. Factoring in that archives are closed, so I'm gonna have to be creative or just do chapters using interviews or something. Then adding in the two additional chapters, roughly gives me an extra 6 months, plus plenty of loose ends to tie up.\n\n\\---\n\nOr, by a DIFFERENT, SIMPLER metric: that's when my funding is up and they are gonna tell me to GTFO if I don't give them a nice tidy finished product, lmao.",
