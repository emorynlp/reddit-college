  "title:": "TW: Mental illness and applying to grad school",
  "text": "Hey y\u2019all. I know there are people with chronic illnesses and mental illnesses or a whole lot of other things going on who still managed to excel in undergrad and be very involved, but that wasn\u2019t the case for me unfortunately. I have a 3.35 GPA (might slightly increase after this semester), 5 semesters of research experience (I don\u2019t count the first 2 just because if we\u2019re being honest, they weren\u2019t quality), am volunteering as a crisis counselor, and had an interview for a clinical research coordinator position (that for once, I genuinely feel went well). I also completed a senior thesis, which was a really wonderful learning experience for me although frustrating at times. I graduate this December.\n\nIs there any hope of me getting into a competitive program? I\u2019m highly interested in clinical psychology, especially factors contributing to cultural differences in mental disorder symptomatology. I know mentioning mental illness is one of the kisses of death and I don\u2019t want pity points. It would just be great to know if there\u2019s a way to still reach my goals despite this bump. Feeling hopeless right now.",

      "text": "I did not mention my mental illness. I had a semester off due to psych hospitalization and a comparable GPA, with some shit grades in field-relevant (STEM) courses from my first two years. I had no research experience or relevant work experience, and I got in everywhere. Only difference may have been that the GRE was required for my applications, I had pretty good scores to offset my GPA. But ask your nicest professors for recs and put a ton of work/passion into your essays and I think you'll be good! You seem like a stronger applicant than I was",

      "text": "You\u2019ll be fine with personal statements and research! \n\nI\u2019m curious though why not mention your mental illness? It sound like it is inspiring you to go in a specific career direction. Which this actually makes you a strong candidate as you know what research is needed being part of that community. Mental health troubles especially during higher education isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of. If a program rejects you for that reason, would you even want to go there? \n\nI say be honest. Its not a pity party if mention the bigger issue. You\u2019re not alone in situations like this and speaking up about it helps disability and mental health become more normalized for the community who are applying to grad school. I had to bring it up for my applications!",
