It feels like punching a brick wall to get tiny little cracks appear.\n\nThe day that wall starts to give, you feel like god.  Don't give up.  Leave it all on the field.  Submit and know that you've done your best.  We just got a simulation in for a big pre-grant review last month. Had unpredictable errors twice.  Third time worked.  Ended it at 730 am.  Handed off the data at 8.  My FFRDC partner integrated it into the presentation and handed it off at 830.  Seriously, life is a game of inches.  You'll be amazed where those little tiny bits of progress get you.",
