  "title:": "Is it unethical to use the same lit review for two assignments?",
  "text": "I\u2019m taking two classes in different departments and the professors assigned a final on any topic of our choosing that furthers our research. I decided to write on the same topic from different disciplinary perspectives but the background on it is pretty much the same. The rest of the papers are completely different but I still feel like it might be unethical to use the same lit review for two assignments at the same time. I\u2019d be tweaking things to fit the discipline, but the information will basically be the same. Does this sound bad? I can\u2019t tell because it *feels so unethical* but I can\u2019t tell why exactly since it\u2019s not plagiarizing.",

That\u2019s going to be much of your career considering you are likely o be highly specialized and writing many papers on very similar research projects. You can write a similar paper with plagiarizing yourself, you just need to cite yourself too",

      "text": "If you still have time, you should talk to the profs about it. It, to me, sounds less like self-plagiarism and more like you having a narrow focus. You see the overlap and the potential value for using the lit review info in two different applications. \n\nI dont really think it sounds like plagiarism. \u201cI\u2019d be tweaking things to fit the discipline, but the information is basically the same,\u201d is way different from \u201cI\u2019m turning the same paper in for two courses because it works for both.\u201d There is also an ethical way to do this through self-citation. But since they aren\u2019t published, I\u2019m not sure how it would work. Your handbook should define plagiarism what makes plagiarism unethical is when it\u2019s intentionally deceptive. Claiming another\u2019s work as your own, or like I said\u2014turning the same paper in twice. \n\nI\u2019d email both profs with some version of:\n\u201cHi Dr. X-\nI have found that the way I am thinking about your project is very similar to how I am thinking about Dr. Y\u2019s. Although the disciplinary intervention is very similar, the background research is the same, so the lit review portions are going to be quite similar. I don\u2019t want to get into any ethically murky waters here, but if I pursue each of these projects alongside one another I can see how it would be helpful for a larger project in the future. It\u2019s a unique opportunity for me to investigate the topic through two different avenues. I\u2019ve reviewed the plagiarism policy and A,B,C seems to indicate this would be okay. The problem I\u2019m seeing is that if I had already published one I could self-cite, but because these are concurrent seminar papers that doesn\u2019t seem to work. Before I go further, I just wanted to get your sense of the plagiarism policy, and see what, if any, advice you might have for how to proceed.\u201d\n\nIf you do t have time for all that, I\u2019d go on with what I was doing and wait and see what happens. Plagiarism cases are reviewed and you\u2019d have an opportunity to explain all that first at the department level, and if they don\u2019t accept it then higher in the university. It\u2019s not a quick door slamming shut.",
