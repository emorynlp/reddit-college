  "title:": "Writing a formal research statement for a PhD",
  "text": "I just finished my masters about a month ago and have gotten in contact with a potential pi for my PhD. He said he's very interested in taking me on but because funding will be tight the first year, he wants me to write a formal research statement that could be used to apply to fellowships. I've got about a page done so far describing my past research and my broad interests but im a bit stuck now with regards to:\n- a lot of the examples I've seen have current research sections. How would I write this if I'm not currently doing anything? Would I write my current research section as if I was already in this new lab or should I just leave it out and do a bigger future research section?\n\n- how do I confidently come up with a project idea when it's a new organism im working on and how will I know if it aligns with his interests? For example I really like studying the regulation of cell death during development and this prof is interested in me cause of my comparative endocrinology experience do I \na) write what I'm thinking of for a project regardless of it it aligns completely with his interests and hope he'll help me adjust it\nB) write something I think he'll be interested in that kind of fits what I want to do but I'm not 100% sure is accurate or consistent with the literature because I'm not super familiar with the organisms\nC) come up with something that's 100% his field of interest that I'm pretty sure would be accurate but I don't have the background or interest in and hope those 2 things develop along the way\n\nSorry for the long post! I really appreciate any help I can get! I told him I'd have it to him by the beginning of this week but he told me it's okay if I took longer which is good because I completely misunderstood what a research statement entails",

      "text": "I've been in your situation, many a time (based on my own experience and friends) when they push this trick it usually means they don't want to invest in you. I wrote a research proposal that took me a month for a prof, we sent it for a scholarship and for rejected (my bad luck was that the scholarship was awarded to half amount of people as the year before). And when it did he wouldn't respond my mail anymore. I've got a fully funded position now but I wish I didn't waste those precious months on that PI and that proposal.",
