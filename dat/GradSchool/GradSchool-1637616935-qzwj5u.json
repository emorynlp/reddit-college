I have an hons. degree with a 2.2. \n\nWhen I\u2019ve asked my tutors if I have any chance of getting into a PhD, they say that the Masters dissertation and networking is the key.\n\nWhat are your reactions to this? Is the PhD possible?",

We have a student loan for PhDs now though so it\u2019s not impossible if you\u2019re willing to self fund.",
