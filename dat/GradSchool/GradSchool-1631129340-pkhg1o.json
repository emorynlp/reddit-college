  "text": "Title. I'm a grad student planning to apply for it again in my second year (first time was senior year of undergrad). Is it advisable to reach out to my past letter writers again for them to resubmit similar letters? I saw one of the letters my advisor submitted for me last time and it was written beautifully, but probably would not apply to my graduate career as much. Thanks all!",
