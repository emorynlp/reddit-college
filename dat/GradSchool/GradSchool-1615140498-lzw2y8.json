  "text": "I see a ton of posts about combatting burnout, dealing with imposter syndrome, and any other number of mental health worries that come with being a grad student. I live with the same issues, so I thought I\u2019d share what helps me cope.\n\nAnd that is: think of the type of person that you want to be.\n\nDo you want to be someone that works 16 hours a day, 7 days a week and has no close non-academic relationships? Or do you want to be someone that works hard and has fulfilling friendships and hobbies on the side?\n\nDo you want to be someone that can only talk about their area of study? Or do you want to have interesting conversations with people about a variety of topics? On that note, do you want to have diverse knowledge and experiences?\n\nThis sort of reasoning helps me when I feel like I don\u2019t have the time to take breaks. It reminds me that I want to be a well-rounded person and that I\u2019d rather work toward that than be the absolute best in my field.",

Also I've accepted it as a challenge and a self intrinsic motivation, towards the professional field where I can to be. But, the path hasn't been enjoyable, I have mental health because of my perseverance and remembering its a transition, my family, spirituality, hobbies, and my internal distance towards being the top student. \n\nI won't add to this, but (I'm clear..grad school is just a transitional path, I cant' romanticize it. Even when I have been lucky and blessed to find a few down-to-earth beings who are also there, but its just not real. I think its a scifi long episode)",

          "text": "I think this is the right sentiment. I think that most, if not all grad students come in understanding that this is more than just a job, but struggle with defining what that means for them.\n\nDoes that mean you\u2019re always working, putting in 60-70 hour weeks and reading even when you aren\u2019t working?\n\nDoes that mean you put in the amount of work/study commensurate with your pay? \n\nWill you work weekends? Nights? Holidays?\n\nWill you get involved with student groups? Student government?\n\nWill you have hobbies? \n\nDo you want to finish in 4 years or 7 years?\n\nYou can give any answer to ANY of these questions and be successful in grad school. For me, I\u2019ve probably given every answer to each of these questions throughout grad school at different stages in my career. I\u2019ve done the 70 hour weeks, the holiday grind, the late night timepoints. I\u2019ve given up hobbies due to lack of time or funds. I\u2019ve let my health slip in multiple ways. What I found in all of this was where my limits were. I know how many hours per week I can put in before the quality of my work starts to slip, I know how many things I can focus on simultaneously, and I know when my anxiety is getting the best of me and to step back. I know that my hobbies cost money and arent directly productive, but they satisfy that part of my brain and help me keep focus when I\u2019m working. \n\nIt\u2019s all been trial and error. Yes, grad school to me is about pushing yourself and getting a little bit uncomfortable at times, but it doesn\u2019t have to be an all out sprint, it\u2019s a controlled burn. \n\nWhat we need to be careful of is not getting too complacent. I\u2019m guilty of this as well, and I\u2019ve watched far too many grad students squander weeks or even months of productivity and unstructured time in the name of \u201cbalance\u201d. Guess what? Playing video games until 4AM on a weeknight and not coming into the lab until 1PM the following day isn\u2019t balance. That\u2019s immature and irresponsible, no matter how you try and frame it. Going out clubbing two nights a week, blacking out and spending the next day comatose in bed isn\u2019t balance, that was college and you\u2019re not 21 anymore. Likewise, running westerns until 4AM because you want to present the results at lab meeting is equally unbalanced. Find a groove, do what you\u2019re comfortable with, but don\u2019t be lazy. Get in and get out, they pay us too little to be complacent, it\u2019s not meant to be sustainable.",

I was reading a post on another subreddit earlier where someone asked if they should do full time work and full time school, and pretty much all the comments were \"it's totally manageable! I did it, I just gave up all my free time and exercise and relationships.\" I totally respect people choosing that if they want it, but it's shocking to me that it's just such a given and pretty casually normal to give all of that up during grad school. I wish it was seen as more okay to prioritize quality of life and preventing burnout and such as well!",

      "text": "On the other hand, if you *do* want to be the best in your field as a major motivation, don't feel bad about devoting more time to your research and reading, even if friends complain that you're busy. Don't let friends with 9-to-5 jobs guilt you into doing a lazy PhD. Your PhD is a very unique time for you to really focus in 100% into becoming the world expert in your very particular topic, and it's entirely fine to embrace it. Just, as OP said, do it under your terms to achieve your goals, and make sure your work is not motivated by the \"rat race\" parts. Long hours are not necessarily effective and rarely the most efficient, and although it's counterintuitive, taking some time to step back and disengage can help you be more productive overall by giving you fresh perspectives. But also make sure your rest times are under your terms (like if you prefer to take a typical weekend off, or strictly keep weeknights free, or take breaks by playing sports, or long vacations once or twice a year.... whatever works for you). Don't feel like any particular way of being \"well-rounded\" is best. \n\nI felt the need to comment since my preferred mode of working is to just go straight for 3-4 days (with sleep) then take 1-1.5 days completely off. So it's more \"weekend-style\" than taking nights off, and it took me a while to find this because people kept suggesting things I felt like I had to do to take care of myself that broke my stride/focus, like \"you MUST get up and walk for 10 minutes every hour\" and \"you MUST stop working at 6pm and go hang out with friends\" or \"you MUST take an hour before bed to meditate and unwind\" or \"if you don't eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the SAME TIME EVERY DAY you're doing something wrong\", and I'm sure all of that was suggested with good intentions but all of that was very distracting and felt like more of a chore than a helpful relaxation when I tried any of it. Ex: when it takes me 30 min to completely focus down to a problem, getting up every hour to stretch means I accomplish nothing in a full day, increasing stress and burnout.",

To echo your comment about eating three meals a day, half the time I only eat once per day because there\u2019s too much task-switching penalty to stop what I\u2019m doing.
