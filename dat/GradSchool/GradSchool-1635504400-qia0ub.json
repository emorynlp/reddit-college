  "text": "Title.\n\nI worked on this in 2019, spent considerable portion of my studies, and time, wrote large portion of the paper, including major corrections. It didn't pass then but was eventually accepted in a workshop this November.\n\nI was removed from the authors list, and now listed in acknowledgements. Nobody informed of this. The supervisor/professor even forwarded me the email where it was accepted.\n\nI mentioned it in my PhD interview today, and a citation was requested.\n\nOnly now I learned that I was removed.\n\nWhat the bloody fuck am I supposed to do at this point?\n\nEdit:\n\n>The main contributions of the work:\n\n>- First, 2 models, one of them is mine, my code, trained on my machine, half of the analysis is mine.\n-\tSecond, the framework they propose, I had written the code that performed the task\n-\tThird, the code is evaluated against real world models (read deployed models). I wrote the code that hit them. I didn\u2019t do the graph generation and \u2018analysis\u2019. Part of the analysis relies on my work writing a back end for local models that normalized everything and run the comparisons.\n-\tFourth, is implication of the transformations that I wrote and came up with.\n-\tFifth, Study against humans. Not mine.\n-\tSixth, Defense measures, not mine as far as I can recall.\n\n>\tArguments against state of the art wrt efficiency, and the explanation mostly mine. \n\n>\tI can't recall most of the text, but I am certain at least 30% is mine, either directly, or paraphrased.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThanks everyone for the help. I explained in a follow-up to my interviewers that I am \"acknowledged\" in that work, provided a camera-ready draft, and the citation.\n\nI prefer to not be considered an author of that paper. I have decided that I'd rather not get drugged through the mood. If they wish to be pigs, let them be pigs.\n\nI decided that I call out their paper as lacking, bogus, and dishonest. I have gone through the draft, and there were very few changes in the methodology, and analysis even after the previous reviewers tore it (and I agreed with them). That to me implies to me that nearly nothing changed between the revisions and the code, except perhaps polishing of the text.",

Most of my work was on the code part, figuring out solutions, and attacks against the models. Then I made corrections to the other author's writing, and wrote some part of the analysis.\n\n\n> The natural follow up question is: do you have reason to believe the lead faculty author on this paper knows that you wrote that part of the text (and did these parts of the work)?\n\nYes, we even had a meeting on 19th of August where we discussed future work. The submission was done in late July. By mid September I was informed that it was accepted. Nobody had informed me that I was revoked of authorship.\n\nI was going to work on the project for my undergraduate thesis but decided against it, and worked on it just that summer instead.\n\nBefore I applied to universities for an MSc, the professor told me to list the paper in my CV.",

And generally speaking, wide latitude is given to PIs to decide what they consider to be a contribution that's worthy of authorship on a research paper. So if the OP only had a research contribution, it would be complicated to determine whether an integrity violation occurred.\n\nOn the other hand, it is much less difficult to mistake the significance of a contribution when that contribution is actually writing the text of the paper: writing the text of a paper yourself _ipso facto_ makes you the author of that text.
