  "title:": "What PhD should I go for?",
  "text": "I hate to ask this, because everyone's PhD journey is different, based on their undergraduate degree, interests, fields, major etc. But I'm an aspiring teaching fellow, going to be a teacher for grades 7-12 in New York City public schools. As part of this adventure, I've also enrolled into their graduate level courses to obtain a master's degree at Fordham University, in their graduate school of education, for the class of 2024. I'm excited about this. I'm the second person in my immediate family to graduate with my bachelor's, and will be the first to graduate with my master's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLately, however, I've been obsessed with the idea of obtaining and working towards a PhD. Initially, I was looking at edD's but I realize those are shorter, almost 4 years, and not funded, while PhD's are. \n\n  \nI plan on going the master's route first, so I have extra credentials to apply, but I'll be 30 when I graduate from Fordham University and hopefully in a career opportunity, earning a salary at the Department of Education.   \n\n\nWould it be smart then to continue to work towards a PhD? Almost everything I've read stated that I'd have to leave my cushy job, and live on a reduced income. I'm also single and haven't gotten a girlfriend, so that would reduce my living as well as opportunities to make a family. However, I've fallen in love with academia, and feel if I don't do this now, I won't ever have the time to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also not a STEM major. My bachelor's is a communications degree, with a specialization in advertising and public relations, and my masters will be in education. Would it be smart to go for a PhD? if so, what field?",

      "text": "I think you need to do more research on what a PhD entails. The letters after your name can be enticing, but it\u2019s an entirely different ballgame than taking classes in an undergrad or master\u2019s course. In addition to loss of income, there\u2019s also significant emotional burden. It\u2019s extremely hard - they\u2019re very rare for a reason. The only reason to get one is tif you have a very specific career in mind that you can only do with a PhD, and are very curious about a specific field of study. They fact that you\u2019re asking what you should get a PhD in tells me that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into and are only interested in it for pride\u2019s sake. Seriously, just read through some of the top entries here and ask yourself again if it\u2019s worth doing on a whim.",

What you learn in your master's program will greatly influence whether or not or what PhD you would go for. \n\nYou'll also have the chance to discuss this with advisors after you've finished some graduate course work and they can tell you what might suit you best.",

      "text": "Don't do a PhD unless it is a requirement (or at least a huge benefit) to achieving your goals. From what you've said here, it appears it would add literally nothing to your hireability (it may even make you less likely to be hired because you would be more expensive than other teachers) and leave you with a ton of debt, a lot of opportunity cost loss, and all of the other nasty side-effects grad school tends to leave with people.  \n\n\nMake sure that the Master's is even a good idea for your goals first. It may be, it may not be.",

From what I've read, an edD is a professional degree, whereas the phD is a research degree. \n\nAlso, edD's are not funded, but PhD's are.   \n\n\nHow should I combat these two issues?",

              "text": "Well, do you want to work on the field or do research about it? They are both doctorates, one is focused on research and one is focused on practice. Typically if your doctorate is not funded then you work while completing it. Another option is to look for an employer that will pay for you to get another degree. This is often the case at academic institutions and some private sector employers.",
