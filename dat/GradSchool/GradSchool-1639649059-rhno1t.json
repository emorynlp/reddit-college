  "title:": "Is this pathway to a master's degree worthwhile?",
  "text": "I  recently graduated school with a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and have a full time job at a major defense company in the US. This has helped me pay down my student loans to where I'm financially comfortable, however I want to continue investing in myself and I don't want to settle down just yet.\n\nThe company has a standard program to sponsor engineers to earn relevant master's degrees on the conditions that it 1) doesn't interfere with full time hours and that 2) I have to stay for another two years of work  after the degree is complete. Condition 1 effectively limits me to  night-school or online classes, and is realistic only for a non-thesis masters (which I gather is still useful for industry jobs).\n\nThis is great but the idea of a 40-hour work week plus online courses at night sounds mind numbing, especially without any social aspect. Part of the appeal of a return to school for me would be an opportunity to get back in an evironment with peers in my field and meet more people around my age. Are those expectations fair in this case?\n\nWould you take that deal? Otherwise what would be some alternatives?",

      "text": "Attending industry conferences or earning certification programs are an alternative to masters and likely would be just as helpful when switching jobs. Additionally there would be less of a commitment for you to stay on longer to \"pay back\" the company. \n\nAlso graduate school is less social than undergrad. While you may meet more people your age you are not necessarily likely to be friends with them afterwards.",
