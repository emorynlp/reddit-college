  "text": "This is what my mom sent to me before she went to bed tonight.\n\n She's in the province so we're just relying on video calls and messages to update each other. However, because we have a lot of requirements for this semester, I've been very busy that I can no longer call as often as I did. I resorted to updating her by sending her photos of me studying, attending Zoom classes, and printing papers. \n\nThis semester may be tough for all of us but here's a reminder that our loved ones are proud of us. Their support will be of significance in helping us finish this! \n\nVirtual hugs!",
