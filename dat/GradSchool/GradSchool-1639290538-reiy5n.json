  "title:": "Already getting asked about my PhD dissertation project",
  "text": "I literally have not even finished my first semester of my PhD program and am already getting asked for what specific topic/project my dissertation is going to be on. I was doing a journal club, just presenting a paper, and the profs were all asking me, \"but how does this paper relate to your dissertation project? How does it affect your topic?\" Bssssssh, idfk!\n\nFor context, I was trying to finish a master's thesis this semester. My chair essentially dumped me, said the new direction I'm going in with my PhD doesn't fit with my thesis topic and he 1. Doesn't want me going in two different directions for my research and 2. Doesn't feel like he's an expert in my PhD direction and wouldn't feel comfortable leading a project in my \"new\" area. So I spent most of this semester freaking out, trying to find both a new project and new chair/mentor. \n\nFinally got that sorted out maybe two weeks ago and to now have professors asking me to already know what I'm doing for my dissertation (not even the general area, but specifics), I'm just disinterested working with them again. The journal club is voluntary, so I can just not go back next semester. But it's also such a difference to me between my current advisors who are much more non-trad and are like \"we'll take time to work out what experiments you'll do for your dissertation.\" Like I know the area I'll do my work in (my advisors' research area lol), we're just trying to settle things before getting into specifics. I'm only in my first semester, give me at least until the end of next semester before asking.",

      "text": "What country are you in (since this might differ based on length and structure of the program)? I definitely didn't have any specifics worked out in year 1. In fact I switched labs after my first year and basically started over. Things gradually developed over time (I had enough of an idea by my qualifying exams to have 1 of my 3 exam papers geared specifically towards the background on my topic), but I didn't have specifics for my experiments til much later. \n\nObviously depends on your program's timeline, but assuming it's not a shorter program, there's no need for such a rush unless you really want to work with one of those people specifically. People's interests change and develop all the time during a PhD. Our program always said 25% of people switch labs. You have time. You don't have to have it all figured out yet.",

      "text": "Sounds like they're expecting more from you since you're already completing your masters. Maybe they think that your PhD topic is (or should be) an extension of your masters topic? Is this the case? Or have you completely refocused going from masters to PhD?",
