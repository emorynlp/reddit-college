  "text": "Hey guys.\n\nTrigger warning: mentions of sexual assault, drink tampering, trafficking\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI don't quite know how to begin this, so I'll just dive straight into it. I got into a grad program this year after really working my butt off. I love my program, I love what I'm doing, and the people I work in the lab with. But I had some struggles when I first moved. Essentially when I was younger I was trafficked by a previous boyfriend, and once I got out, I was able to access services at my university once I started classes again where I was given a diagnosis of complex PTSD. With help from the psychologist I was seeing, I managed to raise my grades dramatically in my undergrad to get into grad school, and I was starting to do a lot better despite having some struggles with certain day to day living with relationships, friendships, etc.\n\nUnfortunately though at a school event a month into being there, my drink was drugged. I had my friends there and I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, but due to my history the feeling of being drugged again made me have some serious flashbacks and my symptoms came back really hard as I thought I would be transported via the ambulance to somewhere else. A week after the incident, one of the friends I had made since my move came into my room and started feeling me up while I was asleep after a night out. Nothing really happened because when I woke up I had a panic attack, and he didn't really stop at first but after a bit he did. I cut off contact with him after.\n\nI have been really struggling in school lately and I feel like I am disappointing my supervisor. He doesn't know about any of this, but my grades have been suffering. I haven't been sleeping well and don't really have people around that I can talk to about such heavy topics. I saw a psychologist today and essentially she was adamant I should ask for an extension on my paper that is due. I can't shake the feeling that I am worried about talking to my supervisor for an extension due to mental health, and that he will feel like I can't keep up with grad school and I might lose my funding or be asked to take a leave of absence. I've been working with the police services in my province and my college department head regarding the drink tampering happening at school events, but I don't feel safe at school. The psychologist also said I should report what happened to campus police, and my ex-friend could face non-academic misconduct penalties including being expelled. I don't have proof of what happened and don't want my name dragged through the dirt only to be told nothing will happen.\n\nI don't know what to do.  I'm not myself right now but I feel like I should be able to handle both of these events, as they weren't that bad compared to other stuff I've went through. Should I just try to get as much as I can done on the paper and hand it in so I don't disappoint him further? I have an especially prestigious MSc position, a lot of people would kill to be in my place so I don't want to seem like I'm not up to the task, but I'm worried it already seems that way. Or should I ask for the extension, and take the time to do it well even if it might appear like I'm not able to handle things?\n\nSorry for the heavy topic, but thank you guys very much for any responses",

      "text": "First of, what happened to you was horrible and I'm really sorry. Your psychologist is absolutely right. Please ask your supervisor for an extension. With regards to reporting the crimes, go over your possibilities carefully before coming to a decision and do what makes sense to you. Before I say more on how to go about explaining this to him, I'd like to talk about your feelings of guilt. The recent events are truly traumatic, no matter if they are subjectively not as bad as what happened in the past. Think of them as individual events and if they were to happen to a friend or a close one. Don't you think they would be deeply impactful? Coupled with what happened in the past - these recent events can be extremely huge triggers for you. \n\nI'd advise taking things one step at a time. First, explain very briefly and to the point what's going on to your supervisor. If you feel uncomfortable telling them details, say something along the lines of: \"I have recently gone through some events that have had a deep impact on my mental health. I am seeking help for it by going to a psychologist. I was wondering if I could get an extension on the paper since I am unable to work to the best of my abilities at this time.\"\n\nNow once that's done, I think you really need to go to more sessions with your psychologist to discuss future plans with her. Please take this seriously and take care of yourself. It may seem like a barrier to you being in a great program and doing well but if your mental health declines over time it's going to have a negative impact on your work and life in general. It's best to manage your mental health now or atleast work out options on how to juggle everything that's happened and college. \n\nTake care and sending you lots of hugs and wishes. \u2764\ufe0f",

          "text": "Hey, thank you so much for replying to me. I really appreciate your kind words- it can be hard to give yourself the same kind of care you would give others, and what you said kinda made me think that if this were a friend saying these things to me, I'd tell them it's okay to ask for help. I ended up messaging my supervisor with something similar to what you said and he gave me a week extension and asked if he could help in any way. Thank you so much for your reply! Sending warm wishes your way <3",

      "text": "I'm very sorry that you're dealing with this situation! It sounds horrible and I hope you're getting the support that you need from your medical team and your friends and family!\n\nI'll respond with advice on the academic stuff, which I know best: Your first stop should be your university's accessible education office. Often you can just drop in, but with Covid you will probably have to make an appointment; at the appointment, you can tell the representative that you went through a traumatizing experience that you are dealing with under the care of a therapist and ask for them to arrange for accommodations for your situation. You might need documentation, but your psychologist will surely provide this for you. That office should give you a statement of required accommodations that your professors/adviser are required to follow. It should be no problem for them to mandate extensions for your current semester work, and your professors and advisers won't think twice about implementing them. I would do this *even if* you get an extension for this semester through other means, as you'll want it documented should the condition recur. \n\nI hope that you'll follow up with your psychologist and that you'll have time to yourself to process this when the semester ends! These sorts of traumas are real medical conditions and need to be treated as seriously as any other, so you shouldn't feel any guilt whatsoever about taking the time you need, prestigious position or not!",

      "text": "If you make a complaint maybe it will be dismissed - this time. But if it is kept on file that could make a world of difference to the next woman he does this or worse to. I would talk it over first with a therapist for help/advice on this decision first though. Submitting a complaint of this nature, especially if the person taking the complaint is dismissive can be an additional trauma.",

      "text": "I am so very sorry for what you\u2019ve gone through. PTSD is so scary and can be incredibly disruptive, and to have gone through another trauma on top of that\u2026 yes, of course you need additional support in your grad program right now. Please don\u2019t think of this as something you should \u201cbe able to handle.\u201d You are not weak for needing an extension on an assignment anymore than someone who had just been in a car accident. What you are dealing with is just as worthy of help and support, and you should not feel like it\u2019s on you to push yourself beyond your limits for a class assignment. \n\nAlways remember that your health and well-being come first. Any accommodations you may need are there to level the playing field for you, so don\u2019t hesitate to seek them. You\u2019ve gone through so much. You deserve every opportunity for success.",
