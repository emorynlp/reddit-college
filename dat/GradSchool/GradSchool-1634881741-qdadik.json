          "text": "Alright after reading it, I kind of really don't like the second half of the article. Rather than giving, say, helpful tips on how to switch to a growth mindset, the author talks at length about how parents who want their children to do well are inadvertently making their kids' lives more challenging by preventing failure. Talking about fixed mind-set as an \"epidemic\" seems kind of cynical to me, and (maybe I missed it) I didn't see any real research that supported the claim that \"wiffle parenting\" was on the rise; there was only anecdotal evidence from managers. Given that this came out in 2014, that kind of feels like your typical millennial-bashing to me.",
