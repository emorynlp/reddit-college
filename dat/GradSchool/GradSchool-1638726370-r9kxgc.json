      "text": "You could ask questions about the program: how many students are likely to be enrolled in your cohort, what connections does the program have with industry or others in the field, how do students in the program describe their experience? \n\nYou could ask questions about the admissions process: what's required, what might strengthen a statement of purpose, what kind of letter of rec is best (i.e. a letter from an adjunct who knows you well and can speak highly of what you would bring to the program, vs a short, generic letter from a department head), what weight is given to grades, test scores, relevant research and experience, etc. What are they looking for in a student entering their program?\n\nYou could ask about financial aid, scholarships, and teaching assistant opportunities. You could ask how graduates fare in the year or two following graduation.  \n\nIf you anticipate that some aspect of your application would be less than stellar, you could even decide to broach that subject. \"Although my grades are excellent overall, in my last year of undergrad, all of my bandmates spontaneously combusted. This had a damaging effect on my academic performance that term. Should I address this in my application?\"\n\nGood luck!",
