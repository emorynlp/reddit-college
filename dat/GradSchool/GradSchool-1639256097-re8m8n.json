  "text": "It would be interesting to hear your story! What's your motivation, your end goal, your reason for pursuing postgrad studies?\nDid you come straight from undergrad, or have you been in the workforce?\nWhat's your goal?\n\nI can start. I finished my BA in 2003 and was very keen to start working. I did well, but I felt every day at uni was just one day less to work towards my goal of working in media and communication. After all, I was getting old at the age of 22, lol.\n\nI started working in a news room straight after graduation, and haven't stopped since then, although I eventually left the press. I've had so much fun working and I always used to say that studying would be pointless, because the learning curve was much steeper in the professional world than my experience was from uni.\n\nBut at some stage, the curve flattened. I reached a point where I started getting bored. I could have changed jobs, gone for something more exciting, but I really like my workplace (I currently work at a university). And since I work at a university, I kept getting snide comments about my lack of education from certain arrogant professors ...\n\nI guess one of my reasons to go back to uni was to prove a point - I wanted to prove to the people at work that I'm not dumber than them just because I've preferred practical experience over theoretical studies.\n\nSo I enrolled at a masters at a university which is higher ranked than the one I work at, lol.\n\nI do well, but I'm still not convinced that academia and I are a perfect match. I roll my eyes a lot. And there really is too many words. But it's also interesting and rewarding, and I take with me insights and perspectives that I'm very grateful for. I like being a mature age student. I think life experience is useful when trying to understand theory (I'm in humanities). \n\nI won't pursue a PhD unless something very strange happens. But I'm glad I'm doing a masters. Now I know what it's all about, and that's valuable in itself! \n\nHow about you?",

On bad days, I am mostly motivated by spite (see [here](https://postacademicinnyc.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/308/)).\n\nI am not sure I have an end goal because the academic job market is so bleak and uncertain. I would like to stay in research, but I am not sure if that is possible. For now, I just want to finish my thesis.",

      "text": "In my country, it is for certain universities the unspoken assumption that you pursue a Master immediately after the Bachelor. Not doing so is perceive having an 'incomplete' degree.\n\nIt has always been obvious to me and everyone around me that I'd go to one of these universities, first-generation college student etc etc bla bla. So that's how I got my Master's.\n\nI was looking for work after graduating. I had a few temporary stints with fixed-term contracts. In the end, I had a job at a company, when an old professor approached me with a PhD position. My company job was a 4-month contract, but it had a very high likelihood of being extended to permanent. Nevertheless, the PhD position was a 4-year contract with higher pay. Both out of greater job stability, as well as spite to the company for only giving me such a short contract.\n\nMy PhD was relatively uneventful. I had a supportive nice supervisor, I had a bunch of high-impact publications, and that was that. Finished within the contracted time too.\n\nI wish I could say it was some form of greater calling for continuous learning or whatever, but that'd be a lie. The PhD position paid more, offered more stability, and gave me a doctor title to stroke my ego. Easy choice. The only real downside is that of every PhD student; nobody in the world seems to understand that it is a job in everything but name.",

          "text": "You make it all seem easy, haha!\nIncomplete degree. I kind of get that. I did a BA in journalism and media studies. The journalist bit was fine. There's limits to how much you can study for that job anyway. But the media studies bit was interesting, but I found it disappointingly \"light\". I expected uni to be full on, but it wasn't. I feel more fulfilled on a master level in that respect.",

      "text": "I was a bartender and drug dealer, I had to pay for everything myself because my family was in complete financial ruin so I knew it was the only way I could make it happen. The whole time I was bartending/dealing I saved up for a car and tuition for community college. I got arrested four or so times along the way and had to work full-time throughout CC which was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done but I transferred from community college debt-free with my car paid off and quit dealing (it was always my goal to quit when I got into university and just take the rest of the cost on in debt).\n\nProud to say I graduate next semester with distinction for a Statistics BS/math minor and I\u2019m currently in the process of applying for ms/PhD programs that are ranked in the top 10-50. Most people who know me now don\u2019t know what I had to go through to get here and most people who knew me then don\u2019t know where I am now. At my lowest point I was afraid I screwed it all up and I would never even be able to make it this far.\n\nMy motivation was motivation itself. I was incredibly determined to be motivated and succeed. I *knew*, the entire way here, that this was where I was going. Even when I was afraid, I knew I would make it here. Absolutely *anyone* can make it if you don\u2019t give up.",
