  "text": "Sorry in advance because I\u2019m sure there are a million posts like this all the time. \n\nI was admitted into a 2-year masters program in the arts with a job as a GA. It\u2019s a pretty good deal for what it is. The problem is that I honestly don\u2019t have much of an idea of what I\u2019m going to do with my degree. I don\u2019t feel like creating art very much at all, or at least not in the way that they\u2019re expecting me to.\n\nI\u2019m only one quarter into my program, and I\u2019ve already accepted an incomplete for one of my classes, which puts my financial aid package in jeopardy. \n\nI have ADHD and bipolar. I feel like I am capable of doing the work, I just can\u2019t do it while maintaining a stable mental health state and a balanced life. I think I just wanted some sort of direction in my life, just pushing back the inevitable discomfort of figuring out what I can do with my life. Is it really worth taking out more loans to pursue an education that I don\u2019t know will land me a job?\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m afraid that if I drop out, I\u2019ll regret it forever. I was smoking too much weed over the past couple of months, and I\u2019m sure that contributed to my incomplete work. I\u2019m also sad that I\u2019ll be disappointing the people around me. Do any of you have any advice?",

      "text": "I'm sorry you feel that way.  It's understandable to be upset and just... not happy about the state of everything.\n\nYou're going to have to figure out what you want out of life and what do you need to get there.  To put it bluntly (and make an assumption, so apologies if I'm wrong), it seems like you don't have a healthy relationship with weed that it's impacting your academic performance and is used as a way to cope with your emotional worries.  I'd hold off on that for now until you figure out what you can afford and can't afford time-wise.\n\nI'd suggest drafting a list or something and do a little soul-searching.  Answer the following questions:\n\n1. What's my current situation?\n2. What do I want out of life? (aka what's my long-term future goals?)\n3. Where do I see myself in the next 5-10 years? (aka what are my short-term future goals?)\n4. What do I need to get there? (look at building roads that will hit both short-term but also long-term goals)\n5. Is a graduate degree (in the arts) on the critical path to get there? (re-analysis of current decisions)\n\nThese questions are easily asked, but really hard to answer.  I know the answer to question 2 changes every once in a while.  But the idea isn't to set this in stone and dedicate your life to it, but rather use these questions as a tool to re-evaluate where you are, where you're going, and figure out how you get there.  Our list of priorities change over time so don't be surprised this changes too.\n\nPeople fall off of horses all the time.  The important question is when to get back on or if getting back on this horse is worth it and if you want to get on a different horse.  Build a plan based on your capacity and what you can take on and execute it.  My opinion is that you should speak with an advisor or someone who understands your situation a bit further and see if there's also some campus-based support for you to access during these times.  Maybe even talk with someone at the Career Services program and see if your target career even requires it (although my experience with different universities career services has been... varied).\n\nThere's always going to be a tomorrow.  If today isn't a good day or you're just not in a good place, it'll be hard but try to build a plan and push so you can have a good day tomorrow.",

      "text": "I want to commend the comment by u/HalfEatenPie as well as add something else here.\n\nAs you mentioned, balance is hard to maintain. I'm guessing the pressure of work is making it hard for you to rest and refresh, and that tiredness and discomfort is driving you to smoke more.\n\nI would encourage you to find a place to where you can get out of the graduate school headspace - maybe your childhood home, or a short vacation. See how you feel after clearing your head. Sometimes these feelings are just the tired brain taking over, sometimes they run deeper - and it really is a matter of changing life directions.\n\nOnce you're refreshed, it's a good time to start looking at the habits that are draining you. Are you letting stress take over, even when not working? Are you taking care of your body - eating well, exercising.\n\nI wish you the best of luck as you navigate this!",

A program should be a two-way relationship, in which you complete coursework and the program provides you something in return. Is this program providing you with anything? \n\nI would highly, highly recommend not taking out loans.",

There are likely to be other pursuits that provide the direction you need. Pursuits that may also be helpful for answering those existential questions.",
