  "text": "I just did my masters thesis proposal and my 3 advisors/ committee completely demolished my ideas. They argued with every point I made and I feel so discouraged. I feel like I should just quit or completely start over. How do you all move passed this point in grad school? I\u2019m in a special made program so I\u2019m the only one in my department so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s other people to bounce ideas off of or review things.",

Are there changes you can make that answer their questions? It's literally their job to peer review your work. They want to make sure that your research questions will be answered by your methods.",

Like legitimately laughed at me when I didn\u2019t understand a question and then wouldn\u2019t let me answer the other guys questions. I have stutter from a TBI and he takes it as an opportunity to just talk over me. I almost quit my first semester because of him.",

If not, I'd suggest you find some good research proposals to get a feel how you should frame your topics. Sometimes advisor are just too busy to read through.",
