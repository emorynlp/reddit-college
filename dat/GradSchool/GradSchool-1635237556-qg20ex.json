  "title:": "Is CS minor beneficial for EE undergrad?",
  "text": "I'm an EE undergrad from India from a tier 1 college with a GPA of 9.5+\nI wish to pursue MS after my undergrad and wanted some advice regarding it\nI already have courses like DSA, Probability, Comp Arch, Digital Circuits as core courses and have done an ML course as an elective recently. I wish to know whether pursuing a CS minor would add any weight to my application or should doing some more CS courses as electives give me good background for it? If the latter, which courses do you think are important and that I should do them before applying for the programs next December?\nI'm planning to do OS and Networking (both offered by the EE department) in my next sem\nThanks in advance!",
