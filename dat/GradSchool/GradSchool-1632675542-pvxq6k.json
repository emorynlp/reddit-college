  "text": "And it was eye-opening experience.\n\nTo preface I had an ok relationship w my advisor.  I was in a stem PhD program at a big university. He was great about responding to my messages, put a lot of effort into papers, and was generally \u201cthere.\u201d However, I rarely felt like he really valued me or my contributions or my ideas. He was habitually combative in conversations about my STEM subject. Sometimes my ideas were met with curiosity and interest, and sometimes they were met with scoffing. \n\nI graduated, got a job not in academia that pays well and has good work-life balance. My co-workers have nearly always been kind in interactions, especially when it comes to working through ideas. It\u2019s very possible to disagree with a person\u2019s idea without aiming to shame them for having it.\n\nI had lunch with my old labmates and advisor recently and ended up experiencing the same kind of combative interaction w my advisor! Except I wasn\u2019t used to it anymore. I brought up a pretty reasonable idea- not to actually implement, but to casually explore in conversation what\u2019s possible. He quickly dismissed everything I was saying.\n\nI continued to defend my idea and he continued to dismiss it- making almost absurd claims. For example I mentioned I was interviewing for a new job where the main responsibility was simulating particular physical behavior. My old advisor said the relevant physics problem was \u201csolved.\u201d Like it is? So this company is throwing 6 figures a year at an already solved problem?\n\nI checked in with another former person in the lab who witnessed the interaction and she said she felt it was a really uncomfortable situation as well, and she thought my (very general) idea made sense.\n\nIt made me wonder how many other times I let him make me feel stupid unnecessarily because I had some degree of trust in him. It makes me never want to come back to academia.\n\nEdited wording for clarity",

      "text": "This is not a good advisor in general. They likely do not have the full picture. Out of curiosity, I'm not sure if you're female, and your advisor is particularly combative with women in general (this sometimes happens in male dominated fields, and you mentioned that the other person you checked with was female). Without more context about the general idea or problem, its difficult to decide whether your advisor is right and knows an approach you might not have considered, or if he is relying on an outdated or incomplete picture of problem. \n\nIt is fine to be combative in academia or a research setting, as long as you know when to accept that you were wrong, otherwise you just look silly defending a position you dreamed up yourself. It may also be that your advisor may be insecure and felt the need to show off on his 'turf' in the lab, so even after you have left, he still sees you as his student, rather than a research professional in your own right. The problem your advisor is talking about may indeed be 'solved', but under some constraints, or may be impractical to implement in industry, the company is probably looking for a different perspective.",

          "text": "Thanks for your response!! Yes I am a woman and he\u2019s a man :/. I know other women who have had negative interactions with him. Our lab used to be all men and I sometimes get the sense that my old advisor missed that. There was a student that actually mirrored his dismissive ness who he loved.\n\nI feel extremely confident that my advisor was speaking out of line. I was speaking from my knowledge of internal documents at my large company who is working with state of the art technology- tons of phds. My work now is only tangentially related to my PhD work. My postdoc also agreed my idea was reasonable. Even if my old advisor had actual insight to share, he certainly didn\u2019t make a convincing argument by being dismissive.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have minded combativeness with more specific criticisms, but they were all basically judgment calls from a place of unearned authority. \n\nThanks for the opportunity to talk this out \ud83d\ude05",

Your advisor is either jealous of you, threatened by you, or just didn't think you'd make it and is having a hard time stomaching the taste of all that crow.\n\nThe average CS prof makes about $90K a year. Do you think your advisor is making six figures? Probably not. Why do you think that is? Maybe he just prefers academia and the lower salary. Maybe he wanted the exact kind of job you have but never could get it. What do you think his work-life balance is like? It's probably pretty shit, except during the summer.\n\nI'd be willing to bet that this professor is not happy. Happy people celebrate the successes of others. Good teachers feel proud when their students are successful. He saw that you were happy, and he feels like you don't deserve it, like you're getting something he deserves and doesn't have. He made you feel stupid on purpose because your success makes him feel insecure.\n\nI don't normally jump to this conclusion, but in your situation, it feels like Occam's Razor to me.",

              "text": "It is my experience (albeit limited, given that I have two full semesters of major classes left) that approximately half of CS professors pretend to have more in-depth knowledge than they actually do. You know what they have in-depth knowledge about? The specific course material they're teaching and the specific subjects they're researching. This professor does not have the understanding of physics necessary to have this conversation/debate at your level, which is why he uses maneuvers like ludicrous statements, making you feel stupid, dismissing you, and shutting down the conversation: to avoid being exposed as, well, a bit of a fraud.\n\nI've taken a hiatus from my uni to knock out my next few maths at community college. They're offering some Java classes so I figured, why not take them for fun even though they're too low-level to transfer? I thought the prof was just a lazy asshole until I started noticing red flags in how she teaches / grades / etc. that signal she may just be less knowledgeable than she claims. For ex, she claims she gets paid a lot of money to correct errors in other people's code. Okay, so... why do you need to teach at a community college then? I got curious and did some research. The college is having a hard time filling vacant positions. She got some kind of IT management degree, and I looked at her school's course requirements. She was required to take maybe three Java classes, and the rest of her classes were about management of employees, communication, etc., which means I have had more coding classes than her and know (the basics of) more languages. I think she can tell, and she does not like it -- because she acts just like OP's prof.",

There is some seriously shitty libertarian ideas and sentiments that have propagated in biomedical sciences in academia, in my experience. I don\u2019t think honest collaborative science occurs in the current paradigm. I think it\u2019s mostly corrupt entrenched labs exploiting junior workers to publish rushed and improper science.

Also being able to deal with such a person at work and still go home with $100K and not having your entire livelihood lean on a single project allows you to separate work from home easier and make it much more bearable.",

Like it could be that maybe the physics is solved but then why not elaborate, why the attitude. I feel like there's something else going on.\nI have a colleague who I've always thought of as smart. He's pretty good with words and he seems to know a lot about my field even though his field is different from mine. Often I feel stupid when I hear him talking about \"smart\" sounding ideas. A lot of times I also had no way of verifying on the spot if what he's saying is actually true. But after a while I started questioning him and noticed that he either gets super defensive and that he dodges my questions. Which made me reevaluate my impression of him. Now whenever I talk to him I make an effort to keep in mind that he might just be trying to impress me or whoever is around and to take what he says with a grain of salt.",

I felt like during grad school I justified his attitude in maybe he doesn't want to encourage ideas that might be a waste of time. But here there was no such implication, I was half expecting the conversation to go in an imaginative, exploratory direction.. especially since it was a lunch get-together.\n\n> But after a while I started questioning him and noticed that he either gets super defensive and that he dodges my questions. \n\nYeah I think if he were truly interested in this ideas vs trying to flex, he'd be excited to get into the details. But sadly some people are attracted to these big ideas in large part for flexing.",
