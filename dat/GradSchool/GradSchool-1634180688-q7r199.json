  "text": "Hi guys. I am in my second year, 12 credits out of 36 credit program down, in a mental health counseling masters program. It has slowly become apparent to me that I don't want to be a therapist. I am unhappy in school, I don't see a future as a counselor for me. I am doing fine with the course load, but I don't think this is for me. \n\nUpon telling my friends this, none of them in grad school, they urge me to continue. Their reasons vary, but some of them are straight up arguing with me even though I tell them I DO NOT see myself being an LMHC when all of this is said and done. i guess I just expected more support, or... something else.  Has anyone else experienced this? Or in general, just words of advice would help. I feel so lost.",

There\u2019s no point in grinding it out if you don\u2019t even want to be a therapist in the end anyway. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re suddenly going to like the field after you graduate.",

Don\u2019t keep pouring effort, money (including opportunity costs), and time into something you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to do.\n\nAlso in case this is a concern, the older you get the more people you\u2019ll meet who did a semester or a few semesters in a grad program and then left and did something else. It\u2019s amazingly common.",

Might be worth looking into and considering so that you at least have the piece of paper to go with the grad education you\u2019ve started.\n\nThat said, I would 100% recommend to go with whatever YOU think is best for you. You\u2019ll be happier in the long run. And if you get 5 or 10 years down the road and decide you do want to be a therapist, then fuck it. Go back and finish school then. Live and enjoy life while you\u2019re young.",

It is truly not the business of others the way you choose to live your life. Working in mental health requires a clear \u201cwhy\u201d in my opinion; it is hard, hard work that demands sharp written and oral communication skills, patience, creative problem-solving, empathy, compassion, flexibility, time management and frankly the wherewithal to be underpaid and undervalued by society relative to other professions.",

There are a lot of jobs within the mental health field that you can get as a counsellor that don\u2019t actually involve counselling. It\u2019s a very versatile degree to have and a fantastic one if you want to work in social services. If you don\u2019t want to work in social services at all though, then I do t thank there\u2019s much point in sticking it out.",
