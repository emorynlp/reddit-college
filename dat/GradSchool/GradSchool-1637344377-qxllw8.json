  "text": "I have a research gate profile. I never updated it with my information before, so decided to do it. While giving information,  i tried to update my undergrad thesis with title and abstract only. I found that my other two co authors mate does not have RG id ,  however, i can update the info with mentioning their name. I know it is just a profile update, not any publication or conference presentation. Profile update can be done anytime. But i was thinking do i need my co authors permission or advisor's,  to update the thesis title and abstract in research gate? I m not going for any publication without anyone's consent just updating it in RG profile.\n\nNewbie here, so valuable suggestions are appreciated.",
