  "text": "Hi everyone! I graduated in May from NCSU. Degree in Conservation Biology, minor in Marine Science. Ultimately I want to do field research on sharks/rays/and skates. I am also interested in marine habitat conservation, marine macrofauna, and marine rehabilitation. I want to go back for my masters but have no clue how to even start looking for programs. \n\nHow do I know what degrees will get me to my goal? And once I know that, what's the process for applying? I feel totally lost. \n\nI've heard that I need to cold call professors and then apply once I've found a program and that I have to apply to the school prior to finding a program I want which is completely contradictory advice. \n\nAny advice is welcome. Helpful websites and databases would be incredible.",
