Then read out the pixel from each slice where the green value of the pixel has the largest difference to the neighboring pixel. Or something like that (like the binarize option the one user mentioned). You could use one of many built in image filters to sort of tune the result you get, I imagine this would be a really important step to get accurate results. A high pass filter would light up where the pixel value change is largest (where there are edges in the image). To run this efficiently you should only take slices of data instead of full frames, store the data in arrays, and don't use any for loops. I.e. vectorize your code.",
