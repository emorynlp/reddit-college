  "title:": "Are waitlists for courses not commonly used in graduate school?",
  "text": "I've been trying to add myself to the waitlist for a course and emailed the instructor when I couldn't find the waitlist option on the student portal (which has happened before due to tech errors/forgetfulness on the instructor end). She claimed that she has never heard of course waitlists before and has never seen one being used. \n\nI am 100% sure that my institution uses waitlists because last semester I was on several waitlists and got into 2 courses after people ahead of me dropped the course. I've already emailed the registrar/academic advisor in charge of the registrar for further guidance but I've never gotten a reply from her before so it's more of a formality than an actual request for help. \n\nIs my institution just weird for using waitlists or is there something else going on here?",
