      "text": "I don't really know either of these, but from my experience there's always a team that loves x program better than y and has 15 reasons for it.  Typically it comes down to what you're trained on and specific analysis.  If there's researchers that you are trying to work with/look up to in your field, maybe look at what they do in some of their papers.  Or if there's a specific type of work you'd like to do (e.g. I do alot of longitudinal analyses, certain programs are more flexible and better suited for that, so I use that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!",
