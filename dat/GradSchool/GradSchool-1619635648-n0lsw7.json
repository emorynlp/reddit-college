You should have:\n\n\n3 copies of all important files, spread across at least\n\n2 different media, with at least\n\n1 off-site backup.\n\n\nSo, following this scheme you should have one copy on your laptop, on copy on your work computer, and one copy on your cloud service of choice. This fulfills three copies. The two different media are hard drives and cloud, and the off site is obvious. Don't trust just hard drives, they fail. SSDs are less prone to failure, but they can still get bricked (I had two SSDs fail ON THE SAME DAY once). Flash drives are great as a quick backup. All my lab data is stored 1. On the machine that collected it. 2. On the flash drive I use to transfer it 3. On my work computer, which then auto backs up to one drive, which then auto downloads onto my home computer. With this I have 5 copies, three different media, and technically two off site backups (home and cloud). The rule goes for handwritten data as well. Photos are great, especially if you have Google or Apple or one drive auto upload. \n\n\nAlways follow the 3-2-1 rule for any mission critical data.",

Most templates are filled with examples on how to do everything you might conceivably need to do in a paper. They also appear to all be written by some extremely passive aggressive people who outline specifically how formating should be done from figure labels to citations, and how people who don't follow those specifications are idiots. Seriously every single template is so passive-aggressive I don't know why.",

              "text": "Along with what everyone else has said re citations, labels, ease in changing styles, reliability etc I think the most important thing for current students is its popularity.\n\nLaTeX is ***old***. 1984 old. For much of its life, editors like Word were utter dogshit. Maybe Word has improved a lot since my college days (2013-14), but it doesn't matter. LaTeX got a strong hold in a lot of STEM fields while Word was still shit, and so now you have fields that base the entire document-preparation ecosystem around LaTeX. Word simply does not exist in the daily operations of researchers in those fields. They may not even *have* Word installed on their computer, that's how little it's used. \n\nAll journal files will be LaTeX. All funding proposals will be LaTeX. Your thesis template will be given in LaTeX. Sure, maybe you can convert these things to Word on your own but no one in the world is going to help you, and you'll need to be able to understand tex files anyway to do that conversion. No one can or will give you advice on how to do that because everyone else in your world knows and uses LaTeX like a fish in water. If all your collaborators use LaTeX then you must also use LaTeX. Even the oldest farts in astronomy use LaTeX!\n\nAt a certain point, it becomes so much easier to just learn LaTeX so you can use the resources that are available. It's really not a choice, and students will make it easier on themselves if they put in the effort to learn early on rather than try to hold out with Word.",

I would rather not learn *a new skill that is absolutely vital*.\n\nSure, maybe you're doing fine with your MATLAB or Excel for the time being, but if your field demands Python/R then you will be forced to use Python/R throughout your career. You will **never** avoid learning it. You don't *get* to opt out.\n\nIt's the same with LaTeX for a lot of us. You simply can't get by with Word. No one will be able to collaborate with you, and no one will *want* to collaborate with you because they'll have to all download new programs *just for you*. It's like if everyone you know prefers to talk via email but one person out of the hundreds demands that you use Slack just for them. It's a hassle and it's not fair to others.\n\nIf a piece of software is the standard in your field then you must be able to work with it. Getting lots of errors is a bit of a beginner thing thing because once you have one working version of a document type, you don't need to fiddle ever again. I've been using it for a few years and I can't remember the last time I got any kind of real error that wasn't obvious and trivial to fix (like a typo). So LaTeX has a bit of a learning curve, but then again so does R and Python and every single computational tool in ML/AI, and people still have to learn that and they *do* learn that.\n\nYou would rather stick with what you know because it's easier, but it will punish you severely later on. Go through the pain now to avoid 100x more pain later.",
