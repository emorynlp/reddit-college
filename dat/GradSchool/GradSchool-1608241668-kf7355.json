  "text": "One of my friends who is doing a STEM PhD (so do I) just passed away earlier this week. Possible reason was depression worsened by this pandemic and lockdown.\n\nI'm writing not for any sympathy as I could handle this, I'm writing because I hope everyone here, who might be struggling, making less progress, feeling isolated, stay strong and take care. It's been a hard time for all of us, and I know a lot of grad students suffered from mental health issues as well. Still, we will make it.",
