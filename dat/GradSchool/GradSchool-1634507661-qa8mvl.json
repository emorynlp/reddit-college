I had to take several Ws in undergrad for various reasons- and undergrad took me 8 years so I had plenty of time. \n\nWhen I was talking to the admissions guy at the school I now go to I can honestly say it never came up once. And it hasn\u2019t since, unless you count my W over the summer during my first semester of grad school. \n\nLife happens. I think they understand that.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t want it to sound like I dropped just to drop. I have a lot of health issues.",

It was too much, obviously I knew that but I thought I could do it. One of my classes was CS intro to c++ and i had no coding experience whatsoever and they moved so fast, I\u2019m basically struggling all through the weekend on one subject to maintain a c. Because of this, other subjects like calc 2 and phys 2 that I am good at are suffering because I need to focus on computer to even get a passing grade.",

              "text": "Why did your parents want you to take 21? That is an insane amount of classes. 19 is already too much, especially hearing your class load. Don\u2019t worry about the coding class, where I went to school, the intro to CS classes are sort of the weed out class. So it\u2019s definitely made really hard on purpose. Plus, if you never had coding experiences, this definitely is even harder.",
