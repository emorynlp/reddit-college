  "text": "\" I actually failed in an exam and not allowed for placements this year. So, some of my classmates who got placed with 20k jobs had made fun of me, But the truth is I have been earning 50k by doing an online job and no one knows about it. I want you to know that, if you are doing something good don't let anyone know about it because all they do is to ruin them. I am enjoying my life in silence and still planning something big again but definitely I love to keep everything as a secret. Shhhhh!!!! \"",
