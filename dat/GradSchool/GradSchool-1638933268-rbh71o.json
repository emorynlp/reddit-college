  "text": "I (Indian) am looking to apply for mscs in the US. However I have no idea what kind of places/states to zero in on to shortlist my unis. Ideally, I would like a place that's vibrant, affordable, with opportunities to socialise. It's also important for it to be non-racist, one that does not have religious discrimination and basically just safe, suitable for international students. Feel free to drop in any other advice for international students about shortlisting unis if you'd like.",

      "text": "The three states on the west coast fit your bill except for the affordable part. Especially if you stick to socal, bay area, portland, seattle and sacramento. Outside of that, you're probably looking at Chicago or DC. DC is pretty cool because it's young and vibrant. New York is amazing, but affordability is another problem. Philly and Boston can have issues with race, but I wouldn't cross them off completely since they're such large/diverse locales. Maybe Austin as well? Each one of these places will have nicer neighborhoods and sketchier spots. \n\nFor what its worth, college towns can be much different than their surroundings (Madison, WI or Gainesville, FL come to mind). It may be easier to look at schools you would be interested in and then research the individual locations. If the location won't work for you cross it off.",
