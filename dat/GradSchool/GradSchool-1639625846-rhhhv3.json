  "title:": "PhD program - knowing when to walk away",
  "text": " 1st semester of my PhD program has been a complete shit show, both academically (fundamentals class kicked my ass) as well as  dealing with an entire mess of outside issues (struggle to find housing, daily costs of parking due to 'sold out' parking permits, working part time bc the stipend is a joke). I don't think I can handle 5 years of this shit and I'm pretty dismayed at how classist higher ed really is. For those of you who left, at what point did you realize it was time to tap out? (I know, I know \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\" And boy howdy has this been hellish lol)",

Honestly I don\u2019t think I do - my department is a bit of a sinking ship, and the grad students are unsupported and overworked. Plus at this point, I can\u2019t think of a job I want that this PhD would give me - I\u2019m really disenchanted from academia right now.",

The further in you get as well the harder it is to quit. I personally think if you know it\u2019s not for you after one semester you can still leave without feeling much guilt or shame.",

      "text": "Academia is not for everyone. Some departments are not for anyone - bad culture hurts everyone.\n\nThere is no shame in recognizing if it's not the right place or time for you. Many people walk away from graduate school only after having developed serious physical and mental health challenges. some of which are life long. Elevated levels of chronic stress are not a joke.\n\nWhen making big life decisions, I always recommend taking some time away and refreshing, it's hard to look clearly when you're in the midst. If this is possible, I hope you can do it.\n\nWishing you well as you navigate this.",

      "text": "For what it's worth, I really regret not leaving right at the beginning of the pandemic. I had just finished the MS portion of the degree and I actually had a decent job offer. My advisor basically convinced me to stay (probably because I'm the only one who knows how to use a lot of the equipment) but then I basically hit a wall. I can't seem to get results, nobody is there for me to talk to, my advisor won't even meet me anymore.\n\nI say if you have a way out take it. You're not happy now, do you really expect things to change? In my experience they won't unless it's helpful for a higher up. I'm almost in my 5th year now and I'm trying to leave so I can finally start my life. If you know what you want don't wait as long as I did.",
