  "text": "I am a sophomore Physics student. I am coming out of depression (since 18 years) and currently I do study and attend classes and maintain above average cgpa but I consider it a chore. I don't really want to put mental effort. I am not genuinely interested in my courses. My confidence was also a big zero 2 years back and I am only just regaining it , so there are several moments of self-doubt. How do I determine if I should pursue higher studies or go for a corporate job? The lack of genuine interest could be because I was burnt out and I am in the recovery phase. On the other hand my inclination towards wanting to do research is because it was always seen as an intellectual thing to do.",

      "text": "As a person who has been through grad school while actually interested in the subject and got burned out anyway, I\u2019d suggest you reconsider. Take care of yourself first, grad school is not a soft nurturing environment. You can always go back to it later when you are in a better state. Also, the pandemic has been hell on research progress for everyone. Not the best time to enter academia.",

Just wanting to do it because it\u2019s a sign of being \u201cintellectual\u201d isn\u2019t enough to get you through. At the end of the day it\u2019s about deciding your career - if you think you\u2019d have better prospects for career paths that interest you by going to grad school then sure, but if you\u2019re not interested in the careers grad school would open up then I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s for you.",

      "text": "Only you can really make that decision. And who knows, you pick one direction, and then later change your mind. That's totally legit.\nGrad studies is both amazing and totally sucks. \n\nYou oscillate between loving and hating  what you do. Your mental health will suck. But, you also discover how resilient you are. Be sure to use mental health resources available to you wherever you are. \n\nImposters syndrome is very real. \n\nYou may hate the course work that you have to do in any grad studies program but love your research. Or it could be the other way around. Grad studies is unpredictable at best. \n\nEither way, a masters degree is supposed to be two years long. Get funding and apply for grants (which are hard to get) and try to avoid taking on too much debt. \n\nYou will have to learn to love rejection because grad studies is all about getting rejected from programs, grants, publications, and conferences. But when you don't get rejected, you get to do all this awesome stuff!\n\nGrad studies is a crazy lifestyle of freedom to make your own decisions and set your own hours. But you always have to work because there's so much work.\n\nAnyways. Whatever decision you make will be the right one even if you change your mind later.",

I am not genuinely interested in my courses.\n\nThere are two main reasons for going to grad school\n\nYou love the discipline and are passionate about learning more.\n\nGetting a graduate degree is important to your future career goals.\n\nCertainly, the first is not absolutely necessary. As either are good reasons for going to grad school. \n\nBut if you lack the motivation to work hard for undergrad, be aware the work is going to be much harder in grad school.\n\nOften, people are better off going to work after undergrad until they have a clear direction for their future and/or discover that passion. Don't just go to grad school because you think you might possibly need to.",
