  "text": "Hi Reddit. I'm having an unfortunate work issue with the prof for a class I am slotted to TA for next year.\n\nShort story shorter: we had a quick Zoom meeting set up last week to go over course expectations, etc. I remembered it was coming up, mentally reminded myself, and when the time rolled around, I totally forgot. My brain is completely fried after the term, so no real excuse I just... forgot. I felt really bad about it, especially since this sort of thing really never happens to me. Showed me how strung out I am on stress from this term.\n\nLater that day, I was reminded of the meeting and how I'd missed it by an email from the prof, essentially saying: I'm here, will give you 5 more minutes to show. Otherwise email me in January to reschedule. I immediately sent my apologies for having wasted her time, essentially leaving it at: we'll talk in Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, today, I get an email from the department coordinator. A forwarded chain of an email the prof sent in, before I had responded to her myself. Gist of it was: she seemed quite annoyed, worried I wasn't up to the task (communication and responsibility being key skills for a TA) and that she was not sure I was capable. Would it be possible to tell me my services are no longer needed? (actual phrasing).\n\nShe literally gave me like 1 hour to reply to her panicked email about missing the meeting, chalking it up to being disorganized and lazy instead of maybe showing me some grace. Aren't we always hearing about mental health awareness these days? Again, not an \"excuse\"... a reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe, an overworked and exhausted upper year PhD (teaching my own class atm) was pissed. The office coordinator said they assured the supervisor I am a good student etc., and that I should get in touch. \n\nI've sent back another email, impressing upon the prof that I'm serious about the job/this is out of character for me, etc., but still no reply (this was over 6 hours ago, and the first email was last week.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else have any stories like this, or who can commiserate?\n\nObviously missing a meeting is bad, but not so dire as to immediately jump to\u2014they're not qualified, I need a new TA!",

      "text": "This professor doesn't sound very professional or put together, so I would be careful with them moving forward. Missing a meeting is discourteous, but it does happen. I've missed a couple, professors I've scheduled meetings with missed a couple more. Things happen, and your professor should have reached out to you to clarify that this is not a pattern before going to the coordinator about replacing you. When people do things like that to me, I am definitely petty enough to reply all, in addition to cc'ing my adviser. I want them to know I know they went behind my back and were talking shit, even though I respond as professionally as possible. \n\nMy experience with academia so far is that so many people are full of shit. So full of shit, in fact, that if ever they had an enema they'd completely disappear. Mental health is a big concern until it's inconvenient for them. Same goes for racism, sexism, and homophobia. It's a problem *other* people have, but not \"enlightened\" people in academia. When it turns out it's their friend who's a bigot, well that couldn't possibly be the case since we do yoga together!\n\nThe dynamics that exist in academia are not radically different from those that exist in the private sector. Professors behave exactly like lazy, incompetent, greedy, entitled, clueless supervisors in many cases, and graduate students have slightly more power than fast food workers, but not an iota more.",
