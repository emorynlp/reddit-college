The balance of work and keeping sane is hard and my advisor has really been great about letting me take half days to go to counseling and work on my own schedule and I'm making decent progress.

I don't require a whole lot of training day-to-day, so I can work pretty efficiently; 2) My lab is small and we never fully shut down. I never stopped going to work. I'm often the only person here, so I get to use all the equipment whenever I want! Prior to COVID my lab was very talk-y and social which was fun, but definitely interfered with my work sometimes; 3) My partner and his roommate are a lot of fun to be around. Our little 3-person COVID bubble has really helped me stay happy and feel like I have friends and a social life, even if it's just the three of us playing tabletop games and watching a lot of Adventure Time; 4) I recently bought a house and all of the moving / designing / house-related projects have given me things to do so that I'm not just stewing home alone; 5) My cats are the absolute best and they keep me happy; 6) Maybe more importantly than anything: I LIKE working alone and am good at setting goals / deadlines for myself, so having huge chunks of unbroken time actually works well for me. I get distracted pretty easily at work (downside of liking my labmates a lot), so being on my own (but in frequent communication with my PI) has helped me stay on track. I've actually been really productive since the pandemic started",

I'm trying to make networking work for me because a large part of my graduate program is just that.\n\nAlternatively, I am seriously lacking motivation and I am not inspired by the work at all - I'm not getting that same interaction or feedback as I would in a classroom. I was so excited to start this program because I would be around other like-minded people who were passionate about the same things!\n\nThe extra flexibility I'm not always using wisely, and I think it really bums me out because I would think \"man I'm gonna learn so much\", but I haven't even made much progress on the coding languages I told myself I'd learn this year.

I was hoping to do this research and take the classes I need to become a registered forester, but I won't be able to take those classes and complete my thesis in time. At least I'll still get the forestry degree.\n\nThe only benefit is DoD took pity on me and extended our grant, so I at least have more time and we get a new grad student to take on a different part of the project so I have less field work to do.

Time enough at last!\u201d I started my second grad degree.\n\nI\u2019m halfway done with the degree now, but I underestimated just how much I need normal human activities to keep productive. In the summer I could still go to a coffeeshop to study because I was in a rural area that hadn\u2019t been hit much by the virus. Then in the fall semester the schools opened back up and it was like someone set off a COVID bomb. My county is still having anti-mask rallies and 1 of 10 here has an active case of COVID. The coffeeshop has been the source of several outbreaks.\n\nThe last month of total isolation really sapped my energy and I only limped to the finish line, turning in work that gets the job done but I\u2019m not proud of it.",
