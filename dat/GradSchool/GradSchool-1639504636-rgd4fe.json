  "text": "I'm trying to locate two semi-popular blogs/websites that chronicled experiences about leaving academia. One of the blogs was basically a repository of different people's bad experiences in grad school/academia, and the other was a specific person's account of looking for non-academic jobs after finishing her PhD. I'm sorry for being vague with my descriptions, but I suddenly remembered these blogs, and have been trying to find them.\n\nEDIT: I found the second one! Its https://howtoleaveacademia.blogspot.com/ . I'm still looking for the first one. I don't think it is necessarily about leaving academia, but basically a bunch of user-submitted experiences about their experiences in grad school.",
