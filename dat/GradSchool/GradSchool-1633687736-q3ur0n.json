  "text": "So I am a BS Physics student from an above average asian institute. I am in my third year of my 4 year course and I wish to diversify my areas of expertise. As of now I am learning data science and coding as a back up plan for getting a well paying job right after graduation if nothing else works out. I have the following options:\n\n1. Minor in Tissue Engineering\n2. Minor is Cognitive Science (I am actually kinda interested in pure psychology but not much into neuroscience)\n3. Bachelors in Physics + Masters in Mechanical Engineering\n4. Bachelors in Physics + Masters in Biological science and biomedical Engineering\n\nI have normal level of interest in 1,3,4.  Minors will be done within my 4 years and doing an additional masters will take 1 more year ( which I dont really mind). I can also do minor in one thing and masters in another which can be a little hectic maybe because of taking more courses.\n\nI don't want to go into more of pure physics.",

      "text": "It really depend on the geographic area that you want to work in. But generally minor in engineering is near to useless, because they usually won't make you qualify for becoming a licensed engineer, which is the only thing important for jobs (again, exact details depend on geographic area). Similarly, minor in any kind of science won't help you much with getting jobs.\n\nMy advice is look at what kind of jobs are available in your area (perhaps through career center at your school) and what kind of people they hire, before deciding what degree to pursue further. As you said you are no longer interested in academics, then there is really no point for more school unless there are foreseeable returns.",
