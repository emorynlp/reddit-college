      "text": "Everyone I know in my field who was so super-successful in the PhD, had started doing academic research in a competent research group at the latest in the 1st year of undergrad - more often in high school, and one even earlier - or otherwise had a large amount of relevant pre-PhD experience. I didn't have such opportunities. So I guess it's normal enough that I am taking some time to catch up. (And in my type of research the results for a high-impact paper can be obtained in several months, so technically it still isn't *guaranteed* that I won't be a successful PhD student. It is guaranteed that I won't get any fellowship/grant to use during my PhD - I was only ever eligible to apply for one and didn't get it - but my advisor has the funds, and someone recently wrote on reddit that he/she got a grant as a postdoc after not getting any ever before, so that isn't career-ending.)",

I want to be a professor more than anyone in the known universe, I am an extremely talented teacher and gifted speaker with a deep love for learning and excellence. I LOVE the challenge and rigor of grad school. But I work harder than almost everyone else in the building, I came up with my own idea and ran with it (with my generous amazing PI's blessing) and nobody gives a shit and nobody recognizes my efforts outside my lab where I can feel that everyone else does. I DO NOT want to end up in industry, I don't belong there. I know in my soul that I belong here and it is killing me to not know what I could be doing better to make things right and succeed over everyone else. It honestly seems like even though I have the world's most amazing PI, the fact that he is new (I helped build this lab from the beginning) it seems that the \"outstanding\" grad students aren't actually outstanding but have PI's that have the right connection and string-pulling power. So when we say \"outstanding\" it's not really a reflection on the student at all. But I'm probably just really salty. I would do literally anything within ethical boundaries to succeed and I just don't know how else to prove that I am worthy. EDIT: Yeah this post struck a nerve with me.

My first two years of grad school, when I was struggling and when I didn't get the NSF but others did, I felt some pangs of jealousy and disappointment in myself. Part of the problem was that I had just moved into a new city, knew no one, was single, far away from family, and couldn't afford the time or money to work on my hobbies.   \n\n\nFour years later, I am defending next month, and I have a clear picture of what I've managed to accomplish during PhD. I am by no means one of the superstars of the department, but I still feel proud of what I've done. I have some high quality, but not necessarily high impact, papers in the works, I have directly mentored nearly a dozen students who are having their own success, I have been an essential part of carving the culture and scientific direction of my lab as a whole. I have built a life with my husband and made connections with the community here, and changed my priorities so that I can work on my hobbies. I'm satisfied with who I am as a person, of which work is only a portion. There are aspects of my life that are enviable to others, even the superstar students with CNS papers, who may have not had the time to build the life I have.   \n\n\nYou should also know that success is partially luck, partially circumstance, partially innate talent, and partially hard work. Only the last portion is 100% under your control. Success also has a tendency to snowball. Some successful students may have lucked into their initial success...joined the right lab at the right time, and then got lucky that their high impact hypothesis happened to be true. After the first big success, the other successes follow more easily...high impact paper leads to high value fellowship leads to more resources, high impact collaborations, etc. Other students get scooped, have their high impact hypothesis not be true, have circumstances beyond their control.

Learn how to say no to everything else.\n\nI came into grad school knowing there was maybe a 5% chance that I actually wanted to pursue an academic career. Still, I felt like I had to prove myself by getting good grades, winning awards, and spending as much time in the lab as possible. In a way, it makes sense: those are the things that helped us get where we are, and it's natural to want to continue doing them.\n\nAfter pouring my heart and soul into my proposals only to receive scathing comments from reviewers who clearly didn't read a word I wrote (one of them called my PI by the wrong name), I went full-cynical about academia and that 5% chance turned into a 0% chance. Suddenly, publications and impact factors and authorships and grants were worthless to me except in an indirect sense: my advisor wants them, and I want to have a good relationship with my advisor.\n\nThese days, I meet with my advisor regularly to make sure that I'm producing all the deliverables she wants from me, and that I'm making adequate progress towards receiving my PhD (a.k.a. my ticket out of academia). I spend the rest of my time making a conscious effort to prioritize activities that I find meaningful. For me, this means networking, attending professional development events, and enjoying the rest of my child-free 20s.\n\nRather than worrying about whether I'm working as hard as my peers, I try to ask myself whether I'm doing everything I possibly can to achieve my own personal goals.",

To borrow from another area in life in which people worry about mediocrity, some grad students are growers, while others are show-ers. The show-er is who you\u2019re worried about- the person who is getting high impact, sexy publications that are first author and it seems like they can write their ticket after grad school. The grower might start toward the back of their cohort in terms of how the faculty once ranked the students, but continues to improve their knowledge and skills, through work, throughout grad school. You may be \u201cstruggling\u201d compared to another student, but it might just be imposter syndrome. You might not start as a star, but you may get there, if not at the end of grad school then throughout your career. \n\nWhen they get to the market, you might think the show-er is better suited to land a great job. But maybe the market isn\u2019t into their niche topic this year. Maybe they have geographic restrictions. Maybe their letters are crappy. Or maybe just through the whims of the hiring committee gods, they don\u2019t get one. And maybe the grow-er is an amazing lecturer. Maybe the grow-er has a shorter publication record, but has shown excellent recent promise. In other words, the market is a shit show.\n\nAnd at the end of it all, all you can do is be persistent and thoughtful about your work. It\u2019s important, too, to recognize  the role that chance and other factors play in academic \u201cobjective\u201d markers of success ... and if your measurement is flawed, who cares even if your t test shows a difference?

And it helps. For a little while. But deep down the envy or disappointment still lingers. \n\n>Why can't I be genius? Am I just not smart enough? Am I not working hard enough? I slept 5 hours. What a waste of time! I bet he never sleeps.\n\nMy advisor offered me some advice in class a while back. She's incredibly successful and well known to be brilliant. (So easy for her to say, right?) It wasn't very serious. And she said it to the class, but looked directly at me because she knows I am perfectionist and waaaay too hard on myself. She causally quoted a passage from a poem I had never heard of. Maybe other's have. It's subtly famous, I think. Max Ehrmann's Desiderata. \n\n>If you compare yourself with others,  \nyou may become vain and bitter;  \nfor always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  \nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. \n\nIt's dumb. But the moment had an impact on me. I looked up the poem. It's not a masterpiece of any sort, but good advice. Reminds me of Baz Luhrmann's Sunscreen song. Which I just learned was an essay published in the Chicago Tribune. Neat. \n\nAnyway, I think the advice that matters most, when you boil everything here down, is that comparing yourself with others is a waste of time. Focus on doing the best at what you're doing. Improving on your score alone. Doing better than you did the day before. Admire other's successes, but don't covet them.

          "text": "Wow dude. I am one month into a Masters/PhD program in Computer Science, and already I am suffering from imposter syndrome because my peers seem so much more knowledgable than me. Meanwhile, I'm struggling to keep up with my three courses and have not been able to start on a research project yet. I've told one of my friends, who is a Christian, about this and he tells me there's no need to be too anxious about this because what's a few years in life compared to eternity? One thing I really admire about him is that he's very humble and not perfectionist. He gives help and receives help in equal measure, and is not afraid to admit when times are rough and does not hide his true feelings. Whereas I feel like I need to maintain a perfect front.\n\nPrior to starting grad school, I worked for a few months and then briefly volunteered with my friend and his church youth group with the Salvation Army in NYC. I vividly remember one man who we helped named Quentin, who would make jokes about TV show characters and movies. The youth pastor encouraged us to talk to the homeless people on the streets, instead of just handing out water or food or money to them and then leaving. He said if we just hand out material goods to them and then leave, what does that say about how we view the worth of other people? \n\nLast week, I saw a performance of \"CS Lewis, the most reluctant convert\" by a playwright named Max McLean. It just so happened that as I was walking to class, I saw a poster for the play. It was a much needed diversion from my computer screen. In the beginning of the play, he quotes \"The Problem of Pain\", which asks how can anyone have faith in a world where every creature must prey upon one another in order to survive? And that humans, with our ability to reason, cause ourselves even more unnecessary psychological pain because we are able to think about the past and future, and thus suffer from regret of the past or anxiety over the future. And we cause ourselves even more physical pain because we use our intellect to create civilizations and technologies that isolate people into classes, and create weapons of mass destruction as seen in his brief time of serving for the British army in World War 1. It was inspiring to see his transition from cynicism to nihilism to occultism to spirituality and finally to Christianity.\n\nA friend of mine recently transferred from community college to a university two hours away to be closer to her significant other, but literally a month later that person broke up with her and said she was struggling with classes and the university dorm environment. What kept her together was praying and reading the Bible and CS Lewis books. Recently, I was reading the first few pages of \"The Screwtape Letters\" and a paragraph from the second chapter really struck me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Work hard, then, on the disappointment or anticlimax which is certainly coming to\n\nthe patient during his first few weeks as a churchman. The Enemy allows this disappointment \n\nto occur on the threshold of every human endeavour. It occurs when the\n\nboy who has been enchanted in the nursery by Stories from the Odyssey buckles down\n\nto really learning Greek. It occurs when lovers have got married and begin the real\n\ntask of learning to live together. In every department of life it marks the transition\n\nfrom dreaming aspiration to laborious doing. The Enemy takes this risk because He\n\nhas a curious fantasy of making all these disgusting little human vermin into what He\n\ncalls His \u201cfree\u201d lovers and servants \u2014 \u201dsons\u201d is the word He uses, with His inveterate\n\nlove of degrading the whole spiritual world by unnatural liaisons with the two-legged\n\nanimals. Desiring their freedom, He therefore refuses to carry them, by their mere\n\naffections and habits, to any of the goals which He sets before them: He leaves them to\n\n\u201cdo it on their own\u201d. And there lies our opportunity. But also, remember, there lies\n\nour danger. If once they get through this initial dryness successfully, they become much\n\nless dependent on emotion and therefore much harder to tempt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I would be really honored to maintain a correspondence with a fellow PhD student in Computer Science, such as yourself.",

The people who were exceptionally productive during grad school didn't seem to \"learn the same lessons\" so to speak, and often had many advantages contributing to their publication rate (e.g. productive labs with ample support, family, sheer dumb luck, different publication standards in their field).  They approached postdocs with... not exactly arrogance, but perhaps hubris?  They seem to be struggling now that more of the responsibility rests on their shoulders.\n\nOn the other hand it's been neat to see people \"bloom\" later.  Kind of affirming as an observer who was in the middle as far as productivity/luck goes.  It doesn't always happen, but I do often see people succeed as postdocs when they've been held down in some way during grad school.  In contrast, it seems people who had it relatively easy don't do so well later.  (Not that all successful grad students have it easy, of course.  Just a trend I've noticed.)  There's definitely something to the whole \"you need to struggle a bit\" cliche.",

Professors would never be satisfied unless their students' papers were accepted by Nature. Anyone who wanted to go into industry was seen as \"giving up\" and were left to just float around until they managed to sneak through or just dropped out.\n\nProgram I'm at now is decent but by no means highly-ranked. However, my advisor's well-connected in industry and everyone coming out of this lab (Of the past 20 PhD students, 16 of them have finished and defended a thesis) ends up doing well for themselves.",

There is so much more to life than one's impact factor. So much more to contribute",

He has a classmate who got an undergraduate degree from Harvard, served in the military for a few years, and then enrolled in medical school. The veteran says he doesn't care for a prestigious specialty such as neurosurgeon or plastic surgeon. He just wants to get the degree and practice as a general practitioner or family pediatrician. I think the man is pretty wise. There's more to life than the biggest toy competition.",
