  "text": "Hi! Most of my textbooks I have for my program are in pdf form and I like to be able to both highlight and write directly on the pdf so I can take notes in the margins. I\u2019ve used acrobat but the drawing tool is clunky and inconvenient. Is there something smoother? I\u2019m using a windows 10 Lenovo 2 in 1 with a stylus.\n\n(Also easy storage in some sort of cloud would be great but not absolutely necessary)",

          "text": "I\u2019ve been using OneNote for everything else but the idea of putting a whole textbook on a page wasn\u2019t great BUT I realized I could save my textbooks to the desktop or google drive or whatever and just print the chapter for that week to onenote and do it that way so it\u2019s easier to navigate. I am a little nervous about after school\u2019s out because I\u2019ve had issues transferring my notebooks before and losing access to my school account but I think I should be ok provided I just save a copy of the notebook to my desktop with the right permissions.",
