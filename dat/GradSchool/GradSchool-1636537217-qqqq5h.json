  "text": "I'm a Master's degree student. I did all my courses, only the dissertation(or thesis?) left. I got time till next june. I should have started studying months ago, the problem is... I don't have a thesis topic yet. I talked to my supervisor(via online) like 6 months ago, she gave me an extremely vague topic like \"analysis of x\", we haven't talked ever since. I cannot do anyting about this topic because it is too broad. Why she gave me this, I don't understand. shouldn't it be something like \"analysis of xxx under xxx in xxx etc.\"  like something unique.  Anyway, I did nothing whole summer, ignoring  this. \n\nAfter September, I started to worry. Then I procrastinate for straight TWO MONTHS. Played Skyrim and Dota2, went outside for walking the WHOLE DAY. I walked 20-25 km's a day(few times a week). Whenever I try to start researching, My body prevents me, I feel extremely stressful then I start to play Skyrim to relax. \n\nNow I am afraid to e-mail my supervisor, she would be mad at me like \" where have you been! I thought  you were studying, but you wasted all your time instead!\" I saw a nightmare about her scolding me.\n\n Now here I am stuck. I don't have a good idea for topic. If I contact her she will be mad, also she probably won't help me about topic again. I am considering quitting. The Master's degree has been a stressful experience that devour my peace of mind. Always looming behind me to remind me, I should study instead doing something else.  \n\nPlease tell me anything, you may even insult me, I just want some words from you guys.\n\nedit: thank you for everyone helping me here. I tried so hard to start researching today. Then immediately I started to feel sick, nauseaus, also there was this unbearable headache. My body started shaking, I got out to get some fresh air. Then I removed my working materials(pencil and a paper) from my sight. I decided not to start today. Now I'm feeling better. Nausea is gone, thank god. Health is the most important thing on this earth. Life is the most beautiful thing ever happened to everyone, health is a requirement for us to live. I guess I need some professional help here, something weird is going on about me when I sit to start studying.  I also edited my first paragraph about AskAcademia thing. Please ignore that other post.",

      "text": "It sounds like you have extreme anxiety, I would talk to both your advisor and a therapist about how to move forward. I think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself; it has been a shitty couple of years for all of us and the stress of graduate school isn\u2019t helping any of us either. I went though something similar. Last spring I finished my first year of my PhD, joined a lab, and then found myself absolutely paralyzed by anxiety. I had been working through burnout for a couple of years and of course it came to a head during COVID and grad school cause I hadn\u2019t addressed it. I am now on month 2 of a 3 month (unpaid) break and loving it. Already excited to go back. Being honest with your advisor and a doctor will help immensely. I can\u2019t speak as to what your advisor\u2019s reaction will be but a good advisor would take your mental health seriously and try to plan ahead knowing you can\u2019t get the past back. I wish you all the best, hope things work out for you.",

If there is not, I start to worry about health. This is what happening to me now. Since my problem about thesis is solved, I immediately feel like I am sick and need to go to a hospital for peace in mind. My brain can't stay without worrying.",

      "text": "As someone who has anxiety and a tendency to procrastinate because I catastrophize, you really just need to email your adviser. Prolonging it isn't going to make it any better. Yeah, the best time would have been months ago, but the second best time is now. \n\nIf your deadline is next june, I don't think it's really all that unreasonable but it will still be a strict timeline. My friend wrote their whole dissertation in a few months because they had a job offer in August and needed to be done, so a Master's thesis should be doable in a semester. Maybe that depends on your field, idk. My friend and I are in the social sciences, so their biggest hurdle was collecting data from a survey, but mTurk responses came back in literally two days. If you're in STEM, it might be a bigger issue. \n\nIf you want, before emailing your adviser reaching out for help, maybe take a week and devote yourself to consistently studying the topic she told you about, keeping in mind things you are interested in and would like to follow up on. Put in a decent amount of hours every day, but give yourself micro goals so you can show yourself you're making progress. Then, before you contact your adviser, type out a document outlining potential research questions and how you might go about examining them. Maybe include a brief outline of a potential paper based on the articles you have read (Zotero/Mendeley would help a lot if you don't already use it), and *then* meet with your adviser. At that point, you can tell her that you have done some reading on X, and these are some potential ideas you've had so she can provide feedback on that and maybe give you some more direction. Having *something* to discuss is usually more productive than having nothing.",

They gave me the research field I need to focus. I did a lot research on the field for weeks. I found good thesis topic ideas. We discussed them, they told me one of the topics is good enough for a master's degree thesis. So thankfully I'm ready to start. Thank you again, your reply guided me.",

      "text": "> I posted something like this on r/AskAcademia , they lashed me out, telling me how stupid I am, got all the downvotes.\n\nWhat a wild misrepresentation of what happened. I read your post over there, but didn't comment myself. I did however read all of the other comments, and while they might not have been as coddling as you'd like, they all made very good points.\n\nI do sympathise about anxiety, and you clearly have that by the bucket load. But you're an adult, responsible for your own degree, and you instead basically checked out of it. You procrastinated. You avoided reaching out or asking more questions. And that is on *you*.\n\nYou originally went to your supervisor with a topic, so clearly you're able to think of one yourself. So when she shot that down and suggested a different area, you should have researched that general area and figured out what specific aspect to focus on. At the graduate level supervisors give you guidance, they're not meant to hold your hand.\n\n> she gave me an extremely vague topic like \"analysis of x\"\n\nThat was guidance.\n\n> Why she gave me this, I don't understand. shouldn't it be something like \"analysis of xxx under xxx in xxx etc.\"\n\nThat would be hand holding.\n\n> Anyway, I did nothing whole summer, ignoring this.\n\nThat is when you should have been researching the \"vague topic\", to figure out what would be a good and more specific research question.\n\nYou need to just email her. Things can only get worse the longer you leave it. Have you in any way looked at the broader topic and familiarised yourself with the background? Because that will help your case, and make it easier to try and work towards a research question.\n\nYou also need to talk to some kind of counselling service, because your anxiety is causing you massive problems.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nOne thing I will say in your defence (or rather against your supervisor) is that it is strange that she hasn't at least checked in at some point in the last 6 months to ask what research question you settled on and how it is going. Doesn't excuse your actions (or lack thereof) but doesn't look good for her either.",

      "text": "Just talk to your advisor. Tell her you think the topic is too broad and ask her if you can talk through narrowing it down to something more focused and doable. Tell her you have had a hard time getting started because the topic is so broad that it is slightly overwhelming. \n\nAs a former professor I can tell you with 200% certainty she wants to see you succeed and is there to support you. She doesn't assume you have been reading and writing non stop, but you might want to be prepared with a couple resources on the topic so you can start to narrow in on something you're interested in. Maybe start reading something to begin thinking about it. Ask her for reading/research suggestions. \n\nDon't give up. You're so close. This isn't the insurmountable mountain it appears to be. You've acknowledged you anxiety, which is a bit strong now. I always got started my leaving the emotion on the back burner for just a minute and try to start doing Anything. Everything always seems to tumble into place after you get going. \n\nBut definitely talk to your advisor. With communication, your professors are generally eager to help and hopefully, with a clearer pathway to your goal, you will be able to bang this thing out in no time.",

This is a health issue, so go after it like you would if you\u2019d broken a bone. Get treatment, secure reasonable accommodations if you need them. You can succeed, but you will have much bigger hurdles to overcome as long as your mental health isn\u2019t addressed. And that\u2019s really not ideal, right? \n\nIt\u2019s okay to ask your advisor for help, too. I suspect they gave you a broad topic so you could do some legwork and come back with questions. It\u2019s possible there was a miscommunication somewhere along the way. Regardless, you can go over your concerns and paths forward with a therapist.",
