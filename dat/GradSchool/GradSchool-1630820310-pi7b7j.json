  "text": "So most people probably had their first week back.  We had a ton of new students and faces in our program.  I decided it was a good idea to have a students-only get-together and introductions for them, so we (a group of senior students) invited all the new graduate students (and postdocs/research fellows, and of course rest of our program) out to an outside patio of a local wings place and bought plates of wings and fries as a bit of a \"welcome to the program\" event.  We made sure to spent time to get to know them and engage with them.\n\n**I figured, what other activities or things have you all done to help ease the new students into their lives out here?  What ideas or things can you share to help foster friendships?**\n\nTalking with our current (and former) students, the feedback I've received during COVID was that some students felt very disconnected from the program and just ignored.  Our new students are coming in and who knows what will happen two months from now.  I want to build opportunities for some strong friendships or something so that if we have another round of campus shutdown or something that our new colleagues, who many have moved far away from home to be here, can still survive and succeed academically and socially.",

      "text": "Like your program, our program had a students-only get together off campus. Almost everyone made it, so that was good. My only thought would be to find multiple times to do that, with multiple formats, so that there are more chances for students to feel that they can approach the group organically. \n\n\nI noticed that some of that connection in my program is less in things the department actively coordinates, and more in the general atmosphere they've cultivated. Often, because parking is hot garbage at my college, most of us arrive to the building early, and since our cohort meets in these conference room, we trickle in early and inevitably start talking. Our faculty encourages that, so even *without* official events, we've naturally become more comfortable with each other. \n\n\nOne final thing: if you *do* plan events, please make sure at least most of your students can go! Our Graduate College offers events, but nearly all of them are during the busiest part of the day, so it's been impossible for folks in my program to go unless we skip class. :(",

          "text": "Haha yeah our graduate college also schedules events in the middle of the day.  Like guys...  The more senior people have a ton of meetings and the newer students have classes.  Then they complain they don't get enough engagement...  \n\nOurs was near the end of Friday right before our day usually ends.  So it's been great in engagement.  Glad your program has that culture baked in!  I usually just make it right on time as I budget my time in hours or 30 minute sections and try to get the most out of them.",

      "text": "I love that idea! One of our graduate teachers used to host tea get togethers about every other week that he would invite all of the grad students to to get to know them. None of the students who were originally from the school would ever come, it was all just the transfers, but we had fun.\n\nMy suggestion to anyone trying to make friends with the new kids is to don't stop asking them out to do things. I am extremely introverted and when I first moved, I didn't have the mental energy to go out drinking after classes with people right away but a few months in, once I knew people better, I would have loved to.",

          "text": "Definitely a great idea! One of our newer faculty members is a huge tea guy.  Part of his thing is to offer Asian tea in his office! \n\nThat's definitely true with the invitations.  Sometimes people really want to go but for X, Y, and Z reasons they just can't.  But always creating new opportunities seems to help everyone come out of their shells;",
