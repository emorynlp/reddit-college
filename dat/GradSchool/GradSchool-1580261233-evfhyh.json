  "title:": "Recent Suicide of a PhD Student",
  "text": "I defended two months ago and just got back from a postdoctoral interview in which the 7th year doctoral graduate student took his own life a month prior. While we, as graduate students, know personally and professionally the toll that a career in research takes on the mental health of young professionals, this situation seemed all too familiar yet shocking for me.\n\nI briefly met him a year ago at a conference. This PhD student was extremely intelligent, had acquired his own funding (F31), had awesome publications (2 co-authors, 1 first author), and had a great lab environment. His mentor is/was very supportive of his progress, way more than mine. He was a month or two away from defending and his paper came out just today (from a journal that my submitted manuscript was rejected). For all that work and effort, it feels so empty to be wasted and I have nothing but deep sympathy for this lab and his family going through this situation.\n\nTo the downtrodden of /r/gradschool, I just want to say that if you're feeling down and out, your situation and feelings are completely valid. Try to seek out help from therapists, family, friends, or whatever you find solace and validation in. If you need to quit and leave grad school due to extreme mental health challenges, I and all other graduate students are with you. Nothing is worth taking your life.\n\nEdit: Posting for clarity (as done in the comments below):\n\nThe National Grad Crisis Line\n\n1.877.GRAD.HLP\u00a0(1.877.472.3457)\n\n[http://gradresources.org/crisis/](http://gradresources.org/crisis/)",

      "text": "I just popped onto reddit because I needed someone to reassure me that people with mental illness can, in fact, succeed in grad school. And this is the first post that I saw. \n\nI was going to ask, if you have a mental illness, how you do it? How do you go from day to day? I have bipolar disorder and the last five months have been some of the worst of my life. The stress of my prelims launched me into a mania that lasted all the way through winter break. I'm a different person when I'm like that, and certainly not a person who is working on her dissertation. \n\nNow the pendulum has swung. I am so low right now that I'm reading fucking Camus to talk myself out of suicide. I have a kinda important meeting with my committee on Friday and I have no new writing for them. I haven't changed clothes since...I'm guessing it's been five or six days? I can't go more than five minutes without breaking down. I'm terrified of what I will do during the meeting. \n\nPlease tell me that the mental illness won't always win. Please tell me that I can do this.",

What mental health supports are you getting, and what more could be available to you?  I would focus on that first and foremost.  If you have to postpone your committee meeting, or even use the meeting to discuss taking a medical leave of absence for the rest of the semester, that's a much better use of your time right now than trying to throw together some writing.  Best of luck, friend.",

          "text": "I don't know if there's any data on bipolar disorder in particular, but the prevalence of depression in grad students is about 40% according to several studies, and the prevalence of anxiety is also around 40%. Most of the students are not officially diagnosed though even though they show significant symptoms on assessments. I think, by these statistics alone, you can easily conclude that people with mental illness in grad school are far from alone. It's just that no one openly admits it.",

It is difficult to explain because people that read it cannot see what they have not experienced (Believe me I have been there). Do it if you get a very good school, a good stipend (no loans or your savings) and you are completely sure who will be your advisor and you have a good match in personality, ask other people in the lab and his graduates as postdocs or the ones that are in the industry that graduate from his lab. The Ph.D. is just the start (postdocs, assistance, tenure, etc), so make sure you are in complete love for the field and you do not care about anything else (especially finances), and you can postpone so many things like family, housing, etc. Ph.D. only makes sense if you want to be an academic or you only want to do research and if there is a real chance in your area to get a job, look for the statistics.",

I had a meeting two days ago in which I overheard a faculty member having a conversation before the start of the meeting about suicide and how it\u2019s happening at an alarming rate among students and young people. I thought it was pretty insensitive to be having that conversation out in the open like that where anyone who came by could hear, but some of the things said made it worse.\n\nI\u2019ve been mad about that since and really want to avoid speaking to this faculty member because idk how much I can keep myself from berating them haha\n\nBut yeah if anyone is having any suicidal thoughts or knows someone who might be, we\u2019re all here for you and we love you. I have full faith that you\u2019ll be able to push through and find better times soon",

International students in areas where their mother tongue isn't the same or struggle with their language is the worst off, and I can't fathom what people have to go through before they fall through the cracks.\n\nI wish there were more awareness around this issue at conferences and other academic meetings in general to really make PIs everywhere and others understand that this shouldn't be treated as a isolated issue but as a grad student issue.\n\nAnd perhaps include this as a metric in academic rankings so we can make informed decisions not just based on academic output but on HUMAN metrics as well.",

I was overly comparing myself to others, had repeatably gotten denied grants, and was starting to loathe people in my cohort. Oh and my data and experiments were failing, so I had no usable thesis project. In my personal life I was uncontrollably smoking weed everyday to cope (albeit unhealthier than getting an ESA) and trying to balance a fledgling relationship and familial issues. By the 5th year, my longtime partner had broken up with me and I was lonelier than ever. I remember a time when I entered my apartment, looked up at the ceiling, and was pissed that I didn't have a place to hang myself.\n\nI was lucky that I had other grad and post-grad students to talk to or I don't know what would have happened. Through them, I sought therapy, got on medication, and learned how to practice self-care when I needed to. It was hard, it was exhausting, but helped me get shit out of the door and set boundaries with my PI and program. While I was privileged to have the resources (time, job security, and friends), not many do and, you're right, it's very hard to acquire those. \n\nIt doesn't end after grad school. I still struggle. Learning about this student and his life really kinda put my own mortality into perspective and I try to pay it forward by having lunch or coffee conversations with other students struggling in my program. Hopefully they can get something from just venting. Feel free to shoot me a DM if you need it.",

However I think the negative response to your comment is a really good example of us all saying we care about each other and psoting links to hotlines but when someone does say it's hard and they're struggling and maybe this is a way of reaching out, it's not well received. Sure, it may not be in the most appropriate context but it's definitely relevant and a very true, overlooked problem with simply reaching out to services for help.\n\nI hope you get through it and it's easier for you to get what you need, eventually.

It's a great thing to provide resources for people, but it's important to acknowledge the reality of it because for people who have tried and know it's sometimes really hard to reach out seeing encouragement to just take the step to get help can be even more discouraging. It's also useful for people who are supporting those struggling to know what they're going through and the next steps and importance of following up with them.\n\nI've recently had a similar experience with my doctor sending my case to a specialist who made me feel like I was a bit of a lost cause after the number of professionals I've tried to go to and all the medications that haven't worked. It really sucks, especially when it's so hard to reach out for help in the first place, and sustaining that help despite obstacles that you have negative energy for is so hard.",
