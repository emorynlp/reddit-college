  "text": "Hello everyone! I really need a bit of insight and advice for my future. Sorry if this is not acceptible for this sub, I'm sure mods will delete if thats the case.\n\nI'm 29 years old, doing my Ph.D., studying for my qualification exam. I am living in a somewhat corrupt country, especially regarding academia and I feel like I have not accomplished anything valuable in my academic career. \n\nMy country does not value science and many academic work relies on nerworking and favoritism. I tried my best for 5 years since masters but at this point I feel so beat down. I can't stop comparing myself to my other friends, many went to Europe for Ph.D. and keep working there. They started their life while I'm still struggling to even find a project to work to put in my CV. I had many financial and family issues that set me back to pursue studying abroad and now I feel so inferior to them. This took a toll on my mental health and this in turn killed my motivation to work to get better in my career. \n\nI know I need to pass my exam for starters. But I need some insight from you as I really want to pursue a good academic career in Europe/abroad. I really want to get my career and life together, stronger. So I want to ask;\n\n\u2022 Am I late to achieve anything for this (age close to 30)? \n\u2022 Can I achieve a better career after PhD (post doc etc)?\n\u2022 What should I do to get my career more fullfilling and more attractive for future employers?\n\u2022 How can I stop comparing myself to others?\n\u2022 Any other advice you think suitable for me?\n\nI'll appreciate any comment, thank you in advance!",

      "text": "It\u2019s definitely not too late for you to achieve something. I didn\u2019t start my PhD until I was 30. I had the same thoughts of what can I accomplish or will I be too old and got some advice that solidified my decision. You\u2019re going to turn (age) no matter what, do you want to be (age) with a PhD or without one. \n\nYou can definitely build a career after graduation. In my opinion your PhD is where you learn the skills and the post-doc is where you truly apply them. I would look into potential post docs and see what they require or what they\u2019re looking for in a candidate. This is what I\u2019ve been doing, when I find a post doc that looks interesting I see what skills they want and then look for ways to learn them, whether through classes or webinars. \n\nI don\u2019t have great advice for not comparing yourself to others, I still struggle with that myself. I have classmates who have already published papers and presented and at times it makes me feel like I\u2019m behind, but I also work full time in addition to school full time so it\u2019s not a fair comparison. They also have access to databases where I will likely have to collect my own data. It\u2019s a little cliche but just remember that everyone\u2019s journey is different.\n\nFinal advice, I just took my qualification exam and I won\u2019t lie it was brutal. Manage your time wisely and don\u2019t overthink or get hung up on a question. Write what you can off the top of your head and move on. You can go back and edit later but just focus on getting your thoughts down.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for this answer! Looking into post docs & doing related courses sounds a great start for me. I'm sure it will at least provide me a sense of way for the future.\n\nIt is true that everyone have their own journey, but it is so easy to forget this watching other's accomplishments. I think it is a very common issue in academia to compare yourself with others and I am not even sure it will go away even if I have my own achievements. It all has to do with perspective I guess.\n\nThank you also about the exam. I am dreading it as I know it is brutal, and we also have an oral exam after the written one which is even worse. Thankfully I have a good amount of time to study. Meanwhile I will be looking into courses and webinars like you suggested.\n\nThank you a lot and I wish the best for you!",
