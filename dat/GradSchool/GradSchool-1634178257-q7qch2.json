As the director of an MS and PhD program, I do not consider the MPS to be a credential on the path to admission.\n\nMy department also has a successful MPS program. Those students go on to do good things, but rarely go to graduate school in the field.",

If you have one of them and present as having the other, you will not get respect. \n\nThat is, if you have an MPS and are passing it off as an MS, you will not get respect because it is not an MS. \nBut if you have an MPS and are looking for employment requiring the skill set you picked up",
