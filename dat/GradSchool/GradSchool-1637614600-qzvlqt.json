  "text": "I go to ucla (psych major/cog sci minor)  but have an opportunity to be a TA at a smaller college nearby (and possibly ucla too) for a prof that works at both schools. It seems like an interesting experience but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the time commitment. I\u2019m not necessarily interested in teaching but I also don\u2019t know what I wanna do with my degree yet. I already have a super busy schedule so I only wanna commit to things that will really help advance me academically/career-wise. Any insight?",

      "text": "I'm a PhD student. Yes it will look good as an extra but not if it is at the expense of getting good grades. It becomes important to show some teaching experience, I believe, when applying for post-doc roles that include teaching. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are just interested in your CV then there are more productive ways to spend your time. However, its a good way to earn some extra money if you want that, and you will really solidify and improve your understanding of the topic that you teach. You might even enjoy it.",

      "text": "Short answer: Yes but only if you show commitment. Only did it for a semester? Not gonna be a huge impact. Applicants who had experience being TA's usually do it for 2-3 years, which shows commitment.",

      "text": "I TAed as an undergrad but not because I knew I wanted to teach at the university level. Will it look \u2018good\u2019? Maybe, if you do a good job. It might get you a good letter of recommendation from someone who\u2019s seen you work hard and communicate well. However. If you\u2019re already busy this can eat up a tonne of your time and leave you either neglecting your coursework or neglecting yourself. In my opinion, it\u2019s only worth doing if 1) you are being paid. Unpaid positions are not worth it. Even for the line on your CV. You\u2019d be better off doing volunteer work in your community. 2) you can guarantee the time commitment is minimal and you will not be stretching yourself too thin. 3) you are interested in seeing what teaching is like and keeping it in mind as a career option. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely easy to be exploited as a TA\u2014not that it\u2019s the norm. But in my experience most people I know who manage to TA for one or even two semesters of undergrad get nothing out of it but stress.",

      "text": "I think most jobs and grad schools would look favorably on this work experience, but I think there are probably more valuable things you could do, depending on what kind of job or grad school you're going after. If you thinking about a Ph.D., focus on research experiences. If you're thinking about clinical mental health, focus on getting some clinical or adjacent experience (including crisis line work or peer education work).",

I LOVE what I teach, though, and my advisor was incredible about actually teaching me how to do the work. I have a peer who is a TA who absolutely hates it, considers it a waste of time.\n\nI suggest asking if you can audit a class before agreeing to it.",
