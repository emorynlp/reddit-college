  "text": "I was supposed to go study in Germany last year, but instead I completed 2.5 semesters worth of credits completely at home. Now the first in-person semester is finally starting, I have however only a few credits left besides the master thesis, not to mention half of them are still digital. How do I make the most out of the remaining program? What's the most important aspects of studying abroad?",

      "text": "I don't know what your program is, but if it were me I would spend as much time as possible seeing everything I possibly could (and eating as much as I possibly could), and maximizing the time I spent experiencing the culture. I'd try to spend as little time as possible in my apartment--only for classes and sleeping. \n\nSo many people in Germany speak English, so I'm sure if you found a cool event to go to it would be easy to meet people and practice your German without getting lost. They also have a pretty developed public transit system, so it wouldn't be too hard to take a train outside of the city to experience other parts of Germany. If there are other people in your program studying abroad, you could arrange an informal field trip somewhere.",

          "text": "There are many things to do for a student : traveling, social events, student clubs, academic courses, research programs, etc. I'm wondering which part will be the most valuable and irreplaceable. I could for example get a part time job as reearch assistant, but it would mean sacrificing a lot of time for traveling. Or take more (in-person) courses then needed, but end up with less leisure time.",

              "text": "I think your degree program is relevant here. If you are in a German language program, for example, a research position may not be the best bet compared to learning more about the culture and language on a personal level. If it's a social science/STEM program that offers an abroad opportunity, then cultural knowledge might not get you a job so the research program would be #1 priority. I didn't see in your post where you mentioned what program you were in, so I left it kind of vague.",
