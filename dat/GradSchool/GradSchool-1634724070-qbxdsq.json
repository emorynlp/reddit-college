  "text": "Dear fellow Redditors,\n\nI am currently trying to find the perfect title for the master thesis that I would like to do and I need your help. I would like to find out how important is the knowledge of foreign languages in the hotel industry in a certain city, but I don't want to do quantitative research (highly unskilled in this). How should I formulate the master thesis name so that it reflects that quantitative research will be done, eg interviews with hotel stakeholders?\n\nThank you!",
