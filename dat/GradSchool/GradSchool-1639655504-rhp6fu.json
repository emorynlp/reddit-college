  "text": "So the situation is that I was admitted directly from my undergraduate to a PhD in 2020. However, I\u2019ve very quickly realized that a tenure-track professor position is not my end goal, and I really don\u2019t like research as much as I enjoy teaching. I\u2019m on track to get my master\u2019s this coming spring and I\u2019ve been thinking about leaving with it, but it\u2019s very faux pas to do so in my department. They make it clear that everyone who is accepted is understood to be pursuing the PhD, and why wouldn\u2019t they with how much it costs to fund someone, but those who bow out early are very alienated.\n\nRight now I\u2019m still leaning towards sticking it out because of my age (started in the program when I was 20), but it\u2019s definitely taken a big toll on my physical and mental health to the point where I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll make it another 3-4 years. Yesterday, though, I got a job ad in my inbox for a lecturer position at a university close to my family, master\u2019s minimum but PhD preferred. I think my chances might be low but considering it was the first thing that got me excited in a while, I figured it was worth applying to.\n\nHowever, they require 3 academic references, and due to aforementioned situation I don\u2019t know how to go about this. I can think of maybe 1 person who would support this, and definitely not my advisor. I don\u2019t want to burn bridges for a position I probably won\u2019t even get but I feel like I\u2019ll regret not applying. Do I put references and not tell them? Do I ask the \u2018exiled\u2019 master\u2019s students if there\u2019s anyone I can trust? Am i way overthinking this?",

      "text": "It doesn\u2019t sound like your department is very supportive of varied professional paths. However, I\u2019d start with sharing your truth with one faculty member you trust. \u201cI love teaching, but research isn\u2019t as fulfilling to me as I imagined, and I don\u2019t think I have the stamina to navigate the academic job market. I saw this job ad, and it was really exciting to imagine myself in a position like this. I know you want to see your grads finish with PhDs, but I was wondering what advice you have to offer in this circumstance.\u201d\nThey\u2019ll probably urge you to stay. Or tell you they aren\u2019t qualified to advise you because they did something different. But you\u2019re putting your truth out there and there are actual protections and policies against retaliation.  After you discuss with a faculty member, reach out to your career services for more advice. You don\u2019t have to stay doing something you don\u2019t want to do, but don\u2019t put all your eggs in the other basket either.  My general sense is if it\u2019s an MA with PhD preferred position, and you don\u2019t have a whole lot of teaching experience you wouldn\u2019t be a competitive candidate for the position, and you should keep that in mind as well.",
