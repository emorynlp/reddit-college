  "text": "So yeah I'd really like to stick to a routine and get 7-8 hours of sleep a day, but sometimes it's just really hard.\n\nI've found that going to the gym every day doesn't usually work out. I'd go every other day and just watch what I eat (I personally _really_ hate gaining weight). I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep though, otherwise I'm exhausted the whole day. I also try to work out early in the morning before heading to the lab.\n\nJust curious how everyone else does it.",

      "text": "Just my experience but:\n\nUntil the pandemic changed my routine, I regularly did about 3hrs of powerlifting a day 5-6 days a week following the Hybrid Performance Method. The most important thing I did was make my fitness a major priority in my life. I would work pretty hard to either A) get out of the office before 5pm or B) plan around days where I needed to work late and either go early or take that day as a rest day. Depending on the nature of the social event sometimes it was also early enough that I could be at the gym by 6pm, although that was not typically ideal. For me I'm best in the gym between about 4pm-5pm. So what I did was make sure I got into the office early enough to get all my work done and then as soon as I'd finished my reading or writing for the day, I would head over to the gym. I kept a gym bag, my lifting belt and shoes, and everything else I needed in my car so it was just a short walk over to the campus weight room. \n\nKeeping that schedule was a \\*major\\* factor in my fitness success (and thus why the pandemic has totally torpedoed everything I was doing). My other 'key' to success was to realize that I was never going to be a competitive lifter, or a body builder, or the hottest guy there. And thats a hard mindset to break. But once I realized that I was the only measure of my own success, I accepted that having lazy days, taking extra time off, missing my lifts, and falling off the program wasnt the end of the world. I progressed pretty well in the two years before pandemic, so for me as long as I was satisfied I didnt get caught up every time I faltered. I recognized that very often my school/life stress would creep into my gym performance and I accepted that. Again I also managed my program periodization around this. My schedule had me shoot for a personal record (a max weight lift attempt) every 6 weeks, and that week the physical stress would often overwhelm my ability to do work. So with a little planning I was often able to place those high strain periods in between major assignments and due dates. I even eventually used the long-term glow from my 'heavy days' as fuel to get through finals and my comps exams. \n\nBut sometimes its really hard. Its hard to get on schedule, to stay on schedule, and to keep work and recreation separate. Its really hard to turn down beers with the cohort to go to the gym and I sacrificed a lot of socialization to do it. Sometimes I pushed my workouts too hard and fucked up some stuff because I simply was too burnt out to do my work. And sometimes I canceled workouts to get shit done and stay on top of my work. But ultimately with fitness, there is always an excuse that will get in the way, always a damn good reason not to go and work out. If you arnt willing to \\*carve time out\\* you wont do it. For a long time I didnt. And then one day I realized I'd probably burn out if I didnt become more active and do that for myself. So I did, for all the good and bad its brought me.",

If I had a 60 minute run scheduled, I can just do 20-30 minutes.

I find that if I workout too late in the evening, it\u2019s harder to get to sleep. I need probably 4+ hours after completing a workout before getting to sleep.

      "text": "Honestly, it sounds cliche but u MUST get into a routine. It doesn't really matter what/how you workout if you don't do it regularly.\n\nFind a program that you fancy (personally, I do body weight workouts that run between 20-45 mins a session), and force yourself to follow it. The first 10-14 days or so will be super tough, as you'll give yourself a bunch of excuses not to do it, but if you can tough it out and get over that initial hump, then every day after you'll almost feel weird if you don't. Once you get to the point where you don't think, you just do, then your mind is freed up to do other things, and you'll notice it doesn't really inconvenience your schedule anymore.\n\nSome tips that I find helpful: working out for hours a day might work for some, but if you're just tryna stay healthy/keep fit, a good circuit that runs at most an hour should be more than enough. Also, working out in the morning might sound terrible, but I find that, for those initial 10-14 days, doing it in the morning makes you not realize how tired you are and you kinda just go and do it (plus you feel great for the rest of the day), however, find a time that works for you! No point in working out in the morning if all your free time comes in the afternoon. Again, consistency and building a routine is key!\n\ntl,dr; make urself get into a routine, find a time that works for u and stick to it, quality>quantity when it comes to the type of workout\n\neverything else should be pretty subjective in terms of how you want to do things",

      "text": "Before trauma hit me recently I spent 7 months of quarantine losing 73lbs. I ate very well with a caloric deficit, and found that telling myself, \"I can't wait to workout after work\" was such a privilege. It meant I was healthy and mobile and honestly it kept me sain and kept all sorts of mental problems at bay during this time. I worked out 6 days a week and just thought of every workout as a privilege and a method to keeping my sanity positive. It was amazing. I would workout for 2 hrs, sometimes 2.5hrs and start school studies by 630pm until 11pm or midnight. Weekends, involved a very early morning Saturday workout and studying for 12+ hours with walking breaks outside cold or not. I also worked out at home! I thankfully had everything and ordered a few extra things as they came in stock on various websites. I cut down the drive, the getting ready to look presentable and the looking for weights etc. Etc. I'm now getting back into that mindset knowing that it will save me and it will for sure save you too. I'm using the gym for a little social/confidence due to all the mental stuff I've battled. I can't wait to go back to home workouts 80% of the time. Make time for exercise 5-6 days a week as this will be the main combat method to battling grad school and mental problems that arise from a pandemic, grad school stress, working full time, possibly zero social life, less time with family, an extra cheat day from stressors and more. You can do this!!",

I always tried to park my car where it would be easy to access after the gym. I stuck with it and the routine worked well enough for me to go to the gym consistently. Part of why it worked is because I went to the gym on campus, so it wasn't a big ordeal to stop by after class. Also I am much more motivated to work out when I am in a gym rather than when I am at home and this was before the pandemic. I also noticed I was much more motivated to use a treadmill when Friends was on TV.\n\nAs for sleep I just tried to go to sleep at the same time every day and wake up at the same time every day. I just planned these times around my earliest responsibility in the morning (for example, if I had a class at 10 on Tuesdays I would try to wake up at 7 every day).",

I also don\u2019t go to the gym, I very much prefer running 5-6 miles per day rain or shine. If you\u2019re not comfortable with that, I recommend making an effort to get out to run/walk on the days it\u2019s nice instead of gym. It\u2019s a lot easier to work out when the exercise is right out your front door.  \n\nAs for sleep, you just have to make it a priority. It is VERY tough to accept that you should trade one less hour of studying for an extra one of sleep, but being well rested makes the world of difference. I burnt out like sophomore year of college believing *I* was the special person that could get 5-6 hours of sleep and function perfectly fine. After I got into the routine of extra sleep, I realized I was working and studying more efficiently in the less hours that I had.",

      "text": "So I've been really focusing on working out regularly since lockdown started (using resistance bands at home) - here are a few things that really helped me:\n\n1. Starting slow. Finding 3-4 hours a week should be doable, and as someone else has said already, if you can't find that amount of time in a week, some other things may need to be de-prioritized.\n\n2. Consistency. I go to lab at night due to COVID restrictions, and I have found a schedule that works really well for me is working out 2-3 hours before I need to go in. \n\n3. Be flexible with your workouts and ease in. The most helpful thing for me has been the realization that you don't need to be working out for 2 hours at a time for it to be beneficial - find a routine that works for you, embrace being a beginner, and you'll find yourself way more willing and excited to exercise.\n\nIf you have a set of resistance bands (can be found on Amazon relatively inexpensively) and a pair of dumbbells (optional), I have a 3-day Push/Pull/Legs split routine I can send - it's what I've been doing in my living room for the past year!",

Once you learn how to safely do the basics there is so much more (cleans, shoulder presses, snatching, etc). \n\nThese were once all movements I was dying to master because of the simplicity matched with how it tears up your entire body. The promise of kettlebell training actually delivers. \n\nI\u2019ve also found kettlebell training to be protective against injury while making my entire body functionally strong. I\u2019ve honestly never felt better after doing this for the last year since the pandemic hit and the gyms closed. \n\nLastly, there is this famous \u201cwhat the hell\u201d effect when it comes to kettlebell training as it makes doing a lot of other unrelated things (eg. Running, jumping, biking) a lot easier. Couldn\u2019t recommend it enough!",

There is no job, grad school included, that should preclude someone from finding a miniscule amount of time to exercise.  And if the expectations are such that they do, it's worth reconsidering one's advisor.  No job is worth sacrificing your well-being.  There's a story about how George W. Bush used to set aside about an hour every morning to exercise.  My opinion has always been that, if POTUS can find a way to prioritize it, surely anyone else can too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to gym during the afternoon, about an hour a day, and generally play tennis like 6-8 hours a week (on average).",

I was a biochemistry student so would frequently be doing things like setting up a reaction and letting it run for an hour and a half - perfect span of time for me to get a workout in, get cleaned up, and back to the lab for the next step. I found it to be a really good excuse to take a mental break from whatever I was working on.\n\nThen again, that only worked for me because my research group was fairly casual and hands-off about working hours. After moving to a more structured environment in fellowship where it would be inappropriate to disappear for 90 minutes mid-morning, I would change into exercise gear immediately after coming home from the lab and crank out my exercise before dinner.\n\nCertainly echo what everyone else has said about making exercise a priority - if you really want to work out, there's almost always wiggle room in your life for other things to be moved around.",

For the rest of the day I'd be like a zombie, drooling and falling asleep sitting up during work meetings. lol That's why am working out never worked for me but I am really trying to be able to pull it off. Any tips?",
