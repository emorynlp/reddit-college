  "text": "I wrote a paper in a historical/literary context outside of my typical wheelhouse and got an A- on the paper with reading recommendations that, in hindsight, should've been on my priority list in the first place. I have no excuses except that I was dumb enough not to think about these resources. I feel like a research failure this massive is a sign that I shouldn't be in this field, but what do y'all think? It is genuinely not about the grade, which I think is a generous mercy grade. I'd dump my impostor syndrome here but it's a genuine matter of whether I'm taking up a space that could go to a more thoughtful and organized human.",
