Right now my lab in pharma is 5 BS-level research associates and 5 PhD scientists, with #11 being a scientist who doesn\u2019t have a PhD but has worked her way up. Other companies I\u2019ve worked at have been a little less PhD-heavy but we still always had *some*.",

So I dug my own grave in that case (I should have taken one in the Fall, then the second in the Spring).\n\nAlso, don't even talk about the all-nighters I pulled during productions, pulling one of those after a 12 hour rehearsal was a monthly event for me.",
