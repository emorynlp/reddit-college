  "text": "I am a young American lawyer and I would like to transition into international relations. I don\u2019t want to do law much more, though I plan to work a while longer while I continue learning a language and saving some money.\n\n1. My BA is in history, but the international affairs courses I took in undergrad were fairly quantitative. I\u2019m not scared of numbers and understand I\u2019ll need them under any circumstance. But I would prefer a more qualitative program. Do these exist? If so, where should I look?\n2. My current thoughts are to simultaneously apply to the foreign service and MA programs in international affairs. Practice and academia both interest me, and in my experience, my best professors spent time working in the profession before becoming academics. I know I do not need the MA for the foreign service, but getting into the foreign service is not guaranteed, so I am open to getting the MA first. Other than debt and foregone earnings, what drawbacks are to getting the MA first, if any?\n3. How important is school prestige in the international affairs field? From my understanding, it\u2019s up there with law in terms of elitism if you want to go into academia or work for a think tank (both of which I am interested in). Is my understanding correct?\n4. I know PhDs are funded, but how is funding in IR masters programs, both in the US and abroad? Can tuition be paid for by the university if I work as a teaching or research assistant or something? Financing would be an obstacle, though not a major one. I am also very open to programs in Europe.\n5. Should I even get an MA first? I don\u2019t have a particular idea of what I\u2019d like to focus my studies on, but do IR PhD programs generally allow you to explore your interests a bit before you narrow your focus?\n\nThank you in advance, feel free to include other advice you have as well based on what I\u2019ve said. Some former professors have been very helpful, but I would like other opinions too. I know I am a ways off before I do these things, but I would like to have the information now so that I can start to plan my next steps accordingly.",

      "text": "I think I can answer at least most of your questions pretty well. I\u2019m a current IR MA student.\n\n1. For a more qualitative approach, there are programs out there, but they\u2019re less common certainly. I know some people that have done IR MAs at University of Chicago that had no quantitative background and were able to take a primarily qualitative approach. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more options, but that\u2019s the one I know of.\n\n2. Drawbacks to getting an MA I think are pretty much just limited to the cost and the opportunity cost of not working while doing it. Have you at least taken a practice foreign service exam to get an idea of where you\u2019re at? There\u2019s a free graded exam you can take on State\u2019s website that gives you a percentage chance that you\u2019d pass a real exam that I found pretty helpful.\n\n3. Prestige is pretty important. If you\u2019re wanting to go into academia or the think-tank world, it\u2019s extremely important. If you\u2019re wanting to go into the professional world in government, IGOs, or NGOs, it\u2019s still important, but it\u2019s mostly about networking and who you know it seems. Prestige schools tend to come with that built in though. If you go to Georgetown, you get access to the Georgetown alumni network for instance, which goes a long way to getting jobs. I\u2019m at one of the \u201cprestigious\u201d schools for IR. I\u2019m not on the job market yet, but I will say I\u2019m blown away by the services available to students here. There\u2019s job market workshops for every imaginable career field and career services is amazing. \n\n4. Funding at the MA level is relatively rare in the US, especially at top-tier schools, but not unheard of. Princeton for instance fully funds all of their MA students. The catch is that you have to get into Princeton. I got a scholarship at a different top-10 school that covers about half of my direct costs and talking to my cohort-mates, I think everyone got some level of funding this cycle, ranging from 30%-100% of direct costs, though 30% is of course far more common.\n\n5. As to whether to do an MA, that\u2019s a question for you. Typically though PhD programs are for people that have a pretty specific idea of what they want to do. For an MA you typically will want to have at least some idea of what you\u2019re interested in, but certainly not as specific as a PhD. When I started my MA program they even told us that we shouldn\u2019t feel stuck with our research background, i.e., we could still change our interests.\n\nMy other advice though is to really take a good honest look at the academic job market. It\u2019s a fucking dumpster fire. Tenure track jobs are few and far between, especially in the social sciences. There\u2019s some really great IR careers, and an MA may still be a great path for you (you\u2019ll probably be very employable with an MA and JD frankly). Just make sure you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into before you get too invested into the PhD track I guess is what I\u2019m saying.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have other questions!",

              "text": "I don't know what GULS is (Georgetown University Law School is my best guess? but I don't go to Georgetown). I know of at least one person in my cohort that has a JD. I don't know what their funding situation is, but my impression is that my program has a lot of funding to give out. The law school I think basically gives out no funding, because why would they? They have plenty of people willing to pay full sticker price.\n\nI honestly don't know a whole lot of what schools offer thesis based MAs and which don't. My school tries to straddle the boundary between professional and academic, and our program requires a thesis. I'm quite happy with the blend, it gives us a good opportunity to get both lots of theory as well as plenty of research methods and practical skills.",
