  "text": "I\u2019m currently TA\u2019ing for the first time. I teach the lab component of a class and grade the lab reports. I have a student who other tell me constantly complains about my grading of the labs and my instruction, but this student has never has actually addressed this with me directly. His labs are often of poor quality, but he refuses to ask questions even though I stress every lab that I am available to answer questions. I haven\u2019t said anything to him about his comments because it seems inappropriate to confront him about things he hasn\u2019t said to me directly.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m grading one of his labs now, and in the report he insults my instruction directly and says that my poor instruction and explanation is the reason why he couldn\u2019t do the lab calculations correctly. He even goes on to say that even help from \u201cwell-intentioned classmates\u201d failed to help him. Every other student has turned in acceptable work and if they had questions, they came to me. He rarely asks questions and then blames his poor grades on me. How do I handle this student? I\u2019m not sure how to grade the lab fairly at this point and I don\u2019t know if I should bring this up to the professor of the class.",

In my department, there was a student like this my fellow TA had in their class. The professor required that the student meet with them and the chair of our department to discuss his behavior in the class and what his plans are for improving it moving forward. My department chair can be kind of intimidating, so she did not put him with his attempt to blame the instructor and just made it real clear that his behavior was unacceptable. She also made it clear that improving his behavior was a condition for continuing to be enrolled in the class. I think the dean of students office was also looped in, as was our departmental adviser (who can put adviser's notes in a student's file), but I'm not sure. \n\nI'd also start cc'ing (or bcc'ing) the professor on all email communications with this student moving forward. If you feel like you can't objectively grade his work, it's fine to ask someone else to do it. Your professor can either grade it themselves, or find someone else to grade it.",

I forwarded it to the Professor and just replied, \"Thank you for your feedback, I've sent your comments to Dr. XX. You can address this with him.\"\n\nAs for how to handle this in general, give it about as much time as it's worth -- not much. Person comments about instructors and other students don't belong as part of a lab report anyway, so marking off for it wouldn't be inappropriate. Ask the professor to grade it. This is clearly a personal problem the student is having and honestly, I wouldn't worry about grading him either too high or too low -- he'll eventually shoot himself in the foot with this behavior anyway.",

      "text": "I used to have something similar happen all the time last year when I taught freshman labs. Especially because I am short and look young. In my experience this typically occurs because there is some type of mismatch between your expectation of the student\u2019s performance and the students expectation of you as an instructor. In this situation I would:\n\n1. Mention the situation to the professor, let them know that you plan to talk to the student but you would like to make sure they are aware of the situation beforehand. \n\n2. Pull the student aside and let them know their behavior is unacceptable. (Generally on syllabus day I give a talk about how we\u2019re all adults now and university classes rely on mutual respect to facilitate learning\u2026 and good grades. So I bring that up again but the student conduct section of your syllabus could work too in a pinch.)\n\n3. Give them an alternate outlet. Let them know that if they are upset with their grade they can email or come to office hours and you\u2019ll be happy to explain the grading and/or how you expected them to know that information from the class but they have to meet you halfway. The disrespect has to stop. \n\n4. If they continue (never had this happen tbh) I would do whatever nuclear option I have. Disruptive during class? Kick em out. Continues to write awful stuff on assignments? Record it all and make a formal complaint against them. They\u2019re still being petty? Start every class by reviewing the previous assignment, going over \u201ccommon mistakes\u201d (i.e. their mistakes) and explaining how they are wrong and how you taught them the correct way. \n\nYou can also show distributions(histograms) of the grades for the last assignment, obviously without names so it\u2019s anonymous. If there is one student stilling at a 50 while everyone else is at a 70-100 it\u2019s going to be pretty obvious that they\u2019re the only one that doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d and while all the other students won\u2019t know who the 50 belongs to, the bad student definitely will. \n\nMost students really just need an expectation on how to behave and once you set a clear line they generally don\u2019t cross it. The exception here is cultural differences such as the student coming from misogynistic/racist culture. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this as a white male, but I have had plenty of students look down on me because of my size/appearance/status/ect (we have a lot of Silicon Valley trust fund babies). Generally I just politely remind them that they pay the equivalent of a new low-end Mercedes per year just to come and learn from people like me and that I am the one who determines their grade in my lab at the end of the semester.",
