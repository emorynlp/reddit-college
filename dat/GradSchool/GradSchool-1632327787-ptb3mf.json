None of the other advisors in my program are taking students. I'm essentially being made to quit without being kicked out. \n\nI'm looking at other grad programs because I still am passionate about my project despite all the bullshit. But I really don't know if I can go through the admissions uncertainty and rigmarole again. Will it be easier compared to going in with only undergrad experience?",

What does it say about being advisor-less? In physics, you could demand that from the department head (or ombudsman) that you be assigned an advisor. Of course then you have the up hill battle of convincing someone who didn't want to take you on that you are a good student. Meaning you probably wouldn't get a good letter form them either.\n\nNot saying this is fair or good, but this is how it is.",

I wouldn't trust my former advisor with a letter of rec, but the other professors in the department were supportive and understanding of me and they probably would write me a good letter (at least to my face they were nice). They told me that they would have taken me on if they had funding and/or space. \n\nAm I still fucked despite that?",
