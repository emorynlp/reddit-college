  "title:": "I (junior in undergrad) had an entirely B+/B semester. Am I done for for competitive programs?",
  "text": "I am a linguistics major and transfer student whose GPA is only influenced by their junior and senior years. This was my 6th semester of college and my first semester (no classes in major) gave me a 3.5 overall.\n\nI\u2019ll be real; part of this was my fault and my own distractibility, part of it was having a *very* rough semester mentally speaking. I was on track to complete honors and did not perform as well as I was hoping to by any means (mostly comes down to testing terribly). \n\nI was hoping to apply to competitive grad school programs (MA/PhD) after college; should I just start looking for jobs instead? My GPA will come out closer to a 3.3 or 3.4 when I was fully anticipating being closer to 3.7 or 3.8. That said, I\u2019m a great researcher, have held two undergrad RA positions, and will have my name on two papers by graduation. TIA for any advice you may have.\n\nEdit: grammar and additional context",

      "text": "In my field (physics) undergrad research is viewed very favorably in the admissions process. And if you have 2 co-authorships that will help a lot. IMHO you should definitely apply to grad programs and emphasize your research experience and accomplishments. Just make sure you don't apply only to 'top programs'. Apply to 3 'reaches' (would be awesome if you got in but based on your resume it's unlikely). Apply to 3-4 'good fits'. And apply to 3 'backups' (programs you feel overqualified to be in).",

      "text": "Research experience, work sample and letters of recommendation from the right people will be more valuable than GPA for a lot of theoretical R1 linguistics programs. People come in with all sorts of different background into these programs, international students do not have a GPA per se and the only thing they have in common is that the department sees potential in them.
