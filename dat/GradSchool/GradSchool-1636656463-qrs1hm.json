  "text": "I am a first semester masters student in my statistics program, and more and more, I feel like I've kinda been left out to dry in terms of completing my assignments. My professors have been giving some general idea of the concepts, but then the homework they assign asks us to do things they've given us little to no idea how to solve.\n\nThe textbook is not much help in either class where this has become a problem. One professor only offered the textbook as a suggestion but mostly came up with his own material, so we are entirely dependent on his slides for direction in doing homework, and those slides often contain no examples at all. Another professor has a textbook but jumps all over the place with it, teaching sections of this chapter and immediately jumping 2 chapters down to something else. The book itself is just... Not a very good book either. Again, very conceptual, little explanation of how to solve actual problems.\n\nI've had to Google a lot of concepts just to make sure I really understand them, and I've had to Google examples of problems and guidance on how to solve problems. Like last week we were taught about propensity scores, but if it wasn't for the website showing the code you use in R to create these scores, I would have had no clue how to do this. So, thank the heavens that some rando in the interwebs once made a website explaining things like this. But, I'm spending $10k a semester, I shouldn't have to be teaching MYSELF any of this shit when I'm shelling out THAT much money per semester.\n\nJust really frustrated. I get that grad school is tough, and maybe it's normal for a program to give you the basics and then expect you to do the work to figure out the rest, even though the vast majority of that work currently involves resources not even connected to my University.\n\nAnyone else have this problem in their program?",
