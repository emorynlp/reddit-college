  "text": "I'm a History PhD student in my fifth year (planning on a sixth due to Covid) and in the dissertation stage. I like my dissertation topic pretty well, I'm starting to pick up with doing the work on it a few hours every day after really struggling with that for the past year, and things are gradually getting better.\n\nHowever, the loneliness (I guess that's what you'd call it?) of this process is absolutely killing me. I don't lack friends; I'm still living by the university, so I'm still hanging out with some of the other grad students in my program all the time. Yet, it just feels like, when I'm alone (especially if I'm trying to work), it can be so incredibly difficult to \"engage\" with my life. It's difficult to explain. It feels like, even though **I** like my work, it just doesn't feel like it matters. It feels like it doesn't matter if I work 12 hours or 12 minutes. It feels like nobody else cares about my topic (the other grad students obviously have to deal with their own specialties). And I certainly can't even try to talk about it to anybody that's *not* a grad student. So it often feels like I'm just sort of drifting in life even when I'm getting my work done, and even though I care about my project and my specialty.\n\nHas anybody else experienced something like this? I can't even necessarily say what it is. Is this loneliness? Is it a lack of intellectual community? Do I just hate my career and I don't know it?",

      "text": "Do you have an assistantship or teaching responsibility that structures your time and naturally includes some socializing? If not I would recommend forming/joining a writing group with other abd students in your program or even your college. My university has a grad student writing center that also has weekly \u201cwrite-ins\u201d for anyone in the university to drop in and write together. If yours doesn\u2019t have that maybe recommend they start? You could even join graduate student government or get involved in some way with your university. I just find that having *some* structured time in my calendar makes me overall more productive and feel less isolated.",

      "text": "Here is my take on this kind of thing: try to engage with people for whom your topic matters, whether that's other historians, history teachers, history enthusiasts, history YouTubers, the communities you're writing the history of (if applicable), other academic/professional/ interest groups for whom that history is relevant (whether that's in the arts, sciences, social sciences, politics, activism, professions, fandoms...) They will be eager to talk to you, appreciate you, maybe collaborate with you on projects, and give you a special kind of feedback, purpose, and community that academia alone never will.",
