  "text": "This is my first term of grad school. I\u2019ve been struggling the whole time to stay on top of things. My mental health is bad.\n\nApparently I asked my prof too many questions for help with assignments (like how to write something). And I just feel so incompetent and incapable.\n\nNot to mention, I got some upsetting news from my doctor the other day which made things even worse.\n\nAnyone have ideas on how to navigate these sorts of issues? I could use some ideas",

      "text": "It's far better to ask too many questions than not enough. Grad school is a pretty big step up from undergrad at least in my experience and can be a bit humbling in terms of what's expected of you. It can take a bit to really get into the swing of it. Go talk to your supervisor and be honest with where you're at. They've heard it all before (and have been there themselves) and are there to help you out however they can.",

      "text": "My first thought is that it might be helpful to do something to relax like breathing exercises or meditation. You might also consider talking to a counsellor at your school about all of these things. Where I live, counselling is free for students, but depends where you live (I'm a counselling student so that's why I thought of that).\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with reaching out to the prof for support. If you feel like you're asking too many questions from them, maybe also reach out to other students in your class to talk about assignments. \n\nBtw first semester of grad school is hard for everyone! It takes a while to adjust to the expectations but you can do it! (:",
