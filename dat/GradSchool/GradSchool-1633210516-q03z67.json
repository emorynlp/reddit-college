  "text": "I just started my MSc program in August of this year, and have no desire to pursue a PhD at the moment. I have been encouraged to apply for the GRFP (second time applying, final attempt), but I have no clue what to say for my future goals. My future goal is to get my MSc, but will they even fund me for my masters if I\u2019m already in that program? I had feedback where it was suggested I mention how I want to get my PhD in my future goals statement, but that\u2019s not true for myself. Any tips or advice? Thanks!",
