  "text": "I think higher ed is such horseshit. It is crunch time rn in my program and I have 3 papers and one project on one class, one huge project in another, and 2 huge projects in my third class, all due in the next two weeks. On top of that I\u2019m required to go to class as in 2 of my 3 classes participation is 40% of my grade. For both of those two classes I have to read a book a week. If I don\u2019t at least power skim the texts, and I\u2019m not prepared to participate, my dickhead professor will give me a 0 for the day (same one for both classes, also my advisor).\n\nI\u2019m losing my fucking mind. How can anyone assign this much work and sleep at night thinking they are doing a good job. \u201cIt\u2019s grad school, it\u2019s supposed to be hard.\u201d Yeah well this is beyond hard, this is stupid. Oh you\u2019re not able to multitask inhuman amounts of work and attend 3 classes a week? Better apply for a job at Starbucks you fucking loser.\n\nFuck grad school. Fuck higher ed. I\u2019m studying to be a teacher in a state where an MA is required and we have a teacher shortage. Wonder why. $50k a year salary at the end of this shit tunnel. \n\nI\u2019m gonna do it because i have to and I want to be a teacher, but the higher ed system is an ego driven nightmare that completely ignores the human condition, and is in serious need of reform. \n\nSorry for the incoherent rant.",

I'm back in school later in life and honestly.. I learn so much more on my own through reading. It's kind of ridiculous. But I need a masters to practice. Some classes are of course better than others but.. I sat through a whole semester and feel like I haven't learned a thing. Mostly it's about teaching people to stfu and be docile to power.",

The second point is that in some schools they expect you to take an incomplete and work on the projects over the break. This gives faculty the ability to assign more work than could be done in a semester and allowed them to put off planning for the project until the very last minute.",

I ask the professor how long they estimate it\u2019ll take, and they seem to not account for the difficulty bump of a student wrestling with the assignment, but seem to come at my question from the prospective of how long it would take them personally to complete the said assignment. \n\nIve learned the hard way that when the professor estimates that an assignment they\u2019ve given out will take students 3-5 hours to complete, that usually means it\u2019ll take me around 6-10 hours to complete. Granted I have ADD so that doesn\u2019t help but other students in my cohort have had similar completion times so there it is.",
