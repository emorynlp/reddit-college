For some people it just takes a little more time to read the literature and find something within the topic that sparks interest. As for the work ethic I\u2019m not so sure what your PI means by that but you are a grad student not a full time employee. Unless you have a project with your PI that states that you need to be there daily to do some work in the lab or other, you are an adult and can decide what to do and when to do it (as long as the work is done). Again, it\u2019s only been six months. You are also taking classes and you have things going on in your life. I would suggest you speak with the department chair to explain your situation. I wouldn\u2019t focus too too much on the issues you are having in your life unless you have missed many deadlines/ assignments. I would just meet with the department chair and tell them your situation. If they are reasonable they will try to find a solution for you. If not I would suggest you speak with someone that\u2019s more on the students \u2018 side as department chairs are usually more on the professors side. Even if the PI wants you back after talking with the department chair or other, please change supervisors. Your current PI sounds very toxic and this will just stress you out in the future or make you hate the work you\u2019re doing. Good luck!",

I think the only thing I've accomplished is just getting good at cloning, Western blots, and protein purification. In terms of actual experimental results that advance our understanding of my project, I think I have like 4. \n\nMy current experimental woes greatly outnumber my achievements, but I have an actual human of a PI who understands how difficult my project is (it's a half a decade old and has gone through about 4 hands before they all passed it up for something else). OP, if you're reading this, please find support in your department and program if you can't get through to your PI. They have unrealistic expectations for a new grad student who currently has other things besides research to worry about right now.",

I asked to take time to figure out what was going on and I was told that if I needed time to get my health in order that academia wasn\u2019t for me. I internalized that so much, but guess what? They were wrong, and I am better off not having to deal with that bullshit. I am so sorry your advisor is doing this, but also\u2026 get yourself away from an advisor who does this. \n\nYour health and family come first. You can\u2019t succeed unless you have a chance to treat your health issues, and you don\u2019t deserve to be in pain. Of course you\u2019re struggling! It\u2019s really hard to perform at a high level with unaddressed chronic pain. \n\nYou also need a program and an advisor that knows that this stuff happens. I know how you feel, I know the frustration and the hurt, and I know how deeply it cuts. Those feelings will fade with time and distance from all this \u2013 it feels like it\u2019s you, but it\u2019s not. The situation you\u2019re in isn\u2019t healthy, and you deserve better. \n\nCheck out your options for switching advisors, but if that\u2019s not possible, be grateful you didn\u2019t waste more time with an unsupportive advisor. Better now than in a few years, right? And don\u2019t worry about what leaving \u201cmeans\u201d to anyone, it\u2019s quite simple: the program wasn\u2019t the right fit for you. Especially in the pandemic where everything is chaotic.\n\nI really wish you the best.",

Turns out I was severely depressed, and I had to take a semester off to work on myself. When I came back, my old PI let me master out while I looked for a new lab. Joined up the day I got my thesis signed, and fast forward 2.5 years and now my committee is tentatively recommending defense in 16 months.\n\nDepending on your institution\u2019s rules, you can go on a leave of absence and take your future out of your PI\u2019s hands for a while.
