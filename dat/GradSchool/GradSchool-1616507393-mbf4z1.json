I have three different tutors one through a star program went through a trio program and once through a schools just general tutoring that they offered. I went through my homework with all of them and then when I turned it in got a 50 on the entire piece of homework. All there were were exes on the question number. This was handwritten homework where I had to show all my work. They didn't mark an x on whatever part was actually wrong just on the number of the equation before I started working it out. \n\n\nEach ta at about 300 student papers to grade that we're all handwritten and they had to grade by hand. I ended up dropping out of that class because I couldn't get a response from any teacher assistants or the teacher to even understand how I got something wrong and even the tutors didn't understand where I had gone wrong unless it was a technicality. But generally the issue was either circled where you got it wrong or X out that way you knew where you got something wrong.",

I feel like in cases like that, students often want to be heard and validated that they're not crazy for feeling that way.\n\n> \"please I am begging you to give me more than 10 uninterrupted minutes in which to eat my dinner and write my thesis; I promise your 5% participation grade will get sorted out by the time you graduate\" \n\nSomeone already mentioned turning off email notifications is a form of self care, and I strongly agree. I have anxiety and went to my university's mental health service a awhile back and my counselor there pointed out that email notifications seemed to be a major trigger for me so I got rid of all of them (except UberEats and GrubHub lol). \n\nI don't know what your syllabus says, but mine typically have a line setting up expectations for when students should expect a response. Typically it's 24 hours. I tell my students that they should wait at least 24 hours before following up again. I also explicitly state that I do not ignore emails, so if I haven't yet responded, they should assume that I will within the 24 hour period.  It's unreasonable to expect anyone, let alone a graduate student, to be \"on call\" for students. \n\nSometimes student emails take seconds to resolve, others take more time if their problem is more complex. For those complex ones, it's okay to hold off on a response until you have the bandwidth to deal with it (but do respond within the agreed upon time!).",

Block times to read, respond, and deal with it. Start, middle, and end of workday are good choices if you need three blocks. If you're very nice, one of those blocks can be late evening, otherwise relegate everything after \"business hours\" to get answered in the morning. E-mail is asynchronous, use it that way. You can make exceptions for easy one-liners, but anything requiring, like, looking up their work or something, don't do it. Guard your time.",

              "text": "That fucking sucks I'm sorry! I know that your OP was maybe more to vent than to seek advice but FWIW here's what I've done in that situation: I make notes to myself as I mark regarding what I'm praising/critiquing so that at least if I'm making it up with no guidance, I'm being consistent. Then, I write up some 'global feedback' on the assignment from those notes - common challenges were x, strong submissions tended to do y - and then post that for all students on the course page (you shouldn't HAVE to do this work, but it doesn't take too much time and it'll cut back on appeals). Ideally, students will then be able to 'see themselves' in that feedback and they'll have some ideas on how to improve if they want. Plus it'll give the prof some idea as to what you did in case students e-mail them (they don't deserve to be let off the hook like that but again, the goal is to cut down on headaches on your end).",

I was lucky that the professor was just as tired of them as the TAs, so he never disagreed with our assessments and would CC us in his responses to students.

I went in and checked and the upload time was clearly after I had finished grading and a minute before they emailed the prof. Nice.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s like they wanted to get me in trouble.",
