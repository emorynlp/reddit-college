      "text": "Agreeing with the above comment, you need to sit down and really address with yourself: what is the main thing that is preventing me from being productive?\n\nFor me, it was social media. All deleted. I feel so much more productive.\n\nIf you're not motivated, refer back to discipline. Recognize that work must come before play and set deadlines for yourself. At this point, you must realize that your own bad habits are your worst enemy. You HAVE to be honest with yourself. SCARE yourself, use fear to motivate you if you need to. Have others around you keep you accountable and check in on you. \n\nUnfortunately in this rigorous path you have to do anything and everything to make it. There will be sacrifices.",
