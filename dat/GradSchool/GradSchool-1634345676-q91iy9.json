      "text": "Hi, physics PhD track over here. Definitely had a 3.0 requirement for us. If you didn't make it, you were on academic probation for a semester.\n\nThe thing is, it was kind of a formality. In our case, they care if you can sort of pass the classes and *absolutely pass the qualifying exam*. After that, classes are done and it's all lab work, so it's whatever. I was on academic probation most of my second year of grad school (my daughter was born spring break of year 1) and I was never kicked out.\n\nIf you're worried about it, highly recommend talking to the more senior grad students in your program. I only have one data point, but I hope your program is like mine\n\nThey invested a lot of money bringing you there, giving that spot to you, paying you, etc. It benefits them statistically if you pass their program. Those were things I wish I knew when I was stressing about the 3.0 requirement, so hooef6it helps.\n\nTL;DR - Yes, these seem to be common.",

Many professors understand that you NEED A's and B's in your classes, and will hence be reluctant to give you a C unless you truly deserved it.",
