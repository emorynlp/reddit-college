  "text": "Hi, I'm in my 2nd year of university right now in the States. I'm a Japanese major with a minor in asian studies and graphic design. I'm considering going on to graduate school for astrophysics. Considering thats a hard left-turn from the humanities and language studies, I'm wondering if this is even a feasible thing to do.\n\nI've always had an interest in space and STEM, but I talked myself out of studying it in college because I felt like I was too stupid to do math or science. But lately when I hear all my STEM friends talk about the homework they're doing and papers they're reading, deep down in my heart all I can feel is \"god, I wish I was doing that right now.\" It makes me tear up sometimes. I took physics twice in highschool because I loved it so much, and I really, really adored everything I was doing in my astronomy class in my freshman year. It was hard and I didn't understand everything, but I sure understood more than my peers did, and I was always happy to do my homework.\n\nI understand that there are college-level physics/math/astronomy courses needed for these kinds of grad programs...are there schools or pre-graduate programs that allow for people to take two or five classes or however many needed to go onto a graduate field?\n\nWill someone please advise me here? I'm willing to let this dream die off pitifully, but I want to explore all my options first. Life is too short, and all that.",

      "text": "You would need to change your major to something radically different. Perhaps keep Japanese as a minor to acknowledge your distinctive humanities training. Two to five classes isn't anywhere close. Two to five years, maybe. \n\nThe key question is how you imagine being an astrophysicist years from now, not so much how much you enjoy studying astrophysics in classes. \n\nIf your school has any sort of career exploration program, you can dig into your underlying motivations, preferences and strengths to make a better-informed decision now.",

Grad school is notorious for exacerbating Imposter Syndrome among even the most talented grad students. If you are already having feelings of inadequacy, you need to deal with them (including seeking professional help if necessary) before addressing any other steps in this process. You don't have to be the smartest student to succeed in astrophysics, but succeeding will take all your strength and motivation to keep pressing forward in the face of failure.\n\nEchoing what others have said, to pursue this path, you need to add (or switch) majors to either physics or astronomy; and this will likely add an additional 2 years to your undergrad degree. Also be aware that most astronomy/astrophysics grad students do not end up doing astrophysics for a career. You need to be comfortable with a career as a data scientist, quantitative analyst, or in finance (as examples) before choosing to go to grad school, as there are roughly 10x as many PhD's produced as tenure track jobs each year. If you are okay with all of that, then I encourage you to reach out to the undergraduate coordinator in your university's physics and astronomy department to see what the process of this transition would be like and what resources they can offer to help.",

      "text": "Why not change majors or dual major now? You'll want to talk with your academic advisor about what all will be involved but considering you're only in your 2nd year it'll probably only add 1 more year of undergrad study. Might as well try and see if it's for you now while you're still in college instead of waiting to graduate and then trying to shift into it for grad school.",

      "text": "I did the opposite: forced myself to continue getting a STEM degree while feeling like I should\u2019ve gone into social sciences. What I ended up doing was getting a minor in linguistics, and now I\u2019m studying sociolinguistics in grad school. \n\nThe problem with a STEM grad program is that you need to show that you\u2019ve taken the fundamental math and science courses. For me, the STEM classes I took weren\u2019t totally wasted in my application, because it\u2019s a huge plus for computational social sciences. But you\u2019d have a hard time connecting your Japanese major to astrophysics. \n\nCan you switch your major or double major in something like physics or astronomy? At the very least, you need to have something as a minor. And you\u2019ll need to get research experience in STEM. \n\nYou\u2019re only in your second year. You have a lot of time. I didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d made a mistake until the end of my third year.",

      "text": "You kind of sound like you're where I was 4ish years ago. I started undergrad (also in the states) as a journalism and politics major but I replaced politics with math in my third year and graduated with a double major in journalism and math. Right now I'm in an M2 (second year of masters) in probability and will be starting a PhD thesis next fall (i just got confirmation of it today actually).  \n\nWhat I ended up doing was taking extra credits each semester so that I could take 3-4 math classes each semester during my last two years. I applied to REUs and got accepted to one in stats. I also took two grad classes during my last year of undergrad and asked to do a project with the professor of one of those classes during the summer after I graduated. That summer I also applied to and attended a summer school on random matrix theory. During my gap year, I continued to revise some core subjects in math and did another project on the side with a professor at a local university. As well during that year, I applied to masters programs. \n\nSo it is possible however unlikely to be easy. The first thing to do undoubtedly is to start taking math and physics classes. As the others have said, you will most likely have to do at least a double major in physics. \n\nYou should think about the extra time and unfortunately financial resources, e.g. for extra credit-hours, extra semesters, or a masters degree, that will be necessary. However if you do decide to do it, I would suggest trying to take advantage of as many things as you can; go to research seminars and colloquia, apply for things, etc.",
