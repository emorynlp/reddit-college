  "text": "I'm a humanities MA student, so 2/3 of my grad school life is reading, writing, analyzing, and grading since I'm a TA. \n\nFor some reason (maybe because learning/reading is genuinely fun to me?) I never feel like I've been \"working\"... and these feelings have only been exacerbated since WFM and seeing my partner who as a \"real\" job. \n\nSome how, no matter how busy I am, I never feel like I am working hard enough. \n\nThoughts?",

Once I finish grading there's suddenly another wave of assignments and I'm back at the beginning where I have nothing graded. Same with reading and writing. There's always more to do, which doesn't help with feeling a sense of accomplishment. I liked the other suggestion in this thread of charting work hours. I might start doing that.",

If you ever get to the point where worrying about this feels damaging or upsetting, it might help to reach out to counseling services. Wish I'd done it sooner. :-)",

It is a manual task that does not take a lot of intellectual effort. However, it is still a meaningful and necessary step for the overall analysis. This is what I tell myself at those moments. And this is the line of thinking that could help you too. If you connect in your head your research and the final change that you want to contribute to by doing your research, it could be easier for you.",

Maesure pops up a box every X minutes (you choose X) to ask you what you are doing - you take three seconds to type an answer and then back to work.
