  "text": "I did not take out any loans for my undergrad so I\u2019m new to all this \ud83d\ude13. Now that I\u2019m planning on going to grad school, I\u2019ll be taking out a loan through FAFSA, which I am most likely offered around $20k per year. Some of the grad schools I\u2019m looking at are hellaaaa pricey and will require more than $20k per year. I\u2019m not sure if FAFSA is capped at $20k/year for grad school students so if this is the case, then I may need to get another student loan lender.\n\nI was wondering what student loans aside from FAFSA you all chose (if any) and what other low interest rate student loan lenders you would recommend and why. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t have an employer who is going to finance my education so this is not an option for me. There\u2019s no stipends offered for the masters programs I\u2019m applying to either so I\u2019ll definitely need to to find a way to finance my education. \n\n\nTips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude0c",

Take advantage of any grad school programs offered by your employer\n\n3. Take out student loans\n\n4. Do a research based master that provides a stipend \n\n5. Work during your master as a RA or TA for undergrad student (sometimes this can get you a tuition waiver as well)\n\n6. Work part-time during your master to help pay any student loan/tuition fees/living needs \n\n7. Apply to externally funded scholarships",

      "text": "Many grad students are funded through TA (teaching), RA(research) or PA (project assistant) positions that provide tuition remission and a stipend. In my case, students admitted in their first year are funded with a TAship for an intro class, unless their adviser has funding for a RA position for them. This is the case for both MS and PhD students. \n\nNot all Master's programs are funded, though, so if your program does not provide funding then I would assume either a combination of loans or part time work would be how people afford their studies. You could probably also apply for TA or RA positions--your university's job board would typically list these positions.",

You may consider applying for TA/RA positions in other departments, for example, or looking for PA positions with other professors. The professor I do most of my research work with hires lots of students from computer science and statistics because we work a lot with social media data and are an interdisciplinary research group.\n\nAlso, if you can find on-campus employment that would probably be better than finding work outside of campus because they may be more likely to work with your class schedule. A friend of mine worked in the office of diversity, equity and inclusion as a PA and although they really hated the experience and it had an, ironically, toxic atmosphere, it was pretty flexible scheduling wise.",

I\u2019ve taken the course requirements to apply to some CS grad programs (data Structures, calculus, linear algebra, and Python programming) and have all the requirements for a bioinformatics program. \n\nI also want to start working and making more than $40k per year  (which is what most PhD programs pay) in 2-3 years.

      "text": "I'll be graduating with my master's in the Spring, with no debt. I funded my master's in a slightly unconventional way, so I thought I'd share.\n\nMost master's programs allow you take semesters off without having to reapply to the program, as long as you don't take off consecutive (back to back) semesters. So, I took off basically every other semester to do full time internships. I used the money from internship to fund my next semester. I was able to get into more high paying internships than I could during undergrad, and turns out grad interns are really desirable. \n\nIt was a great way to mix in more experience throughout my degree and have tons of connections for when I'm job hunting next spring.\n\nSome caveats:\n\n \u2022 I go to a state school (relatively cheap). If your school is more expensive than the money you could possibly save during a semester-long internship, this could still be a useful path if you consider the value of the connections you'd make at the comapnies and could use the experience to decide what you want to do.\n\n\u2022 Most of my internships were remote, so I was able to save all the money I would've spent on moving and renting a new place to stay.\n\n\u2022 I'm doing a coursework master's, so there was no advisor screaming at me about a research project while I was working the internships.\n\nEdit: spelling/formatting, 2nd bullet point",

I have a tuition waiver associated with my TAship that obviously helps A TON. Then I pay my fees out of pocket. Outside of teaching I work two jobs- one in a lab Fri-Mon, and a desk job on campus one day a week where I essentially get paid to do homework for a few hours. Another HUGE factor in staying debt free is that my thesis project is a part of an NSF grant my advisor is a co-PI on, and I will be getting paid for 520 hours of work. That kind of just fell into my lap and I know I am in the minority when it comes to research funding opportunities in grad school. My advisor told me that after those hours run out she would want to split her summer paycheck with me\u2026 again SUPER lucky.
