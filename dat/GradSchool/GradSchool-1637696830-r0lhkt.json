      "text": "In your case with being an Econ major, the fact you've gone out of your way to obtain a math minor will reflect on you positively when you apply to grad schools. However, because Econ is such a popular major, it is crucial that you obtain a good standing minor degree as well as try to make yourself a more \"outstanding candidate\" by collecting more BUT important things to place on your resume/CV. You should strive to get the best grades possible in calc 3, especially since later classes in the minor will build off of topics learned in the class (i.e., matrices and differential equations).\n\nI do understand that Calc 3 in particular isn't an easy subject. Reach out to your professor or TAs, or previous students who have taken the course. If you're able to bring the final grade up to a score you like, great. If not, prepare yourself for grad schools asking why you hadn't done so well. Be honest when you answer them, but don't try to make excuses for yourself.",
