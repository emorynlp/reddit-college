  "text": "How good is PhD of civil engineering in Michigan tech? I see most do MS there. Their most of the publication are from MS students too. Do they have very limited PhD students or is there any limited facilities for PhD that's why people don't do PhD there? Can anyone enlighten me about these? Thank you. \n\nConcentration will focus on transportation engineering",

      "text": "Michigan Tech undergrad alumn here. Had some friends do PhDs there. The engineering grad programs are solid. Good labs and equipment, good professors, though I cant speak specifically to the civil department. If anything the reason there's not more people is that it's isolated and the winters are tough (or awesome depending on perspective). Also, the school only has like 8k students so it's not big by any means. Loved my time there, the nature access is out of this world.",

          "text": "Actually i love nature and a bit rural place is not my problem.  I am not from there so thanks for the input. I am concerned about their facilities actually. That's why i was worried why only few people do PhD in civil there. Also i found only one faculty with traditional transportation research interest, most work with rail. Bit worried about it. Now thinking to apply for Msc only as application is free. Btw mate, how is the living expanse there? No nearby housing?",

      "text": "I did my master's there. IMO most people don\u2019t do a Ph.D. there because of how tough is to be in Houghton for 4 years and also because most engineering students want jobs outside of academia. The university It\u2019s very isolated and far from a city. Most grad students are international so adjusting to life there is tough especially if you don\u2019t know anybody and are not used to winters that last 8 months. I considered staying for a Ph.D. because the facilities, labs, and professors are great but in the end, I found a job and decided that was right for me. My advice is that you go see the place, see the uni, labs, and talk to your possible advisor and then decide if it\u2019s right for you. It\u2019s a great university with great facilities my time there was great and I learned a lot.",

          "text": "Thanks. are u from civil engineering?  I actually wanted to do PhD in transportation  but looks like most faculties are interested in railway than traditional transportation.  Now i am thinking to apply only for Msc using the free application fees. So there is no housing service for International students nearby? U have to live in city? How is the rent then?",

              "text": "Geological engineering, a lot of the faculty there is also in the civil department. At least the ones I took classes and worked with were great. Since it\u2019s a small campus you can interact  a lot with professors. Clases are small. You can transfer to PhD while doing your masters too, there\u2019s a lot of options so don\u2019t think that if you choose masters you have to stick to that. Just talk to the  department chair and your advisor and they will say all of your options after your start your masters. For housing most of my friends lived in Daniel heights it\u2019s one of the cheapest options and it\u2019s  great because there\u2019s the campus shuttle that you can take so you don\u2019t have to walk to campus, specially when it\u2019s snowing. In the university web page you can see how to apply. I used to live downtown above the cyberia caf\u00e9 it was nice. $575 for a 2 bedroom apartment.",
