  "title:": "Should I push through the PhD even when I've realized I don't enjoy the field I'm in?",
  "text": "I am currently ~3 years into a PhD in a hard science. By all external measures, it has been going well. My advisor is happy with me and my progress, my grades have been good, and I have multiple first author papers either published or close to being ready for submission. \n\nHowever, internally, I'm a bit of a wreck and have lost all motivation. At heart, I don't think I am passionate about the science I'm in. I have been carried by success and momentum up to this point, and primarily have enjoyed the computational side of projects while quite honestly learning the minimal amount of the science to get by. I already know that I do not want to stay in academia, so this further makes me want to leave.\n\nAs some of my research has a machine learning flair to it, I have been considering applying for data science jobs and mastering out if I receive an offer. However, I can't shake the feeling that it would be a waste. While I hate my current thesis work, my advisor has said that in about 1.5 years (and one more paper), I could graduate. I do enjoy some of the side projects I work on, but they are not directly with my advisor and they have said that there is no way my thesis can pivot towards these kinds of projects.\n\nThe only thing keeping me here at the moment is the fear of lacking upward mobility in industrial jobs without a PhD. On the other hand, my degree is not directly in ML anyway, and I don't think I could compete directly with CS PhDs. An alternate option is to re-apply to CS PhD programs, but starting over a 5-6 year process from scratch terrifies me.\n\nSeeing that my graduation timeline is a relatively short time, should I stick it out for the piece of paper? Or, does it make sense to cut my losses at this point and switch to a computational job that I think I will enjoy more?",

      "text": "One alternative that you might consider is seeing if your advisor would be okay with you taking a month or two off, or to do an industry internship over the next term instead of doing research. This can help in two ways - it allows you to test the waters, to see if working in industry is something that you would really want to do, as well as giving you some time/space away from the pressure cooker that is academia. \n\nIf after that time you still feel like you have no motivation, maybe that's a good sign that you should definitely look to master out, so that you aren't throwing away time. And if you do feel rejuvenated afterwards, it sounds like all you would be \"losing\" is half a year at maximum of time, which (imo) you would be able to easily recover by being more productive from taking the break!\n\nHowever it goes, hope you are able to take good care of yourself!",

I do think I need some form of temporary mental break from this work -- it's sometimes all-encompassing and I really never have a full day where I don't worry about some project or other.\n\nA few weeks off is probably what I need to reconfigure myself and my goals. Looking into internships also is an interesting option I hadn't considered. Thanks for seeding these ideas.",

It just sometimes feels like I'm wasting time and mental health here developing field-specific skills that I don't think are transferable to what I want to do long term. I often wonder if 1.5 years doing something else would help more.\n\nThe comments here seem pretty unanimous for trying to find a way to stick it out / give it another chance, though. I'm going to try to see if I can find a route in which I can finish but not be miserable working on thesis-related work.",

But a piece of paper that will not give you satisfaction. A piece of paper that may help open doors, but not the doors you want to enter.\n\nPeople who successfullly pursue PhD-requiring careers continually assess and act on their strengths, limitations and interests to adjust what they are doing. You are doing just that, which is excellent. I encourage you to make the relevant adjustment.\n\nYou now have experience with doing research, so you have a good sense of what matters to you and what you do well. You path forward should be emphasizing those things. Is it that the nitty gritty of doing research doesn't offer frequent enough successes? Is it that the bigger-picture consequences of the work are not meaningful to you? Those two phenomena are both common reasons for redirecting a grad program, but require substantally different responses.\n\nOdds are your graduate advisor is willing to help. Advisors don't want their PhD students to be drones just grinding it out to get done. They generally want to see their PhD students develop into creative, independent scientists. Each student will take a unique direction. Let your advisor help in finding that direction for you since the current direction isn't yours.",

                  "text": "Thank you for the alternate perspective, a lot of what you say resonates with what I'm thinking internally. I could grind to get the degree, but if I'm not proud of the work and it's not interesting to me, then what was the point?\n\nI do enjoy doing research -- I actually like the nitty gritty, trial and error process to figure out new and better solutions to cutting-edge problems. I think I'm realizing the fundamental issue is just that I'm not good at, and don't actually care much about, the science I'm in. In contrast, I do think I'm somewhat good, and really enjoy, developing statistical and computational methods. The problem is that my advisor is the inverse of this, which is causing the mismatch in my projects.\n\nSo, I know I'm going to make a pivot towards more CS-focused work at some point. The question I'm struggling with is whether to do it now (mastering), or after sticking it out for 1.5 years. A third option is trying to transfer to a CS program, but I don't think I could convince myself to re-sign up for 5 more years at the moment.\n\nI will try to talk to my advisor about this, though in the past I have not succeeded at proposing alternate directions for projects.",

I think its pretty common for people with PhD/master's in some subject matter discipline (e.g. psych, physics, econ, etc) and some computational focus to their research to end up doing data science in industry. It might make getting your first role a bit tougher, but once you clear that hurdle I think you should be fine. Emphasize the computational aspects of your research clearly in your resume, and don't load up descriptions of your research with a bench of domain-specific jargon.  \n\n\nML engineering roles might be a bit tougher to land without more CS background , but I think data scientist is certainly within reach.",
