And most of the advice in the guides are things that people should have learned in their college writing courses.",

That's why people hire you. lol\n\nBut at the same time, these guides don't help much with addressing the specific rhetorical situation of how to develop content for a personal statement for graduate school. It's all very generic writing advice that would apply to many different writing situations.",
