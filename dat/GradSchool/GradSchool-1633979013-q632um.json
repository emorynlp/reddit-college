  "text": "How manageable would this reasonable be? I wouldn\u2019t even consider it, but I\u2019m in a lot of debt that I need to pay off pretty much as soon as I graduate. I want my masters but I need to pay off my debt. I thought the best way to do this would be to work full time and get an assistantship from my school (they would cover my masters in exchange for research and grading). On top of that, I\u2019ll be an RA to limit my expenses since my food and housing would be covered. I understand this would be a lot on my plate, but just how unreasonable would it be? Is it doable? All I need to be considered full time is 2 classes (6 credits)\n\nOne of the most important reasons to not wait for the masters is the housing and food I would get from continuing as an RA, plus this is my chance to get the masters covered",

      "text": "This is not likely to be feasible, both from a logistical standpoint (your work and school schedules are not likely to line up perfectly) and just because it will be too much work. Additionally, many programs will not give you TA or RA-ships if you have a full time job - universities often have rules about not working outside of assistantships and/or not working full time while you are in a graduate program.",

      "text": "Are you talking about being an RA as in Resident Assistant not Research Assistant? I\u2019ve known a few people (PhD students) who have done that and seem happy and not overburdened. But if you\u2019re saying that + classes + research + full time job, then no. Absolutely no way. If you\u2019re doing a research masters then research will be your full time job, and they expect you to treat it as such that\u2019s why they\u2019re \u201cpaying you\u201d in tuition.",
