  "title:": "I had my first \"holy shit\" moment",
  "text": "I'm so excited! I've been doing a PhD program in physical chemistry for about 2 years, and today I had my first \"holy shit, these results are so exciting\" moment! To make a long story short, I'm working on catalysts, and up until now, for like a year, we thought that one of the elements was not involved in catalysis. We used it as part of the support material, to make the Pt more effective. Yesterday, I read a new paper about that element in a similar compound as an active catalyst for a similar reaction that we use. \n\nSo I presented this paper to my advisor, and suggested we look at the data (I had just run catalysis for the support sample by itself without Pt, just as a blank and I hadn't looked at the products for it because I assumed there just wouldn't be anything). I just looked at it, and holy shit I was right!!! It's forming products without platinum! This is huge for my research!! ",

I think what exactly the world will look like is up to speculation but middle-classes will be more rare, global infrastructure for moving food around will be more rare and only the ultra wealthy will be able to afford it. We will probably start hitting cycles of population boom and bust more often because more poor people will rely on low-calorie local foods or maybe calorie dense engineered food but the building-blocks for that will be less reliable due to climate change. Groundwater resources are becoming depleted in huge parts of the world and those areas (large parts of India and the United States for example) will begin dealing with conditions similar to pre-groundwater extraction. Baby-boomers probably remember famines in India and China that ended when they pushed huge groundwater development. Those supplies are going to run out in the next 20-50 years. We polluted our soil, depleted historic protein sources (fish, land mammals), and don't have reliable rain or groundwater to grow high calorie dense crops. We will go to war over water and food... again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe long and short is 1) people will survive, and 2) society as we know it probably won't. I doubt most people will be living in huts but I bet a lot will be living in shanty-towns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: And this isn't just a business as usual projection... This is a \"maybe we make a few big structural changes like shift away from fossil fuel and protein from pigs/cattle but we don't do it fast enough.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Just a reminder that I'm not an expert on this stuff (yet). I'm just a PhD student and my field isn't in \"civilization speculation\"... I work with groundwater in agricultural settings. The impacts on society are just too obvious to ignore.",
