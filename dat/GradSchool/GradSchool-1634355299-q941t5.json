      "text": "It got REALLY bad for me. I was in your position a year ago and handled it terribly. The way you've described yourself is exactly how I felt. I was struggling through every single day and coping in self-destructive ways. But I made it through it and finished. I was worried I wouldn't, but I did, and I'm in a much healthier/happier mental state now. \n\nI'm sure there are people who have healthier coping mechanisms and make it through their dissertations without so much struggle, but there are many of us who have a harder time with it... You're definitely not alone. \n\nHang in there and be kind to yourself. You will make it through to the other side.",

              "text": "It took me ~3 months to gradually get out of that self-destruct mode after I passed my defense. I dragged my feet on getting my final draft and paperwork submitted to my graduate college. Then I dragged my feet on applying for jobs, even though I was facing unemployment as soon as my research assistantship ended.\n\nBut eventually I got everything finished, and found a few industry jobs in my city related to my research experience and started applying. I've now been in my new job for a couple months, and all of that struggle is totally gone. I still have normal ups and downs, but I'm no longer stuck in that rock-bottom that I was in for close to 15 months.\n\nIt gets better.\n\nAs some other replies have mentioned, seeking therapy with a mental health professional is also a great idea. I wish I had gone that route, as it might have made the struggle and subsequent recovery more manageable.",

My therapist was actually another PhD student in our psych department researching counseling (this work was part of their program's training), so he could sympathize with me a lot. I went for about 5 sessions, felt pretty good about finishing the rest of the work, and then a school shooting happened about 4 days before my defense. I was feeling...many things. I wanted to just get my work done though so I asked my committee to still do my defense which they agreed to, albeit a bit reluctantly. All in all I look back and wonder how in the world I got through so many bad days/nights of my dissertation. I waited far far too long to go to therapy because I assumed all of my imposter syndrome was normal, but tbh in hindsight the magnitude and longevity of what I was feeling warranted therapy probably in year 2 of my 6 year PhD.",

I found it helped to take a step back and reassess my priorities. It was in my best interests to finish my thesis. No one would be impressed by the hours I spent Googling and I would ultimately be doing myself a disservice if I failed because of bad habits. That honestly was enough to make me focus on creating plans and schedules that kept the pressure up, but in a manageable way. The bad habits crept up some days, but only a handful of times in the final months. I figured it was better to sacrifice some days entirely and come reinvigorated for the rest of the week. \n\nIn short: reassess priorities, plan your work into manageable tasks, accept that somedays won\u2019t be that great productivity-wise and come back stronger the next day.\n\nGood luck!",
