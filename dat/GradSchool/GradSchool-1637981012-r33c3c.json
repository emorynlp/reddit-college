  "text": "Hi there,\nI am 3rd year (out of 4) philosophy student at University of toronto. I am interested in studying south asian philosophy at doctral level.\nJust a bit of my background: i had a gap of 7 years in my high school and university and i was working shitty jobs. So i m slightly mature than average student. I am also learning sanskrit language with my philosophy courses. My cgpa is 3.58 and my average grades in phil courses fluctuate between B+ and A-. \nHowever, i dont have any co-curricular record, or good writing samples as of yet (i am working on it). \nSo basically, my two questions are: what are some good grad schools with south asian philosophy program. And what are some things that i should keep in mind while i am still in 3rd year undergrad that would help me later.\nThank you very much.",
