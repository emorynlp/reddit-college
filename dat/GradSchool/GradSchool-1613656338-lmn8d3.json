  "text": "A student in the class for which I am a teaching assistant emailed the professor and me asking for extension on the homework due this week as he is stuck in Texas. For people who are OOTL, Texas is facing massive blackouts and people are scrambling for basic needs. Not to mention, we are in the middle of a pandemic and working from home as it is, is challenging.The professor replied telling that they will offer no extension on any account as it just encourages others to seek it in the future. I am baffled! Where is equity in this?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for the reply and affirming how shitty this situation is. Unfortunately, my funding for the rest of PhD will involve teaching and probably with the same professor(not my PI) as my other funding was pulled. So that's the first reason why I do not want to go over him, which will include letting the student know their option. I encouraged them to reach out to me even over cellular text so I can help them with the assignment as this is the least I could do. I didn't think about granting the extension myself, maybe I will do it from the next time.  \n",

Any extension due to pandemic should be one applied to every student, which hopefully means it was already considered in establishing the original due date. Maybe wishful thinking considering the response here but...\n\nBut an extension due to a power outage that literally nobody else is experiencing and may actually be preventing them from doing work for multiple days should be granted.",

Professor does care about the pandemic's psychological impact. Then they would have already had a lengthened due date in the first place, so the pandemic is already factored in.

This prof might genuinely believe that fairness requires that all people be treated exactly the same and, for them, that translates to absolutely no exceptions to the rules. I worked fir a professor who had this mindset. To his credit, he also had set up some practices that would deal with this kind of situation. For example, at the end of the semester, he would drop 5 homework grades and 3 quizzes. He also separated his final exam into sections of what each exam covered and if someone did better on say, for example, the test three section of the final exam than they did on test 3, he would replace their midterm exam grade with what they scored on that part of the final. Still he would not except any late work for any reason. No exceptions, no discussion. I accidentally gave a grade for something late and he made me change the grade to zero. I thought it was a headless, but now I understand it. I\u2019m wondering what he is doing now. I expect he has rolled due dates for the entire class back a week.",

Everyone gets to drop so many assignments with no questions asked. This worked for the prof I TAed for who did this. He taught several classes of 120 students and managed 3 TAs. If someone missed an exam, they were required to take their excuse to the Dean of Students. The dean made the decision on the make up. If no make up was granted, the prof counted the final exam twice to replace a missed exam. His policies treated everyone the same and kept him from having to decide who\u2019s excuse was valid and who was trying to play him. \n\nI agree that op should advocate for the student if needed, but the prof might have polices in place that we don\u2019t know about that would apply to this situation.",

I think the concern would be that someone without power and access to a power source will need that device for emergencies, not to be wasted trying to upload an assignment when there are alternatives. This is an assumption of access from the professor which in this case is likely wrong. It assumes access to the material needed to complete the work, and also assumes access to a means to submit the assignment, which if it's an internet connection that also requires a power source, and further a hotspot of your phone requires a data plan which you could argue everyone has but you can't assume that people actually do have that and have enough data to send the assignment. I'm all for a 0 tolerance late policy, but the reality is if they ask in advance and have a valid reason which is denied, most schools have acceptable reasons for altering policies and not having access to basic needs is going to be fairly high up on the list of acceptance. The best course of action is to create the paper trail on the students end via email. They need to be clear of their situation and the TA here can help forward them to the appropriate contact or have the student agree to let the TA do it for them by CC a dean or student representative and be their every-other-day contact between them until no longer necessary. I honestly can't fathom a situation where a school would side with the prof on this if the student can prove that they didn't have access to heat and water and power when it's below freezing weather.",
