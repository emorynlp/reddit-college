  "text": "Graduated undergrad back in 2018. Worked for a company for about 2.5 years and left them earlier this year. Have a new job with another company now. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot more about graduate school for business and trying to get everything situated for applications. \n\nBasically a couple months ago I called my previous Director and asked if they would be willing to write a recommendation for me. Director agreed to write it for me and I followed up with email. Its a \u201ccommon\u201d rec, and I explained that\u2019s it\u2019s just 1 PDF that they will fill out, and then I will send the emails out for each school so they can upload the same file. It is not \u201ctailored\u201d to each school in any way. I stated it would be about a month for me to then email again so it wouldn\u2019t be random.\n\nThey emailed back once, and acknowledged the form, and asked if they just need to fill out and wait for emails. I emailed back and confirmed the process. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago (after a month) and I basically said is it a good time to send the upload emails and from what schools. No reply. \nFollowed up a week and a half later and no reply. Going on another week from the last email. \n\nIs this a dead end? \nSomething tells me I should just send them out and maybe it will be uploaded. Maybe just busy. It is the holidays. might be able to delete it if I have a bad feeling, but I will be notified if it gets uploaded. \nAt this point I don\u2019t think I have anything to lose, and I\u2019m out of options with recommenders as I\u2019ve already been ghosted by another recommender. It\u2019s a burned bridge otherwise\u2026and not by me. I had to reach to a professor for the other, as most school require 2. \nWhether it is a good or bad review, this person knows me well enough. My last option is someone I didn\u2019t know for long (less than 3 months) but was a manager of mine. No other people to ask. Too new at current job.",

      "text": "I love the disheveled professor. One of my recommenders said, \u201cIt\u2019s less of a big deal if I\u2019m late than you.\u201d And got his in and I was accepted. \n\nGrad apps is a wild time for faculty. Email them with the date. Email them again before the deadline. I see a lot of emails i don\u2019t feel any sort of urgency to respond to. Depending on your rapport you can go with a \u201cHi. Hate to be so neurotic about this, but did you do the app for me?\u201d Or \u201cHi. Will you let me know when you send the rec letter so I can chill?\u201d Or \u201cHi Dr. X. I\u2019m just checking in to remind you my apps are due X Month 2021.\u201d",
