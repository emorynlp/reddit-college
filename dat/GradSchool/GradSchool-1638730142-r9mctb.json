  "text": "I am in a MA program right now that is graded on final papers in each of the courses and the dissertation. In the three months of my program so far, I've written a singular 1,000-word paper and done a group presentation. It sounds weird, but I really miss quizzes and tests. Test-taking is my strong suit, and I think I miss the constant anxiety of undergrad. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?",

I went to an incredibly competitive high school so it wasn't uncommon to have multiple all-nighters a week so and the anxiety/ adrenaline from that is really rewarding (addictive?). So I think I internalized that and brought it to undergrad with me, even though my undergrad was a cakewalk compared to High School. So my MA is the first time that that mindset isn't helpful and I miss the adrenaline I guess.",

Undergrad felt because of this mostly like high school except with a much better social life, a lot more free time, and a lot more freedom to just go off and do random shit off campus. \n\nGrad school was the first time i ever hit a block of \"oh crap I can't just cruise through this like undergrad and high school\" which made it a lot more stressful and less fun. Learning study skills for the first time in grad school wasn't exactly pleasant.",

I think one of the most important things we as grad students can do to address this is have clear conversations with mentors about expectations and designing schedules, checkpoints/deadlines etc. to build in more structure.",
