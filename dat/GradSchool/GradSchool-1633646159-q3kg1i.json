  "title:": "My Grad Program is treating my brothers suicide not seriously. Am I overreacting?",
  "text": "My brother recently passed away about a week ago. I won't go into the details but he was very depressed for a long time and made an unfortunate decision while under drugs.  This has been a very emotional week for me and have had a lot going on. I emailed my advisor asking her what accommodations they could offer and me and what are some options for the rest of my semester. She send me a pretty generic email back saying I should reach out to my professors individually and speak about accommodations they could offer me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am emailed four of my professors and ONE has gotten back to me and spoken to me. I can understand if one professor can't get back to me but 3 out of 4 is ridiculous I think. I emailed my advisor again asking her what the plans are for dropping classes, possibly withdrawing for term and recommendations for students in my position. She sends me back a generic email copy and pasting the withdrawing policies from another page.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my school is putting in very little effort to help me through the most difficult time in my life. No one will speak to me and I can't just be consistently following up with professors I have a lot of other stuff going on. I am possibly thinking about maybe dropping out of the program regardless since they seem to not care at all about their individual students. This is my first semester getting my masters. Is this common, or am I overreacting?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thank you for the support everyone means a lot!  I did speak with the disability offices. The person I talked to was somewhat helpful, he saif it is up to the advisors to talk to the professors and make sure that they are aware of the situation. He said I could fill out some application, I had a really busy day so I haven't done that but will do that soon. I also didn't mention to any of my professors or advisor that it was a suicide, still think they should treat it seriously regardless maybe that made a small difference.",

I lost loved ones during my PhD process, and I am lucky to have had a supportive department. Make sure that you surround yourself with people you can count on, whether that is family, friends, cohort members, etc.\n\nI would highly recommend reaching out to the Dean of Students Office at your University. I used to work in the one at my university, and there are people who specialize in connecting you to resources and will often help you reach out to professors for accommodations. If they have trouble getting the professors to listen, they can also help to talk to department heads/advisors. Essentially they can help work as an advocate for you.\n\nI also want to echo reaching out to counseling on or off campus. They will often have one-on-one support as well as support groups if that is something you are interested in. Take care of yourself.",

      "text": "I went through a similar loss recently and I cannot put into words how sorry I am that you are experiencing it, too. There is so much to grieve. My heart goes out to you and your family as you navigate this. To be honest, I found that I had very little patience for manufactured issues like this when all my circuits were processing the suicide. It just\u2026 it feels very cruel. You are not overreacting. \n\nWith that said, I would not rely on individual professors to help you out on a case-by-case basis. I would reach out to your school\u2019s disability center for an accommodation. That will lay out a plan for you and honestly probably simplify things for your profs as well, because they\u2019ll have guidance to follow. You will likely need some sort of documentation, possibly from a mental health professional. You want this on file so that giving you an accommodation is not optional. If you\u2019re not sure of what other options may be available to you, consider reaching out to your university\u2019s ombuds. \n\nYou absolutely need some breathing room here. To be blunt, you\u2019re not going to be doing your best work for awhile, and you shouldn\u2019t be frustrated by that on top of everything else. If you have trouble focusing or anything, be kind to yourself. It\u2019s just what happens during a trauma of this magnitude. Whatever space you need to grieve, take it. If at any point you get the impression from your university that focusing on yourself and your family is a poor work ethic or inconvenient or whatever, remember, their take is not healthy. It takes strength to get through this, and strength to ask for help when you need it. \n\nYou *will* need a support system. The counseling center is a good start, but I would suggest that a few sessions won\u2019t be enough. I cannot recommend regular therapy strongly enough here. You should be navigating all of this with an expert, and you should have a neutral party you can talk to. Find someone you feel comfortable talking to \u2013 it\u2019s okay to try someone new if you don\u2019t click with your current therapist. Consider that this will be a medium- to long-term endeavor. If you need any additional suggestions on finding a therapist, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. \n\nI am truly sorry for the loss of your brother.\n\nEdit: I just want to add, if making any of the suggested calls sounds too daunting, PM me and I will do my best to help you. I am happy to call and ask questions to get you some more information, or to be on the phone with you when you call. And if I\u2019m not the right person for that, ask a trusted friend. Sometimes these initial calls can feel extra overwhelming. If I can make that any easier, I am glad to. Truly, do not hesitate to reach out.",

It was expected and she was almost 100 years old, but my professors were very quick to respond and offer me some time if I needed it. Given that you are dealing with a much more serious issue, I think your professors should be ashamed of themselves. Especially your adviser, may she forever have meetings that consistently run 30 minutes over time, are about nothing, and do not resolve anything. \n\nInstead of contacting each professor individually, I would do what the other commenter suggested and speak with someone at your disability resource center. Contrary to it's name, they don't exclusively deal with people with disabilities. People who need accommodations for a variety of things get them through the disability resource center, at least at my university. If you can get one through them, they will email your professors and *tell* them what your accommodation is, rather than you having to ask for one. \n\nI don't blame you for wanting to withdraw given how these people behaved, but you may also consider a medical leave of absence instead of a regular withdrawal.",

IIRC, a medical leave of absence means you are still a student there but you are taking a break for medical reasons (or other personal reasons). After your leave of absence ends, you can return to taking classes normally. A withdrawal means you are no longer a student there and, if you decided to return, you'd have to reapply. It's honestly pretty shocking to me that your adviser didn't bother to mention it to you and instead just forwarded information about withdrawing. That seems pretty callous and negligent to me.

It\u2019s really heartbreaking, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect more from your program than they are offering you. \n\nI\u2019ve worked in graduate education (as an administrator and adjunct faculty) for almost ten years, and when you mentioned your faculty are adjunct, their lack of response made more sense to me. In general, adjuncts are not as responsive to student emails as full time faculty. This is often because they are also working full time jobs outside of teaching, but also because they aren\u2019t really part of the campus community and are largely unaware of the expectations for faculty (even though we relay these at orientation). They are also not going to know how to answer your questions about accommodations because this is not some adjuncts are expected to handle. That\u2019s where administration steps in. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that they should ignore your emails - I think it\u2019s awful that they haven\u2019t responded at all with their sympathies - but they are going to have no idea how to navigate the withdrawal process at a university. \n\nI would definitely reach out to someone in student affairs and ask for help (the dean of students is a good place to start).

That\u2019s a whole lot and I feel for you immensely. \n\nI might be biased because I\u2019m going through the same things but, no, your advisor and professors are not acting in an appropriate and supportive manner. My advisor handled all communication to my program and professors. I was only allotted 2 weeks of for funding reasons but they\u2019ve been very accommodating. I actually had a talk with my statistics professor again and he\u2019s open to having me go through the whole class and if I don\u2019t pass, take an incomplete and retake it next year. \n\nYou should reach out to graduate student advocacy groups if your campus has that. See if they can help you. You can also try contacting higher ups in the department or see if the counseling center has any resources. \n\nSometimes people don\u2019t know how to handle grief, let alone complicated or traumatic grief.

That is the staff's function). Try the Graduate School's office, or the program director for your grad program. They might be better equipped to handle the situation from an administrative standpoint (it's been my experience that faculty aren't always familiar with to the processes the way that the student affairs staff are. It might not be that they don't care about your situation, it's just that they might not know what to do.) \n\nCalling is uncomfortable and inconvenient, but you'll likely get a response quicker and they can't just shuffle you around to other people.

I emailed my professors that I would be out due to a family emergency, but I guess some friends had explained the situation to the department. They sent flowers and food to my house and told me to stay out as long as needed. I didn't go to school for a few weeks and was just kind of a husk of a person. It was incredibly hard and honestly took years to properly get back to normal. When I went back to school, all my professors (except one jackass) were very accommodating.\n\nI'm extremely sorry for your loss, this is such a hard thing to go through. Please, please go to therapy for this. I really wish I had.",

My childhood best friend of 15 years died when I was preparing for my SATs and I learned a few things during that time.

If a student reached out to me about a loss, I wouldn't be able to do much but I could at least respond with my condolences and put them in contact with someone who knows more about what to do in that situation. That's on top of research and my own classes as well. \n\nEven this week, I asked my advisor about scheduling classes and he asked several detailed questions about how I'm adjusting to life at school and invited me to stop by his office sometime to check in. Life doesn't stop for a tragedy, but I do think it's odd that OP has presumably given her professors several days with no response. Part of the job is communicating with students...",

If it is true, then it must be helpful, right? \n\nWrong.\n\nLet me explain why your post is unhelpful at best since, shockingly, it needs explaining (judging from the upvotes):\n\nOP's brother killed himself a week ago. A. Week. Ago. Your response is:\n\n* \"Everyone suffers loss.\" This is true. However, most people will go their entire lives without experiencing trauma of this magnitude. \n* \"It's unfair\"; i.e. \"Life is unfair.\" Have you had a parent tell you that before? Do you sound condescending yet?\n* \"Whelp, that's life.\" Hmm. Insightful. I'm sure this platitude will help OP navigate his trauma a week --  a **WEEK** \\-- after losing a sibling to suicide.\n* It is true that the world won't stop for OP's grief. It is likely that OP understands this already. If they don't, they will be learning it now. Either way, saying this is merely patronizing. OP can understand this while still expecting a more caring response from their professors.\n* The loss of  your childhood best friend is not relevant here. It is not remotely comparable to what OP is going through. It does not enable you to understand what OP is going through. Mentioning it at all puts the focus on you and cheapens OP's loss. \n\nI hope this explanation has been helpful for you. Consider that your capacity for empathy may be deficient.

I told my advisor about it and she clearly felt uncomfortable discussing it. She was flexible with my work for a few weeks, but she didn't give me any of the emotional support I was hoping for.\n\nIf it's getting urgent that you need academic accommodations, I would say something like the following:\n\n\"Hey, I'm not sure if you saw my last email. I'm going through [X], and I need to take a couple weeks off to grieve with my family. I'm already working through the UAC office to get official accommodations. I'll do my best to catch up on missed assignments when I get back. Let me know if this will be a problem so I can withdraw from your class.\"\n\nThat will hopefully put them in a position where it is quick and easy for them to respond.

Being that you have just started the program, no one knows you well enough at all yet, so that could also explain the lack of adequate empathy. You just haven't recently lost a distant relative who you might only see once a year. You have lost a *sibling* and this was also due to suicide. Eventually you are likely going to feel angry towards your deceased brother, and it may sicken you, but remember that it is a normal stage of grieving.\n\nUnfortunately, with what I am about to type here I speak from experience, as someone who attempted suicide 4 times.  Your brother was in a *lot* of pain. A suicidal person wants to *live* and *die* simultaneously and it is an emotionally excruciating Hell to be in for all concerned--the suicidal individual and his or her loved ones. The feelings of worthlessness are the worst, especially if you are a seriously judgmental person and judge *yourself* to be guilty of *failure*. I cried myself to sleep many nights. I'm sorry your brother lost his internal battle with his own mind. I keep up with depression research, and research indicates that clinical depression reduces the mind's ability to multitask, which means you just can't \"snap out of it.\" Years of therapy aided me; along with sertraline, good friends, and for certain people piling needless stress on me--complete with sudden ultimata--to stop doing that. \n\nYou have to prioritize your own mental health--this is your #1 priority. You are the best judge of what you need. It may be a prudent idea to look into available counseling resources at your school, if you are not going to take a medical leave of absence.",

They are very early stage and they probably are thinking that this could be an indicator that they will be supported in their endeavors long term, in which case it would be better for them to make a change earlier than it would be if they waited and the lack of support became too much to overcome later on. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that is necessarily the case with this program given that their response could improve or there could be other indicators that suggest it is more supportive than this experience indicates.

      "text": "I am very sorry for your loss. You deserve better. If I were you, I would fill out some kind of withdrawl (or deficit load) petition. That way, you can receive some money back and can take time to focus on your mental health. From personal experience, it can be hard to find an administrator willing to help.. and it can be ESPECIALLY frustrating when you are going through a hard time mentally",

Both are places designed to help students deal with this, and honestly these resources are what your profs need to work with and refer you to use to begin with as they are not counselors (clearly by not replying...).\n\nMy condolences and best wishes to you and your family!",

You would email them and explain the situation (anything from a loss of a loved one to medical conditions etc) and they would reach out to your professors for you and provide you with additional resources if necessary. \n\nI would reach out to your schools disability center regarding accommodations. While they often deal with the obvious disabilities they deal with a lot of other stuff and they also hold some weight around campus in terms of getting professors to actually listen/recognize a situation.",
