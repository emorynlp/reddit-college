  "text": "I\u2019m at the very end of my first semester of an accelerated program 18 credits this semester, 18 next semester, 6 credit internship over the summer next year. \u201cDone\u201d with 4 of 8 classes for this semester. \n\nDone is in quotaction marks because the instructor for 2 of the classes decided 2 weeks ago she was done. Cancelled the final for one class, and assigned our last project as the final. We only had 1 graded paper and the midterm in this class, other than this last project. Of course she never opened the Dropbox to submit the work so I emailed it to her and cc\u2019d my advisor and my personal email address to cover my backside, just in case. \n\nThe other class she instructs is the Foundation class for my program she did give us an online final, as well as 2 projects, but we turned in a project 2 November we still haven\u2019t received grades on, so I\u2019m not holding my breathe on those getting graded.\n\nAnyone ever run into this type of issue? She is a Doctoral Graduate Assistant. I\u2019m fearful the University will make us repeat the courses if she fails to finalize grades.\n\nThoughts?",

This is not an uncommon phenomenon of grad students quitting mid-semester and there are contingencies for this. Although a grad student teaching graduate classes is not common as well.",

It may be a non-issue if she does put grades in, since final officially start tomorrow mornin, but we\u2019re doing it for the ones coming behind us so it doesn\u2019t happen again with this instructor. \n\n\u2018Sadly our field is hurting and there aren\u2019t enough instructors willing to teach. 4 professors retired in the last 22 months, one is returning to teach 2 classes next semester.
