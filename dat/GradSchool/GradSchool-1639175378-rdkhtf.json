      "text": "I spent some time looking for something like that but ultimately realized that even when they are comprehensive and helpful, they still tend to lean on the needs of a certain program or faculty, based on whomever wrote them.\n\nI spent a bit of time brainstorming and putting my goals/needs/wants on paper, plus insights that I found from other people into what should be included, and then I got a dotted journal that I could draw out my own scheduler on. It has made me many times more productive having the personalized information in a tracking form that is customized to me. Took a bit of trial and error, but you figure it out as you go. It's also FAR cheaper to do than buying pre-made journals. \n\nThe small investment in my time to actually understand my own needs and situation I think also went a long way to helping me compartmentalize and prioritize more effectively.",
