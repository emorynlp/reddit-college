  "title:": "Question for phds who TA at universities in the US",
  "text": "I\u2019m working for a professor who earned their doctorate from an American university and they seem to think that TAs in Canada, despite being paid a fraction of what they are paid, have equal responsibility running a course. I\u2019ve been expected to create grading rubrics for assignments and exam outlines but this is a first for me. I assumed that the prof just didn\u2019t want to do their job but they claim that in the US the TAs and the prof work more as a \u201cteaching team.\u201d Is this true? Do you get paid more in the US as a TA to take on this extra responsibility? Or are you just expected to do more? Or is this prof full of BS?",

      "text": "I\u2019m doing a phd in social sciences in the US. In my experience, the expectations of my duties as a TA have depended on the professors\u2019 teaching the course. Some professors only expected I grade assignments/exams. But other professors expected that I help create exams and guest lecture for the course at least once. However, we have a union and contract that states we work a max of 20 hours a week and most of the professors respect that.",

I would just bring up you\u2019re going over hours if you are. Also love the arrogance of the prof to impose American standards in a different country and defend them.",

They tried not to do it until the department told them they needed them ASAP (my union is intense). They asked us to do it for them, so we used typical workload hours. None of it says that we need to create rubrics/exams, or to fill in our own workload forms lol. But they wouldn\u2019t know that since they didn\u2019t fill it out themselves.",

      "text": "During my MSc, I TAed for one of my committee members who was kind of like a second advisor. We had to TA one course as part of our degree requirements, and I TAed a lab course. My only responsibility was to oversee and organize labs. It\u2019s a microbiology lab, so that was ensuring that our undergrad assistant knew how to make the media and how much to make, growing up the bacteria culture for the week, and getting together any other supplies. We didn\u2019t grade anything and already had all of the labs prepared. I didn\u2019t get paid any extra. \n\nI really enjoyed teaching that class. When I moved on to my PhD at a different university, there was an opportunity to teach the same course, so I agreed. There were a few changes as there were more students enrolled and they actually had the students in the lab twice a week instead of just one time. This was only the second time that professor had taught the course, so the lab manual was definitely lacking. I had to go through and edit that before the semester started. We also supervise and teach the labs, which is about 10 hours/week of just lecturing. She also wanted quizzes, lab notebook checks, lab exams, and 4 lab reports from the students which all needed a rubric and guidelines. I had to make the quizzes and exams from scratch. We had to grade everything (there was me and 1 other TA). This was also Spring 2020, so when COVID happened and students were sent home, everything had to be moved online. We weren\u2019t able to film any videos since we also couldn\u2019t be on campus, so I had to search for similar videos online. I\u2019m on a research assistantship, and there are no course requirements to TA in my program. I was paid $3,000 extra at the end of this semester; however, our professor had to fight to get us the money. Keep in mind that this specific course has an extra fee associated with it due to all of the supplies used which more than covered the TA compensation. \n\nFast forward to Spring 2021. I agreed to TA for the professor again. I had a lot of the previous semester\u2019s materials, and our professor decided to hire a third TA who\u2019d been our student the previous year. New TA wasn\u2019t allowed to grade anything, though, since she knew a lot of our students. We were also expected to give the lab in a hybrid format, so half the students would attend one day while the other half attended virtually. Every lab had to be videoed, edited, and uploaded prior to class. She also wanted content quizzes for the online students to ensure they\u2019d been watching the videos. I\u2019d say that it was basically the same amount of work for me as the previous semester, but since we had a third TA, we got paid $2,000 each.",
