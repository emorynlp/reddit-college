  "title:": "Any advice? My advisor told me to quit because I have ADHD",
  "text": "I am a first year student and I've made a few mistakes. I'm great at troubleshooting, so when we discuss where experiments went wrong, I list details. He accused me of not taking accountability, but to me, the details are also my responsibility and by going through them, I am taking responsibility for my actions. He then said that I am too careless and I should consider dropping out because my \"medical issue\" (the ADHD) doesn't allow me to improve. I'm devastated and I really don't know what to do now. I'm not sure if another lab would take me. I'm not sure if I'd even want that. What I really want is to stay where I am and to have him understand that I'm here to learn and grow, but it seems he's not really open to that. The postdocs and other students in the lab are supportive of me, but there's nothing they can do to stand up for me without facing retaliation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone for your support. I see some are suspicious of my story, and I will admit I have made some significant mistakes. When I do this, I list all the areas I can think of where I may have gone wrong. I never deny my mistakes, but it is not true that I'm not paying attention to the details of my work. I am medicated for ADHD and it is well-managed. The only reason I ever brought it up at all is because I have trouble word-finding when I'm speaking which is highly noticeable and embarrassing, so I like to explain it.\n\nI did not mention that I had to leave in the middle of the day last week due to a different medical condition. I'm not very comfortable sharing this type of information in great detail, but it is a hereditary heart condition. At that time, I was scared because of my symptoms, but I didn't leave anything unattended. I am fine now and the lab tech was concerned about my health when I returned, so I briefly explained the situation to him. He must have explained it to my advisor. My advisor also listed this as a reason I should quit, saying I can't handle the work. The both of these things in combination are rather damning, I agree. And to those of you agreeing with him, let me remind you: I'm always trying to improve. Instead of helping me, he is berating me and telling me I will never improve. \n\nI really needed to hear some kind words to give me the push to address this through proper channels, so I'm doing that now! I'll update when I can. In typical abuser fashion, he is now pretending like nothing ever happened. Whatever.",

      "text": "I've made plenty of numbskull mistakes and have even broken a piece of equipment due to carelessness. My advisor is definitely frustrated with me each time and gives me a very very stern lecture on how I need to improve. Sometimes they just express disappointment without offering advice, which isn't super helpful. But through it all my advisor has never given up on me.\n\nWhen I was in another rotation I had a PI tell me he thought I was unmotivated when I wasn't as productive as he thought I should be.\n\nI'd say both my rotation PI and your advisor are both in the wrong. I think your advisor may not be a good fit for you and it may be prudent to consider changing advisors. I know it's scary, but having an advisor that believes in you is undoubtedly base level for a student-advisor relationship.",

I am in the mental health field and I do not agree with any talk about \"let's talk about mental health,\" that's the worst thing you can do in grad school while being vulnerable. Narcissistic people within hierarchical, organizational structures will use stuff like a disability against you.  It's  sick and I see it happen far too often. It's a way for him to distract from his negative and depraved behavior and treatment of you. I say read about narcissism and the subtypes and you will be better prepared to deal with the people in academia.",

I know a grad student (40+M at the time) who had a freaking heart attack during his master's program and the department (and his advisor) did everything they could to get him help since the shitty university student insurance didn't cover all of his care costs (even made a GoFundMe for his medical bills) and made sure he got a leave of absence approved because he couldn't work on the thesis while in the hospital recovering from surgery/in rehab center. He did ultimately graduate, just delayed by the sudden unknown heart condition he developed (diagnosis was from stress, since he hadn't used cigarettes in a long time, like twenty years). \n\nI wish I had paid more attention to the other master's student my current advisor dropped/kicked out of the program because she had ADHD and was unable to finish her incompletes by the deadline that had been set. She had no insurance to cover her meds. I should've read the signs then during my first year of how much of an abusive dick my advisor is. Thankfully I'm almost done with the PhD with one socially distanced semester left.",

If I can't juggle, maybe I can learn to juggle a little bit, but I just can't develop the dexterity to juggle 8 bowling balls on fire. That's not the job for me. However, I am learning the best that I can, but unfortunately have not had much technical training on the more expensive areas where I am repeating mistakes. I do not repeat mistakes in other areas. I hope that makes sense.",

It just may be the case that although you learn well from your mistakes, it\u2019s just not a learn-by-doing kind of environment \u2014 you have already to be at a certain level of proficiency in the first place, and they can tolerate your learning from that level, but from where you are starting, it\u2019s just too much. So in your juggling example, if you can juggle 7 balls of fire and occasionally get burned by the 8th one, it shouldn't be too much of a risk to let you learn.  But if you can juggle only 1, and you get burned by the other 7, even if next time you get burned by only 6, there won't be enough of you left by the end of it to let you continue! I'd say I was the same as you -- learned from my errors, but I was working 70-80 hours/week to play catchup, and it just wasn't worth it for me, and frankly I'm not sure they were going to let me continue.",

I got yelled at and called names in front of MA's students for mundane reasons. I was accused of making up words they didn't know. I stopped eating and the only thing I'd do was studying pretty much all the time, sacrificing time off, which is so important to be healthy. I lost 20 kgs and all I can say is that abusive advisors can totally ruin you. The training technique was 'if you're strong enough you will survive'. So beware of toxic advisors.",

      "text": "A lot of people gave great advice about interpersonal relations with your advisor, so I'm also gonna just look at the case at hand in order to advise on how you could improve your current behavior. Let's say you run an experiment and it fails. You document everything and report to your advisor for why the experiment failed. There are a few things I'd like to know: (1) what is the nature of your reasons for failure, and (2) how do you convey them to your advisor?\n\n(1) Nature of failure: Sometimes experiments fail because we simply don't realize an additional variable was added that ruined the entire process. I've recently had a 10x failure streak on a process we KNOW should work to the point where my advisor just bought brand new thousand-dollar equipment to fix the problem. (It turns out the problem was literally that a screw had gotten loose, fixed the screw, and well now we have 2 equipment.) Sometimes we add the variable ourselves by careless mistake, like if we overslept and left an experiment in the oven for an extra 2 hours not realizing how it may change the results. Even though both mistakes here are caused by carelessness, the latter is more damaging towards your reputation because it reflects a change in what should be known process variables. Is this the kind of \"carelessness\" that your advisor is mad about?\n\n(2) Convey to your advisor: You could perhaps deliver your results to your advisor in a more structured format. This shows that you understand the process (lay out steps that you took, variables, etc.), and it can help diagnose what went wrong. Lay out EVERYTHING that you did in the easiest and clearest way for your advisor to read it. Maybe what is happening is that your results are not very structured and so your advisor is actually struggling to follow what is happening.\n\nNotice how I laid out the structure of this post. I identified the two things I was going to talk about, and then went and talked about them sequentially in bullet points. Notice that these topics do not overlap in content and collectively exhaust all points of discussion by focusing on during/after running the experiment; in other words, a very clean and organized structure! When you show your results to your advisor, can you improve on your structuring and layout so that your advisor sees competence even in your failure?\n\nFinal note: you could also just have a mean advisor, and you are a first-year student with no track record of success yet. Once you start succeeding, maybe your advisor will treat you differently?",

My advice is for you to find a treatment that suits you and for you to speak with your committee to help you find a new advisor! \n\nHowever, I would like to mention, experimental work is detail oriented. It is unacceptable to reduce failures to \u2018mistakes\u2019 as sometimes they are not just mistakes but they can be very costly errors. The reality is, some samples are precious, some money is important, and some experiments just need to work. \n\nIf he is suggesting a drop out, it seems like there have been more than just a few errors and you should be ready to take some pride in the quality of the output of your work. Even if this requires some hand holding in your first year. Take a post doc to lunch and ask him or her to hold your hand for a couple experiments. Explain your situation and explain to them you are under the gun right now. If your advisor has suggested a drop out it is their invitation for you to leave, the next failure probably will be a firing. Understand the position you are in right now.\n\nI hope you take the time to learn how to do whatever your next thing is right, even with your ADHD. Don\u2019t hide behind an excuse, strive to find a solution. If you need treatment, get it. If you need counseling, get it. \n\nGraduate school is a longitudinal process of working hard on yourself. It requires constant effort, not just in your professional life but also your personal well being. If this means giving up free time to treat your medical conditions then you will have to figure out how to successfully navigate those waters.\n\nYou may not like my advice but, I hope it gives you some valuable insight.",

It\u2019s not he/she has to find solutions to deal with it, as I suggested, instead of letting it beat them. It\u2019s not the only issue in play. We had plenty of people with disabilities in labs I\u2019ve worked in, they all seek out soliton sets. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a first or a fifth year, you have to find ways to soldier on. No one is going to do it for you. \n\nUnfortunately, there plenty of PIs, given that it is now almost August, that probably would not allow a situation where a student is unproductive in a year to continue. It\u2019s not a matter of their experience, or h-index or funding status, or tenure, it\u2019s just what it is for some PIs. The PI has a terrible way of approaching conversations about work output citing medical disability is a huugggeee no no. But the student seemed to also indicate there may be some underlying attention to detail problems or ensuring that the quality of work they do put out is strong. This indicates OP should seek help in the lab from post docs and find a treatment method that suits their needs. What I am suggesting is rather straightforward.",

Your advisor is way out of line, and generally speaking, nobody should be speaking as an authority on any mental illness we deal with personally except for a licensed mental health professional. This certainly ticks all of the boxes for one big HR no-no.\n\nIf you can, I would set up an appointment (as others have said) with the accessibility/disability resource office on campus. Get anything you can in writing. I would also talk to a dean about your interactions, but make sure you bring the receipts: Anything in writing (such as e-mail) will help, especially since your interactions with your advisor sound discriminatory and you mentioned concerns of retaliation. Moving forward, I recommend you keep a working document of these interactions called CYA (\"cover your ass\"). Include dates, times, locations, and supplement your documentation with screenshots of e-mails, etc.\n\nI know this is hard, and it's scary, but I had a similar situation in which various situational stressors (including my own work with depression) came to a boiling point. I had to take time off. I knew that talking to my boss would end with them trying to convince me to not take leave, so I went straight to our graduate office and a dean; the rest is history.\n\nSince you're in your first year, there are still plenty of opportunities (and time) to switch advisors. I've also had to do this, and while it's hard, it will relieve stress immensely if you work with someone who humanizes your experiences and isn't a lizard being. I know this is easier said than done, but I recommend shopping around to see if there's another lab you can work with if the opportunity is there.",

Disabled people (mental disability is a disability) can do anything that able people can if given the opportunity. \n\n I know you want to stay in your lab, but I think it's important to realize that your supervisor used your medical conditions to judge the quality of your performance and give unsolicited career advice (telling you to quit...what the hell? that's not something light to say to someone!!).  Also, you are not even obligated to disclose the details of your disability to anyone except the school administration to prove your disability, so he is not even supposed to be talking about it. What he did is a big no-no.  Pretty sure it counts as discrimination against a disability, which probably goes against your University's policies (it goes against mine at least).\n\n Contact your school administration to make them aware of the situation to protect your student status, so that he does not go behind your back to ''fire you'' from your position (can happen even if you are a PhD or master student in a studentship, RA-ship, Fellowship, TA-ship, etc.), file a complaint if you want or don't if you don't want, change advisor because this just fucked up your relation with him and will only result in a super toxic work environment. Even if you think you could just get over it... I don't think you can go back to what your relationship was with your advisor prior to this type of comment, it will probably remain in the back of your head bothering you every time you talk to him. Good luck and please update us!",

As your advisor, I'd hope he'd support you having a good record of your conversations anyway as a general good practice. \n\nAt the very least, you can start keeping a record of his discrimination now. Create a doc and each time he says something like this, write it down, including this most recent incident. Best of luck and I hope you can find an advisor who both supports and respects you!",

I can recall with good precision and accuracy most text/image based information, to the point of recalling where on a page I read any particular information.  \n\n\nAdditionally, I can \u201cread\u201d a page of text (on a DIN A4 page) in under 10 seconds.  As I\u2019ve been aging, that\u2019s been decelerating, unfortunately.  \n\n\nNow, since I\u2019ve had other cognitive issues growing up, I\u2019ve been tested up and down, for all sorts of reasons, with the goal of getting some answers to why and how I could do some tasks effortlessly and others not at all.  \n\n\nMost psych / neurological evaluations ended with the docs kinda shrugging and saying effectively the same things: no, you\u2019re not cognitively impaired (because the IQ tests came back way higher than expected \u2014 which didn\u2019t really matter or explain the overall problems I knew/know I\u2019m experiencing); yes, we need to do more tests; yes, here are some treatment/medication routes we can try.\n\n\nBy then I had moved to the US because in Germany, I\u2019d still be taking tests and doing what I had tried to teach myself how to do: figuring how to go through academic life on a kaputt brain.\n\n\nAdderall and co. are generally not a thing in Germany \u2014 just as the diagnosis of ADHD wasn\u2019t one when I grew up there.  In school (even in the expensive private one) the \u201ctreatment\u201d was mostly punitive \u2026 my parents didn\u2019t have any idea what to do with me either, other than dragging me from one doctor to the next, in an ever-increasing spiral of frustration.  It must have been hell for them.\n\nI\u2019m really glad that the last few years have seen a growing awareness of the reality of these issues \u2026",
