The major difference comes down to what you're planning to do after you get it. Pretty much, most departments will be looking for a thesis-based masters if you're going on to get a doctorate of some kind. This isn't always the case, I currently have a colleague who is \"mastering-out\" of her PhD program with a non-thesis masters to continue her PhD at a different university and with a different topic. On the other hand, I've had friends get non-thesis based masters in certain areas of clinical psychology and go on to practice without any issues. I would also recommend checking with your licensure board in whatever state/country you're in, they may have a thesis requirement if you're intending to go on to practice.",

In the UK at least, not doing a dissertation/thesis/project would leave you with a Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip), which is not the same as an MSc/MA; the master's awards is based on the research project you do at the end of your studies. Sometimes a PGDip suffices for some jobs, but I think it usually signals that someone couldn't make it through the full masters. \n\nI personally wouldn't think of omitting the dissertation if I knew that I was capable of doing it. My experience in the UK has been that the dissertation was a semi-guided learning experience of dipping your toes in academic research, and it really wasn't as scary as I initially imagined it. That part of the master's was by far the most valuable part of the whole course, and I enjoyed the process a good bit.",

It was more valuable for me to do the graduate internship plan of study than a thesis. Most jobs I was looking at required at least some experience, so I would have been much worse off if I didn't get work experience before graduation.\n\nIt really depends on whether you plan to pursue a PhD later, and what jobs you plan on applying to require. If experience is a requirement for most of them, you may want to do a non-thesis route.",

The advisor said that research skills gained through a thesis experience are applicable both inside and outside of academia, whereas pursuing a non-thesis makes it more difficult to go the academic/research route later on if you decide to. Basically, you can work toward either industry or research with research skills, but it\u2019s harder to work toward research later in your education or career without relevant experience.",
