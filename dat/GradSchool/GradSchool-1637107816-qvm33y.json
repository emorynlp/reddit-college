I did have a hands off advisor so a big learning was to be proactive in seeking out collaborations, and trying to find good people to work with whom I could learn from. \n\nI am an introvert so this took some learning and going out of my comfort zone. I truly wish I had taken better care of my mental health. I let rejections and the lack of my advisor being around affect me quite a bit, which led to stress eating and what not.. \n\nIn hindsight, I should have believed in myself a lot more and trusted that I would figure things out instead of worrying and spiralling downwards :) I really believe consistent work and just showing up makes good things happen and it\u2019s a big learning lesson for me to take onwards through life.\nWish you the best of luck!",

That\u2019s also my goal. \n\nI\u2019m glad that it sounds like you grew a lot in your program. I understand the spiraling and self-doubt, but seeing it through to the end is commendable. I hope that lends you a better sense of yourself and your capabilities in the long run.",
