      "text": "If you are looking for anyone who can do the job to do it, then you can go through any job-seeking website.\n\nIf you are looking for graduate students because you know you can get away with paying them less for the same labor than you would a traditional recruit, then boo on you.\n\nIf you want to hire grad students exclusively, or were thinking you could give graduate students some job experience, then you need to go through an academic institution. You partner with them and fund their lab, and that's how the student gets paid. Through the lab. The deal is made through the department and implemented by the prof running the lab. \n\nInternational students can only be employed through their university in the vast majority of cases; they can only work through their academic institution as per their student permit rules.",

      "text": "It depends on the nature of the work I would say. If its a short project, maybe contact the statistics or Applied math departments at universities of interest, including details about the project(s), especially expected workload. This would be like just running analysis on a few experiments or making a certain model that you want.\n\nFor full time / internships, just change the nature of the posting but send it to the same places. Try and email whoever may be related to industry connections, the main office / admin, or any professors specific to the area of interest.\n\nFor something like a research project/question, it's probably the most complicated, where you'd have to figure out more specific to your case. For instance, I believe in defense, there are certain government programs or deals for companies wishing to fund research. Note that usually it requires the results to be public. Also not bad to reach out to specific professors in the designated area, as they would need to get involved eventually.\n\nSource: I receive emails similar to this, for both projects and internships, and I worked at a company that collaborated with university research (US).",

      "text": "Speak to your local University on creating a GA position that would match up between yourself and a students academic goals. There are a decent amount of Graduate programs out there who require a capstone project that can be pretty broad for fulfillment requirements, if your project is flexible and meets the goals for fulfillment there are always students who do not have a project yet and would jump at it. Typically you front a certain amount of money to the University and they front a tuition waiver. Depends entirely on the university so good luck. Also they would not be your employee, they would work for the university most likely. If you are just looking for regular employees job posting sites are your best bet. Seek professors in your field of interest there are some fairly large email distribution networks run by professors that post jobs in their field.",
