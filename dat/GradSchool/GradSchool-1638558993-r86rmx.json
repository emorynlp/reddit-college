  "text": "I am hoping this is the right thread for this.\n\nI struggled immensely during my PhD, not necessarily due to work stress (although that was a part of it) but in terms of communicating with people and trying to connect with others in my department etc.\n\nIn my final year at the age of 28, I got diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. I don\u2019t tend to pick up on social cues very well and eye contact makes me uncomfortable. I can be very awkward, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had trouble making friends. I was told it took me so long to get diagnosed because I\u2019ve learned to mimic others, especially in conversations (as a child I got told off for things like fidgeting, not looking people in the face or understanding things too literally). But I guess I still don\u2019t know how to build meaningful relationships. How will I ever find collaborators, or network, or even become likeable/approachable?\n\nAcademia can be very isolating and the way my brain is wired is making it more difficult. I\u2019ve started seeing a psychologist to help with some issues I\u2019ve developed over the years (anxiety and depression), but I feel an almost unbearable amount of self-pity that the only person I speak to is a medical professional who has a job to do.\n\nTl;dr Recently diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s, unable to interact with people, making my life very difficult in academia.",

      "text": "ABD and autistic here. I decided against going into academia because I knew that I couldn't handle the stress. In my field, you enter the job market before the defense, so that you can graduate straight into the job with no gap in your CV. I was actually offered a professorship, but turned it down. Looking into research jobs instead. \nIn your position, I would seek out other people with autism, via something like your local Autism Society. You can swap strategies for self-regulation in the workplace, and vent to others who know exactly what you're going through. Also, I highly recommend seeking speech therapy and occupational therapy, which are available to people of all ages. That can help with your regulation and communication skills. I only did that recently, *after* I had turned down the professorship. I sometimes wonder if I would have accepted it instead, if I had had the  skills that I have now.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm also in the same position with not finding out that I was autistic until adulthood, and getting blamed in my childhood for my symptoms really messed me up. \n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck with all you do, and go easy on yourself. You made it through the meatgrinder of grad school already, and that's impressive. One of my committee members, who has a severe autoimmune disorder that makes stress downright dangerous for her, developed a policy in grad school of just saying \"no\" to everything nonessential. When she was an assistant professor, If a project that a colleague asked for her collaboration on wouldn't help her get tenure, then her answer was *always* no. Now that she has tenure, if a project doesn't advance her specific research interests, she says \"no.\" Accept that you might not make it to full professor, or if you do, it could take more time than your peers. And that's okay. It's not worth the trade-off to your wellbeing to try to match pace with your neurotypical colleagues.",

I\u2019d be happy to chat about what has worked for me (36yo m) in my journey through military, undergrad, and now academic lab work \u2014> grad student.\n\nI completely understand your hurdles and difficulties, and would happy to start a PM chat or something if you\u2019d like.",

      "text": "Also Aspergers, in my (hopefully) final year.\n\nI think the hardest thing for me has been reconciling my dreams with reality. Part of me wants to be a professor, but only this idealised view of what academia is. The current reality of academia and of being a professor is actually something that is very at-odds with who we are. \n\nI want to be the sort of person who enjoys that highly social job, with all the required networking and schmoozing, the lack of stability, the constant grinding and begging for scraps of money. But I\u2019m not that person. I need stability and clear goals. I need independent work. I need to know what I\u2019m doing in a years\u2019 time and I need it to be the same as what I\u2019m doing now.\n\nWe can force ourselves to do these things but it will always be forced. You can train yourself to socialise better but you\u2019ll always be faking it. And how much satisfaction can you get in a job where you constantly have to pretend to be someone else? Your potential is stunted simply because you have to put in 500x more effort every second of every day of your career, extra effort that will never be recognised or rewarded in *any* way. Your career is already very limited simply because you didn\u2019t network during your PhD. It wasn\u2019t your fault, but the academy doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI wish more research-only roles existed and I wish those roles came with stable employment and pay. But that\u2019s even more rare than your average professorship, and probably isn\u2019t a realistic dream to have",

      "text": "I recently found out I have autism, and it's been interesting to thinking about how many coping mechanisms I developed over the years to deal with it. I think my experience with masking has actually helped me fake it until I make it in grad school, but there have also been many challenges (most notably, my department being bad at setting clear expectations ). I think the psychologist will be able to help you a lot with your problems socializing - just please don't be too hard on yourself. While it sucks to be struggling, it sounds like you are doing what you can to work through it. I hope you find a way to make things work a little better for you.",
