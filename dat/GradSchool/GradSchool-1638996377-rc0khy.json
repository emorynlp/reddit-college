      "text": "Hi, also a History student: make use of book reviews over the texts you haven't (or have) read. They'll usually direct you to the most innovative parts of the material, or at least provide an overview of what the author accomplishes. I'd personally focus on the introductions of the books, find which claims stand out to you, and read those chapters. You're probably not going to have to define the *whole* book, just how the section you focus on fits within the book's trajectory and the theme of your paper. \n\nI know it's crunch time now, but how I would approach your timeline is by considering today to be a big review day (looking at introductions, gathering some quotes, outlining) and then using the next three days (9, 10, 11) and making sure I write (at least) four pages each day. On the 12th, I'd read the paper out loud (and fix any glaring issues), use Word's spell check function, and polish your footnotes.",

      "text": "If the paper is max 15 pages and addresses five different books, you can't need to reference content from the *entirety* of each book. I'd flip through the books looking for sections that are relevant to your chosen theme, skim those sections looking for material you can use, and start fitting them into an outline. Also, I think it's normal for an essay to favor certain sources; I don't know what your professor expects, but I think it would be fine for you to give more attention in your essay to the books you read in-depth, while making fewer or briefer references to the other ones. (Disclaimer, I'm not a history student, but I did write some history essays back in undergrad)",

Proceed in chronological order from the first to the final monograph by year of publication. How has the perspective of these various authors changed the prevailing perceptions of this event or broader topic? Why have their perspectives changed? Are they historians from different schools of thought? How would this influence their perspective? Did they discover new evidence that merited a reevaluation of the prior historiography? Did they utilize new methods? What were these new methods (if any were used)? How are these authors regarded by the profession--are any of them seen as one of or *the* leading authority on this event?",

Figure out which chapters will be helpful for your thesis and skim them enough to get whatever information you find helpful and you can summarize to back up your thesis.\n\nDon't feel pressured to be perfect.
