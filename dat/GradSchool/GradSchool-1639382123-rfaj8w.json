  "title:": "How Do I Become The Best Synthesizer",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nKind of like the title says, except not in the music sense (though that would be pretty cool). I've been told that a big (if not the biggest part) of grad school is being able to understand, analyze, and synthesize multiple papers/sources. \n\nI plan on starting graduate studies next fall. I'd love to hear any advice/resources you guys use for being able to synthesize and understand the research of others. Not sure if it helps but the programs I've applied to are a mix of psychology and information science. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019m working on this right now too. What I\u2019ve found helpful is not moving on from the introduction until I can write one or two sentences restating their main argument. Then I compare that to the main argument from the other pieces I\u2019m trying to synthesize it with, see where they\u2019re the same, see where they differ, etc.\n\nIdk about you, but I have a hard time seeing the bigger picture argument a lot of times. I just read the article or whatever and every new paragraph I just kind forget what the whole do unsent is supposed to be about cause I\u2019m so fascinated by the new information in *this* paragraph! I feel like fucking Dory from *Finding Nemo*",

          "text": "Ah gotcha. I can see how new information can make it difficult to keep a holistic understanding of some bigger picture. For me, whenever I read, I usually create some type of connection to either something I'm working on or something I'm interested in. \n\nI think in my case the most difficult part would be to make sure I'm taking all the useful bits out and building a strong connection from paper to paper. I think as I read more, I'll be able to more naturally see connections and illustrate those connections. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I had a coworker who has this problem. He couldn\u2019t get out of his own way. Let\u2019s say he needed to summarize an issue that included 4 studies, he would include every caveat, secondary point, etc. instead of summarizing the major points, similarities and differences (my typical approach).  \n\nSometimes we needed to know minor limitations or the differences in methods, sometimes not. But he couldn\u2019t adjust and would include enough text to fill 2x-3x as much as we needed. \n\nYou have to figure out how to communicate the key and major points in as brief a way as possible and know your audience/assignment. \n\nYou\u2019ll figure out your voice, but find away to be accurate without being overly specific (unless your assignment calls for that specificity).",

Remember being in the 3rd grade drawing venn diagrams and filling out charts and the such? Bring those back. I know, it sounds insane, but genuinely this works for me. You probably haven\u2019t used those things in YEARS and they hold like actual real value when you\u2019re really getting into doing this kind of thing for academia",
