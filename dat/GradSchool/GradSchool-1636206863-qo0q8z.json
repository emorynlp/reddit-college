  "text": "I went on an exchange/study abroad semester in my undergrad and would like to put it somewhere on my Canadian CCV, but there doesn't seem to be a specific place to put it...\n\nI could do Education > Recognitions and selected \"Distinction: Recognition you receive for achieving outstanding results or demonstrating high standards in your work or volunteer activities (e.g. leadership prize, scholarship, etc.)\" since I have an official transcript from the university that I suppose could fit here?\n\nAnyone else put an exchange on their CCV?",
