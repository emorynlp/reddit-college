      "text": "I don't know how does a grad school works in your country, but I can tell you about mine.\n\nHere, the objective of a master's degree is to produce scientific research with a focus on solving a relevant problem. The student must clearly present this problem, how he intends to solve it (materials and methods), the results of the analysis, and a discussion based on these results. Eventually, this can be used to produce a scientific paper.\n\nWith that said, the role of the advisor is to ensure and instruct the student throughout these stages, as it will probably be one of his first contacts with scientific research. The presence of the advisor is crucial, both for reviewing the text, as well as for instruction and assistance in the production, interpretation, and discussion of data. I also see the advisor as a good companion to help through the stressful process of producing an academic research.",

For me, their main thing is introducing me to research, helping network and expand my work to the right level. Taught masters don\u2019t need them because they have tutors directing and helping their assignments, I know some courses give them supervisors for their dissertation bc they\u2019re treading into research then but not necessarily. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m in the UK doing a MRes, I know masters is different elsewhere",
