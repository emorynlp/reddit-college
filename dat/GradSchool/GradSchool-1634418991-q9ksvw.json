  "text": "History MA here! This is a silly question, I KNOW!!!! Please hear me out. I'm a terribly indecisive person. Currently, I've been doing all my work from my personal laptop. It's a gaming laptop and it has a lot of flashing lights, not very appropriate to bring to class (nor is it recommended to move these types of laptops a lot, they're usually best when kept in one place). (also flat-out embarrassing to bring to class, IMO. I've been going to class without a laptop rather than carry it around). \n\nI think I'm getting away with using my personal laptop because most classes are online. However, I have one in-person seminar, and the professor has been kind enough to be OK with me referring to the assigned text through my phone. (I contribute and read quotes, so I'm doing the work). \n\nThe latest announcement from our school was that classes are going to be fully back in-person, I'm debating if I'll need a second \"professional\" laptop. \n\nI don't have a lot of money and I'll be putting it on a credit card. There are a few things I have to pay in the future that I haven't figured out either. \n\nI don't know if this is the right place to even ask this, can anyone relate to this? I also can't help but feel bougie running around with two laptops for different purposes LMAO. Is it a more normal thing than I'm making it out to be??",

No way. \n\n> nor is it recommended to move these types of laptops a lot, they're usually best when kept in one place\n\nWho's saying that? It's still a mobile device and designed as such. Of course you need to treat it with care and not kick your back down the stairs.\n\nThe real issue with gaming laptops is that their battery life usually sucks, so you need to sit close to an outlet all the time.",

It's not really about my classmates too I just won't be comfortable and I need all the comfort I can get in these situations. \n\nIn any case I mostly needed to write this down so I can get some perspective on it and figure out how I feel about it.\n\nOverall you're right it's a bit silly. Thanks.",

Honestly I know no one really cares about these things I just get embarrassed easily and there's a few things that I just can't be comfortable doing. Hell, contributing to class seminars is tough as it is for me, I don't need a laptop that looks like it should be hanging from the ceiling of a rave (I'm being dramatic!)",

I used to lug around a 15\u201d gaming laptop to school. It wasn\u2019t worth it to me, I much prefer small and light. If you\u2019re just wanting something more portable, it might be worth getting a second-hand 13\u201d thinkpad that\u2019s a few years old. Depending on the model of course, you can usually find one for around $250. Check out r/thinkpad for figuring out which model to get.",
