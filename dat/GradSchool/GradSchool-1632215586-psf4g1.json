  "text": "Does anyone have tips for overcoming performance anxiety? I am able to keep up with my coursework, ask questions as needed, and collaborate with my classmates and supervisors. Yet when it comes to people watching me perform in any capacity (test, working with clients, presentations) I suddenly forget what I planned to do and never perform as well as I would like.",

I have not taken it myself but read some class notes on doing presentations \u201cask you doctor about prescribing\u201d it if you have issues with doing presentations. I\u2019m sure someone else on this thread has taken it and can chime in.",

I used to smoke weed because the relaxing effect would clear my mind and help me focus, but getting high all the time was not great for my productivity. L-Theanine gives me that same relaxing effect but keeps me sober enough to do good work.",

          "text": "I took a beta blocker (it might have been propranolol or another one) for my fear of public speaking and it helped so much! It took away that physical reaction of shaky hands, dry mouth, fast heartbeat etc and I realized that was what I was really afraid of, not the public speaking. I only needed to take it a couple times to basically train myself out of the fear and now I don't need it anymore.",
