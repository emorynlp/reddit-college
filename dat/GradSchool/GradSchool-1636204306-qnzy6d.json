  "text": "I am working with a start-up that wants to change academia for the better. We are creating a networking and support site aimed at making the lives of grad students and early career researchers better. To do that, we need to know what is important to you. You can take our survey [SURVEY LINK](https://forms.gle/bs5iCUJyvb76A7St8) which should only take 5-10min. Or you can post a short comment here about what kind of support do you need more of in academia.\n\nThanks for any input you can give. We're happy to hear from anyone involved in uni study, research, teaching or admin roles.",
