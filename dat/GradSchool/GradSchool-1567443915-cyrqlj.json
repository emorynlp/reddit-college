  "text": "Most of us struggle with imposter syndrome. It\u2019s nothing new. I\u2019ll feel myself comparing my achievements or intellect to other scientists around me and coming up short, feeling inadequate, like I just faked my way in and don\u2019t belong. Then I recognize that that\u2019s just imposter syndrome speaking and most of us get it from time to time. \n\nBut wait, is it really imposter syndrome? Sure, *real* academics get it. And it\u2019s totally valid when they do - they\u2019re just as deserving as everyone around them. But am I just appropriating that term to make it sound like I belong here, when those feelings are actually very real feelings of failure and the accurate sense that everyone else really *is* better than me? Is my imposter syndrome just another way I pretend to be a real academic? \n\nAAAAAAAAAAA",

Sometimes I try to remind myself that my feelings of inadequacy are unwarranted because clearly my supervisor saw something in me that I dont but then I remember the fact that for every 1 thing I do successfully I mess up 5 way more important things and realize that I'm way too much of a screw up to actually have imposter syndrome. I figure soon they'll wise up and kick my clumsy butt out but until that point I'm going to stick around and keep trying",

Maybe both of us can be real imposters together while everyone else around us just has imposter syndrome. \n\nBut seriously though, it comes and goes in phases. There will be times when you really don't feel like you belong and other times when you realize how far you have come and how you feel like you are starting to really understand your field and how to contribute to it in meaningful ways. Then you can feel proud of how far you have come. \n\nRemember to compare yourself to where you were when you started, don't get too caught up in comparing yourself to everyone around you. \n\nFor some reason, now that I am writing up my papers and my thesis, a lot of my confidence is coming back. Sometimes it is hard to keep things in perspective.",

In fact, they might be the truest part of you.\n\nYou feel stupid because there are people all around that are smart and hard working and dedicated. You feel it because you are human and trust me, most of us feel it too because we, just like you, are fallible human beings. We are scared of competition, ashamed of failure, jealous of other's success and desperate for appreciation. Learning to deal with the complex being, that is you, is part of the process :)",

Then you get here, and realize that grad school is filled these individuals, sure, but most are just 'regular' people who are very hard working and goal orientated. But the idea that everyone in grad school is a genius is the reason that we look at ourselves and think, \"well that's definitely not me. I must be a con.

I have always felt stupid and inadequate when I was in grad school, but to be honest I don't know if I ever felt like an \"imposter\" per se (I know it's a term to describe the general feeling and symptom). I didn't even think I was good at faking, I just felt that I was a flat out failure and everyone was waiting to kick me out. \n\nAll it took was a good man (bless my advisor) who told me I'm not a failure to inspire me to finish my degree.",
