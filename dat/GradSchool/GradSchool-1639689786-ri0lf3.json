  "title:": "[Engineering] what did you do in the summer between undergrad and grad school?",
  "text": "I'm thinking of applying to internships, as I very much want to work in industry after my PhD.  I can't get into research programs really since at most I have to confirm that I'm either an undergrad or a grad student and don't have a place for me to say that I'm in between.  Any advice on where to find internships or research? Does it make sense to either try to work at a research lab (or I guess should I try and \"start\" grad school early / do research early at my school)?  I would very much like to get paid is the caveat.  What did you do between undergrad and grad?\n\nAlso, what was your experience with doing internships while a grad student? I see there's positions for grad students (e.g. Microsoft and Facebook's research labs) but you can you just choose to take off whenever (I imagine you have to get it cleared but will they say no or is it pretty painless)?  Would you recommend to do internships?\n\nFor reference, I'm MechE undergrad, EE grad school (not accepted yet), and I'm interested in controls, haptics, VR, biomedical instrumentation, etc.",

Might be the last chance you'll get.\n\nAnd any internship you get as an undergrad, probably isn't going to matter  much to your resume compared to everything you'll be doing while in grad school.",
