  "text": "Hello all. \n\nI'm a non-computing student from Singapore with research experience in computational linguistics.\n\nI'm interested in a career in data science, but am uncertain if I should take some time after I graduate to build a portfolio and familiarise myself with the materials. \n\nMy other option is to head straight to a conversion masters in the UK (MSc in computing with placement at Cardiff) or a digital humanities programme in Europe or Canada. I intend to continue to work in the country of my grad school programme afterwards. \n\nWhich would be better? I'm an international student, and concerned about my ability to find work in cs with my educational history and foreign citizenship. Suggestions are appreciated.",

      "text": "UK universities use master degrees as cash cows, so there's no real hurry to do one as they'll be gagging for your money either way.\n\nI would take 1-2 years out to broaden your experiences. Personally I rate grad students who have non-educational experience/\"mature\" students as they tend to be better with communication, contributions, and no their limits more. \n\nIf you get an MA in CS, have data science skills and professional experience you'll be in a good place.",
