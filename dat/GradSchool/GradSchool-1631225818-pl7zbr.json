  "title:": "Should someone in my shoes write the GRE, or should my time be spent elsewhere?",
  "text": "So, I just graduated in computer engineering from a Canadian University with an 82% average. Nothing too impressive, it dropped a decent amount from online school but, it is what it is. I want to get my masters in either Canada or Europe (seeing as I am a dual citizen), and don't want to apply in the US because holy does it cost an arm and a leg.\n\nNow, many of these universities have very different rules on the GRE. For example, Toronto says not to even bother attaching it. UBC says it is unnecessary, but could potentially help your application. Politecnico di Milano (a school I really would love to go to) says that the GRE \" is not mandatory but strongly recommended, it can affect your evaluation.\" Looking around online though, I have seen people claim that they didn't write the GRE and got in just fine.\n\nConsidering my average and the fact that most Canadian/European universities don't seem to care too too much about the GRE, should I bother taking the time to study for and write the GRE, or would my time be better spent elsewhere, such as working on projects and other things to improve my application. Thanks.",
