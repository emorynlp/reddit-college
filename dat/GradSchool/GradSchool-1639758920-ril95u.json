  "title:": "Do I take the solid B or take an incomplete and redo my paper next semester?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m a first-year master\u2019s student in the arts and humanities field. I had to withdraw and take only one class this semester because of a car accident and other mental health issues.  I knew my paper wasn\u2019t the best and turned it in anyway. My advisor said I had a few options. He would give me a solid B or I can get an incomplete and redo my paper next semester. I would have to turn it in by the third month into the semester tho.  \n\nHe gave me good feedback. He told me how I could restructure my paper and what to add if I were to write it again.  What should I do? In his opinion he said that I should take the B and start off a clean slate next semester since I has a rough start into the program. On the other hand I definitely know what to do to get an A",

      "text": "I wouldn't even dream of being less than satisfied with a B. But maybe the system is different in my country. I sometimes get confused when I read threads like this. Our grading system goes from A-F and the F is fail, which means a B is up there. A B is translated to very good, an A is outstanding.\nIt feels better to get an A than a B (outstanding!), but technically they are both considered good grades. You need at least a B average to apply for a phd after a masters.\nI like to know that I've done a decent job. To me, a B shows that I know what I'm doing and then some. That's plenty.",
