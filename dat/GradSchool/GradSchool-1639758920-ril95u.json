  "title:": "Do I take the solid B or take an incomplete and redo my paper next semester?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m a first-year master\u2019s student in the arts and humanities field. I had to withdraw and take only one class this semester because of a car accident and other mental health issues.  I knew my paper wasn\u2019t the best and turned it in anyway. My advisor said I had a few options. He would give me a solid B or I can get an incomplete and redo my paper next semester. I would have to turn it in by the third month into the semester tho.  \n\nHe gave me good feedback. He told me how I could restructure my paper and what to add if I were to write it again.  What should I do? In his opinion he said that I should take the B and start off a clean slate next semester since I has a rough start into the program. On the other hand I definitely know what to do to get an A",

Our grading system goes from A-F and the F is fail, which means a B is up there. A B is translated to very good, an A is outstanding.\nIt feels better to get an A than a B (outstanding!), but technically they are both considered good grades. You need at least a B average to apply for a phd after a masters.\nI like to know that I've done a decent job. To me, a B shows that I know what I'm doing and then some. That's plenty.",

Get a better grade. \n\nEarn the A.\n\nSpare your future self from doubts or extra competition because of first year struggles.\n\nHaving a 4.0 really helps when applying for (and receiving) scholarships.\n\nWe're in a pandemic. Anyone who sees an Incomplete on your current transcript will be more accommodating for now. However, you'll still be competing with others who still earned As. \n\nIf you know you can get the A, do it. Your future self will thank you. \n\nOnce it's an A, you'll feel good that you got it done. \n\nSpend whatever time on weekends and during break making the changes. You don't need it to be perfect. Just do what the professor suggested. Submit it. Be done. \n\nHaving a B from the start will lower your GPA, which means that you'll competing with others for the next few years for scholarships, internships, and additional opportunities. \n\nYou don't know what opportunities may come your way in the next year or two. Give yourself a strong start with a high GPA. \n\nBy the way, many students put their GPA on their resumes. Some people say that they rather have a non-4.0 student with a life and larger workload, and GPAs don't mean anything.\n\n However, GPAs still mean something. For me, as a student, my GPA helped me become eligible for scholarships and joining an additional certificate program (electives from a totally different field/department) that I never even knew about until my second year.",

That's simply not true. \n\nHow do you think that you will feel if you stuck with the B? \n\nI'd take advantage of that opportunity. \n\nAnd finally.... one day, your advisor may be writing your letter of recommendation for a job, internship, and scholarship!\n\nIf nothing else, showing that you have the resilience to push through, where others would have taken the B (your advisor prob convinced others to just take the B, and professors know that some students won't push back), demonstrates your work ethic, and reflects on your drive to excel.\n\nWill you have time before next semester to complete the paper?",
