  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am doing a master's in aerospace engineering at imperial college london, after which I'm planning on doing a master's in computer science, preferably in Europe but I'm open to suggestions. \n\nThe one I'm looking at specifically is the MPhil advanced computer science in Cambridge University. \n\nMy question is do I stand a chance if my minor was in computer science, I spent a lot of time (and extracurriculars) in doing projects pertaining to programming, data science and cloud computing and am in the top 15% of my cohort for my BSc, also in aerospace engineering?\n\nI also know there is a strong research component to the above-mentioned programme, and I do have some background in research, albeit in aerospace engineering as well. Is it recommended to have research in the subject matter itself or is having technical research experience okay?\n\nThank you in advance for reading this.",
