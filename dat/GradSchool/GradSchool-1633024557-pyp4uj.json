  "text": "I\u2019m studying mechanical engineering for undergrad and while it\u2019s not terrible, I\u2019m definitely not passionate about it. I\u2019m pretty set on my future career being in engineering but I want to spend at least a little bit of time studying something I actually enjoy. I\u2019m thinking maybe something sustainability or public affairs related. Would this be ok and would it be hard for me to find a job in engineering after grad school?",

But I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t find a field for grad school that can marry your engineering experience with something you\u2019re passionate about.\n\nLike if you\u2019re interested in sustainability, why not go into something like environmental science or an engineering program with an emphasis on green/sustainable production or energy.\n\nAnd what is it that you\u2019d like to do with public affairs?",

          "text": "This. Grad school can be expensive, and even when you can get funding and a stipend, it\u2019s not much. Getting into graduate school from a different major won\u2019t be an issue, but in your SOPs you\u2019ll have to be able to justify it, and \u201cI just kinda wanted to\u201d probably isn\u2019t gonna look great. Look into some maybe less traditional careers and find a way to combine your interests with your degree. You might have to get creative, but just going to grad school to go to grad school isn\u2019t worth it. In addition to not being super financially advancing, grad school is HARD. Even if you absolutely love what you\u2019re studying, it\u2019s hard, and there will be days you won\u2019t enjoy.",

      "text": "Yes, you can. There are a few people in my urban planning program with degrees in things like jazz, Spanish, history, math, etc. However, these people are using their Master\u2019s degrees to go into planning, which is why it makes sense for them. Grad school is expensive, stressful, and time-consuming. Don\u2019t do it if you\u2019re just wanting to study something different and then go into engineering anyway. I recommend that you either change your undergrad major to something you like, tack on a minor so you can take some fun classes, or use grad school to get into a career you\u2019ll actually enjoy.",

      "text": "It happens and it's fine.\n\nAs long as you can turn it into a story that has good reasons then I think you're solid.  I'll give an example.\n\nI have a colleague who got her undergrad in Engineering.  She then ended up working in restaurants for a bit (high stress busy environment that requires precision in-the-moment).  Then she used that people-connection making skillsets to go get her master's in engineering.  Then she worked for an NGO and worked in ODA projects in Africa.  She was instrumental in her work at the NGO and ended up coming back to grad school to get her PhD.\n\nHer restaurant/social experience helped her build amazing rapport and social skills to bring clients and stakeholders to the table to help build those decisions.  She was able to combine both experiences to build her story and show **why** it's so much better.  She's so instrumental our funding agencies are interested in hiring HER as a person.  She's looking to faculty positions after her PhD.\n\nAs long as you can turn it into an excellent story and it brings additional skillsets that are marketable and transferrable, then I don't see why this is an issue.\n\nI think there's strong ways of taking an engineering undergrad, couple it with public affairs, and coming out and doing engineering.  Engineers usually suffer from communication issues or limitations.  It's a major pain point that I believe some institutions are requiring their undergraduate students to learn a few communication skills through their academic curriculum.",
