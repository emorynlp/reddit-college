  "text": "I was excited for graduate school, but now that I\u2019m here I strongly dislike my courses and honestly, most of my cohort. \n\nI\u2019m doing a master\u2019s degree in public policy but 90% of my coursework is essentially a large glass of critical race theory with a small splash of public policy. It\u2019s something to have a class or two about but this is really the entire curriculum. I\u2019m not learning anything particularly applicable, it feels as though I\u2019m wasting my time but I won\u2019t be able to get a job without a master\u2019s in my field so I\u2019m basically stuck here for another 3 semesters.\n\nI\u2019m putting the bare minimum into my coursework in order to get decent grades while I try to improve myself, do internships, or have fun on the weekends with friends. If I was doing just the degree I think I would jump off a bridge.\n\nI was so pumped for graduate school but I made a bad decision and went for a program that gave me decent funding but possesses a curriculum I just don\u2019t care enough about. It feels alienating and depressing. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.",
