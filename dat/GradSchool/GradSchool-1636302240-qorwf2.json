  "text": "Hello,\nJust to start off, I would like to say that I haven't touched that stuff. I have completed my Bachelors and Masters without any drugs. But now I am in my PhD program and I can't help but notice that it is common for PhD/MD to use Adderall or some other substances. Most of them don't even show real signs of attention deficiency, they are just prescribed these things freely.\n\nIs that also common in your fields?",

      "text": "I don't know if it's common in my department, but I have ADHD and Adderall has been a lifesaver for me personally. I still struggle, but it's better than not taking any at all.  I think it really depends on the doctor who's prescribing. When I was prescribed, I had to show documentation, and I have to talk to my doctor/make an appointment each time I need a refill. I was diagnosed when I was a kid though, so that might be why getting prescribed initially was harder. I also wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people you know either aren't diagnosed or show different symptoms than you might expect. I don't really have hyperactivity, but my executive function and time management skills are really bad.",

See [here](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-adhd-correcting-myths-about-adhd-20456) for example. Contrary to expectation, it is quite hard to get diagnosed with ADHD and get stimulant treatment (see [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/health_and_wellbeing/adhd-adult-symptoms-diagnosis-doctor-b1871966.html)). Therefore, I think it is unlikely that your colleagues are getting Adderall even though they don't need it. \n\nApart from this, there are of course people that abuse substances like Adderall, and people in the medical profession might have easier access to it. I know of someone who tried it once, but did not find it useful.",
