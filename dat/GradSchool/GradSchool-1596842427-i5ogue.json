  "text": "Has the pandemic destroyed anyone else's ability to concentrate to a concerning degree? I had attention problems even before but now it's so bad I'm actually afraid part of my brain is broken and my ability to focus won't return post-pandemic.\n\nI'm still WFH and reading papers is like pulling out teeth. I've been reading the same paper which I have to present at a journal club for the last two days (I finished it yesterday and managed to take notes while reading, but didn't process it at a high enough level, I feel, which is why I'm trying to read it more carefully today). I don't have outside distractions, just me at my desk on my work laptop, but my brain is full of a million unrelated thoughts, like having 10 TVs all playing a different channel at once.\n\nI'm getting more and more frustrated because I want to read this paper! I want to be productive, the paper itself is interesting, and I've removed all outside distractions. But my brain still refuses to process. I can't hold the information in my head for long (hence the need for detailed note-taking). It seems to just float away like air.\n\nPomodoro isn't effective. I've tried it at progressively shorter intervals but literally after reading 2 or 3 sentences my brain will go \"Ooh shiny!\" at a thought drifting through my head, I'll chase the rabbit down the hole, and 15 mins later realize I've been staring into space. Then I'll return to the paper, re-read the same sentences because I didn't process them, and the same thing will happen. The thoughts range from an interesting article I read that morning, memories from years ago, a cool concept from a class I took in undergrad, a song on the radio...except they all run into each other and I can't even hold onto one of them for long before I flit onto the next one. I don't respond to positive incentives, either, since I know I could just give myself the reward anyway even if I haven't done the thing.\n\nThe attention issues have gotten worse since I started staying home in March. There are still some things I can focus on; I do bioinformatics, and am much more productive when I'm coding than reading. But since everyone's been home, there isn't any new data to work on anyway, and any old data from the backlog goes to the lab's computational biologist first. And what I really need to be doing is reading because I have a written qual in the form of an F31 due at the end of the year. I can still read general news articles/features (the longform kind The New Yorker or Atlantic put out), though that also takes effort.\n\nI'm really freaked out by this and don't know what to do. I've always had focus problems, but they've never been this severe, though now I wonder if external structures just masked them in the past (I've always joked that I need meticulous external organization because of how disorganized my actual brain is). I've thought about whether this may be undiagnosed ADHD, especially since 3 of 4 of my immediate family members have the inattentive variant. But I was apparently a VERY organized and well-behaved child, especially in contrast to my brothers, whose ADHD was very obvious. So I don't know.\n\nThis is making me wonder whether I really feel passionate about my field and whether I can really succeed in it. I figure, if I just cared enough I'd be able to focus on this, right? And the constant effort yielding minimal results is just worsening my (diagnosed and pre-pandemic) depression and anxiety and making me feel like I don't deserve to be at my school. I've talked to my PI about feeling unproductive, and he was very supportive and reassured me he wasn't expecting anyone to perform like their pre-pandemic self, and that he had no issues with the quality/quantity of my work beforehand. But I didn't tell him how bad it is, and I'm afraid my ability to work is going to continue to deteriorate until it becomes noticeable even to him.",

As a society we've gotten really bad about being glued to them all the time and it ruins our capacity to be bored.\n\nAlso, get tested for ADHD. I was diagnosed as a kid but recently got my diagnosis restrengthened for meds and accommodation. Straterra is the fucking shit. It makes you feel like a fog is being lifted from your life and has helped me with self-worth and motivation. If you need help accessing testing services lmk and I will walk your through the process. If you live in RI I know a FABULOUS practice, like trulynmarvelous. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Being lost in a stream of thoughts is normal, but not being able to get out of the stream is a problem. One of the things that really helps is, paradoxically, paying even closer attention to those random thoughts. When you do, you will find that they disappear and all you are left with is the ability to focus on whatever you WANT to.\n\nThis is going to sound really trite, but it absolutely helps. The way to train your brain to be able to get out of the stream is to start a daily meditation practice. Meditation and mindfulness are training for your brain to improve your attention span. That's it. \n\nThe one thing this pandemic has left us all with is more time alone. Why not spend that time with trying to improve your mental ability? \n\nI would recommend Sam Harris' app, Waking Up, but there are a bunch out there. Waking up is a pay app, but you can try it for free and if you like it, you can send an email to get a free year.",

I didn\u2019t get diagnosed until after the 1st year of my PhD, when, as another commenter mentioned, all my coping mechanisms failed. Now they\u2019re failing again, but that might not be ADD\u2019s fault.\n\nSidenote: if anyone has a strategy that\u2019s helped them retain motivation / get to work let me know.

If you can take a weekend off, stick your phone in airplane mode, go somewhere quiet and disengage. I compulsively desire that cheap internet dopamine, but after a day or two outside alone it fades, and I feel much more able to focus on science for some weeks after. \n\nAs regards ADHD or perhaps some autism-spectrum disorder: certainly a reasonable idea, and if you have access to healthcare, try to talk to someone about it. What relationship do you have to stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, etc), if any? You might find it productive to pay close attention to how these frustrating, unfocused thought patterns are affected by clear physical variables like the time of day and what's in your system.",

My therapist gave me very helpful tips and to break down things into very small achievable steps. It's ok to not get through a whole paper a day, it's good enough to just get a small thing done! It can be do just dedicate 15 minutes to read a paragraph and that's good enough. Slowly build up this and you'll start being more used to small tasks and not get too overwhelmed.

My work was going great and I had a bunch of cool stuff lined up. Then the pandemic hit, I was forced to \"work\" from home, couldn't go into lab, and my motivation took a nosedive. To make matters worse, the fellowship application I was working on and had a good shot at got canceled. I know I was \"working\" from March - June but I literally have nothing to show for that time period and cannot remember for the life of me what I was working on. I completely forgot to schedule my committee meeting and am now considered behind by my committee. Even now, as I'm once again working and actually making progress, I'm doing it because I know I need to be doing it and not because I want to or enjoy it. It's like my motivation hit a wall and it's taking everything I've got to keep going. \n\nOthers on here have talked about mental health, which I know is a serious thing for lots of people, but I know I'm not depressed, anxious, or anything else. Every other part of my life is great, full of motivation, and I'm as happy as ever. Grad school just doesn't feel like a priority anymore and it's been really hard to get back in the mindset that it should be. \n\nHonestly, the best thing I did was sit down with my committee and advisor, admit where I was mentally, and get my ass handed to me for being \"lazy.\" But out of that came a lot of encouragement as well as I realized I'm really not that far away from graduation and what I've already done is pretty cool and I just need to get it done.",

Like on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, completing a grad degree is pretty high up there, near self-actualization. And a lot of my more basic needs are not getting met, especially for love and belonging (because of not having close family and distancing from everyone).

My therapist had a few suggestions that have helped me and maybe could help you. \n\n1) lower your expectations of yourself - we are in a pandemic, you are stressed, maybe you are used to putting out a certain quality of work. Your best is good enough. \nq: but what if my best is lying in bed staring at the wall? \nA: it's not, you didn't get into your program staring at walls. You can do this. You have the power to push through. Write this down 'I have the power'\n\n2) put the phone away. Start with 30min segments. Then an hour. At breaks check it for up to 10 minutes and then start the timer again and put it away\n\n3) write down a list of accomplishable tasks at the start of every day. Be really realistic. Do your best to meet this goals but also don't take it personally if you don't. \n\n4) seriously: Be kind to yourself. A mistake? Fuck. That sucks. But don't say you hate yourself if you drop and break a glass. These little nuggets of hate add up. The same goes for your work. If you catch yourself talking down to yourself reframe it. This sucks but I don't suck. Or I feel like I suck right now - but this is temporary and I will get through it. Reframe the situation as if a close friend made the same mistake. Would you yell at them or tell them you hate them? What advice would you try to give them to make them feel better? Take that advice and believe it.\n\n5) your only concern is each day / week at hand. Not two weeks or a month or the end of the year. Break it down into as small of steps as you can. It gets overwhelming if you get ahead of yourself.\n\nYou CAN do this. You DO have the power.",

Sometimes to keep my mind focused I'll read papers out loud, but that's really the extent of the advice I have, mostly I just empathize.",

I wish I had some magical advice to you to fix it, but I honestly just said to my bf that I need to go talk to my psychiatrist soon because I am getting very annoyed-stressed.

I've heard of people with ADHD who don't get diagnosed until they go to grad school and their coping strategies start failing, so I guess it's more common than it looks.

It was mainly for the anxiety/depression (which had gotten bad enough that I figured I should get back on meds instead of just seeing a counselor) but I'll ask about ADHD too when I finally get that appointment.",

Heads up, a lot of psychs seem reluctant to discuss ADHD if you're an adult who functioned \"fine\" up til then, and if you have other things that may be contributing (anxiety, depression). So if they dismiss the idea of ADHD or you feel like they don't engage with you and give reasons, feel free to discuss it with someone else. I ended going to someone who specialised in adult ADHD. They're also more experienced with comorbidities (anxiety etc).\n\n> This is making me wonder whether I really feel passionate about my field and whether I can really succeed in it. I figure, if I just cared enough I'd be able to focus on this, right?\n\nThis is how I felt before treatment to a T. Now I'm six weeks in to the meds and have been in counselling/therapy for the anxiety, and also seeing an educational psychologist through my uni for organisation/procrastination type help (\"academic counselling\")... and gradually my passion for my work is returning! I'm finally starting to enjoy it again. I truly hope your docs can help you get back on track, however it goes. Wishing you all the best!",
