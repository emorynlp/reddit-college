  "text": "I just saw a post discussing thesis backups. Well, despite having two CompTIA certifications I haven\u2019t backed anything up in years. I tend to move around a lot, work with water, and have two cats that could all lead to me using my data. What is the best way to back up important documents? What kind of cloud service would you recommend and why? What do you choose to back up and not to back up in regards to space?",

      "text": "I use an external drive to backup my entire computer at least once a week. Additionally, all my personal documents are additionally backed up to the cloud (I use windows, so OneDrive). I basically just set up a folder that automatically stores in the cloud and on my local. So basically everything I have is in three places. Data and research related things I deal with separately as they are on lab owned hardware, but basically stored in multiple copies on different devices.",

      "text": "- All my files backed up to a USB stick on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ using Borg backup.\n\n- A subset of the above (docs, code, secrets) that adds up to ~10G backed up to drive with encryption using rclone.\n\n- Almost everything that makes sense to version control is version controlled using Git or RCS.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I'm on Linux. If you're on Windows, I think you can replace rclone with duplicati which I used and is good. IDK a replacement for Borg tho, maybe you can use rclone or duplicati for the same purpose.",

If that's the case, just copying the documents folder is all I need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What kind of cloud service would you recommend and why?\n\nI have most of my documents on Box because I still have an old free 50GB account there, but I don't count that as a backup. That's just for convenience.",
