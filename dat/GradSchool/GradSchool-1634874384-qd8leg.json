  "title:": "How do I tell my prof that I'd like to do a PhD... but in another lab at a different school",
  "text": "I'm doing my master's right now at the same school that I did my undergrad.  I've been very fortunate to be funded for it, and so my tuition is waived, I get a stipend, and I must deliver a \"master's thesis\" in order to meet the requirements of the degree (ECE).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy professor has made it clear that she would welcome me to continue in her lab into a PhD, if I so wished.  This issue is... while I am seriously considering a PhD, I don't really want to do it with her lab.  Part of it is that I don't want to do undergrad+MS+PhD all at the same school, and part of it is that her specific research thrusts don't quite align with the directions I'm motivated and curious about.  Further her lab is small right now, and honestly I feel that I would be lonely doing this for another 3-4 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is another lab that does absolutely fascinating stuff that relates exactly with my areas of interest AND there are many parallels with their work and my thesis work currently.  Even better, my prof knows this prof from their days at Caltech - so certainly if cards are played right I might be able to get a strong rec.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the issue though - my current prof has been so generous to fund me for my MS (which, at least at my school, is very rare and competitive).  We have gotten to know each other well and the intellectual conversations we have are stimulating.  I get the feeling definitely that she's hoping I stay around, and she drops hints ALL THE TIME about different interesting things that could happen \"if you're still around next year\".   I would not have been able to afford the MS had she not funded me, and I feel like I owe her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I an ingrate for having a wondering eye?  How do I even bring this up to her, and should I?  Should I take the (good) opportunity sitting in front of me and just try to steer research towards my interests?   I'm incredibly fortunate to be in the position that I'm in, and I feel that it would be borderline disrespectful to propose going to a different lab that essentially operates on the same fundamental technology thrust but in a different application space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, hope the kind folks here have some advice.  Thanks",

My professors always joked about failing me so I would stay, but they were happy to write me letters of recommendation to move forward elsewhere. \n\nYour life is YOURS! Do what\u2019s best for you.

      "text": "It sounds like you and your supervisor have an excellent relationship - I am sure they would support you in whatever path you decide (even if she will be somewhat disappointed). I would be upfront and have that open conversation with her in this case, given that I think spending 4+ years completing a PhD in a university and field of interest you are not fully engaged in is probably a poor alternative to facing your anxiety in that one moment. Good luck!",

      "text": "I did my MS around 2 years ago and my thesis advisor thought I was a good student and would have liked me to stay. I was funded by an assistantship for one year.  I told her I wanted to apply to other universities for my PhD and explore other topics and research areas, with similar practical skill sets. She wrote a recommendation letter for me and now I'm at another university doing a PhD.\n\nYour advisor sounds like a cool person who would be enthusiastic about supporting your career interests. 99.99% she will write a good letter for you if you ask.",
