  "text": "I just don\u2019t understand why I am so scared/self-conscious of my emails \ud83d\ude44. I just wrote to my supervisors asking for their preferences regarding working dynamics - whether they prefer me to report my progress through emails, or to go over everything in meetings, etc., so that I can adapt to what works best for them. And now my overthinking ass is worrying whether I sound condescending, or lame/with no opinion of my own, or whatever.",

If you tend to put your foot in your mouth a lot then this makes sense.\n\nBut you need to realize that faculty, especially more famous ones, spend as little time as humanly possible reading your email. Trust me they aren't parsing about if you use the right word for this or that sentence. Remember that even though they have tons of power over you, they're also people. And they don't want to be reading your email.\n\nFree yourself! You'll live a lot happier after that.",

      "text": "I do it all the time, matter of fact I did it just before I saw this post lol.\n\nI'm in the first semester of my masters- big adjustments, not knowing what to expect, more experienced cohorts, etc. I had a GRA this semester that I literally did nothing to support anyone or get any work done. Basically got funded and paid for nothing. While that sounds great, I feel like it robbed me of experiences and skills I really needed. Between snafus in lab training (I spent exactly 1 hour in my advisors lab after the fact) plus I had to take a couple of weeks off since I got overwhelmed with a lot of things (which didn't include the GRA since at the time I was doing nothing) and a lot of breakdown in communication, I amounted to just a small handful of things I did which contributed almost nothing. I learned lab skills and got certified, but never used it.\n\nSo I sent her an email this morning after she requested final reports from everyone, asking what I should include. My accomplishments amounted to ordering lab supplies (once), drawings on Illustrator (a total of maybe 4-6 hours) planning a few meetings, logged one hour of lab time spent looking at maps, started but never finished a spreadsheet of test units because I could never get a straight answer if I was doing the right one. Thats it. But I did get my tuition paid and regular paycheck which I haven't gotten in a long ass time. So yeah. \n\nI totally feel everything you are saying. And she doesn't have the funds for next semester so I won't get a chance to really get into it all, unless I do it all as part of the experience. But I felt so weird sending that email for all the reasons you mention and then some.",
