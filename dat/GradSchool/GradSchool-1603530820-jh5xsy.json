  "text": "I genuinely like my cohort. My cohort members are not hyper competitive and they are very honest. Tbh, the months leading up to my PhD program were full of stress. But the stress went away when I spoke to my cohort members. Everyone is so honest about their insecurities, they are humble and they offer extensive support to each other. When I decided to go to a Top 10 program I was afraid my colleagues were going to be aloof. But there isn\u2019t one member that has been rude, hyper competitive or negative. People are so honest about their fears, hopes and weaknesses. I no longer feel alone about suffering from imposter syndrome. \n\nAnd my department has gone out of their way to support us in every single way imaginable. They have genuinely worked to address some issues that impact those of us that are POC. Furthermore, I love how that the professors recognize we all have different strengths. We receive so much support.\n\nBy far, the upperclassmen are amazing. I have never met some of these people and yet many of them have taken time out of their schedule to recommend classes, offer guidance and listen to the problems we might have. \n\nMy classes are challenging. I am learning things I have never encountered in a short span of time. I have to master two different programming languages by the end of this quarter. \n\nNevertheless, I am happy.",

Plus I haven\u2019t been in university for almost a decade. And if not for my supportive cohort and faculty I probably would feel very discouraged. Since it\u2019s a lot of work with a family. But they are so helpful, zoom hangouts and study sessions. It makes it truly an amazing experience. Best of luck to you and so glad you are enjoying it.",
