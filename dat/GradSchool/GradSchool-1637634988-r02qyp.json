  "title:": "I'm pursuing a PhD in Aerospace Engineering, but I refuse to fly or work in defense. Am I crazy?",
  "text": "I'm passionate about sustainability, and unlike the energy and automotive industries, there isn't a clear path to greening aviation, which interests me. I've enjoyed the research I'm involved with for my MS, and I have multiple directions in mind for future work. However, I'm afraid my reluctance to fly or work for defense contractors will hurt me (whether I go to industry or academia).\n\nIs it hypocritical to study aerospace engineering but be unwilling to fly? Am I shooting myself in the foot by refusing to take defense dollars for academic research? Will it hurt my chance at faculty positions, or will there be universities looking for folks who are critical of industry?",

He only has a BS and MS, but teaches at a college as well and is one of the authors of the PLTW curriculum.\n\nHe basically only flies if he absolutely needs to.\n\nGoing into industry may be a bit hard as most companies do at least some small things with the military, even Cessna.",

Engineering engines probably has a fairly normal flying expectation, even if there will be enthusiasts in the shop. \n\nA lot of the innovation in aerospace has always come from the defense or intelligence budgets, so that will be harder to avoid.",

      "text": "I share your persuasion, but I have a couple of things to add to your perspective that might help.\n\nI also work in engineering, though not Aerospace. I have wrestled with the issue of taking DoD money before. Ultimately, the essential consideration is what your research actually *does*. Can the DoD use this to kill people? It's not all bombs and body armor. In many cases, DoD-funded research really has no immediate \"defense\" application -- for example, I know a researcher who's doing breast cancer diagnostics research on a DoD grant -- so in effect by taking their money you're causing the military to invest in something else, which I'm sure you would agree is a win-win.\n\nIf you see a research path towards green aviation (I guess by this you mean jet engines that get competitive mass-to-energy ratios without liquid fuel? The alternative is renewable biofuel that still polutes coming out of the exhaust but has an overall carbon-neutral lifecycle) and you can get the DoD or Boeing or whoever to pay for that, then I think it's pretty clear that that's a service to the world.\n\nAs far as refusing to fly, of course the real objective is to reduce climate impact. If you're flying in service of that goal (to further your career or attend a conference, for example) then that's going to be a net positive and  you should feel good about that.\n\nI'm thinking about this sort of thing more and more often as I move forward in my career. I'm going to offer you a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. that I find myself often coming back to when considering the way I interact with and position myself within systems of power.\n\n> Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.\u201d",

          "text": "You make some good points here, and that's a relevant and helpful quote for me to reflect on. Thank you!\n\nIt feels wrong, however, to fly to conferences while preaching sustainability though. I suppose \"if not me, who?\" is a valid point, but I struggle to internally justify it because at best it weakens my message and at worst it's outright hypocritical. I think it's reasonable for world leaders to attend COP26, for example, so clearly some middle ground exists where I could justify it. Maybe I just undervalue myself and my message.",

              "text": "> Maybe I just undervalue myself and my message.\n\nAnd, perhaps, all the good you can and will do for the world? I really do know how you feel. Something else I'm reminded of is animal research, which I participated in for a short time as an MS student. We were testing a new device we had designed to treat a very common disease. If the promise that the device represents were to come to fruition, it could save thousands of lives each year and greatly improve quality for life of tens of thousands more. But still, the rats thrashing in a tupperware container as we anesthetized them for surgery they'd never wake up from. It's our responsibility to honor that sacrifice.\n\nIncreasingly as I mature I see scientists and engineers as stewards of human progress. We absolutely cannot stop the world from consuming and wasting, and though we may try as individuals to live as ethically as possible, we know we're only a drop in the bucket. Our real role is to use our highly specialized and rarified knowledge and experience to guide our species towards a better, more just future. If you take that responsibility seriously and honor your role in it, I believe you will come to a broader, more valuable, and ultimately more fulfilling self-concept.",
