  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a master's student trying to get volunteer experience in a research lab. They are notorious for getting back to me after some time. They finally sent me the application and said I can fill it out so I can have an interview with them. I sent it October 30th. I haven't heard back. I am not sure if I should follow up with them and if this is normal for a research lab. I am not sure if silence is a rejection or they are just busy and taking their time with things.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThank You!",

So, I would guess that unless this is some unusually famous lab that gets tons of eager, qualified volunteers then they're probably just being slow.",

Otherwise shoot the prof an email following up 99.9% won't be annoyed though you may end up with the 0.1% whose an asshole (in which case you've really dodged a bullet regardless)",
