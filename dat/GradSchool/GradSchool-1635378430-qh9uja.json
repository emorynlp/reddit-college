If a student emails me after 5 (usually it actually ends up being 6) or on a weekend they are not getting a response till the next business day. I told them this at the beginning of the semester and they seemed to finally get the idea 2/3 of the way through. I have my own stuff to do, and I am also trying to instill the idea that they should look for work/life balance also. I know that last bit is rich considering I am in grad school, but still.",
