  "text": "I am debating my exit pathway for my Masters in Education, and wondering if anyone has heard of or done a thesis exit by way of auto-ethnographic research?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the examples I have come across are ethnographic research conducted on groups other than the individual, or more project base. I am in a unique position in my life and wondering if anyone has been successful in having the school approve an approach like this.",

      "text": "I mean, there\u2019s certainly literature on autoethnography that you could use to make a case for why you want to do such a project. It\u2019s also a relatively new, critical method that some scholars find almost laughable, so I think the viability of it depends a lot on your program and what they would find acceptable. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve thought about this already, but it also depends on your career path and whether or not your thesis will actually matter to getting a job in your field.",

Unfortunately, not everyone\u2019s on board with that. If you ever need someone to vent to about trying to do unorthodox academic work, feel free to reach out!",
