  "text": "Hey, all!\n\nI have an interview with a University I've been wanting to attend for years on Monday. It's a cultural studies programme and the interview is set to last 20 mins, according to the invitation. I'm kind of nervous and wanted to know if you had any advice about:\n\n- How different an undergraduate and masters interview is\n\n- What kind of questions I should expect\n\n- Some tips and tricks to generally help out\n\nPlease and thank you :)",

      "text": "idk about your program, but for mine it was important to look up ppls publications ahead of time and to reference them or ask about them in the interview. It's good to show you're familiar with their work, and you want to highlight the similarities between your goals and theirs. They want to know that working with you as a grad student will be mutually beneficial (that advice is probs specific to programs where you apply to work under a specific person).\n\nIt's good to sound confident and to be able to represent your interests clearly. Practice explaining your research interests. If it's research based. Or whatever your academic interests are.\n\nCheck general interview skills too, for stuff like body language and how to hold yourself/dress in ways that come off as professional and competent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: don't forget the interview is for you too. Ask questions about the program to figure out if it's a good fit for you! Even if you're familiar ahead of time.",
