  "text": "hey all, I wanted to share because it has been a JOURNEY. 4 months of writing a grant. 6 days in a row of written exams. A 3 hour oral defense of the grant. \n\nDefinitely the most difficult thing I've ever done, academically. Realized in the middle of it too that I have ADHD so needless to say, it's been hard. 3 months ago-self would've never thought this was possible (let's been honest, every day along the way) but to all of you out there as terrified of the qual as I was- you absolutely can & will do it.\n\nJust use that fear to work r e a l l y  hard, ha.",
