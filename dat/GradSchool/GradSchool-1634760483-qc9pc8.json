I'm still trying to figure out which reference management system to use (extremely new to this), but I'm wondering if there are any ones that have apps I can download on Android? Or at least access from from my phone.\n\nI tend to work a lot of my phone at times, so this would really help.\n\nI feel like a fish out of water sometimes in all this!",
