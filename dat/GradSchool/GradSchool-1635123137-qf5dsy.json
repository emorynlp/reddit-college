  "title:": "How sure do you need to be before starting a PhD?",
  "text": "I finished my bachelors in Psychology and am still at a crossroads of which direction to go, whether to go down the clinical psychologist or research route. My purpose for studying psychology was to become a clinical psychologist, but as I did my bachelors I grew fonder of the research aspect. I graduated with the top grades in the year which gave me the boost to go down the clinical route (as my worries before was that it would be hard to get into), however, to my surprise my supervisor offered me a PhD.  This was quite the shock as I never expected I could do a PhD without a masters and it felt like this was a golden opportunity. However, I'm not sure about sticking to that specific field of study for my whole career. I'm literally feeling 50:50 and I don't know whether I should wait to decide until I'm more sure, or go for the PhD, see how I like it and then drop out if it's not my thing (although this to me doesn't sound like a good idea). Any advice on how to make such a decision?",

              "text": "As a psych grad, you should know better than to solicit direction over asking for advice. Grad school is a personal decision. If you aren't 100% into a PhD, you aren't going to make it. It is A LOT of work on top of you have to cut it intellectually. It isn't just going to and studying for class, it is a lot of self driven, independent thought and reaea. If you want to give it a try, and have a Masters as a backup, that's not a terrible plan.",

A PhD program is typically shorter if you're accepted after the Masters.\n\n>However, I'm not sure about sticking to that specific field of study for my whole career.\n\nCheck the PhD program carefully that you're being offered. You may be locked into a fairly narrow path within psychology.\n\nWhereas you could go get a Masters in one area of psychology. And then be able to make a lateral move in psychology to another area for a PhD after finishing the Masters when you apply to other PhD programs.\n\nAlso, if you stay within the same area of psychology after a Masters, when you apply for a PhD, you might be able to get into a better school with a better program.",
