  "title:": "Struggling to pick and develop thesis topic",
  "text": "First time posting here, but as the title says, I am struggling to pick a topic for my thesis. I am in an accelerated one-year masters program, studying international security. On top of classes, I have to finish a thesis by the end of the my program. \n\nI am bouncing between topics I find. I want to be absolutely certain that what I am picking is correct for me and will be something I enjoy. On top of that, I want something that will follow me into my next career prospects. I've done excessive reading, but I don't think I know how to find the gaps in the literature.\n\nI suppose I am feeling stuck. The pressure is on and I need to really solidify what the hell I am going to be doing. Does anyone have any pointers, suggestions, etc?",

What thesis topic will help your career path the most.\n\nSure. You don't want to pick a topic that you hate so much that you won't be motivated to work on it. But over-privileging how much you \"enjoy\" it would very much be a short-term benefit.",
