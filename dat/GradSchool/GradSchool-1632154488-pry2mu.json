  "text": "As in the title, what are your guys best resources for harder (more theoretical) grad school classes for computer science? I have one semester left in grad school, and this one class is wrecking me. Because it is such a small class, my uni does not really have many resources internally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone interested shoot me a DM as well!",
