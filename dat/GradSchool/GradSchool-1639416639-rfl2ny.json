  "text": "I\u2019m an undergrad who goes to a school in the big ten. My dream has been to go to a top 10 school for the subject of my interest. Professors at my school tell me I shouldnt go anywhere that\u2019s not funded, which is fair, but this mentality of mine is holding me back from taking their advice. The mentality is that I\u2019d feel like a failure in life if I didn\u2019t achieve this dream of going to a top 10 school for my subject. How can I rid of this?",

When you don't have adequate funding, you spend your time worried about supporting your basic needs instead of learning more and researching your topic. Be prepared to do your homework on the state of funding at any potential school you want to attend (and actually ask current grad students about the HONEST state of funding in the program and how hard or easy it is to get and keep funding).",

That's personal, but maybe you just need to talk to more people about grad school and go through the admissions process yourself. It's certainly not unheard of for undergrads to have misconceptions about being a graduate student.",

That's not 'achieving a goal', that's signing up to be used to subsidize the students who they actually want there. \n\nBasically, if you're unfunded and you go anyway, that's not achieving your goal in any meaningful way.    It's failure either way, and one is a lot more expensive.  How you deal with that fact is up to you.",

You, of course, should only work with someone if the relationship is a good and the personalities match. However, it can't be completely ignored that a more reputable advisor will indeed be beneficial in terms of introducing you to more collaborators and may have more resources. But if you have no funding, then there's kind of no point lol. When you say top schools, do you mean you are focused on private ivy leagues that offered unfunded phd programs? Or master programs? Paying for a masters is a scam. Either do a phd, and master out, or work and have your company eventually pay for your masters.",

It will matter most for your first job out of school and less and less as time goes on. \n\nIn my experience, jobs are much more interested in your experience, tangible skills, and personality/fit than where you went to school. If they have to choose between a person who did good research at Harvard or did good research at school X plus has more skills/seems a better fit, they'll go with option B every time.\n\nAlso, don't overestimate the quality of those schools. Your options aren't Standford or community college. There are still a lot of excellent schools that aren't considered ivy league. Imo, you'll end up going to a school that is either barely better/not better/maybe even worse in education and research quality to have a more prestigious name on your resume, AND be saddled with crippling debt. How much more do you think you can make with a Ivy degree over just a top public school? It better be tens and tens of thousands of dollars a year more or else the 100k in debt with another 50k in interest is going to take too long to get off your back for it to be worth it. And maybe not even then because of the mental impact having that sort of debt hanging over your head for years will do to you. \n\nThese were all the thoughts that I had that made it easy for me to go for a good school to do my MS. I'm going to UMich with funding for my MS. I have a small amount of loans from undergrad, much less than a lot of other people, and I don't want any more than even that.",

It really depends what field you're in, but these days you can get a master's from a lot of great schools online.  Sometimes they have distinctions for their online programs, but sometimes they don't. Master's degrees are significant income for the university, even better when you're working for them for free, or when you're taking all your classes online. They love master's students.\n\nI wouldn't wager that it's worth the debt, personally. \n\nA PhD from Harvard would definitely not be a bad thing in any field. But then you *absolutely* should be getting funding. 4-5 years with no funding would be a hell no for me.",

I have two PIs (lucky me \ud83d\ude05) that are both extremely influential and among the most cited neuroscientists in their respective areas.\n\nThe prestige of the school only matters if you're going into a field that is heavily influenced by that kind of stuff (politics? marketing maybe?). In my area of research, it's all about grants, publishing, and productivity. If it's a good lab putting out rigorous work, that's all anybody really cares about. \n\nIn my opinion, it also seems kind of generational. I find that boomers and to a lesser extent gen-xers put a lot of weight on how \"prestigious\" the school is, but younger generations just want to see your work. That's been my experience, anyway.\n\nI'd suggest assessing your motivations. Are you motivated by the prospect of doing exciting, impactful research? Or are you motivated more by financial or social success? Do the prestigious schools you want to attend actually have the kinds of research or work you'd like to do?

If I were you, I would research what a master's degree in your field is like. A master's program is still a research program. You seem to think that a PhD vs a masters are very different... But at least in my field, biology, a PhD or a master's thesis both still require years of novel research. If you're still an undergrad right now, speak with your current professors about what a master's program in your field is like. Speak with them about prestigious institutes for your field specifically. This Top 10 nonsense is what your aunties and uncles might talk about, but no one in your field goes by the US News and Report. That's just foolish.",

      "text": "Apart from whatever has already been said, I'll also point out that the undergrad rankings don't really matter all that much for grad school. For what I want to do, Stanford, NU, and Penn have probably the top 3 programs (in that order; based on my looking at what their graduates end up doing, how well funded the programs are, the research output and impact, and so on), but then you have the UCs, UTexas, UIUC, UNC Chapel Hill, Penn State, and hell even U of Minnesota that do amazing research and produce highly employable graduates\u2013\u2013 some of these schools wouldn't fit into an overall top 10 in any kind of undergrad ranking. On the other hand, some professional graduate degrees at Harvard, Northwestern, Columbia, and elsewhere aren't that hard to get into but will kill you with all the loans. I highly recommend you read this article from the Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773) Hope this helps!",

              "text": "That is very interesting. In the first place, terminal master degrees are not frequently funded, so I can see the conundrum. However, it's not often I hear that within a inconsistently funded program, that the ones that are funded are in lower ranked universities.  \n\n\nAre you interested at all in being in academia (so doing a PhD down the line)? And if you're going in industry, does your field care about your degree coming from a highly ranked university? If your answer is no to each then it really doesn't matter what the ranking of the program so as long as it's a program that teaches you the skills you need to start your job. I would try to focus on looking forward to success and \"prestige\" at the job you do later on with the knowledge gained form the degree, rather than focusing on the prestige of the degree itself. Redefine success and your pride in those metrics, of how well you progress your industry career. Focus on what you gain by going to a funded program-- you are not only saving money but avoiding opportunity costs in the future in that you won't have to worry about not having had enough money to invest or spend in x simply because you're in debt.",
