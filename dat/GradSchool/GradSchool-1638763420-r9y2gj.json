  "text": "Hi everyone, I was wondering where you go when you reached the limit on how many times you can have a therapy session at your school. And I am curious how you are able to afford the sessions with a meager stipend. \n\nI started therapy at my grad school but I found out that I can no longer have sessions after this session. I have to look elsewhere but my school insurance will not cover therapy session or reduce the cost of the sessions.",

      "text": "First, check the Clinical and Counseling Psychology programs at your school - often these types of programs have in-house training clinics (i.e. very affordable) that you can get therapy through. \n\nSecond, check if your school's counseling center offers any kind of referral assistance; your therapist should have been planning for this termination with you and that should have been one of the priorities. \n\nThird, double-check your insurance. Are you sure they don't cover anything? Have you had the opportunity to speak with an insurance rep about that? Usually it should cover *something*",

Only just got a therapist like two weeks ago since there's not a lot of availability in my area. No one in my city takes my insurance, but a lot of providers have a sliding scale. So if you see that, definitely ask them to slide and be transparent about your situation/desperation. Also, if you explain your situation up front, some therapists may offer you a couple sessions pro bono.",

I also suffered from going to therapy at my school, where the counselor latched onto one problem I mentioned with my partner of 5 years and recent fiance. It did not help that she just kept advocating I leave my partner when I was trying to talk about my issues at work. I have currently found myself paying for my own counseling  outside ofy insurance using BetterHealth, though I would not recommend it unless you are a self motivator and want to actively work on your self healing.",
