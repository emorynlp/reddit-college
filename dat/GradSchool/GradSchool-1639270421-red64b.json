      "text": "Advice and good practice I usually follow (learned by a lot of panic and regret) is to start any given project or paper immediately, and continue until you know exactly how long it's going to take. After which, you can table it, and move on to the next thing, and assess that as well. This lets you space out and schedule your obligations, and you tend to have a little bit of the work done as a convenient bonus. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with finishing a project or paper the night before it's due, problems only arise if you didn't anticipate how long it would take -- lack of that knowledge is often an unnecessary source of stress, too.\n\nI would add that this relies on how well you understand your ability to produce good quality work in a set time, and how long it takes you to refine it. For example, I'm a pretty damn speedy initial drafter, and will have very few grammatical or unintended language quirks, but I also know I will find things I didn't think of, and that will require both more writing and referencing.",
