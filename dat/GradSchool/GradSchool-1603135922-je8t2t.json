There is no methodology, no actual study, no peer review, nothing. In fact he called it a whimsical idea\n\n3. CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION \nhttp://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations\n\nThere are way too many factors at play to make that assumption without an actual study. If there is an actual study in a peer reviewed journal then I will reevaluate.",

If you\u2019re early 20s and are unlikely to get seriously ill from the flu, getting the flu wouldn\u2019t put any extra strain on healthcare resources. I normally never get a flu shot as I\u2019m luckily not in the vulnerable group. I\u2019ve had the flu in recent years but thankfully it\u2019s never been unbearably bad, same with my family.\n\nThe danger I can see is if you pick up the flu and COVID at the same time, which could get really bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible",

I also live in the south eastern US where people aren't following mask and social distancing guidelines as they should be so community spread is very likely. So where I live it may be more important than where others are.",
