  "title:": "Panic at the thought of writing my own rec letter",
  "text": "Hi all. I have one very prominent professor who has asked me to draft my recommendation letter for graduate school, which is totally fine and I understand is normal. This person is a coauthor on my first paper, too. The problem for me is that, while I know I have what it takes to be an excellent trainee, I am very aware of the struggles I've had and I just feel incredibly small in this whole process. The thought of writing this letter is almost too much, especially when I read samples of letters and what other students have achieved. I grew up exceptionally poor (first gen) and I struggled quite a lot to complete my degree just due to having to work so much and take care of family. I feel like all my professors probably saw me as just some kind of loser somehow, when I was just struggling to survive. I know I should be proud of that, but this one professor is exceptionally stringent. I greatly admire them, but I feel like they see me as not good enough. Or maybe that's just how I feel. But I cannot even bring myself to write good things about myself!\n\nI don't know if there's a question here....maybe if I should even apply at all? Thanks for letting me vent.",

      "text": "I also really struggled with writing a draft rec letter for myself. There's something about it that is deeply painful. I recommend getting together w a colleague or friend you trust and who knows you, and writing a draft for each other. It was much much easier for me to gush about my colleague than about myself. If this isn't possible try your best to imagine that you are writing the letter about someone not you. And remember that it's just the first draft: the point is not to write a good one, but to capture some of your background / achievements in writing so your advisor has a starting point.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing this. I have two really glowing rec letters that others actually sent me. But I discount those for some reason and I know that\u2019s silly. It helps to know that someone else also found this painful. Also, this prof did want me to draft it out, so that\u2019s a good point. I can speak more objectively about my accomplishments than my qualities. Thank you!",

      "text": "First, I know it's not uncommon for professors to ask students to write their own letters of recommendation, but it really grinds my gears. Writing letters of recommendation is part of their job. And, while you might be able to speak to your personal strengths and accomplishments better than them, writing your own narrative in any form (personal statement, cover letter, etc) is much more challenging and time consuming than any other form of writing. Plus only professors know some of the norms of letter writing that you have no way of knowing (for example, professors in the US tend to be more effusive than elsewhere in the world). So they'll have to make changes to meet those standards anyways.\n\nSecond, you should absolutely still apply! One silver lining about this is that you can provide some context for the challenges you've overcome that it sounds like your professor might not know about. I don't know what field you are in or where you want to apply but universities should be trying to recruit more first generation and historically unrepresented students from different socioeconomic, gender, race, etc. backgrounds. For info on crafting your own narrative of your academic trajectory, I recommend the chapter on cover letters from Karen Kelsky's *The Professor Is In*.",

          "text": "So, I actually have a letter writer who knows me exceptionally well and has been advising me through my undergrad and master\u2019s experience, and is sort of acting as a \u2018foil\u2019 in a sense by writing about my background and how much I\u2019ve overcome. That way, I can focus my precious paragraphs on my passions, plans, and motivations. \n\nThis prof is famous and a lot of folks want their time. This person doesn\u2019t know me that well for those reasons. I have 4 writers, so I\u2019m hoping they compensate for that in my overall application. \n\nI\u2019m trying to see this as a real gift to me in so many ways, but it\u2019s very emotionally hard and it\u2019s also confusing. I feel incredibly foolish while simultaneously writing all this great stuff about myself while also not feeling like I\u2019m any good and that them asking me to do this is proof somehow? It\u2019s also confusing because if I *cannot* provide their anecdotes and opinions on me, it\u2019ll appear that they just read my CV and phoned it in, at best. It feels cruel but also maybe like I need this to overcome imposter syndrome? I hate it, and I\u2019m grateful\u2026.I am Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s student. \n\nThank you for the book recommendation. I\u2019ll order it now. :)",

I mean overall it sounds like you'll have a strong application that will be able to show you off to your best advantage.\n\nAnd don't beat yourself up, it's very challenging to write about yourself!  But yes do check out the book. I think most university libraries and even some public ones should have it so you don't necessarily need to buy it.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I would totally have trouble doing this too. I'd probably just try to be as objective as possible, meaning list the tasks you have completed and any time someone else said something you completed was good. Then write enough connecting words between them to make the document flow like a mostly normal letter. Your professor can then add whatever commentary they want to highlight the things that they believe are significant.\n\nNote that I intentionally wrote \"completed tasks\" up there, not \"accomplishments,\" because I'm guessing you don't feel equipped to tell which things you've done are worthy of being \"accomplishments.\" For example, maybe when you started the project you read several papers assigned -- to you, this would be completing homework as assigned, but to your supervisor they might note this as \"student got caught up on the relevant literature in the first two weeks, and clearly grasped the concepts in that time.\"",

          "text": "Thank you! Objectivity was my thought as well. I don't want it to seem bland, but I can write objectively about the things I did without feeling too strange. I did manage to contribute some good work during the time I knew this person. I created a porfolio of sorts for my letter writers including my CV, writing samples, draft of my statements, and what traits I possess that they might speak to. Hopefully this eases things in the right direction. I have to trust that this person saw something worthwhile in me if they've agreed to support me and that they'll fill in the rest.",
