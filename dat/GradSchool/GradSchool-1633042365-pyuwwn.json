  "text": "Let's say that you get a bachelor degree in music and have a cumulative GPA of 2.5. But then you went back to school and got a second bachelor's degree in engineering and got a 4.0 GPA and want to go to a master's degree for engineering. How will grad schools look at this and how will they calculate the cumulative GPA if you have two different bachelor degrees??",

Graduate admissions are a crapshoot and plenty of people with 4.0 GPAs, great GRE scores, research experience, strong letters of recommendation, and great fit with the department's research focus don't end up getting admitted. There's stuff that goes on behind the scenes that applicants aren't aware of, and the applicant pools vary every year. You could be rejected one year and admitted the next even though your application is exactly the same.  The best anyone can say is to put together the strongest application you are able to and spin the wheel of fortune.",
