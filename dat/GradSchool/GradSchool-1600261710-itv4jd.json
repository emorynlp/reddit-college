  "text": "For context, I am a teaching assistant for a 400 level physical chemistry class right now. My professor didn't solve a derivation in lectures and I received many questions about it over the week, so I posted the derivation on our online system two days before the exam. I just got an email from my professor letting me know my derivation was completely wrong. I fixed the issue but the exam is this morning and I am worried people will use my incorrect derivation and get the problem wrong.\n\nI feel guilty and like a horrible TA and could really use some advice and reassurance. How do you not let this affect you for the foreseeable future?\n\nEdit: I wanted to give you all an update. First, thank you so much for the encouragement and kind words it really helped me today!  \n\nThe first thing I did this morning was to update my announcement with the correct derivation on our online grading software. I also sent a mass email to all of the students in the class apologizing and including the correct derivation. Once I met with my professor, I apologized and he was very understanding and let me know that since it is such a tiny part of the exam we don't have to worry about it too much. If a lot of people have the wrong derivation I sent out as an answer he said we will discuss further and figure out what to do. All and all, it was a great learning experience for me and I will NEVER post anything without double-checking with someone again. \n\nThanks again for all the kind comments!",

Very normal) we get to see you guys as human beings and usually the professor curves it. If the professor doesn't curve it then they are putting their shortcomings onto the students. At least you tried to help, sometimes it doesn't work out and that's okay. What's important at the end of the day is everyone is learning. Sometimes the students learn better when mistakes are made because it breaks the monotony of education up.",
