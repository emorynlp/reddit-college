  "title:": "How to politely acknowledge bad supervisors",
  "text": "I am writing my thesis acknowledgments and I\u2019m not sure how to handle this situation. Most theses I look at have huge paragraphs waxing lyrical about how kind, generous, patient, helpful etc their supervisors are. Mine have been nothing of the sort and we do not get along. That being said I need to maintain a polite relationship not least for references. Other than one sentence acknowledging that they have supervised me, I\u2019m really not sure what else I can say to pad it out without lying. Any tips?",

While they may not have gone above-and-beyond in being a great mentor, they still had to support you/your project in other ways. Like taking you on in their lab, hosting lab facilities, etc. Hope that helps.",
