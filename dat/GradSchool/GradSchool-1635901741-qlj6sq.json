  "text": "I believe I'm burnout. It's been quite hard to get up on the morning or concentrate in anything at all latey - even smaller stuff, like watching some light YouTube videos or cooking. \n\nThing is: the manuscript of my project is nowhere near to be finished and I have a presentation of it by the end of this month. My advisor send me back some considerations and I need to rewrite a big part of it, on top of class work. I figured that I should just be sincere and tell him that I'm struggling to finish - and honestly to understand what he wants me to do. I always think I get it, but I never really get it at all.",

      "text": "You could straight forward tell him that you have been feeling burnout and having difficulties with tasks in general, so it would be helpful if as your advisor he could agree to have meetings to review some questions to make sure the work is on the right way and as to clarify some parts of it. Also if possible, to consider changing the delivery date according to the projected advances.",

      "text": "Hey, you sound really stressed, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I\u2019d reach out to your advisor and say that you\u2019re having a hard time making progress on yourself paper and you\u2019d like to sit down to make a plan. Let him know that you\u2019re having a hard time right now. Come in with any ideas or progress you\u2019ve made, as well as any questions you have.\n\nAt the same time, or even before, please address this burnout you\u2019re feeling! It\u2019s really common in grad school, and it\u2019s been particularly tough with the pandemic. You need more support. If your university has a counseling center, reach out. If you have health insurance that lets you seek a private therapist, consider going that route. Check with a primary care doctor about possible meds if you think that might help, or whether you need a referral to a specialist for that. \n\nProactively schedule self care for yourself where you get a break. Go for a walk, get some exercise, work on a hobby. Even coloring or paint by numbers can be fun. \n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble focusing, give the [Pomodoro method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works) a try. Be gentle with yourself about it, it\u2019s not meant to add stress. It can be a good way to drill down for a bit and then get a quick break in. \n\nIn terms of writing, do you need a silly motivator? Do you like kittens? Check out [Written? Kitten!](http://writtenkitten.co) if you just want to get some words on the page. Yes, it\u2019s ridiculous. But it\u2019s also kittens. \n\nMake sure you get enough rest, too. I realize that stress can make that harder. Been there. There are apps like Calm and Headspace that have some free content you can use to relax. If you have iOS, there\u2019s one called Oak that\u2019s free and has nice breathing exercises. Techniques like box breathing work \u2013 it\u2019s what Navy SEALs use to reduce stress. YouTube also has lots of options. If you\u2019re having trouble falling asleep, I recommend giving a body scan meditation a try. \n\nI know this is a lot of totally unsolicited advice, but I hope some of it helps. You deserve to feel better. This isn\u2019t you slacking or whatever, it\u2019s a health issue that needs to be addressed.",

Looks quite relaxing and you'll have a nice blanket after 365 days :)",

      "text": "Hi OP, I feel this way often too. There are a couple of things that help me. In the meetings with my advisor, I think I understand what she wants me to do, and then after the meeting, I have no clue. So what I did was get a Livescribe Echo pen. It is a special pen that has special paper where it records what you write and can be transferred electronically, but it records audio simultaneously as you write. When you are reviewing notes, you can go back to a section, press on the writing ink with the pen and it will playback what was said around the time you wrote the note. This has helped me A LOT! \n\nI also told my advisor that I have a hard time prioritizing tasks and get overwhelmed because everything seems like the same level of importance. Since then, she has been able to break down tasks for me into chunks that aren't as overwhelming.",

      "text": "I often feel this way with my PI. It's easy to blame yourself, but I think a lot of it comes down to PI blindness. They're looking at things from 10 miles up, and don't see all the technical hurdles *you* have to clamber over to actually get it there.   \n\n\nI think first step is to meet with your advisor again to fully understand what they're expecting from you. And if after that you realize there's too much on your plate, say you need to drop other responsibilities for it to be completed in time. You might also consider seeing a counselor to try and get on medication. I went through a similar burnout--lots to do, mind too foggy to understand how to do most, and no energy to do everything else--and antidepressants helped.",

      "text": "Hi OP, you\u2019ve gotten some really good advice here so far but I just wanted to add that you should consider seeing a professional. Burnout and early stages of depression can be pretty similar. Depression is a whole lot easier to treat early on. The fact that even simple things are hard to concentrate on is a bit worrying. I\u2019m not going to try to diagnose someone from a post, but a trained therapist or psychiatrist will have plenty of advice if this is simple burnout or something more serious.",

      "text": "First off I'm sorry you're going through a rough time. I went through a rough patch about a year and a half before I graduated. I was lucky enough to have a very compassionate advisor who already noticed I wasn't as productive as I had been, honestly maybe months before I did. I always made up excuses why experiment was moving slowly for xyz reasons; not sure she ever bought my excuses. I realize I was in a very fortunate situation and you may not have the same relationship with your advisor.\n\nI had a moment where I was borderline suicidal and did not care whether I lived or died which led to some reckless behavior. This moment was a wake up call for me. I didn't intend to tell her, but when she once again asked me what was going on with me and why my experiments weren't progressing, I told her what happened and it was the best thing I could've done, no more excuses. She immediately understood and began offering up solutions from giving me small tasks around the lab to feel a sense of accomplishment to making me understand there was no pressure on me from her for these results and that others in lab can help out as well.\n\nMy opinion is reach out to your advisor. Worst case scenario they're an asshole and don't understand and you know you should remove yourself from that environment; grad school is not worth sacrificing mental health for and there are alternative paths towards graduation. Most likely scenario I think is your advisor doesn't know how to support you - from my colleagues I've found this to be the case whether that's they don't want to deal with it or they literally don't know how, but at least your mental health is under consideration.\n\nMy only other piece of advice is to go seek out professional help. I personally gained a lot by seeing a therapist and would recommend everyone in grad school to seek out therapy.\n\nI hope you get the support you deserve and know that you'll get through this :)",
