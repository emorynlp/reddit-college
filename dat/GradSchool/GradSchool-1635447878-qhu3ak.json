  "text": "The PhD program is less than 10 years old so I will chalk up to just general inexperience. And this is just a rant as I do plan on taking fewer courses in the future.\n\nBut the full time status of a grad school in my state and country is 9 hours. The department really pushes that students take 12 hours of course work instead. This is on top of teaching 2 courses or being an assistant for the equivalent amount of hours.\n\nWork itself isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s just that coursework itself if fairly small in the grand scheme of things but take up so much time that it\u2019s impossible to plan around it. Meanwhile, the courses themselves suffer b/c of overcrowding. \n\n\nThe sheer number of classes needed to be taken is fairly high but the amount of courses are limited.  (This is young program) So classes are incredibly full while more than half the students are uninterested\nin the particular subject or faculty. Meanwhile, things like conferencing and publishing are much harder. I can\u2019t even attend conferences because I have class five days a week and I can\u2019t afford to miss more than 2 days in a row. \n\nThe very fact that I have to prioritize the mere butt-in-seat attendance over conferencing is insane. And all because there\u2019s not a single free weekday.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s entirely too much work, even on the grad level. 12 hour courses + 15 hour work demands that usually exceed that anyway is ridiculous. Increased coursework just fell more like a sabotage than a benefit.",

      "text": "Coursework is often heavy at the beginning of PhD programs, depending on the field. In my experience, the first year is heavy coursework with on-boarding into research projects/rotations, the second year is more coursework but a bit lighter, then years 3+ are no coursework and 100% research (in addition to teaching/other funding obligations).\n\nGoing to conferences and such is more common after the coursework is done because it's at that time that a PhD student/candidate is actually integrated into the research enough for attending conferences to be productive. Going to conferences as a first year, although not that rare, is uncommon in my experience unless you have shown some incredible research potential or progress.",

I was in a PhD program for two years where I conferenced once a semester and in summers (2-3 times a year). Then I took leave, bounced around as an adjunct, published a small amount when funded,  and only conferenced when invited. Then I officially left my university with a masters to join *this* PhD program. So maybe I\u2019m not used to doing entry level things like this anymore. \n\nBut yea, you have a point. I could just wait it out. It does get better.",

You weren't clear about that.\n\n12 hours + 2 TA courses per semester does seem excessive. If a public institution, could be they are pushing for the heavy coursework because state funding is tied to coursework hours.\n\n>The PhD program is less than 10 years old so I will chalk up to just general inexperience.\n\nOne of the important things to learn early in grad school is to *know what you don't know.*",

But how many students would go against that mandate when the department pushes them to it? \n\nIt\u2019s also a private university.\n\nIf it matters, the funding for the program is very good and is in a location that allows me to continue getting medical treatment with my regular doctors. Otherwise, I would have had to pause grad school. That combined with the faculty & it was a petty good deal. But yea, not many people go to grad school on a whim or by sheer luck. It takes some pretty intentional effort to apply, let alone to attend. So not entirely sure why you think I didn\u2019t research before coming.",

They have their reasons, I just said that the ends do not justify the means. You also assume that I\u2019m new to academia in general & I\u2019m not.\n\nThey aren\u2019t malicious in their push for 12 courses. If anything, it\u2019s indicative of excitement and a desire to keep everyone close knit. The program itself isn\u2019t very used to seeing their graduate students make independent contributions. So to prioritize course work over that independent thinking is fairly short sighted in a publish or perish profession. But in all honesty, I consider this ability to contrast their academic expectations with my own expectations, desires, and limitations as way more indicative of critical thinking skills than not. Better than just thinking \u201cwow, better have no opinion or thought about the things that impede rather than benefit.\u201d",
