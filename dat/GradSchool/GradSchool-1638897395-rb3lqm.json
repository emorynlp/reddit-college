  "text": "I am set to graduate in spring 2022 with a B.S in Integrative Organismal Biology having already obtained a minor in chemistry (with a focus in organic and biochem). My interests include organismal bio, ecology, behavioral ecology, entomology (primarily with Hymenopterans), evolution, and genetics. I am located in Northeast Pennsylvania and would like to go to school in and around the area, open to going to New York and New Jersey. If anyone knows of a really good program else where I\u2019m open to that as well, even if it\u2019s clear across the country. Interested in M.S and doctorate programs anyone may know about or grants/funding that may be good for me to apply for !! thank you all",

      "text": "While you might be lucky and have someone from the field respond to this thread, I think you should start by going to professors in your current school who have a knowledge of the field and the schools that are available for you (and can be a good connection to help you be accepted to these programs). Otherwise, open a journal online about organismal biology or ecology and start opening articles that sound cool (even if you're paywalled) until you see an article from a local university.",
