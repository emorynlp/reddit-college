  "text": "Hey I'm filling out the common app for UT Austin and have some questions:\n\n\\-School wants me to fill out info on every school I've ever enrolled in before I get very far in the app (sending letters out). In high school, I took some classes that I got college credit for, but I didn't attend the university (took an English class through Syracuse University, called SUPA English, and a keyboarding class at the high school through a community college). These credits went towards my total hours at my undergraduate university, FSU. \n\nDo I need to list these as schools I went to and get transcripts from Syracuse and the community college? Trying to figure out if that's necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, do people list Summa Cum Laude at one of their honors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot!",
