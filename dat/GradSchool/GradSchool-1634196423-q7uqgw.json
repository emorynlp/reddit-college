  "text": "If you get nervous during talks and can't stop your voice from quivering... read this.\n\nI gave a talk today and 8 hours later, I got some feedback from friends that blew my mind..\n\nI get painfully shaky when I present (first and only panic attack over zoom in 2020 when presenting to my national lab.) I feel like I can't think straight, no idea why... like come on!! I know what I'm talking about and socially I'm a confident extrovert. I have no problem speaking in any other context.\n\nBut whenever I give a talk at a research meeting, for class, conference, etc... I ALWAYS have this unbearable painful feeling in my throat of my voice quivering. I can HEAR IT so clearly. I have always experienced this. I try my hardest to suppress it and I can FEEL my neck muscles damping the chaotic vibrations. Painful!! I have to focus to tune out these sensations and remember what to say.\n\nToday: Gave a technical scientific talk this morning to >30+ people. Of course felt like I could barely get the words out. Shaking internally and knowing my voice was quivering. I couldn't keep a constant tone. \n\n8 hours later, I was at a study group with ~8 other PhD students who were at my talk. One of the girls said to me:\n\"Hey, by the way I wanted to tell you that I love your voice when you're presenting, it is so smooth and calming\" \nOf course I was almost crying and as others were chiming in on how good my voice was I was so confused, asking them :\n\"My voice wasn't shaking? It always shakes in front of people I could barely speak!\" \n\nAnd everyone was telling me that they genuinely ENJOYED my talk and especially enjoyed listening to my voice. They think I sound GOOD???!?? \n\nMind blowing. \n\nIt's been years that I thought I sounded like shit but turns out it's all in my head.\n\nSo, not sure how many can relate to this. But IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR PRESENTING VOICE IS BAD, it probably isn't as bad as you think. If you think it's a horrible nightmare, shit. People may even love it!",

      "text": "Thank you for sharing that. I had a similar situation. I had a theatre director (acting coach) give me advice when I told her I could hear my voice shake when I spoke to large groups. She said, like you, most people will not hear it, as much of it is *literally* in your head. \n\nBut she also suggested that when we get nervous and start speaking, we inhale more than we exhale, which causes our voice to shake. I learned before I talk in these situations, to take several deep breaths making sure to exhale more than inhale.",

It's crazy frustrating because I nail this stuff during rehearsals but when it comes time for the concert I get very anxious and shake as well. Beta blockers have helped in the past. But like you said, we tend to think it's worse than it actually is, and when I go back to listen to the performances it's never as bad as I think.",

Fuck them.\n \n* Some people are trying to give constructive feedback, but are bad at it. Take what they say and review it later to see if you can in fact improve something.\n\nAnd most importantly\n\n* Every single person in every single presentation you will ever give has at one point in their life had gut crippling, curled in the fetal position on the toilet, goosebumps and cold sweat causing diarrhea. Every. One.  Realizing that makes takes away any intimidating aspect of them, and usually results in a speaker much more relaxed in their presentation.",

This was the first time I'd ever seen myself present, and I was shocked that I didn't look as terrified as I felt. I didn't detect any of the voice shaking at all. Since then, I still get really nervous before I present, but when I get up there I generally have a pretty decent time. It's interesting that what I was most afraid of was people seeing that I was afraid of them.",

      "text": "Literally everyone has trouble speaking in public.  The only proven way to overcome the discomfort and tense-voice syndrome is to dive into it, giving talk after talk after talk.  After the first couple of dozen (a) the feeling fades; and (b) for \"important\" talks where you do get a bit of the pre-talk butterflies, you can greet the feeling as an old friend.  \n\nOther talk advice:  when you're giving a talk, there's a tendency to spew information fast!  You're keyed up and nervous, and time sort of seems to slow down.  Do not succumb to that urge.  Pause.  Take a deep breath from time to time for emphasis.  If you do that, you will at first feel like you're being a fool at the podium -- but people will admire your poise and your calm.  Also, people will understand you better.  Even seasoned scientists take time to process new information, and cannot keep up if you go lickety-split through your important points.",
