  "text": "I'm feeling proud of myself and I want to share my success in the hopes that other grad students will feel inspired to stop accepting subpar conditions. \n\nMy PhD is taking longer than the allotted 4 years due to hiccups early on (skiing accident, surgery, death in the family, mental health issues) plus the pandemic. There has been twice during my PhD that I've seriously considered quitting. My supervisor really plugged for me not to quit each time. After the conversations we had, it really hit home for me that this work is valuable to him. He's invested a lot of time  and money in it too, and this work being done helps his career. \n\nI was also offered a job about 6 months ago, which is one of the things that made me tempted to quit. I was really hating being isolated at home, and here was a job that I would want when I'm done. I know I don't NEED a PhD to be happy in successful in life. I started it becasue I thought it would be interesting and stimulating and rewarding, not becasue I felt like I needed to have a PhD. Being offered this job kind of gave me a sense of what my market value is. So I decided to finish as long as I was being compensated fairly for what my time is worth.\n\nMy supervisor all along said not to worry about money during the pandemic, and that he would have our back. So I took him up on it, and asked for what I think my time is worth. I successfully negotiated that I won't have a drop in salary during my 5th year, and my salary is probably at the high end for grad students in my field I suspect.\n\nI know that I'm privileged to have a supervisor who has the financial ability to make this work. But I think this comes back to knowing your worth. I won't work for people who don't have the financial backing to pay me fairly. I think grad students are exploited - your supervisor needs your work to succeed, and they should be paying you fairly for it. My friend who is doing a PhD in Europe is considered an employee and has a contract. She doesn't have to deal with this.",
