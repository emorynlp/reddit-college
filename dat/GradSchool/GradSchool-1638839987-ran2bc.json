  "text": "I\u2019m not sure if I want advice or just to type this out so I can get this out of my mind. I\u2019m currently working towards my MS in structural engineering in an online program. I work full time and my job is expecting me to obtain this degree for a promotion down the road. \n\nBut, I\u2019m crashing and burning. In the past 3 months, my sister passed away unexpectedly, my relationship with my partner is very on the rocks, and work has been killing me with 80 - 90 hour weeks, knowing full well I need to work on my assignments for school. I\u2019m so deeply depressed and have had trouble taking care of myself, much less maintaining my grades. I haven\u2019t submitted two homework assignments and my productivity at work is slipping. I love my job and my coursework under normal circumstances, but I\u2019m just struggling to get going again. I\u2019ve told my professors and my boss about my circumstances (minus the relationship problems), and I think they\u2019re at the end of their rope with me. I\u2019ve been trying to go to therapy, but I haven\u2019t felt an improvement. I feel like failure for my life falling apart, and I\u2019m so sad that my interest in my program is gone. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know if I need advice or just a shoulder to cry on, but thank you for letting me vent.",

      "text": "That fucking sucks dude. I don\u2019t have much to offer, but it will work out in the end. My condolences. It really just sounds like you need time to process and grieve. Take semester off. No degree or promotion is worth your mental well-being. And there should be grievance leave or something (of course depending on your location), but honestly I would just take the paid or unpaid time off too. Rest. Take care of yourself. You can use this as a reminder that it\u2019s ok to hit pause on life and use the time to figure things out. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once and that doesn\u2019t make you a failure, just human. You have all the time in the world to continue working later\u2026 hope you feel better and get some time off!!! I wish you the best!",

      "text": "That sucks man. My advice would be to talk to your boss and your advisor and explain the situation to them. Maybe something can be worked out. If that doesn\u2019t work, and I don\u2019t say this lightly, then it is probably fine for you to sit down and ask yourself what is more important to you, this degree and your career or your family and your wellbeing? I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that, but if it does, choose the later.",

      "text": "*virtual hugs*\n\nYou are going through grief, loss and just a really stressful time overall. It's not you, sometimes, unfortunate events just happen one after the other. This is in no way a reflection on your self. You aren't alone in feeling this way either. \n\nAs for your grief, it will take time. I feel like you are simply really tired emotionally and justifiably so, which obviously reflects in other areas of your life.\n\nI would suggest to first go easy on yourself. If you do feel like falling apart, know that we have all been there. Your advisor and your boss, both are people too, u might think they are at the end of their ropes but maybe they aren't and completely understand the situation. How about you sit down and talk with them not about managing work but about how you have been feeling burdened and stressed out lately? To your SO too? The key here is open and honest (often vulnerable) communication with people who are valuable in your life - whether that be family or colleagues, that genuinely care about you. Perhaps you can establish an easy less hectic work schedule for yourself and spend quality time with your family and SO, who understand and know your grief better.\n\nThe more you share your grief, the more it seems to lessen - this is something that worked for me and giving it ample time.\n\nIt's okay to not be productive and just go through the motions while you emotionally heal. Remember to be kind to yourself first, even if it means cutting back on things professionally, u can always bounce back when you are ready.\n\nTake care of yourself man, it will be okay. I am rooting for you!",
