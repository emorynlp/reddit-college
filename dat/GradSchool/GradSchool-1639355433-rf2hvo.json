      "text": "I'm co-supervised by people in 2 departments, so I have my main one from my department who is the one I have meetings with regularly and go to for most things. The other I talk to more for that side of the project and when I need to do stuff in her lab but definitely not as much as my main one. For big things like my proposal they both read it and provided feedback. I guess it depends how involved each of your supervisors want to be. I'm happy with the way mine is where I have my more main one but still have someone I can talk to about things he may not know as much about.",

      "text": "The dynamic is pretty good for me. I like them both and they both like each other, so everything is respectful even when one of them gets busy. They complement each other's strengths/weaknesses. And they're careful to always include each other and get on the same page. \n\nWriting manuscripts is a whole ordeal. They are both super involved and have different areas of expertise. Once I've worked hard to get one of them happy with a draft I can pretty much count on the other one having a ton more edits. It's pretty brutal and can feel overwhelming, but then my drafts usually get through coauthors and even reviewers pretty well (so far). \n\nI think my main issues with each of them come from their own weaknesses/blindspots as advisors, which actually makes having both of them kind of helpful. For example, advisor A is a lot better about enforcing work life balance while advisor B tends to overlook that in favor of generating as much data as possible. On the flip side, A will catastrophize errors whereas B always stays positive and problem solves. A is better with stats and results, B is stronger with the introduction, etc. \n\nAnd then there is a solid benefit from having two very  smart people with a ton of knowledge very involved with my research. So, overall, I'm happy with the situation.",
