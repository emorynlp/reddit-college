  "text": "delete this if this is not the right place. \n\nin my 3/4 semester of my msba program. i feel like a complete loser. i have not learned a single thing. i thought that i would learn python, r , tableau, vba, pivot table but i couldn't i couldn't even load up a csv file in r. i made excuses why i couldn't contribute to the group project, stating personal matter and what not. i even paid my group to do it for me. \n\ni feel like a complete failure and with finals coming up nothing is setting in place. \n\ni thought grad was easy given how the distribution curve was significantly better than undergrad. i only got in because covid allowed almost everyone into graduate school and i never needed the likes of a gmat/gre. had i been forced to take them, i for sure would not had gotten in. \n\nno due diligence was taken. i hate stat with a passion and i did not know that data analysis required a vast knowledge of stat. \n\n20k and two years of my life down the drain",

      "text": "Grade distribution is better in grad school because only the top 40%-ish of undergraduates go on to a Masters, and most programs require you to maintain a 3.5 or better GPA. But, yeah, it's a lot harder than undergrad, or at least it should be (this varies by program, of course). I'm sorry you're struggling, but if you haven't failed any of your other classes, you may be able to re-take this one next year so that your time, money, and effort doesn't go to waste.",

      "text": "If it helps at all, I got a C in Biostats I in my first term of my Masters. I could go into \"reasons\", but the bottom line is really that I foolishly assumed that all my As in math were going to mean something there, and I didn't study as much as I needed to. It ended up working out well for me ultimately (I am a hopeless optimist, thanks Dad for making me like this) but it turns out that being a rockstar 4.0 student in undergrad makes you dead average (at best) in grad school.",

It just means you don't thrive in that environment. \n\nIf you really hate it that much you should probably think about dropping out, or just toughing it out the rest of the way if you have the ability to do so. \n\nThink on your own position, talk to people who are willing to help you, think for yourself again, then make a decision and create a plan to go through with it. You're not screwed, probably idk you.",

      "text": "Apologies but I\u2019m confused. You claimed that you thought you would learn R. But you also stated that you couldn\u2019t load in a .csv file in R? Aren\u2019t you learning R by trying to load in a .csv file? You then proceeded with statements saying \u201cyou made excuses\u201d and \u201cpaid your group to do it for me\u201d. Reading that made me think that the group project is R focused and you made excuses and paid your teammates to essentially not do the project in R by avoiding to do one of the first things for the project: loading in data. Please clarify.\n\nDespite if you were actually trying or not, you were given the opportunity to learn. I left my pure math PhD with a masters having not remembered what L-functions and modular forms are. But even if I don\u2019t know exactly the maths, I know two things: a) research in pure mathematics isn\u2019t suited for me and b) I learned how to structure my arguments logically thanks to all the training I received from my \u2018failed\u2019 experience.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you to decide what you learned from your experience. I honestly can\u2019t tell if effort was actually put into learning or not solely by reading your post, but whatever the case may be, there\u2019s something to be learned.",
