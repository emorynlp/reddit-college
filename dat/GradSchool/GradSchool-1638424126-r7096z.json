  "text": "I know experimentalists with spectroscopy knowledge are always welcome in industry, but job postings understandably specify certain disciplines. If one does a PhD on something with limited industrial applications (like rotational spectroscopy), are they effectively barred from industry work? If so, will companies accept you if you do a postdoc in the specific technique they require, as opposed to working on it as a Ph.D student?",

      "text": "Note: all my experience is in Australia.\n\nHere they just want you to know the technique and they don't care about anything else. If you have used a super similar technique you will probably get away with it as well, for example I know in electrochem a lot of the techniques are very similar.\n\nYes project management, budgeting, communication ect are great. However, they will learn all that about you in the interview and from your references. At the resume stage, it's techniques and software packages/programming languages and that's all they are looking for.",
