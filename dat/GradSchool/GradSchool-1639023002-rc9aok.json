  "title:": "How to develop goals outside of academia?",
  "text": "Just like the title says. For almost all of undergrad, grad school was the goal. Now that I\u2019m here, at my dream school, in a fantastic program, I\u2019m beginning to wonder how to develop goals outside of academia? I haven\u2019t put any thought into my life goals beyond academia, and in a way I (wrongly) don\u2019t view goals outside this sphere as \u201cvalid\u201d. I also (wrongly) have a hard time with goals that don\u2019t have a tangible and impressive result, which I personally view as character flaw. I am extremely goal oriented, and that\u2019s why I was able to push myself hard and get into grad school in the first place, but I need more. Has anyone else struggled with this? Are there resources out there for this kind of thing? Or should I just go back to therapy?",

      "text": "This is something I really struggled with, especially when my goals within grad school were often delayed by things not within my control. I ended up training for a half marathon and that was great. It was helpful for me to have something to focus on that didn't relate to academia at all. I think there were a lot of mental benefits of having something outside of work/school that was just about me as a person reaching a goal that was hard for me. Weirdly, I think I ended up being more successful in regards to my academic goals too.",

      "text": "Not viewing goals outside of academia as valid is a scary thought. I may be wrong, but I think many people get so hung up on the goal of grad school and the vision of who they\u2019ll be/become at that stage. In reality, you\u2019re the same person and it\u2019s a tough realisation that there is frankly a lot more to the world than academia. \n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve had tunnel vision on one thing, blazed that trail for a long time and finally smashed through the door only to realise it\u2019s not the finish line.",

You must have at least a few other things you find intellectually interesting. Also, look at your cohort/lab/faculty for people with more balance - what do they find interesting outside of their research?",

      "text": "Had the same issues. My slump came after completing my quals at which point the only goal seemed to be completing my thesis and graduating. Writing papers obviously were goals too but those got delayed for many reasons.  I resorted to many side projects such as participating in hackathons, consulting competitions, and winning awards. These things kept me going but at the end of the day these didn't add any confidence on whether I wanted to stay in academia. Rather, the more I explored I wanted to leave. In the end, getting a good job/internship and leaving academia became the ultimate goal. Not sure if these are the kind of goals you were talking about but just wanted to share my experience. I've also written up [four advice that got me through grad school](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/four-tips-you-need-to-know-before-starting-your-phd-ce950d39e3d) in case that might help too.",

I\u2019m satisfied with my masters and I want to go out and live life at least a little after going straight from undergrad to grad. Maybe next steps would be a fellowship in a incredible place? Other than that, I just don\u2019t know.",

Just follow a plan and do what you're told, and before you know it, you're crossing a 42.2 k finish line and get a medal!\nSo easy and fun. I'm the kind of person who goes all in, but in running I'm definitely not ever going to excell. So I just enjoy this silly hobby which is meaningfull to me and pointless to everybody else.",
