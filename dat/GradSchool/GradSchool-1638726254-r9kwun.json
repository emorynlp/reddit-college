  "text": "I\u2019m in the life sciences and am salaried like many of you. If I calculate my real earnings per hour worked, it\u2019s under minimum wage. I can literally make more money as a cashier at Target than working full-time to advance our knowledge of biology. \n\nZooming out and looking at my postdocs on their NIH standard funding grants (~$50K/yr), I happen to know that fresh high school grads in the military (with no skills or degree whatsoever) make more than the postdocs. *Granted, this comparison is accounting for food and housing allowance, as well as various benefits like healthcare, life insurance, home and auto discounts, 401K benefits, etc. You can check it for yourself [here](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Calculators/RMC-Calculator/) (data for entry: E2, <2, single, 1, no, 08640.) \n\n>For context, the zip code is that of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ, which has a total population of about 40K, making it directly comparable to Fort Knox (40121). While picking the absolute largest bases (Benning: 31801, Bragg: 28303) does result in lower pay than Dix, after factoring in the [financialization of benefits](https://the-military-guide.com/much-military-pay-really-worth/), those individuals are still making more than our postdocs.\n\nWe work full-time, busting our butts to the point where every single one of us has had burnout, depression, and thoughts of dropping out. Do you seriously think we are compensated fairly for our experience, hours worked, and the mental and physical toll this path extracts? Look at what [Germany pays](https://www.myscience.de/en/working/salary/doktoranden-gehaelter) it\u2019s PhD students. Do you think America couldn\u2019t afford that? \n\nThe economy is signaling that unskilled entry-level workers are worth more than people who have invested enormous amounts of time, energy, and money to develop deep expertise. Yes that\u2019s how it is, but is that how it _should_ be? There\u2019s absolutely no reason we should sit idly by and accept this. It\u2019s time we get together and have our voices be heard. It\u2019s time to enact change!\n\nEDIT: if a strike won\u2019t produce sufficient pressure, then how do we collectively leverage ourselves to do it? We don\u2019t have the money to lobby, so that\u2019s not really an option, and a national effort to unionize would be difficult to coordinate. How do we effect change? Ideas are welcome.",

      "text": "As a student at a school where graduate students are unionized-- we went on strike one time (with an alliance with the union of our support staff, including janitorial staff, who also went on strike). It was an *extremely* fast strike and our demands were met almost immediately. \n\nAt a contract negotiation a few years later, we voted to authorize a strike again and the administration caved the day before the strike was set to start.\n\nMy experience is that a union that is unified across the university is *EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE*. If every grad student across campus declines to work, it is literally not possible to fill our jobs. (I see comments that we can be easily replaced-- perhaps, with enough time. But most programs are training you for years to have specialized knowledge, and paying someone to walk in and take both research and teaching jobs on spot would be an *extremely* expensive endeavor. Training someone to do my personal job would take hiring someone who already has a graduate education and training them for like two years, lol. And many of our jobs cannot wait until someone is found or hired or trained.) The university does not work unless we do. If you are not unionized, I *strongly* advise unionizing. \n\nThere have been wildcat strikes and other non-organized strikes at other universities that have looked very painful for the graduate students involved. I would be happy to symbolically support my graduate student peers with a walkout or something similar, but our present contract is negotiated by our union and, AFAIK, will not be changing. I am not sure that I see as clear and efficient a path forward with a nationwide strike (that will likely be short in duration and will almost certainly have a large hunk of people ignoring it) compared to unionizing *your* campus, organizing a strike on *your* campus, and engaging in direct action at the university level. A university can survive a spattering of graduate students across the country walking out for a while; it cannot support every grad student on their campus declining to work. \n\nThis is not at all to say that I don't support bigger change across the country-- I absolutely do. But anyone who is reading this who is a graduate employee at a university without a graduate student union could potentially have a HUGE impact on the graduate students on your own university. \n\nI should note that I am not a labor expert, so I would, of course, defer to people who are.",

              "text": ">How is this \"strike\" enforced\n\nYour peers may think negatively of you (unless you have a very good reason for not participating) and you will hopefully have ample understanding of the ways that not going on strike disproportionally impacts some of your peers and will feel bad about harming them. (E.g. if the strike is over the administration wanting to cut the healthcare that protects your disabled peers, you hopefully care about those people and want them to have healthcare.)\n\nIf you are in the union and opt not to strike, I do believe you would have to resign from the union, which means you would not have union protection for future issues, and if the strike is over contract negotiation, you are working without the contract the union negotiated, so the university can do whatever they want. But that's not different from just... not having a union in general. \n\nAnd, to be clear, at my university at least, you are absolutely not *required* to join the union, but our union is extremely effective, so most people do. The actual strike was before my time, and it lasted like... a day and a half. We prepared to strike a few years ago but did not. The primary way that I am impacted by my union on a day-to-day basis is: 1. I have excellent benefits including great healthcare, paid parental leave, etc. 2. My wage is tied to inflation and cost-of-living. 3. My union is EXTREMELY good at solving random problems, whether that is related to my status as an employee, student, or human being (e.g. healthcare issues). However, there are absolutely graduate employees at my university that are not union members and largely they can ignore union activity. They passively benefit from our union contract which increases their own wages and access to employee benefits; I am not sure of any way that they would be disadvantaged by the union.",

              "text": "So I'm going to try to answer your question without getting snarky since I deleted the first two attempts that started off very snarky.\n\nThat's not how unions work. There typically isn't an \"enforcement\" of a strike on the union's side of things. How it works largely depends on several factors, the most important being whether or not the employer has recognized the union, and whether or not there are current negotiations in place over a contract.\n\nBasically, if someone chooses to be a scab, they're returning to work without the benefit of their existing or possible union contract. Depending a variety of factors, that could also result in long term negative impacts if it's not addressed at the bargaining table -- which is typically the case because a union benefits by representing all employees or as many employees as possible, so even if someone is a dick and crosses the picket line, in the big picture, having that person in the bargaining unit going forward is a good thing.\n\nWhether or not someone is able to scab largely depends on the willingness of the employer to let someone scab.\n\nSomething to remember is even if you're crossing a picket line if you're not being a dick about it, or there is a good reason your union sisters and brothers will certainly recognize and understand a good reason.\n\nIn private sector strikes I am aware of multiple examples of workers being encouraged to scab by their brothers and sisters because of a mitigating circumstance, usually something related to health care. \n\nAs a general rule, unions don't want bad things to happen to the people they represent -- but at some point you gotta ask yourself if you're not going to stand up for yourself during graduate school, when are you going to start standing up for yourself?",

This is 2900 euros without tax deductions. This increases up to 35K until the 5th year of phd.\n\nItaly pays around 1000-1500 euros to its PhD students. There is the ministerial scholarship of around 1000 euros + additional scholarship from department depending on funding/if cola is high in a particular city (Milan, Bologna).\n\nFrance pays around 1800 euros. France also has something called CIFRE scholarships, which are industrial phd scholarships, salaries can be a bit higher.\n\nBelgium pays around 2500 euros.\n\nThere are also project based scholarships, if you score a Horizon 2020 scholarship (or its successor - Horizon Europe) or Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Scholarships your phd salary can be quite high.",

PhDs unionizing is also much needed, and I would highly recommend to build or join one for your faculty. However for much the same reason, full unionisation remains a pipe dream until every phd position doesn't get over a hundred applications.\n\nA lot of awareness could help by pointing that to under(graduate) students and make them aware of the numbers and the reality of getting a PhD. Especially in STEM areas, if you consider the lost income and career, without a reasonable prospect of tenure, those amounts can be over $500,000. The lack of awareness, and the boastful promises from universities and professors on academic career and prestige blinds most students. Because let's be honest, in quite a few career areas you can make more impact, do more actual research, get more prestige and more respect simply if you go for a professional career (and many of them have R&D tracks). Scientific positions and careers are idolized far too much while they are often just as bureaucratic as government jobs.\n\nMore money to academia won't change the fact that it is a pyramid scheme, and it will just mean that the scale increases with more phds/postdocs and not better conditions for each. One of the biggest problem right now is that we have about 1 assistant professor position for every 20 phds graduates (pre-pandemic numbers, may be much higher now). Predation on naive young people's dreams is one of the core business models of academia, and the ridiculous postdoc positions add on that sunk cost fallacy. I've seen people be stuck on postdoc for over half a decade, moving from country to country, with no tenure. They are basically unemployable anywhere except for junior-mid level positions while their peers are looking towards principal/staff employee or senior managers by that point making more than a full professor.",

This is not specific to academia, it is the foundation for exploitation of the youth and immigrants in this country. How could it be, that a career requiring so much education, hard work, and demonstrations of ability result in poorer career outcomes than analogous careers that require much less from their workforce? \u201cIt must be worth it, because people continue to do it\u201d, is one of the worst inertial forces when it comes to human behavior in society, and is corrected through examining the meaningless platitudes and phrases we use to justify absurd and irrational conditions to each other.",

Maybe that's your goal, I don't know, but it's not gonna be popular with the people you're trying to negotiate with if you tell them they need to start paying their students 80k when the students only need 20k to live comfortably just because students need 60k to live comfortably in NYC (made up numbers, I realize they aren't accurate). Also, top-down management tends to be slower to respond and makes it easier to have issues lost in bureaucracy and different priorities of the group at large. Solidarity is great but grassroots movements tend to create more engagement because you don't feel as though you're paying dues to some abstract body with no real representation at your school.\n\nThe typical process involves creating a school-specific union which then joins a larger, national union like UAW. I'm guessing this is because of the scarcity of graduate student unions at the moment. I think creating a national union specifically for grad students/postdocs would be a positive and great goal in the end, but at the moment it has got to be a grassroots movement that is focused on building support from the ground up.",

That effort has been tied to long-standing influence efforts to make the people who would most benefit from a union think that they are bad and inconsistent with their identity. Industrial leaders spend a lot of time and effort on this goal. \n\nSince students only spend a few years at an institution, and as students, the high turnover in any labor union of students means that there is little continuity of leadership and thus the leaders are always just learning the ropes in an enterprise that has been designed to foil their efforts.",

The perfect example of this is the UAW's demands becoming a ball-and-chain on the US automotive industry, hence why not only have the Big 3 automakers lost a hell of a lot of sway, but in truth the Japanese (non-union) automakers now employ more Americans than the American companies do.\n\nThe blunt reality is that there is a surplus of some forms of highly-skilled labor, including those with doctorates. It's a weird problem, and is going to require a much more thoughtful solution than unions have ever been capable of achieving.",

      "text": "I think the comparison to the military is a flawed example. Im a vet and I first hand had all the benefits in question. Tricare health care, BAH, sustenance allowance, uniform allowance. I was an E5 in relatively remote maine, and my take home was  57k a year after taxes. from personal experience, even as an E3 in a more populated area with a higher BAH rate, I was still only making around 34k after taxes. You can game the BHA however you want on the calculator, but the truth is the most of the military population exists in lower allowance rate areas. I mean you wanna see a waste of money look at the BAH rates in Boston or SF. but not everyone gets that. a small fraction do.\n\nBy all means advocate for yourself, please do not think I am saying that PHD students do not deserve better pay, they absolutely do. I am in my masters right now but I see how hard the doctoral students work in my department. It is unreal. but do not justify it on the pay someone else is receiving in an unrelated field. The military and academia are both specialized industries that require training. Also America as a whole places more value on the military. The problem with this is the *lack of support* for students, not the *overabundance of support* for the military.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso. Those in the military who are actually in that pay bracket of 50-60k a year, who are NOT in high BAH areas \"gaming the benefits\", are not unskilled labor. looking at my training transcript that was provided to me when I left the military I have roughly 90 credit hours worth of training when viewed in the academic sense.\n\nbut actual man hours I had working and training in my assigned job was in the thousands of hours. I spent 6 year in, which is around 12000 hours of working time (40hr week, 50 working weeks a year) obvious not all of it is specialized training or work, but i would venture to say that at least 40% of my time in was spent \"in my field\".\n\nAnd I didn't do anything crazy or cool, I had a very average job. I was a small boat mechanic that worked Aids to navigation in the Coast Guard.",

      "text": "I have a hard time answering this because I am biased. I had a great time in grad school (maybe the best 5 years of my life) and never felt that I was not compensated enough. I lived quite comfortably and even got to save a little by the end of it. I also can't help compare it to the rest of the world, which with the possible exception of a couple of other countries, pays their PhDs a LOT less than the US. Given that I got a livable stipend, free tuition (which adds at least another 10-15k a year), and health insurance, I felt pretty good about it. \n\nI don't mean to invalidate other people's feelings on the subject, it's just that I don't share the same negative experience with grad-school. But even if I did, there are problems. For one thing, organizing a nationwide strike would be virtually impossible. Second, there's the question of whether this is financially viable. Grad student money come from a variety of sources, and not all schools/departments would be equally capable of just raising grad student salaries. Could this result in fewer grad students being admitted? Lastly, I'm not convinced that the \"burnout, depression, and thoughts of dropping out\" would be significantly reduced by a higher salary. \n\nThat said, I would unequivocally support: \n\n- Higher pay for postdocs: this would make suffering through grad school a little more tolerable, and IMO it is a bit easier to achieve. \n\n- Local grad student unions: give grad students the power to solve problems on a per-institution basis. \n\n- More active effort on the behalf of the department/university to support the students' mental health. This might include proper training for PIs, who in my experience are often the cause of mental health problems.",

This is obviously field dependent, but these are just not realistic things unless some funding agency mandate comes out forcing their hand. It's not a tiny compensation gap. Another lab here got a grant for some research from a photonics company, and their HR thought the PI was joking when she told them the labor rates here.\n\nMaybe long term it would happen, but that's not actually relevant to me because I'll never be making that money. This is also ignoring the practical legal challenges we face. On paper our compensation is nearly six figures. In practice everyone is half time at best and the vast majority of benefits are worthless and not used (how many grad students need university lawyers on retainer?). The university will point to the ~90k number even though reality is $25k. It's doubly frustrating when I look around and see that we clearly have more money than labor, but that's too much of a microenvironment for the university to move on.

To my mind, the best means of applying pressure is to turn down their admission offers in favor of ones that provide living stipends.

That's also probably a grossly high estimate given how big the department is. It arguably also pays for some small percentage of custodian salary as well. Grant overhead pays for the building, electricity, and building maintenance. Initial construction costs are paid partially by the state and partially by private donations. Actual building modifications and research materials are all taken out of grant money and paid to the school directly. I am charged separate fees for things like the libraries on campus, IT, and the city's public transportation. I take no actual classes. Just the seminar class and a ton of bookkeeping research credit hours. My compensation is entirely funded by the DOE.\n\nThe tuition money charged is just fake. Sure, they do give the department tuition money and then take it back for the waiver, but there's also a reason why becoming a resident for tuition purposes isn't even encouraged despite that reducing the waiver by ~90% which would pay for about .5 students (including in state tuition waiver, benefits, and salary).\n\nGranted, if it was less opaque there'd probably be more hell raised about how the plurality of a grad student's compensation is just a number in a spreadsheet moving through different departments a few times.",

Advocating for fair and adequate wages across the entire segment of the work force is really necessary, otherwise you\u2019re going to be putting several disenfranchised groups against each other.\n\nMost of the efforts I see stagnate because adjuncts making less than grad stipends feel a lack of solidarity, and postdocs lobbying for more than faculty make also tend to sour support from other needed areas.\n\nSimilarly, most caps for graduate wages by RAships are set by government grants, so there\u2019s very little individual faculty or institutions can do.",

Getting an opportunity to learn about labor issues across the institution and work collaboratively might be a great first step.",

It\u2019s not that they should be paid less (they should actually make more), it\u2019s that the macro market is economically valuing us as if we don\u2019t have any skills and haven\u2019t \u201cinvested in ourselves\u201d.

(for example, I'd estimate that, very roughly, it's fairly typical for STEM internships to pay about half as much as entry-level full-time jobs).\n\nIn my field, civil engineers with a PE (licensure) make a bit more than the average professor, if I have the numbers right; then compare an EIT (unlicensed, but full-time and working towards a license) to a postdoc and an intern to a PhD student, and, yep, the interns are making a bit more, hourly, than the PhD students (on average and very roughly).  [The academic equivalents are much more educated, but I think career-progression-wise they're roughly comparable.]\n\nAssuming that that isn't terrible reasoning, the implication is that the problem just cascades from undervaluing research in general.",

They are sincerely looked up to, and many are far more familiar to their students than their lecturers. Personally I would argue that my TA\u2019s did more to teach me than my lecturers in undergrad, on average. They certainly are responsible for teaching the most challenging and involved concepts and tasks, as well as doing the actual work of grading and serving as a general resource. Many lecturers are also not interested in opposing grad student strikes, as they are themselves primarily concerned with grants and research, and in some ways are also exploited to teach undergrad (although much less so than grad students and adjuncts).\n\nThere is a possible movement where everyone in the classroom is recruited for academic labor reform, that uses TAs in the core of its strike, supported by both the students they teach and the lecturers they assist, together against the non-overlapping interests of university administration. Ask most professors and they will tell you that university administration has overgrown and subsumed the initial purpose of universities as institutions of learning and has warped them into just another financial managerial machine.",

It feels like a massive breach in trust for a career track that is so monolithic and requires a lifelong investment. Adjuncts are paid like 4-5 times lower than tenured professors, right?\n\nLowering tuition while enabling collective bargaining is possible because the majority of the budget for universities does not go towards costs of education. For many universities, most tuition doesn't go to the actual salaries for the positions and services that are necessary to teach and support undergraduate education, but rather to \"staff\" or administration.\n\nThis is all a larger thing, but there is a strong argument to be made that higher education, despite advertising itself as the primary form of vertical mobility, has instead served as a gatekeeper for class and furthered inequality in the US. I forget the exact statistic, but someone from a wealthy background has three times of a higher likelihood of being admitted into a program than an equivalent applicant from a working background. Of those that acquire a bachelor's degree, more than half are paid the same as people with a high-school diploma. It would be wrong to say that higher education is generally a fraud, but it seems like it for a great number of people in a whole generation or two that have indebted themselves for it. I think a lack of public funding for higher education, basic science research grants, and general wealth inequality are the context for many of these issues. But these issues, and the way many universities allocate their budgets, are all separate from the fact that all employees of large institutions should be able to collectively bargain with their employers, which graduate students are often prohibited from.",

I\u2019m at a PUI, and teaching is still only about 60% of my contracted time at 2-4 courses a semester.\n\nA huge issues is that teaching is not well valued at a lot of universities, especially not relative to research. And that\u2019s a bad thing for students, and also immensely underestimates the money that teaching brings in with tuition dollars.\n\nI think separating tuition remission from wages for TA / RA positions might also help the barriers to grad students being considered employees. That leaves tax law surrounding educational benefits as the main thing to target. Right now, tuition remissions are only non-taxable if the primary role is as a student. As an employee, most of the tuition remission becomes a taxable benefit.",

The goal is always this: make the thing you want to happen the path of least resistance for your admin. You do this by making it difficult for admin to continue with whatever norm is that is exploiting your labor (i.e. not giving you health insurance, making you pay fees, paying you poor wages, etc.).\n\n1. There are many militant labor actions that are not striking that are still effective. A strike is the ultimate weapon and final goal of organizing. However, for it to be successful you need high capacity in your unit (>50% participation at least). Ask yourself, is your graduate union strong enough for 50% of the graduate workers at your university to strike? If not, then you need to build that capacity through organizing.\n2. Certain sectors of the unit have different concerns. International graduate workers withholding their labor could have more severe consequences and as organizers we need to be proactive about immunizing these people to potential attacks on them from admin b/c they are more vulnerable.\n3. Building capacity before big actions is crucial. If you hold high capacity actions with low turnout you display weakness and your administration will stop fearing you. You always want admin to have the fear of the unknown in their head with every action you plan. Fear of the unknown is far greater than fear of the known. Build capacity by mobilizing in each department on your campus. The union should be hosting events to foster community and enable this work to take place organically. Our union hosts happy hours with free drinks for members.\n\nOur union has leveraged these things into something we call the Honey Badger Strategy. Simply put, we are not worth the hassle it would take to kill us so give us what we want. In general the asks of grad workers are relatively small financially speaking on the budget scale of your university.  This is a good thing. If you couple this with actions that are incredibly annoying, difficult to predict, and effective you get to live rent free in the heads of your administrators for a long time. Be creative. Our union has had a lot of success doing informational pickets on new student days or Flyering campus tours with information about how little grad workers get paid and how much they contribute to the university. Stage coordinated actions to create congestion in campus traffic. Have rolling sick-out days across departments. The possibilities are endless.",

Our department is considering cutting graduate education entirely to \u2018focus on undergraduate enrollment\u2019 [for the tuition dollars]. I foresee that the graduate program will be eliminated entirely or PhD students will be expected to pay 5 years worth of tuition for previously funded positions in the future, effectively gutting socioeconomic diversity in a field that desperately needs it to perform its public function in meaningful ways. We are making a push for unionization on campus, but organizing during covid has been challenging. Still, we\u2019re giving it all we have. Im not totally convinced that the university wouldn\u2019t rather just slash graduate programs in the face of a collective bargaining mandate. The administrators are morons who see doctoral students primarily as \u2018costing the university money\u2019, which is frankly as absurd as it is ignorant. If the graduate program in my department goes under, faculty, students and administrators will absolutely suffer, and they can\u2019t even begin to realize how much. In my mind, this makes it much more likely that they\u2019ll hold onto the program and kick up the exploitation a few notches for future cohorts. I\u2019m so sick of faculty and administrators devaluing my labor. I\u2019m also sad because, in essence, my profession seems to be in the process of becoming a playground for rich kids and people naive enough to go into massive debt.",

Often, you see a top guy who is 28-30 sign a massive deal for 10-12 years or something, let's say Mookie Betts's 12 year $365 million deal. His contract runs through 2032, when he'll be 40. He will average \\~ $30 million a year. The logic here is that, in the earlier years of this deal, when he's an MVP-caliber guy, he will be worth *more* than his $30 million, while in his later years, as he starts to tail-off, he's getting fairly overpaid. \n\nAs a PhD student (and obviously on a much smaller scale), it seems we get a baseball contract in reverse. When we're not super valuable, we are provided with a lot of training, classes, and a stipend, that amounts to (in some capacity, and perhaps debatably) more than we are worth. In the later years, where we're essentially already independent scientists getting shit done and just trying to graduate, we're producing at rate worth more than we are paid. Ideally this balances out, although obviously if you don't get much in terms of pay to begin with it doesn't. But we do receive an education that would cost a lot of money essentially for free - I go to a private school where the Masters program that mirrors my PhD classes (and they're the same classes!) costs somewhere in the realm of $50k-60k a year. \n\nA lot of these points yield separate discussions, and I still think we *should* get more. And if the argument baked into our value is that we get $60K worth of classes, that's it's own argument as that is far too much to have to pay for education. But we do walk away with a very valuable degree, and the opportunity to have intellectual freedom and/or higher paying jobs. There's certainly holes you can poke in this, and a lot of issues with both academia as well as the path itself, but, provided you're not working below a starvation wage, it does sort of justify itself.",

Entry level biotech in the three major cities for it -Boston, San Francisco (area), and San Diego- all average just under $70K/yr without any advanced degree. Let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that you stay in that role and over the course of six years you get no (real, inflation adjusted) pay increases, that\u2019s $420K against $35K/yr stipend yielding $210K: the difference is your total earnings in the PhD. Because of the explicit assumptions, that\u2019s also a theoretical low bound that\u2019s unrealistic: people do get raises, promotions, and advance to better jobs such that it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that after six years in industry you\u2019d make the rough salary of a new PhD. But that\u2019s harder to estimate, so let\u2019s stick with $210K.\n\nSome portion of that is going to be put towards retirement or otherwise buying assets (like a house), both of which are almost guaranteed to appreciate. Now discounting the quality of life differences, how long will it take you after your PhD to catch up to the industry person in terms of lifetime earnings? How long after that until you will have matched their accrued and compounding investments? These are part of the opportunity cost of a PhD. Failing to make much during those years strips us of our ability to meaningfully save for retirement.\n\nYou\u2019re right in a sense that it\u2019s a \u201ctraining job\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the dismal pay relative to our investment in it. It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re pursuing a masters and only taking classes, it\u2019s entirely different to be working full-time under highly stressful conditions that explicitly require critical thinking and niche knowledge. As I\u2019ve pointed out already, Northern Europe actually pays people reasonably well while they are in graduate school and pursuing a PhD. I\u2019ll be blunt: saying that we shouldn\u2019t be paid well because \u201cit\u2019s just a training job\u201d is gaslighting and propaganda. It\u2019s not like this is a novel idea; have examples of well functioning systems with much better conditions. We should demand that for ourselves. Anything less is explicitly accepting exploitation. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I dropped it because, honestly, I just didn\u2019t like the overbearing culture of \u201celiminate the target\u201d.

I choose my field simply because I was interested in science from a young age and wasn\u2019t really into hands-on work (other kids around me really liked the wood shop for example). I by no means look down on the trades or the military. They are just different ways of living the same life we are all given. \n\nMoving on, market forces are weird.
