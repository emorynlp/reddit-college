  "text": "I\u2019ve known for years that I eventually want to go back to school for my Phd. Covid gave me the push I needed to make try a new-ish career path, moving from teaching to working remotely for an education company. I like parts of this new job but definitely don\u2019t see myself doing it long term.  I always thought I would wait until my kids were older to go back to school, but now I\u2019m trying to decide if I should jump back into teaching next fall or move up my PhD timeline and apply for programs now. I have two kids (6 and 3), and would love to hear from other parents about their experiences. Is it worth waiting or is it one of those things where there is never going to be a \u201cgood\u201d time?",

      "text": "I am a few years into my PhD, and my wife and I have been fostering (finally adopting next month) 3 kids since the first year of my program. One of my cohort is a single mom. It is definitely more difficult for us than it is for our cohort that don\u2019t have kids, but it\u2019s not impossible. \n\nFor me, it means that getting a PhD is my day job, cause outside of daycare hours my number one priority is my family, and they\u2019re very demanding haha. There are lots of times that I would like to be working on research or data analysis in the evening or weekend (not often tbh), but it\u2019s generally just not an option. My progress has been affected by this, especially last year when our kids were out of daycare, but I\u2019m still on track to finish at a reasonable rate. \n\nMy view is skewed by the fact that my wife works full time, so there\u2019s no pressure on me to support a family on a grad student stipend. But I think that if getting a PhD is an important step on the path you want to take through life then there\u2019s no time like the present!",

      "text": "I went back for the Ed.D with a 5 and 7 year old.   It is challenging, but requires a lot of teamwork with my wife.   I feel like I have to schedule everything, including time to spend with my kids.  Your choice should start with what is your support structure like? How will this affect the people that I love and how will I feel when going through the program.  It is totally possible for people with families to do this. That really isn\u2019t the question, but what do you sacrifice foe the years your in the program.   I wish you luck.",
