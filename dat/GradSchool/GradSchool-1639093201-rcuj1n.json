  "text": "So\n\nbasically I am in a MA program that I do not feel passionate about anymore, but I am supposed to take my comprehensive exams next semester and defend my internship work, so I feel like it is too late to drop out. This semester, I have made a B and C, and I am still waiting for one grade, which might be an A, might be a B. I dont feel prepared for my comps and my GPA is going to take a hit, I might be put on academic probation, I honestly dont know if I will receive my degree. \n\nThis fall semester, I had some mysterious illness which made some lymph nodes in my neck swell like i have the bubonic plague, which occupied most of my time, required surgery, my boyfriend broke up with me while recovering from said surgery and I was sleeping in my car for a few days, and my academics suffered. I didnt really notify my professors, because I have had tough situations before and still managed to meet deadlines, and I have, in fact, not met these deadlines. I now learned the importance of communicating with my professors lol. \n\nI do have a job at my local library, which I absolutely love, and I want to switch course and study a MLIS to be a librarian. That being said, after sucking eggs in one MA program, would it even be possible to apply to a MLIS program? I am still going to give my current MA program my best shot, but I am worried that if I fail, it might affect my future career aspirations. Any advice or personal stories is greatly appreciated.",

The level of pain varies quite a bit, but there are many times that the pain will only increase with time after you have the realization that the program isn't working for you. Better to take what you have learned so far and start something that will put you an a better road as soon as possible.",

I just have some mental roadblock because I am supposed to graduate next semester and my brain just wants to convince me that I should finish strong despite how much I hate it. I also have a bit of guilt because my dad gave me his military benefits to get this degree and I definitely feel like I would have squandered those in pursuit of something  that I don't really like at all.",

          "text": "yeah, thats what I am currently fearing. My professors this semester dont like me that much, but at least my advisor likes me and might be more sympathetic. I was looking at another's masters program at the university I went to for undergrad, so maybe that will be a plus considering I have a very good relationship with my undergrad profs. If anything, I will just have to take this in stride and learn from it :/",

It only causes an issue if the new masters have profs that know the profs the old one and they discuss applicants, which is pretty unlikely unless they show them as a reference.",

              "text": "Ok I see, so the internship report counts as a thesis and you're almost done? And also if you only have one semester left, I would suggest you to push through, especially if your advisor is supportive.\n\nStill, if you are really unhappy and you really don't think you can finish, don't worry too much. Many people change masters, we live to learn about ourselves and you seem to learn that you love library science. You can absolutely pursue it, even after finishing this one. They won't judge you for dropping out for another masters, and you can tell them in the interview that you realized you love your job and thats what you want to do.",
