  "title:": "I'm making a 100% FREE website to help undergrad and grad students figure out their pathways in life. It includes sample pathways and tips for academia or industry-specific fields. Would love your feedback + contributions!",
  "text": "I am a PhD student at the University of Sydney in Australia, in my second year. I'm working on Neuromorphic Neural Networks, a cool new type of A.I. \n\nAs a way of helping others, i've been working on a website in my spare (lol) time to help undergrad and grad students find their pathway. \n\nFor example, I just wrote a [blog post](https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/should-i-do-a-phd/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=r/gradschool&utm_content=link) on my experience as a PhD student, and what I wish I knew before starting. \n\n\nThe rest of the website offers example pathways and descriptions of related industry or academic careers in the field. For example, the [Psychology](https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/psychology/) page walks you through the steps required to become a Psychologist in Australia (only here at the moment), and which careers or opportunities might be relevant. This is all mapped out in an easy to follow pathway map.\n There's a whole page dedicated to Academic Research as well (although it's just been put up so any feedback / contributions would be amazing).\n\nThere's no ads on the site, and it's completely free!\n\n\nIf anyone wants to contribute to the site, please let me know and I'll give you full attribution if you do!\n\nThank you all and I hope you enjoy!\n\nEdit: Currently the site is for Australian pathways, but would love people from US and other places to contribute so we can make it worldwide :)",

          "text": "It's a tool to assess someone's aptitudes across different dimensions to gain an understanding for pathway fit. For example,  I took the exam in highschool and found that I had a very high mechanical aptitude. That was enticing to me as I'd always found myself as more of a qualitative person..poor at math but good at English. The military test placed me in several specialized areas it assumed I would be a good fit. Engineering, Nuclear Chemical Biological Defense, Tanks, or pilot. I went with engineering as an enlisted Marine. I loved it and excelled at it.\n\nThe military has the career paths and they want to find people who not only want to pursue that path but also have the aptitude for it. Just having drive alone is not enough, if you pick a path not congruent to your skills, desires, or values you will never achieve satisfaction. \n\nHad I not taken the test I would have randomly choosen a occupation for my enlistment contract and been miserable....like electrician or truck driver. Some may love those tasks others don't. \n\nWe are all born with a set of skills and talents....we need to discover what they are...what level each are at in our own psychological sense...and then polish and strengthen these skills to grow in life. Having a qualitative and quantitative mixed methods was to interpret data is a good start.",

These include feelings of becoming overwhelmed and unqualified (personally, professionally, and academically). \n\nOf course I\u2019m also concerned about my career, because my prior employment has been related to finance, accounting, and business. Though I have experience in an education setting, I am worried I won\u2019t be obtaining relevant work experience before getting my degree. I live overseas as a military spouse, where many of the education related jobs are limited to teaching, or extremely hard to get into admin wise (which is more of what I want to do, but teaching at the collegiate level wouldn\u2019t bother me, either!) I\u2019m currently unemployed, seeking something outside my normal job \u201ctype\u201d, but it\u2019s hard due to the economy, the lack of relevant remote jobs, and being overseas.\n\nAny/all information related to career progression in higher ed or professional development relevant to this degree program would help me in creating a more comprehensive plan!\n\nI did sign up to receive emails from your site, too!",

Starting off a PhD, it would be incredibly rare to not feel this way.\n\n- Secondly, concerns about career are extremely valid, but also something that will clear up over time. You said you already have prior employment, that's a big advantage over many PhD students I know. If you're interested in working in Academia or as part of admin in education roles, your Educational Leadership phd sounds perfect for something like that. The skills you've already developed will help you tremendously in finding work, but the skills you're about to develop are a whole different world. \n\n- You will meet people who can help you grow both personally and career-wise. Go to conferences, student meet ups, speak to professors, make the most of your status as a graduate researcher. As i said in my blog post, the people you meet and have a couple of beers with might be your future employers, or introduce you to someone who will be. \n\nI think you're going into a PhD at the best possible time in history right now. Yes, a lot more people are doing PhDs, but also in the wake of COVID, the world will look towards research and science like never before to solve our very real problems. I think we will be in high demand. And especially education is slowly being seen as more and more imperative and essential in our world, so you couldn't choose a more exciting field.\n\nIf you have more specific questions, feel free to PM me i'd be happy to chat any time!",

In my opinion, tying both a finance pathway and an accounting pathway under a business umbrella would be one way to organize it. (If you designed the business pathway to be an umbrella.)\n\nThe finance section looks very good! I think that having those different subsections built in is extremely helpful. In one small point, I would disagree with the alternative career choice of accounting/audit in the pathway tree. There is some overlap in education, but finance and accounting educational pathways generally don\u2019t lend for very much crossover. I think it would be good to have accounting as a separate section, perhaps with hyperlinks between the two, or as highlighted related fields. \n\nI don\u2019t think I could build out something as in depth as what you have for the finance section in a short time period, but I could build an outline of the different pathways within accounting. Would that be of interest to you? I could put together an accounting pathway that would include CPAs (tax, audit, systems), corporate accounting, accounting academia, etc. over the next week or so, especially if I could borrow the pathway tree template used for the finance section. \n\nIn any case, let me know what you think. I\u2019d love to help out. It\u2019s been a devil of a journey and It would be great to pass on all of the knowledge I\u2019ve had to collect over the past decade.",

      "text": "This is a comment copy that I keep making. It's nowhere in the slightest near a blog post format, but it's meant to address the questions of \"what are the rules of doing well\" or \"what should I know before I start\". Maybe you might find this useful or maybe you might want to modify it to make it more.....legible/succinct?\n\n\n\nI just finished my stem doctorate, and while I think it's worth mentioning what I did do, I strongly feel like I should mention what I sorely regret I didn't do. All of this I either did, or realized much too late that I should have done/been doing. \n\n1. Develop healthy habits before starting and maintain them. Get a good sleep schedule. Eat well and balanced. Work out. Be a hydro homie (seriously these four will go a long way to help you through grad school although they may seem an afterthought.). Keep a journal of it all if it helps you stay on track. Best to have the habits by the time you start. \n\n2. Don't be bashful and put yourself out there. I am assuming you will have some resources in your program and you should make as much use of them as you can. Register your mental/otherwise disabilities with the campus disability org if that's a thing. Talk regularly with your program coordinator(s) one on one. Do the same for ALL of your committee members. Develop relationships with them all such that they will go to bat for you.\n\n3. Find friends and stick with them. Grad school is gonna be tough at times. It's probably easiest to do this with other members of your cohort/program. You will learn from each other but also keep each other in check and reign each other in when stress happens. Find cool, relieving things to do them. For example, I picked up D&D with my group of friends (albeit it was year 4, but a great discovery late is better than never).\n\n4. Do your homework on whose lab/group you join (who your PI/adviser is). Hate to be this person, but it's the truth that some advisers are manipulative assholes and grad students know it. Go into it with an open mind, but ask current grad students honestly and earnestly what their groups/advisers are like. \"What do you like? What don't you like? What do you do for fun?\" Just these three questions can give you hints as to whether a person is a true mentor or a slave driver. Do you want to be regularly working weekends for example? Are you that driven? Ask the current grad students about these things if you are in a position of rotating (I realize you are master's and may be different than PhD).\n\n5. In relationship to #4, set boundaries when you need to. If you don't, some advisers may take advantage of that. I think I always had a knack for being a people-pleaser, and then in two instances, my advisers started taking advantage of that, then I responded with boundaries later than I should have (I see in hind sight). Manipulative advisers don't like that. \n\n6. In relationship to #2, 4, and 5 - never isolate yourself. Never just yourself and your PI. DO NOT. There was a time for months on end, I would go to lab, work all day, go home, veg out and watch TV, go to bed, and then repeat. Pepper this in with meetings with an advisor during times when my research just 'didnt work'. No relief with friends, no outside perspective, no contact with my program managers that make sure the students graduate, no attempt at my well being through working out, having good habits. When it gets tough, you want your safety nets up and ready.\n\n7. Install and get comfortable with an article archiving/citation program. I strongly recommend Mendeley Desktop. When it comes time to write citations and bibliographies, your future self with thank you greatly. Make sure to manually curate old articles with these programs as their scanning doesn't work well on old articles that they themselves are xeroxed.\n\n8. Set away time for yourself each week to do something unrelated to grad school (maybe put this in your journal too). What do you like? Maybe hike, read a horror book, go to an orchard to pick fruit, a museum. Do something to remind yourself you do have a life that isn't school. \n\n9. Make use of campus resources, especially if they are free. Mental health services. Job counseling. Tutoring. You name it. \n\n10. Think about your next step (gradschool or jobs) BEFORE you get to the end. Do the networking and put in the elbo grease you need during grad school so the transition is seamless. Your program will go in a flash and you don't want to be at the end thinking \"well now what?\". \n\n11. Get an indestructible, good backpack. I used to think it was weird how everyone on earth had a North Face backpack, but once I got one, damn I feel like I can go through Hell itself with this backpack. \n\n12. If you can, have the inclination to, keep in touch with family. I realize some of the times I was stressed most, also happened to be the times I ghosted my family. They were also 2100 miles away, but go figure. \n\n13. Keep track of and somewhat steer clear of \"Negative Nancys\" and \"Debbie Downers\" (lol, yes I realize the two memes both have woman names....sorry). In grad school you will always find a certain style of student that can't seem to catch a break, but in addition, they will try to bring down too the others around them. (Also remember just recently how I threw a bunch of points at you about \"evil advisers\"?). Take other peoples' experiences with a grain of salt. Listen to these students and help these students, but don't let them convince you that YOUR sky is falling too. I've known numerous students like this, and more often than not they crash and burn or drop out. Pay attention to whose advice helps and whose doesn't  over the years. \n\n14. Set up your healthcare/bank/etc. services SOON in your new area. You want to bit the ground running, so it's nice to have these resources up and running as you start. \n\n15. Know your program's \"handbook\" like the back of your hand - you know the book that has all the rules and regulations etc. It's only an n = 1, but my program followed theirs to a T. In rare instances, the program and the people who ran it would let certain things go for good reason. Revisit point #2 and realize that you want the people that \"pull the strings\" to know you and go to bat for you. \n\n16. Read a minimum of 2 or 3 articles a week. If you really want to be solid, do an article every day.  Being on top of your fields literature will make you more nimble and will demonstrate to your committee that you're clicking along swimmingly.\n\n17. About #16, read greedily. Don't feel the need that you must always TOTALLY FINISH and comprehend everything about all the articles, (like people do with books or something). Promise, just don't. You'll waste a lot of time, you won't be able to even store that much information, and a lot of it won't even be relevant to you either. Find the article you want, get in, get the info you want, then get out. Did I sometimes miss something Supplemental? Yes. Did it kill me? No. For me this was worth it. Also note, if you always read greedily, then I would recommend doubling the numbers of articles I mentioned in #16.\n\nYou may get the sense from my list that I had a very tough time in school. Maybe half of these things are things I picked up on years in, some not at all. By the end many things started \"clicking\" as to why I had such a tough time. And don't let just my comment convince you that grad school has to be Hell. That all advisers are evil, etc. Your milage will vary. I want to reiterate that it was a bad time for me because I did NOT do what you are doing now, I learned all this on the fly. Feel free to ask any Q's or DM and good luck.",

              "text": "Right. One of the best things is you can reach out to people and ask for \"informational interviews\". Basically find people that are in a sector or job you want (probably also educational background like you) and ask to meet with them, most likely remotely or over the phone, and pick their brain about how they got there. \n\nI made the mistake of waiting until after school to look for a job, but it seems like it's taken me about three months, for example. But during these months I tried my best to re-establish connections with study buddies long past, undergrads whom went straight into industry rather than gradschool. Just connect with them (like email, linked in, etc), remind them you exist, and you are looking for jobs, maybe send them your resume. Of course, single out the ones that are closer to the sector you want. Cool thing is one of these older UG's was the very link I used to get a job. They sometimes get referral bonuses (this is in biotech). \n\nThe truth is, is that a lot of jobs in my field are mainly gotten through personal connections. Many of the available jobs aren't even publicized.nso this type of networking, if you do it enough, can really be your ace in the hole. \n\nAlso, in my field, going straight from gradschool PhD to the job market is supposed to be....difficult. For example, 95% of the posted jobs require (supposedly) a post-doc OR industry experience. If you're a newly minted PhD on the market, do not get discouraged, but also low-key just don't take those req's THAT seriously. I've been told that when a hiring manager sees someone they like (their resume), they may stretch the rules, or even manipulate the position title etc. to fit a hypothetical hire. \n\nI'll come back more if I think on it some more. Also, revisit that point about \"don't be bashful, out yourself out there\". I think your greatest enemy on the job market will be timidity. Cold email people, bit be brief, and try to pick their brain. Establish connections, and then ask for what you want - maybe ask for references. Typically only one of two things will happen - the person will get back to you, and help you (or give you a referral for example) or you simply won't hear back. In my case most people I asked actually tried helping me. You can also seek out ex students from your alma mater, grad or undergrad. Linked in helps for this type of thing.\n\nEdit: oh and btw, a third year (you PhD?) seems like a perfect time to start doing this. If you do this now with half the diligence you would having been on the open job market, people will be jealous by how fast you land a job after you graduate (year 4, 5, or 6, you know).",

I did what you are claiming now, essentially started looking and applying once I defended. It was scary and disheartening at first, but just yesterday I took my first ever salaried job (took almost exactly three months). No post-doc, no pubs (yet), mostly because of a friend's referral, good references (grad PI, UG PI, and one committee member) and good interviews. It is not impossible, and to be quite honest, I got a lot of bad advice even from people in industry, a lot of it conflicting too. On the other hand, I almost got no advice from people in academia because they are for the most part in their own little world. A lot of people on reddit said my best chance was getting a post-doc and moving elsewhere, and one dude in industry all but said I had almost no chance without a post-doc.....I'm glad I didn't take that stuff to heart because it's really just not true. \n\nJust keep yourself accountable, and make sure you put your nose to the grindstone, double time - essentially make finding a job a full-time job. And it will work out. Are you STEM?\n\nEdit: I can't stress enough - make sure you reconnect with all your past UG and MS study buddies/acquaintances that moved into industry whilst you did your PhD. One of those peeps is maybe half the reason I have a job now. Make sure they remember who you are and give them a very good resume. In truth many jobs that are available simply aren't even public, sometimes a job opening won't even exist until someone sees a resume they like.\n\nEdit2: if you (or anyone else) needs ideas on how to keep yourself accountable on the job hunt, how to make itself a job, let me know.",

Have a nice PDF one that you can use when you are getting your resume somehow shortlisted by a referral (like a friend that knows the hiring manager for example). However, and I learned this two months in, have the same resume neatly in a Word format document. As a graduate researcher, at first I thought this was really dumb - why send people word docs (like a resume or figures for example) when they are not meant to be edited. \n\nIt so turns out that when large groups apply to jobs, hiring managers use programs that scan resumes - your recent jobs, your location, your highest education level, etc. When I only had a nice PDF, even though it was visually well done people said, illustrated from scratch, these programs did a piss poor job of gleaning my information. I tested it myself, and one of these programs thought my last job was a \"Group\" position at \"Fellowship\", when in reality I was a \"graduate research associate\" at \"my university\". These programs screw the pooch with PDFs and for that reason a lot of PDF submissions essentially get trashed. \n\nSo if you're applying directly to a website, like say Genentech, or Roche, or even a small biotechs website, use a neat Word document resume.",
