          "text": "I think this process is vastly different among schools and even among departments. For my specific program, there are 3 rites of passage for the PhD program. I'm in the combined MS+PhD program, meaning I took MS required classes and did some research as part of the MS portion. At the end of that, I took a \"preliminary exam\" which is an oral exam for 1-2 hours where I stand in front of a board while the professors of 3 classes I took sit there and ask me any questions about anything in their courses I took with them. That was so nerve wracking. I failed very badly, they didn't even finish the whole time period before deciding I failed. Then I had to retake it and luckily passed. \n\nThen you continue on with your research, maybe take some more classes, maybe TA, etc, and when your advisor deems you ready, you do the \"candidacy exam\" where you present your research to a committee of 5 professors. This was the exam I did yesterday. I had to write up a proposal for my dissertation which includes the past research I've done so far as descriptions of the future work I'll do in the rest of my PhD program. I also made a presentation that outlined my past and future work (along the lines of the proposal) for the candidacy exam. The committee can interrupt and ask you anything about your work during that presentation. Needless to say, I was terrified about failing this exam like I did with the first preliminary exam, but the committee was very polite and gave more suggestions on how to improve the future work rather than trying to poke holes in my ideas or invalidate the work I've done already. This might just be my experience with nice committee members, but my impression is that the preliminary exam is like a \"weeder\" exam to get rid of students who don't know their fundamental knowledge and the candidacy exam is more of a conversation and presentation.\n\nNone of the exam requirements in my program are written tests, but a sister department at my university does require a written exam as well as an oral exam for the preliminary exam.

                  "text": "Great question! I can only speak for my own experience. In my case, it was a combination of factors. One was that I had a different advisor for my first two years who handed me a dissertation idea that I had zero input on and expected me to work on it. I tried to be accommodating and worked on it for over 6 months, but eventually decided to tell him I wanted to do something else. Once I said that, he literally dropped me as a student without telling me. I only knew once he started saying that we have no reason to meet, that he wants his equipment back, etc. It was puzzling even to the other faculty because we had no personal communication issues. I spent about 6 months in limbo, trying to find another advisor and once I did, I had to start from scratch with ideas for dissertation. This happened in my 2nd-3rd year. I believe this accounted for at least 1 year of setback for me.\n\nAnother reason for me was that my current advisor doesn't let his students advance to candidacy until they are 200% prepared. Even though the objective of the exam is to be \"proposing\" future research, my advisor prefers to make this event a \"party\" by waiting until his students have already published work and done 50+% of their PhD before advancing to candidacy. Before me, his last two students didn't advance for until their 5th and 6th years. One of them even published 3 papers already (usually the minimum requirement for an entire PhD!). They defended their dissertations less than a year after they advanced to candidacy.\n\nSometimes there are other reasons, like when students take a leave of absence. The reasons for this vary (maternity leave, family emergency, etc). I had taken a leave of absence for 1 quarter to do a fellowship across the country, so there was at least 4 months of setback there.\n\nTechnically the exam is supposed to be done between the 2nd and 3rd year, but in my experience, the advisor really has the final say about it. Hope that was helpful!",

I guess it does depend on the advisor - in my group, it seems like people have nowhere near that much of their PhD work done prior to qualifying exams. Also is there a difference between \"qualifying exams\", \"candidacy exams\" and \"comprehensive exams\" or are they just what different schools call the same thing?",

I had to do both qualifying/preliminary exams and then my prospectus for my program. \n\nOur prelim exams are the intense part and the prospectus is more ceremonial than anything, where it sounds like OP\u2019s was very intense. My prelims during my 3rd year were two days at 8 hours a piece and my prospectus was just a 20 min PowerPoint and 90 minutes of grilling on my proposal before they asked me to leave. I was informed their whole deliberation period was my committee just chatting and asking each other if they had let me sweat long enough. \n\nI didn\u2019t consider myself a candidate until I finished both but my program considered me a candidate after my prelims.
