Still can\u2019t quite believe it.\n\nI\u2019m just so excited and felt the need to share, because I started off the semester seriously struggling.\n\nI was dealing with really bad anxiety and imposter syndrome all semester and thought that maybe I wasn\u2019t cut out for the program, but I decided I would stick it through unless they failed me out and kicked me out, haha. \n\nTo anybody who is questioning whether or not they deserve to be here, you do. You can do it. \n\nCheers and happy holidays everyone. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit: spelling error ",

I have some of the highest grades in the classes? (Heavy disclaimer: one class had many undergrads, the other many first-year MS students; I'm a PhD student.) \n\n**TL;DR** Congratulations!

I've switched fields now, to systems engineering, but it's still quite male-heavy at the graduate level. :( \n\n> I thought everything I was doing was terrible, but the more I talked to people, the more I realized other people felt just as lost. \n\nSo true haha, I'd feel miserable getting a 50 and then talk to people who got upper 40s and upper 50s and feel competent again!
