  "title:": "Can I get into a grad school with crappy undergrad GPA?",
  "text": "I graduated with BS in psychology in 2016. I had a family emergency during that, time and was on a pre-med track, and I completely failed my classes. My school at the time almost kicked me out until I explained what happened\u2013they scratched a few courses from my transcript and let me retake a few. But, the damage was done. I ended up graduating with a 2.2 gpa. \n\nI didn\u2019t pursue med school as I realized it wasn\u2019t for me. \n\nI started working and realized I really wanted to get my Masters in Public Administration, specially since I live in DC (i.e. massive gov presence). I\u2019ve been putting off grad school because I feel I\u2019ll just get rejected. I don\u2019t know if I should start online and then transfer somewhere once my grades are high enough. I don\u2019t know if to go back to college and get another bachelors. \n\nAny advice? I hate standardized testing, meaning the GRE, but idk if that would be my saving grace plus really good recommendations from my employers.\n\nAdvice? Thoughts?",

It's too much effort and expense compared to to your goals, nor is it really going to advance them.\n\nIf you want to establish a new academic record, look at a 1-year diploma program at a community college or a graduate certificate program that's related to your professional goals. \n\nAfter finishing that, you can explain your UG circumstances in the application and point to your recent success as proof of personal growth and being prepared for the program.",

      "text": "Some programs have GPA minimum requirements to apply, but other's don't. 2.2 would not make the cut afaik, but I am in STEM so might be different and also it varies strongly with the university so you might find one that will accept your GPA.  Look up the requirements for the universities you are interested in and try to apply to those where there's no minimum GPA requirements. You will also increase your chances of being accepted if you don't seek research based funded master programs (taught or hybrid master programs). Usually taking the GRE is required to apply although with covid things have changed. I still recommend taking it and working hard to score high to compensate for your GPA.\n \nIf you are interested in a research master/competitive program or if doing all the things above doesn't work, then do a 1 year certificate degree at a university as someone else suggested. This can increase your gpa above the minimum requirement and your overall competitiveness for good master programs.  Best of luck to you",

But if your undergraduate degree isn't psychology, do you have the prereqs for that program? \n\nOne thing you might want to do is part time, take a couple undergraduate public administration courses at a local institution for a couple of semesters. Show that you can do well in that subject matter. \n\nAnd of course, depending on what coursework is needed to get into an MPA program, you might have to do more than that.",

      "text": "Answer is, \u201cmaybe\u201d.\nBy that, I mean a low gpa is obviously a big barrier but it is not insurmountable in the right situation. You can create the right situation by finding a program without a minimum GPA requirement, do some really great stuff post bachelors, write a killer personal statement, awesome recommendations from some respectable people, figure out how to get a high GRE score (it can be done even by people who hate tests), develop relationships with professors or admissions committee members at the school, take a few cc classes to show you can be successful in an academic setting.\nSo you don\u2019t have to do all of the above, but the more you do, the better.\n\nI graduated with a 2.27 in History in \u201805 (yup, I\u2019m old as dirt) and didn\u2019t have a lot going for me. Super depressed and no direction. Developed an \u201c8-year plan\u201d to get me even with my college peers (and essentially have the life I wanted that matched the right age). Decided enlisting in the Army was the best option - high-risk (the whole Iraq thing was looking really bad at that time) and high-reward (gi bill for school, something respectable for my resume, figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and get some discipline). Worked out Better than I could have hoped: didn\u2019t die or get severely injured, the post-9/11 gi bill was Better than what I enlisted for, figured out I wanted to work in mental health/ public health with veterans. So next step was grad school. Eventually settled on social work, even though I didn\u2019t want to be a therapist any more - just so fried. Spoke with this guy running the army sw program and he basically told me to get another bachelors degree. Fortunately, a mentor told me that that was terrible advice. Applied for several local MSW programs, hoping to get In on probation status. Got accepted conditionally at the worst program, admitted to the other two. Was pretty good at school that time around and graduated with a high-3 gpa. This gave me the room to apply to another masters program later if I wanted.\n\nHow did I get in? Military service, they wanted veterans because we were a unique group. Relevant work experience. Excellent volunteer efforts (big brother big sister and other stuff). Fantastic personal statement. Solid references for quality people. Very high gre score (1450 or so/1600). Showed up to school events so I was more than just a name on a paper. As at comm college courses I took (5, I think).\n\nNot the easiest path, but worth the effort.\n\nSo, last piece of advice, come up with a plan on where you want to be in a few years. Don\u2019t shoot for next year, rather think of 3 or 4 years out. \n\nGood luck. You can do it.\n\n\nDm me if you have questions, want support",
