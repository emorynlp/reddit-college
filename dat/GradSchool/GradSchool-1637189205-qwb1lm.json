He told me it was imposter syndrome and that he also suffered from it, even as a tenured professor.\n\nThe important part isn't ridding yourself of these thoughts.  The important part really is learning to recognize the thoughts for what they are and then not allowing them to stop you on your path.\n\nYou got this.",

Will this feeling ever end?\n\nWhen I started my first postdoc I remember talking to a professor in the department about impostor syndrome, and he straight up told me that 30+ years into his academic career he still didn't think he knew what he was doing. I don't know if that will make you feel better, but at least you shouldn't feel unduly bad or alone in that feeling.",
