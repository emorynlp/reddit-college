  "text": "I make an average salary at my job and am self-funded. I prefer it that way because I avoid being exploited for someone else\u2019s research and the net income is still more than what I could make as an RA. But I have things I want to do in life. I\u2019m sick of not being able to afford basic things like shoes and bras without getting handouts from my father, who would like to retire soon. My husband also wants to go back to school and I don\u2019t know if we can afford tuition for both of us without taking on significant debt. My career is going well but I do want to be able to teach one day. In Canada you can do that with a master\u2019s but in Germany, where I\u2019m also a citizen and would like to live, you need a doctorate. What\u2019s your take on the opportunity cost of a PhD?",

It took me 2 full months to decide that as badly as I want to get the PhD, I\u2019m ready to move on with my life and be paid accordingly. It was by far the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made.",
