  "title:": "Military Service and Seminary Application with 2.86 GPA",
  "text": "Currently I am in the Army as an 11B (Infantry). I came in with a BA in Psychology. I feel called to become a Chaplain. In order to do so, I need to go to seminary. However, while at my university, my GPA was less than stellar during the first half of my time there but improved a lot during the last half. Averaging out to a complete cumulative GPA (between community colleges and University) to a 2.86. I want to know if I\u2019ll be able to get into a place like Biola with that GPA. I\u2019ll have good letters of recommendation from a few Majors because I\u2019ve made friends with them working in the church here. Just trying to get some advice and honest opinions. Also, not sure if colleges will look at it, since I don\u2019t have a SAT or ACT score, my ASVAB is score was in the top 94th percentile. This is such a weird case of scenarios that very few people have information about it so honestly any good information helps. \n\nLTDR: Can military help compensate a lower GPA when applying to Grad School?",

      "text": "Most seminaries/Divinity schools are not particularly difficult to get in. The only limiting factor might be scholarships that are targeted towards those coming in with higher gpas.\n\nThey might want a GRE though many seminaries have dropped that requirement. The SAT/ACT is entirely irrelevant as is the ASVAB.\n\nI think you\u2019re experience will be viewed positively by admissions.\n\nSeminary is more of a professional school than other research based grad programs so they really just want to make sure you can keep up with the program and are less interested in your potential to produce research. And unlike medical or law school, there are typically plenty of openings so it is not as competitive.\n\nYou don\u2019t mention it, but most important is getting endorsed by a recognized denomination. It may not be necessary for an interdenominational seminary but it\u2019s a helpful reference and essential to become a military chaplain.",

      "text": "They won\u2019t care one bit about an ACT or SAT, and will care even less than about your ASVAB score. Most grad schools want you to take the GRE if anything.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what asmissions is like for seminary, but strong letters of recommendation always help.\n\nYou might check out @tcburkejr on Twitter. He\u2019s a former Marine turned pastor, though didn\u2019t attend seminary until after getting out of the military. Maybe he could help answer some questions for you. Seems like a pretty cool dude too.",
