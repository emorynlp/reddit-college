  "text": "I know we all have our days, but I\u2019ve been feeling really overwhelmed recently and the fires raging across our state are just icing on the cake. Sometimes my only reprieve was going out for a walk outside but now that\u2019s impossible because of the dangerous air quality. \n\nAnyway, I just hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe, especially those of you living in areas that have to be evacuated. For anyone feeling the same way, feel free to PM me if you need to vent.",

Not only has the program changed to an online format, but I can't even move on campus because of visa and immigration issues. I'm just stuck here indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nI'm cut off from all the support and resources of my international school. There's power outages because of PG&E (just as there were last year, and the year before). The stress of the fires aside, it's also affecting wifi--I'm currently using my phone's data, but I don't have an unlimited plan. I'm at my parent's house because I was supposed to be moving on campus in three weeks--there's no place for me to study here. I don't know what to do, and I don't know if/how I should communicate these concerns to the program director or anyone else at my school.",
