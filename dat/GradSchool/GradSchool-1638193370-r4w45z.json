  "text": "Hello, the lab I am studying at is pretty loud. I don't study well with lot of noise and also I can't focus when I listen to music. Anyone have any ear muff suggestions to buy?\n\nI am looking at these [ear muffs](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Peltor-Over-Earmuffs-X3A/dp/B00CPCH9KA/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=silent+ear+muffs&qid=1638193158&qsid=134-3689199-8563605&sr=8-14&sres=B07QC5W3C5%2CB00CPCH658%2CB00NKSMPZW%2CB06VWJL9LG%2CB07MNZ7C1M%2CB0723CYHPZ%2CB00CI8VWL8%2CB076ZBJ724%2CB01BGHVPYK%2CB00CPCH9KA%2CB07WRM3QQB%2CB01MR1JV4E%2CB01MXYJ2QP%2CB017RZ45F6%2CB0757V13LT%2CB01DFAK64G%2CB01LZGPNAI%2CB06W56YRWJ%2CB01AAH8CMA%2CB07YSJ4JV4&srpt=EARMUFF#customerReviews) right now, do you guys have any suggestions?",

If you can also try cheap ear plugs from the drug store. \n\nAlternatively if you are trying to drown out chatty coworkers then you can use these [headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-Isolator-Noise-Isolating-Earphones/dp/B00OQG7IC2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Etymotic+Earphones&qid=1638196872&sr=8-3) with some white noise playing through them. I also found that having a techno or low fi track on repeat worked well.",

              "text": "How loud are we talking here? \n\nProfessional passive ear muffs do a good job of lowering the volume of everything, and will effectively block out a lot of background rustling and other noises, but won't completely block someone speaking in your vicinity. Active noise cancellation is definitely more effective, and will block out quiet talking, but it definitely doesn't give you complete silence if someone is talking to you. They'll sound muffled, but you'll still hear something. I've also found that with effective noise cancellation that my own body noises become fairly prominent (e.g., my heart beat). What I find most effective if I want silence is the combo of active noise cancellation headphones + pink noise at a reasonable volume. After a minute or two, my brain adjusts to whooshing and it feels like it's complete silence.",
