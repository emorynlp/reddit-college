Unless you do stellar on your GRE's (like *ace* them), you're going to have a very hard time getting in.\n\nFinance is an extremely competitive program to get into, as is the job market. Your GPA is really not competitive enough to get into almost any finance program.",

              "text": "Wait,...how did you get the 2.0 GPA figure from a 51% average? Are you literally just saying that because 2.0 is half of 4.0 that your GPA would scale that way? Because our grading system doesn't scale like that. A 2.0 requires you to get 70%.\n\nAnything below 60% is considered *failing* in the US. If you had a 50% average in a US school you wouldn't have graduated at all.\n\nBeing honest with you here, I don't think you necessarily have a 2.0 GPA equivalent.  This is a known problem with international GPA standards where the percentiles expected of students performing at a certain level actually varies from country to country. \n\nI would consult somebody more familiar with what a 51% in India translates to ability wise with someone from the US.",

                      "text": "well... not necessarily.\n\nA 70% in the US means a different level of performance than a 70% elsewhere, because the way our exams and schoolwork is structured differently. Getting  a 70% in the US is low average at best, but in the UK, it is a top performer for example.\n\nThis isn't because US students are smarter necessarily, it's because the US structures its exams in such a way that our exams are designed to show that if you really are competent you should be able to do the vast majority of it.  Other countries can operate with different paradigms, where even the top students are \\*supposed\\* to fail a certain number of questions.\n\nIt's a mistake to assume that someone getting a 50% at an Indian school would necessarily be getting a 50% at an American school, because again, the way grading and exams work varies from country to country. You should be consulting people who are well familiar with at how to compare an Indian student performing at your level with a similar performing American student. I can't say that I am specifically familiar with Indian grading, but having been in both US and Italian universities I can say that even between the US and Italy the grading doesn't necessarily easily numerically translate between countries like that.\n\nAgain, a 51% would be considered outright failing here, so that alone should tell you that there are differences in how we evaluate percentages to grades than the way you do, as you have presumably graduated if you want to be pursuing further studies.\n\nJust looking at this website, which seems geared towards indians looking to study in the US, it looks like you might actually be closer to a 3.0 based on what a 51% represents in India. [https://howtogetinto-harvard.com/how-to-calculate-your-gpa-indian-grading-system/](https://howtogetinto-harvard.com/how-to-calculate-your-gpa-indian-grading-system/) But again... I would consult people more knowledgeable about this, such as Indians who have gone to study in the US before.",
