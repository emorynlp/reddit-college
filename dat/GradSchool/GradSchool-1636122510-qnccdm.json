  "text": "I know this depends on the circumstances but I'm just trying to get a general idea on a few things. I was offered a GA position in the middle of the semester starting January 2022 that will \\*almost\\* completely cover my all of my expenses, and I just need to figure out a way to make up the difference.",

      "text": "Yes, usually.\n\nOccasionally if it\u2019s not a \u201ctrue\u201d RA but a position covered by a training grant (eg. you are a trainee and not an employee), some university financial aid offices count it as \u201caid\u201d and it counts against how much aid you can request as loans, but that is rare.\n\nIf they give you any problems (unlikely) your best bet is to increase the amount you are allowed to receive as aid by coming up with some more expenses to increase their standard limit. You\u2019re allowed to add money for a new laptop, for trips home, etc. Many schools have an \u201cadditional expenses\u201d worksheet you can request, or if yours doesn\u2019t then you can find one from another school online. Qualifying for as many categories as you can will increase the amount you\u2019re allowed to borrow by a few thousand.\n\nKeep in mind that the above paragraph is for the **unlikely** scenario that your school counts your RA stipend as aid (this only happens under unusual circumstances involving training grants), so you\u2019ll probably never even need to worry about doing that. But on the off chance that situation arises, you do still have options to work around it.\n\n(As a final note, if there is a training grant involved and no employer withholding, you\u2019ll end up owing a lot of money come tax time. If this applies to you, look into using tax prep software with a category for \u201ctaxable scholarship\u201d, reporting under this category may give you some benefits vs. reporting as employment income.)\n\n**Edit:** I just noticed your username. This advice is for the United States, if you\u2019re somewhere else the situations/rules will differ.",
