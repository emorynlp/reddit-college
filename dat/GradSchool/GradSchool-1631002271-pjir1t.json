  "text": "So I just spoke with a director at PNCA about their MA in critical studies program. I've been out of school for over 4 years, and I've been considering going back. I'm doing legal admin work making a steady wage that's nothing to brag about but consistent. I would love to find a program that's focused on my interests (leftism, black feminism, queer theory, disability studies) but after searching for hours online and looking at staff I'm afraid this isn't out there for me. I'm anxious about job prospects, I'm anxious about general life satisfaction, but courses of study are so fascinating to me and I feel incredibly left out not being able to participate in academia anymore. I'm just not sure that I'll find what I'm liking for in a program and I'm afraid I'm idealizing a graduate program/degree when it's incredibly hard and draining and may leave me even more burnt out than I already am?",

      "text": "I would trust your feelings of hesitation about an MA, both in career prospects and life satisfaction. Grad school *can* be really hard and draining, so you'll want to be pretty confident on what you expect to get out of it. \n\nI definitely feel you on missing the feeling of being in academia, though! I felt that way a lot between my undergrad and MSc. If its classes that interest you, do you know if there are opportunities to audit courses at a school near you? This can be cheaper than a whole degree, and depending on course time and structure may be possible to do alongside your job. If research or mentorship or other elements of grad school are what appeals to you though, then it may be worth considering!",
