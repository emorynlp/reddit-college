  "text": "So I am coming up on my last semester of classes next semester and I have gotten all As so far. I put a lot of time and energy into getting As and put lots of pressure on myself to do so. \n\nThis is a masters program and I have not really given a PhD a proper thought. Does a 4.0 gpa even matter for a phd? Is there any benefit to having a 4.0? Am I depleting my mental health for no reason? Lol",

If you\u2019re already accepted for a PhD in your current program, it matters a lot less\u2026 but it can still be useful for some scholarship and grant applications. \n\nThe overarching answer is that it may not be worth as much mental energy as you put into it, but it\u2019s not meaningless. It could help you out somewhere along the way.\n\nEdit to add: substantive research related accomplishments and general contributions to your field will always matter more than grades, but that doesn\u2019t make grades totally meaningless either.",

So although no PhD program would reject someone for having a 3.5, I would argue that they would make a distinction between a 3.5 and 4.0. I have a 3.5 and I think it takes a *huge* amount of increase in effort to earn higher than that, and I think that is acknowledged. To what specific degree is certainly questionable, and research/experience can certainly make up for a difference. But all things otherwise equal, it is a significant difference in my opinion.",

It means most people cant float by with a 3.0, which matters because the minimum GPA for assistantships here is a 3.5.

What matters is the final class papers, the research seminar paper, and eventually the comprehensive exams. \n\nBut you bet I'm going to play up my 3.94 when I apply for jobs.
