  "text": "So last year I applied to be enrolled in an Accelerated Masters Degree (meaning that I start my Masters in my 4th year of undergrad).\n\nI'm in my 4th year now. Here's a bit of background on what I've done up until this point. \n\n-In the summer before my 4th year, I took a graduate course. I wasn't able to finish my paper on time so they gave me until the end of this semester without any penalties. \n-This semester, I'm supposed to finish my graduate paper while also doing all my 4th year courses and working in the lab 10 hours a week. I haven't really had a chance to work on the paper whatsoever and I have little to no free time.\n\nAnd that's where I am right now. Only recently I started to realize that I'm not super passionate about the topic of my Masters (it's still within my undergraduate field but slightly different from my specialization). Furthermore I don't think in-lab work is what I want to be doing (I was excited to try it since I missed out on in-person labs due to COVID-19).\n\nHowever every once in a while I hear something that makes it hard for me to talk to anyone I know about switching out of the program. For example:\n-I heard that every Accelerated Masters student has successfully completed their program at my school. Being the first \"failure\" really doesn't sound appealing.\n-They already said that my entire degree is fully funded (which I'm grateful for, don't get me wrong), but switching out at this point probably wouldn't look good.\n\nI have no idea what I should do at this point. I'm sick of waking up every day and dreading what I have to do. I want to be able to enjoy my graduate studies experience. \n\nI'm still interested in pursuing a Masters degree (I think) but not in this particular topic. I want to go back to my actual specialization, but I'm not sure if I'm suited for grad school or not. \n\nSorry for such a long post. I just had my first mental breakdown in the lab today so I figured it was time to reach out for help. If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",

You didn't even invest that much into it - you just took one course and did some lab work so far, you didn't pay anything... Dont think oh I will be the first failure etc, that's their problem (or I'd even say not a problem at all). Think what's the best for you.",
