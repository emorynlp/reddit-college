  "text": "I'm currently in my final year first Semester. And I have always wanted to do my master degree(  Course based )since my  Junior year.  Currently I'm preparing for GRE and IELTS which I get to take in November. Moreover most of the the Unis deadline  I chose are in January and February. \nMy  current gpa is 3.4/4.    I hv done One internship and I'm planning to do a second one soon.  No research experience , however I'm working on the part 1 of my Final year  project.\n\nPlease tell me if there chance for be to get admitted because I'm ready to give all the best I can for it. my heart is telling  me to badly go for it (because) it's time but my mind is kinda telling to postpone which I'm not happy about.\n\nWhat do you advise me ? \n\nDo you think I get a  scholarship  or funding with this current profile of mine?",

      "text": "Oh yeah you\u2019ll definitely get into grad schools with that gpa and internship experience, no doubt about that. Keep pushing through senior year, do your best on the GRE/IELTS.\n\nAs far as funding goes, it\u2019s difficult to get funding in a master\u2019s program in the US. Going to a research university may give you an upper hand in getting a GRA (research) position, but you\u2019d have to inquire about that for each school. Same with teaching assistants.\n\nI too had no research experience other than senior project & was accepted into a great school with research everywhere. I had 1 internship for 2 years and resident assistant for 3 years.",
