  "text": "I'm 21F and just started my MA in Communications. I haven't taken a year off between high school or my 4 year undergrad and now grad school (plus i skipped a grade, so that's why im a little young).\n\n\nI did really well in high school and good in my undergrad. Good enough to get into a 5 person total program. But, I think I have undiagnosed ADHD (for many reasons that I won't go into here) and doing my work feels impossible. I have 450 pages of readings a week that I HAVE to hand in notes for to prove I read it. It hasn't even been a week but I've been crying every single day and I don't think I can do this. It's just too fucking much. And that doesn't even start on the assignments and my TAship.\n\n\nIt definitely doesn't help that my 4 classmates are all in the same city, versus I'm 10 hours away. So we had a call last night and they all talked about hanging out and I just cried. I feel so fucking overwhelmed and stupid and alone. I just don't know what to fucking do.",

Out of a cohort of 12 students in my department, 8--that I know of--are regularly taking Adderall.  One girl who wasn't actually had her advisor suggest that she try getting on it so she could get more work done.  She dropped out instead.",

Go through, read what makes sense (introductions typically give the general rundown of every chapter) and crunch to tables for sure at the very least. \n\n2.) I also believe I have undiagnosed ADHD.

      "text": "450 pages is excessive, imo, for a communications program. That's like two academic books (or more) every week. \n\nIn your comments you mentioned that these are books, and I also find academic books to be more challenging to go through than articles because the main points can be quite nebulous and not all academics are good book writers. There are books about, for example, political campaigns that I skip almost whole chapters because they are too focused on trivial details like interpersonal communications between campaign personnel and the minutiae of the campaigns. \n\nFor books, I think the process is still the same: What did they find and how? What does this mean? are questions I ask when I start reading a book and if a paragraph is not actively involved in answering those questions, I skim over it or skip it altogether. The background stuff can be helpful later, but it's not the \"meat\" of the question. Also, before I start reading a book, I will go onto google scholar and look for book reviews and read those first. Often, they give me a sense of what to focus on because these review authors are basically highlighting the important points for me.",

Or is it possible that you don't have to read the entire text for this type of class?\n\nIn some classes, the expectation can be that you understand the *presentation* of the text. The actual content may be beside the point, and you can safely skim for big ideas without absorbing every single detail. \n\nWhat does your workload look like right now?",

      "text": "In undergrad, you squeeze in work on term papers when you can in between lots of super important short-term assignments. In grad school, you squeeze in work on less important short term things like classes and TAing when you can in between working on/planning extremely long-term research projects. It's a *massive* adjustment. Things like undergrad theses and undergrad term papers are meant to prep you for this sort of thing, but the truth is that because of the way the rest of undergrad education is structured (again, short-term assignments, and only a side focus on research and actual science), they really, really don't prepare you. Personally, I felt like I was drowning for my entire first year of grad school, even with a supportive lab and an understanding advisor. You're forced to completely re-wire your brain to un-learn old habits (that used to be beneficial, but now aren't) and learn completely new ones instead. That takes time, and it's very psychologically painful.\n\n>I have 450 pages of readings a week that I HAVE to hand in notes for to prove I read it.\n\nThis is a massive reading load, but no one expects you to actually do all of it, or even most of it. Want to know a secret? Your professor hasn't read that material in years. They're only assigning it to you because they know it has some important information in it, or that it represents some groundbreaking ideas in the history of your field. When they discuss it in class, they might bring up a few important points form the reading that they've collected over the years from when they read it a long time ago, or from previous class discussions that they've had, but mostly they'll be discussing broad ideas like \nthemes.\"\n\nWeekly readings aren't designed to test how intensively you can read a passage; they're presenting you with important ideas from your field so that *you* can benefit from them. With reading like that, you can't attack it head on, or even skim it front to back -- you need to know before hand what specific information/benefit you want to gain from it, and only focus on that as you read it. Take a journal article for example: unless it directly affects your research questions, then only the background, hypotheses, figures, part of the discussion, and conclusion will matter -- that might only be 15% of the paper.\n\n>But, I think I have undiagnosed ADHD (for many reasons that I won't go into here) and doing my work feels impossible. \n\nYour school may offer low-cost adhd assessment and associated talk therapy/treatment, if you're willing to be assessed by psychology PhD students in training. See if you have a psychology or counselling center at the school that can point you towards this, if it exists.",

Well, that must be very disappointing as you were already planning on taking your first real break from school.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed occasionally is normal, but it sounds like your situation is more serious than that. I'm guessing that crying everyday is not typical for you. Grad school is supposed to be hard, but you should not *literally be suffering*.\n\nWhether or not you have ADHD, you know that there is something going on that you need to address. These things can take a long time. It might be worth considering withdrawing so that you can think about this with your full attention.\n\nJust for context, I finished a PhD in my 30's after a few stops and starts. You are so young and it sounds like you are racing through school. Please don't hurt yourself by going too fast without a break.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm assuming too much about your situation. I don't want you to suffer for years if that's what staying in this program is going to mean. If you want to be in school now then go for it. It sounds like you wanted to travel, and school is a second choice. I think it's reasonable to wait until school is your first choice.",

I know how you feel- I remember once in my first semester a group of my friends and I all went out for dinner, someone told a joke and we all laughed and slowly we all began crying together at that table. It's so normal to be overwhelmed right now, especially since you're more isolated. I came to my degree off a BA in something totally different, so I also felt like I was stupid and behind everyone. You do get used the the insane reading amount- or at least you get used to figuring out what's actually important to read. I always listen to audio books or watched TV while I cooked/cleaned/walked around so that I would get some pleasure in without feeling like I was wasting time on \"frivolities.\" As has been said, mental health services are a good idea. I don't know what your covid and living situation is like, but if there's a place you can go to work (library, coffee shop, etc) it helped me to have my work space be outside my apartment. I wish I could offer you more, but all I can really tell you is that you are way less stupid than you feel, I promise.",

I think I'll definitely try and talk to an advisor. The way my 1 yr (3 semester) program is set up is VERY weird so I'm honestly just not sure what I could change :/ \n\nThank you for the first part of your comment. It's really validating that I'm not just stupid for struggling with this.",

I just had a nice talk with my first year cohort the other day, and it was surprising to hear how nervous everyone is (and very much a relief lol). Of course, some people are ahead, but those people seem genuinely happy when the rest of us ask them for help on homework and stuff. The same may be true for your program. \n\nI'm rooting for you!",

I would presume someone in the field would have an easier time, but that's still a lot of reading every day imo. If you are switching fields from something where you've never had to do that much textbook/article reading, or if you have adhd, it's not that shocking it might be a big challenge.",

If it were 450 of journal articles I would fly through it, but dense books that dont have a clear conclusion for chapters kill me.
