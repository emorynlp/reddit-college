  "text": "I did poorly on my midterm (60% where the mean was 85%)... not because I didn't understand the material, but because I made little math errors everywhere. So conceptually, I was totally fine, but obviously my grade doesn't reflect that and it's worth 20% of my overall grade. I'm frustrated because I knew how to do everything on the exam, but was so panicked and flustered under the time constraint. \n\nI feel pretty numb, honestly. Everything in grad school is grade/GPA dependent and I'm worried I just royally fucked myself for good. \n\nThose who have done terribly on exams, what did you do?",

One silver lining is that it sounds like you have a great conceptual grasp on the material, and it is mostly just little errors that sunk your ship. \n\nUse your excellent understanding to facilitate addressing the answers in future exams in an appropriate amount of time, and then use the extra time you have to handle the little mistakes (which I think are much easier to learn from your mistakes compared to big conceptual gaps).",

My program has requirements that students maintain a minimum B gpa to qualify for a TA'ship, but the grading for the classes were heavily curved or entirely at the discretion of the professor. I received some pretty dismal exam grades in some very difficult classes, but have only had to make one appeal for a class to be counted toward my degree because I received less than an B for the class. So, in my experience at least, the real test when it comes to grad classes is resilience/stubbornness/determination/perserverance/etc. Just keeping chugging along and improving.",

Another concern is my grade relative to the class average.",

For instance, I had to take classes that leaned heavily on linear algebra despite never being formally taught the subject, while many of my classmates had advanced experience with math and programming and had little problem with that aspect. If you can, try to talk to your classmates and figure out what they know. Maybe form a study group? They might turn out to be valuable contacts down the road anyway, so might as well.\n\nFor funding, I haven't had to submit transcripts for anything yet. Seems to me they also rely on letters of recommendation and published work (including posters, talks, etc.). That said, I'm not sure about the postdoc process and whether transcripts will be required for that. But still, I think letters of rec and publications will outweigh grades.",
