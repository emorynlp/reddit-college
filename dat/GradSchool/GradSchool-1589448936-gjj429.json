  "text": "\nPlease. If you tell your students to keep their presentations at a certain length, do not praise the ones who go above the set time limit by half an hour and praise their work for its depth. This has happened to me second time now. My professor asks me to cover one of the most controversial and comprehensive subjects in social sciences in 10 minutes and rolls their eyes for it not having elaborated enough in certain aspects while praising the 40-minute-though-supposed-to-be-10-minute presentation of my classmate for covering more on the same subject.\n\nIf there are any professors reading this; please don't do this. Some students put a lot of work into making the damn presentation as concise as possible and literally rehearse a few times so that they do not go over the time limit. Covering more by going waaaay above the limit you yourself set is not something to be encouraged. Nor is it fair.",

I don't mention about their lateness or telling them to stop immediately in front of everyone but try to be subtle when they do demonstrations for example. On the rubric, I always take marks off as I have a clear criteria on professionalism/timeliness.

Yet many professors give broad general descriptions of the work they want their students to do, then deride the students when they haven't produced exactly what they had in mind. \n\nYour story is a classic example of bad management. Manager says one thing, wants another, and the employee who followed instructions gets punished. I don't know what it is, maybe there's just something about the type of personality drawn towards the professor path. Or maybe it's the general lack of structure in most labs, but I see a huge shortcoming in management skills within academia.",

It inconveniences everyone by suddenly making every presentation run late and de-synchronizes the session with the rest of the conference. It's also incredibly disrespectful, because you're basically telling the other presenters that your material is more important than theirs.\n\nI think the worst example of this was at a conference I attended a couple of years ago, where this one guy had a deck of like 200 slides for a session session with 15 minute timeslots, and just kept going through them until the moderator cut him off at 30 minutes (after warning him 2-3 times by holding up his phone's timer and pointing to it). Dude then proceeded to just rapidly scroll through the remaining 150 slides to a slide that said \"Questions\" on it. Even the moderator didn't ask a question. \n\nIt's weird though, I only ever see this happen with super old faculty from outside the US. It's never the first year grad students, they always just get nervous and go through a 20 minute presentation in 15. That said, this is also a problem with session moderators being generally unassertive with their sessions.",

If I\u2019m ever a prof I\u2019ll do what one of my old teachers did: when the timer goes off you can finish your sentence and that\u2019s it.",
