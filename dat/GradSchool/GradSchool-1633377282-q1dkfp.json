  "text": "I'm a year out from finishing my PhD. I'm currently in a technology transfer fellowship position, but I've been trying to find a permanent job now for about 4 months. Sending apps, getting interviews, doing assignments, getting to final rounds, only to be rejected. I feel like maybe I need to cast an even wider net than I have been. \n\nSo, what I am wondering is, those of you with science PhDs, what career path are you on now? I absolutely cannot/will not do a research post doc, and I let my time in graduate school destroy my love of bench science, so I'm avoiding wet lab positions like the plague.",

      "text": "My one friend got a PhD in Plant Bio and went to work for Mars (he specifically studied cacao) as they have facilities which prioritize cacao pathogen research. Another got his in material science and he moved to Georgia to work as a manager to oversee the design of a certain type of battery at a new company. Last one got his in Chemical Engineering and it seems like he is basically just an assistant to senior level researchers at GSK. He writes meeting notes notes, organizes data, writes up SOPs, tries to program things in Matlab for them. \n\nThere are many jobs I never really conceived of until my friends started graduating.",
