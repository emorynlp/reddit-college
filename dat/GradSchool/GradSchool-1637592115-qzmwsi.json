  "title:": "My supervisor asked me to learn new things to include new info in my thesis 10 days before it is due.",
  "text": "Has anyone else experienced this? I'm in the final week or so of my masters by research, working on implementing the feedback my supervisor has provided. Naturally, I'm stressed about finishing up my thesis, but on top of that my supervisor has asked me to learn some new statistics in order to discuss it in my discussion. I really don't have the mental energy to learn this new technique when I should be editing!!! I wish my supervisor had at least told me how to do it instead of expecting me to just figure it out.\n\nIt's also frustrating because some of their suggestions mean that some of my results have changed, so my discussion needs to change too. I'm a bit frustrated to have to make these changes so late when I feel that my supervisor should have told me sooner!\n\nApologies for the rant. I'm just very stressed and frustrated that I have to make major changes to my thesis so late! I just want to finish.",

That's just going to get in the way of getting it done. Just focus and get finished. You're almost there :)",

      "text": "Advisors sometimes say things before thinking of the implications, or work involved. Email them kindly back saying that you appreciate the feedback but likely won't be able to include the new analysis due to the tight timeline. Ask them if this would be an issue. Indicate that you will work on all other comments they had. \n\nIf they press you further, firmly state that you are not willing to move your defense back. If they think this issue will be a barrier to you passing, then schedule a meeting to get them to clarify work what you need to do.",
