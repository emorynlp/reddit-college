I see it hasn't changed much: A lot of grad students seem to come online to rant about how much their lives suck and about how terrible it is in grad school. It almost dissuaded me from pursuing my PhD back then. I'm *so glad* that it didn't.\n\nI'm an organic chemistry PhD student, and I have had the **time of my life** in grad school. My advisor is great, my labmates are great, my research is awesome, and I feel like I have a purpose. I'm really happy with what I've accomplished and discovered during my PhD studies. Grad school has been a really fucking interesting and engaging part of my life.\n\nI'm not going to write a super long, post, because I really have nothing to rant about. I just wanted to let people know that it's not all bad and, more importantly, that **grad school can be fun!**",

I should mention I have yet to talk to someone in real life who doesn't love grad school, whereas I rarely read a post on the internet who isn't absolutely suffering.\n\nThanks for this post!",

      "text": "I am in a hybrid Masters + PhD training centre (CDT) in the UK (1 year masters + 3 year PhD) and the majority of my masters year made me want to quit every single day. The course was overly basic and felt like an enormous waste of everyone\u2019s time. They mostly repeated undergrad material and had labs that only catered to 1/3 of the course material (I also happen to be the least interested in that 1/3). I spent most of the first term depressed, regretting my decision to do a PhD and looking at jobs online that I could quit for. The only thing that kept me going was that I knew my centre gave us a lot of freedom for picking our own projects/supervisors once the masters year was over. \n\nBut honestly, since I started my PhD, I couldn\u2019t have wished for it to go better. My supervisor is supportive, present and kind. They let me grow as a scientist by picking side-projects with collaborators (that have led to a publication and I\u2019m still in my first year) which stretch my capabilities and always have relevance to my main project. \n\nI have enjoyed every second of my first year, and I\u2019m actually excited about the research I do, and I know what the potential impacts are if it goes well. To top all of that, they\u2019re aware I don\u2019t want to go into academia and actively make an effort to help me develop skills which will make it easier for me to get a job in industry/outside of the field. \n\nGrad school can be incredibly tough, and I know my experience isn\u2019t the norm, which saddens me. Academics should treat their students as their colleagues, not as expendable labourers whose emotional, physical and mental wellbeing are disregarded.",

This is a place where people have a shared experience, many of which include some really crummy situations. There is a systemic problem in grad school that amplifies this shared experience. In no other job do you get as much responsibility as we do (speaking of STEM not familiar with humanities) and  get paid as little as we do. Many of us are in situations where our advisers are seeking tenure and are either unaware that they are mistreating us, or completely willing to be total monsters.

Just because you have a good advisor doesn't mean you can dismiss others who are legitimately voicing their dissatisfaction.\n\nI have a great advisor as well but I have seen several close friends in other universities suffering because they had advisors who exploited them and drove them out. I'm happy that you are happy but there is a problem with how poorly grad students are valued. Appreciate what you have but don't look down on someone who has no control over their life and the **only** thing they could do to feel some semblance of control is to make an online post. Have you ever been in that position? Can you empathize?\n\nIf someone was driven away from applying to grad school *just* because they read a bunch of online posts, that person was probably not well suited for grad school anyways.\n\nWhat you don't understand about this sub is that its not just \"GradSchool\" it is a place where people come for some support as well. Because literally no one in their real life tells them \"You can do it!\". But when someone comes here and makes a post about a bad day, there's people who give positive words of encouragement. Even though its anonymous, it gives a huge boost to their morale.\n\nYou haven't actually sat down and thought about all the different reasons why someone might come here (or any online forum for that matter) and make a post about something bad that's going on in their life. Your underlying message \"Grad school can be fun\" is something I agree with 100% but you could've said that without undermining the experiences other less fortunate people have had.",

It's relatively easy to stay anonymous so there's no worries about an unpleasant supervisor or cohort member retaliating, and you can crowd-source ideas on how to resolve things while getting support. \n\nAs others have said, if you're having a great day you're less likely to post about it - though we do get those! - than if you're struggling and in need of supports. I think there's also the fear of bragging, or being seen as rubbing it in or being obnoxious. \n\nI'm having a great grad school experience. My advisor is great, my department is supportive in every possible way and from every possible angle. I've been given amazing opportunities, I get to do what I like, I enjoy my project and I'm having a great time. But I'm not going to make a post about it because I'd feel like a jerk, you know? Imposter syndrome is already such a prevalent thing in academia I feel like if I post about something good that happens to me that I might be kicking someone who's already down, and make them feel not good enough, and I don't want to do that, if that makes sense. \n\nSo I get it, I get why this sub can be depressing (I'll openly admit I don't come here as often as other subs) but I also get why it attracts as many negative posts as it does - whether or not it's an accurate reflection of the grad school experience.",

      "text": "I mean, to be fair, posts like these are becoming common enough that they are getting old as well. This forum is a great resource for people going through things, who have questions about things so specific that only other grad students \\*who have gone through the same crappy situations\\* would be able to help them figure out. It seems that people often post on here because they don't have other people in their community to vent to or ask advice of (whether through lack of understanding of specific situations or shame at asking their geographically-convenient peers hard questions that might make it appear that they don't enjoy what they are doing). I think providing a space for people to talk through things anonymously (and even very dramatically if that's what they need at the time) is invaluable, and especially when isolation is something that grad students often face. As fellow grad students who have gone through some of these things, it is also a great way to feel like, if nothing else, our hiccups and what we have learned from them can potentially help someone else.\n\nI think you'll find that while the threads do often consist of people seeking advice (or ranting sometimes), the comments are predictably filled with people who dedicate a lot of time to offering  advice to help people work through things to try to get their focus back on why they joined grad school--to study what they love. There are also folks that consistently start threads asking about specific successes people have each week. If you don't see those often enough, you can start 'em as frequently as you want. It seems more productive than making a specific post to chastise people who may see this forum as a place where they can find support.",

I think that this is partially a result of my advisor preventing unfriendly people from joining our group. My advisor tries to avoid coming into the lab/office as much as possible, and no one feels like there is a certain work schedule that is expected of us.

I\u2019ve been through two grad STEM programs and my main issue is that most advisors don\u2019t know how to be mentors, they\u2019re just acting like bosses, and not great bosses at that. I\u2019ve also worked with some education advisors, and even the worst Ed prof is a better mentor most days than the best graduate level STEM prof. Last time I had a good mentor in STEM was my undergrad profs at a SLAC, 19 years ago.",

It was also really fascinating taking graduate classes from profs, then TAing undergrad classes with the same profs, for classes I\u2019d taught more times than some of the profs I was TAing for. Some profs were great at grad and sucked at undergrad, and some were the other way around. Usually the more compassionate profs were better at undergrad, and the more elitist profs were better at grad, not surprisingly.",

          "text": "I see my advisor on average 3-4 days a week, the only time I don't is if she's working from home or traveling. She's pretty much always easy to reach if she's not physically in her office. She gives positive feedback when there's something that deserves it and negative feedback when something deserves it. The negative feedback is never discouragement or belittling but always constructive and supportive.\n\nOur lab gets along very well. My boss likes having a small lab, there's four of us right now including her. We could easily hire a couple more but keeping the group small keeps us closer (and also gives more money for experiments lol). Grad students get together outside work for drinks, the lab goes for lunch once or twice a month, we sit around and talk during lunch once or twice a week, and generally all know what's going on in each other's lives outside work. My boss has watched my dog a couple of times while I was out of town.\n\nI realize I'm very fortunate to be in this position but I actively sought out this kind of environment. I did rotations in labs that I realized weren't the best environments and decided to not join despite the PIs being highly respected and regularly publishing in top journals.\n\nI don't know how it is everywhere else but at my school all of the older grad students will warn the first years about which professors to avoid, even if it's their own PI. Students here are all generally really supportive of each other.",
