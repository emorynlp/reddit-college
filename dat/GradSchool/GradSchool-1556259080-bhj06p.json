  "text": "Hey folks. Currently 2:10am. Can\u2019t sleep. My\nPhD defense is at 9:15am-12:30pm. Lecture and examination. \n\nHelllpppp! How do I sleep ???\n\nEDIT: Took a melatonin supplement at 2:15. Manage to get about 4 hours. Time is now 7:20 and starting my morning return. I'll come for another edit if there's good news later!\n\nEDIT 2: I PASSED! Two of the four examiners complimented me on the fact that my dissertation looks like it had been proofread more than once. About 70% of the questions were speculative, asking \"what I would do next\" which is apparently code for \"we think your studies are just fine!\". Around 30% of the questions were clarifying details and testing my knowledge. If I didn't know the answer, I was honest but referred to where I would look to find the answer. Overall it was great. Examiners weren't easy but they were very reasonable. Overall great learning experience. And now I am Dr! It is possible to finish! Now to celebrate with my department and family.",
