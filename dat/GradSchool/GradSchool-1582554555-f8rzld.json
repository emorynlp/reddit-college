Not all of their money is fungible, it\u2019s mostly all earmarked. They can\u2019t easily spend football stadium money on stipends, as annoying as that is.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not heartless, and the whole system\u2019s dysfunctional, but unless you were promised one stipend and then given a lower one you don\u2019t really have a leg to stand on: you went in with this information.",

When calculating their income, does the university include the costs of their tuition as part of their pay, as a 'compensatory package' or whatever? Since they get to go tuition free, is the university \"paying\" their tuition on their behalf? Or is the tuition just never being charged? Just wondering how exactly that is considered.",

This is why RAs in \"poor\" labs also have to TA to get tuition covered.\n\nAt a state school, the school *may* classify out-of-state US citizens/permanent residents as in-state students for the purposes of tuition so that hiring decisions are based on qualifications, not geography.

It likely happens as a transfer of funds between ledgers in the University's account since the \"department's money\" is still the \"university's money.\"\n\nIn departments with steady streams of external grants money, tuition \"waivers\" are often paid by the department out of overhead. This is the same reason science and engineering departments typically pay their TAs quite a bit more than university minimum. So it's not exactly just the university moving imaginary money around; it in fact is a steady stream of money from external granting agencies (often publicly funded federal agencies) into general university income via actual tuition payment. Tuition waivers are often only distributed to have-not departments where there is a need for undergraduate education above and beyond the funding the department actually brings in. Universities distribute those because teaching \"Freshman Comp\" or \"Shakespeare for Nonmajors\" generates way more income for the university than it costs to waive a PhD student's tuition.\n\nWhile we're at it, \"tuition\" for thesis-based grad students is a goddamn scam. I take no classes, teach half-time, and work as a full time lab technician and research scientist, get paid less than minimum wage, and I am assessed \"tuition\" because I am still classified as a \"trainee.\" They'd try to scrape \"tuition\" out of postdocs if they could find a way how to do that.

However, it is something that should be discussed openly and comprehensively when discussing you're benefits package as a graduate assistant.\n\nSome basic math as well for you:\nEngineering TA/RA stipend (for a MS student) at my public research institution: ~$25k plus a tuition waiver for up to 9 credits each semester at ~$1,100 per credit. Total value of ~$45k per year.\n\nWith only a BS and 1.5 years of experience in my field I was making ~$65k. Even if you count the cheaper and better health insurance that only counts for ~$6k. Even with the most generous considerations of what is considered GA \"compensation\" you're still ~20% in the hole.\n\nFurther, consider that I left graduate school and got a job as a junior research engineer (very similar in role to a middle of graduate school PhD student) and am receiving comperable health insurance, slightly worse tuition benefits, $81k on salary plus paid sick days, holidays, and time off.\n\nKnow your worth.

Myself and most by buddies applying had 1-3 choices or we would have to deal with the costs of delaying a year. \n\n* A student in their second year forward faces large lock-in-effects since they cannot easily switch programs.

This is big news considering the university has consistently argued that negotiations with the strikers was not legally permitted. It opens the door for us to negotiate a better cola.\n\nBut there's more: the statewide union is considering filing an unfair labor practice against the university for direct dealing, which means we may end up having the union on our side for a while at least moving forward. To be clear, there is precedent for us negotiating with the university directly and independently of the union, but if the union wants to step into the fray with us, we won't say no.\n\nFor the first time since we started this, it looks like we have the upper hand. Some of our TAs are still very much at risk of not getting TA appointments, but the administration is showing vulnerabilities that we've been waiting to exploit.",

It just means that the university stops paying them for the semester and tries to rescind tuition waivers, which won't succeed because it is patently against the law and California will stand by workers rights here.  \n\nMeanwhile, the univeristy is stuck trying to find some way to fill in thousands of TAships, which are extremely low-paying jobs, at a moment's notice for a two month period of time. UCSC will have to organize a search for literally thousands of temporary employees, who will each require background checks and application packages. Those searches will likely take several weeks just to get through HR, which means that realistically another month of classes will go untaught at the very least. Furthermore, no one is going to relocate to Santa Cruz for two months just to take a few TAships that will pay maaaaaybe a few thousand dollars in total over those two months.\n\nThis is a completely empty threat. At the very most the university ties up tuition waivers in court for a while, which costs a lot for students in the interim but will ultimately lose in court. This doesn't do the university any good. Realistically, that ends up costing departments rather than students, because most departments will have committed to funding students in their offer letters. At the very most, the university saves a few months of TA pay at the expense of committing to undergrads having no labs or discussion sections.",

Sure it may need to be prorated, since the semester is underway, but why are the striking workers entitled to it as compensation when they are refusing to work?",
