You never know what might become relevant to your research or the research of someone you might be talking to one day.\n\nI'm in a research group that covers various disciplines and when it comes to issues like possible guest speakers, selecting from submitted abstracts, and so on, we tend to brainstorm quite broadly. Having some familiarity with people and topics outside your own research area and even discipline can be quite helpful. As is the ability to follow up on dim recollections of \"Wasn't there a guy at \\[conference name\\] who did something similar to this?\"",
