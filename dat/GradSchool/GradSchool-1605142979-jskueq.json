I\u2019m happy I went to grad school even with all its ups and downs bc it\u2019s pushed me more than being a tech ever could. I think you said it nicely, the main reason I couldn\u2019t stay a tech my whole life is bc I wanted the freedom to pursue my own questions the way I wanted to do. That is not really something you can do as tech unless you get paired with a great post doc who treats you like an equal- which I was lucky enough to have experienced. But there are days I wish I could just clock out at 4 and let the post doc figure out why my experiments are failing lol. \n\nI also miss my paycheck as a tech. I\u2019m also in an expensive city so these stipends are a joke for the amount of work we do and the cost of having a decent life outside of grad school.",
