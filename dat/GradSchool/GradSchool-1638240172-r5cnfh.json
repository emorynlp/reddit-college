  "text": "**TL;DR - I'm Mastering out of my PhD program (biomedical sciences). I defend in less than 2 weeks and I have a ton of work to do on my thesis and presentation, but I'm struggling to commit the energy needed to finish. It feels like self-sabotage.**\n\nI'm sorry if this is more of a vent post than anything, but I have been struggling with mental health issues and I feel extremely isolated. I, like many others here, entered my PhD program because it was the natural thing to do after working in a research lab during my undergraduate. I was a successful lab tech after undergraduate, and I felt like I could handle the PhD process. I was wrong. Among other issues, my experience has been characterized by these problems:\n\n1. I was not able to rotate in my lab because the pandemic began literally a week before I was set to rotate. My program then strong-armed me into joining the lab anyways. I was naive and figured they knew best. \n\n2. My PI is nice, but very inexperienced (I am their first student). They also have a *very* clear idea of what my project should be and they do not allow me to provide any input or take ownership of the project. The project is based off of a collaboration and my PI has essentially zero experience in the topic or techniques. I received no training due to that experience and the fact that the pandemic made in-person training challenging. My collaborators are also nice, but busy and do not provide the help that I need to succeed.\n\n3. My PI threw a bunch of projects on my desk that are completely unrelated to my thesis and provided no training or assistance with those either. When one large experiment failed, it shattered my confidence. This is where my mental health really began spiralling. Because there is no experience in the lab related to my project, it can best be described as a \"troubleshooting.\" Things that I'm constantly being told \"should be straightforward\" are not working - further affecting my mental resilience. I began having multiple panic attacks every day and became angrier and more upset than I ever have been. Lab became an extremely negative space for me. \n\n4. I opened up to my PI and my program about these mental health issues which was a *huge* mistake. They immediately threatened to take away my funding and healthcare. I reached out to my union and they assured me this was not possible, but experiencing such a negative response completely ruined my relationship with the program and my PI. I felt so defeated that I told them I either needed to take a leave of absence or Master out. They told me a leave of absence was not possible and that I should Master out. So I said okay. \n\n5. While discussing the details of Mastering out with my committee, they told me that I \"had enough\" and should commit to leaving this quarter. We set a date that felt *incredibly* soon. Like less than 2 months to finish experiments, write an entire thesis, and prepare a thesis presentation. I tried to say I needed another quarter, but my PI shot down that idea and said they didn't want to \"continue supporting me if [I] was just going to leave anyways.\" \n\n6. My experiments are still failling because nothing has changed in lab. My PI is constantly Slacking me about experiments that need to be done even as my thesis deadline approaches rapidly. I burned myself out trying to accomplish these tasks. Everytime I hear the Slack sound, my chest tightens and I want to bury my head in the ground and cry - pathetic, I know, but that's where I'm at. \n\nI've tried to carve out time to work on this thesis/presentation, but I really have not accomplished much. Now, I'm less than 2 weeks away and there's *so* much work that needs to be done. But everytime I sit down to start writing, I find it harder and harder. It's like by writing my thesis, I am directly staring at 2 years of failure and it hurts. I know I'll send my PI a draft and get their normal response of, \"This isn't good and needs to be re-done.\"\n\nI just feel stuck. I need to finish all of this. I *want* to finish all of this. I'm so fucking over academia and the light at the end of the tunnel is so close. But I've been in this tunnel for so long that the light burns my eyes. I'm sorry for the wall of text. The pandemic made it so hard to meet people in my program, my partner and family is supportive but does not understand academia at all, and my labmates are terrified (maybe not the right word) of our PI so they are not sources of support either. So here I am, writing an essay on Reddit instead of my thesis. Ugh.",

I didn\u2019t really understand what that meant until recently, and man can it be debilitating when you\u2019re at a local low.\n\nSounds like you\u2019ve made up your mind, though you were never really given a chance. PhD students are first and foremost trainees, and you\u2019ve received no training. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nYou must have considered switching mentors, right? I have heard of and met miserable 3rd and 4th year students who mustered up the strength to switch PIs and experienced a total 180. Managed to wrap everything up in a reasonable amount of time too.",

          "text": "Thanks for your response.\n\nI anticipated a certain level of \"failure,\" but not like this. Your friend is wise. \n\nI did consider switching mentors, but ultimately decided against it for a couple reasons:\n\n1. The idea of starting over was too overwhelming. If I joined a new lab, it would essentially reset the clock and I'd be looking at 4+ more years of this with no guarantee that my experience would be altogether different. \n\n2. The material conditions are challenging. I live in a *very* expensive city and making below minimum wage has been much harder than I thought it would be. I could stomach these wages if I truly had only 2 years left, but yeah, 6+ years at this income isn't sustainable. \n\n3. I truly have lost any interest in pursuing a career in academia. And while I know a PhD is not just for academia, it definitely *feels* more like an academia apprenticeship than anything else. I've researched what I can do with an MS and those careers sound much more exciting to me than anything I've seen with a PhD requirement. \n\nThank you again! It feels weirdly good to know somebody read my rant.\n\nEDIT: I do also want to say that your friend's story is kind of why I am so anti-academia. Your friend is bright and dedicated. They should not need to be a trainee for 6+ years making atrocious money in order to get a doctorate. It's just exploitation through and through. I hope they can wrap up soon and move on.",

Sometimes I feel like I'm eternally arriving at the start gate over and over after years, throwing mud against the wall to see what sticks.",

      "text": "Wow, I'm sorry - no wonder you're feeling this way. The only potential advise that comes to mind is this: if your advisor will find fault in your writing anyway, take that as your cue to lower the pressure on your first draft. Don't make it polished at all. You could even leave comments saying you'll flesh out or polish sections that are not crucial, and try to do a quick and dirty first round. This idea might get you unstuck when you sit down to write. \nIn combination with that, you could implement the tried and tested technique of \"only writing for 20 mins on the first day\". I know it sounds counterintuitive because you have such a tight deadline, but if you're really intimidated by the task and you're blocked for whole days, the 20 min thing can really get you unstuck, the idea being that 20 mins is not intimidating, it's definitely something you can do, and then you can stop if it's too awful - but it's enough to get some juices flowing and work out a few initial things.",

And, I know it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now, but the way I\u2019ve learned to deal with failure was to readjust what I considered to be a failure. If you learned something you did not know before starting grad school, even if it\u2019s just something about yourself, and you grew as a person or can see yourself learning from the experience in the future, then you haven\u2019t failed. If anything you learned that you are more interested in a future outside of Academia. It may not have been what you wanted to learn, but you did learn something.\n\nHang in there.",
