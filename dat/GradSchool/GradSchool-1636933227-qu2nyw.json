  "text": "I am having trouble balancing the pros and cons of different options with regards to pursuing a CS master's degree, and was curious to know if others have any related experiences or advice on this topic.\n\nA bit about me, I am a few years out of undergrad and did not do a CS major, I did mathematical econ. Near the end of my time in school, I realized I wasn't interested in the common outcomes for my major, so I worked hard at self study and took DS and Algo while I still had the chance lol. I ultimately got a job out of school as an analyst that I was able to use as a stepping stone into an engineering role, and now work as a software engineer at a large financial company. I've continued self studying CS topics and also have put effort into practicing and understanding all technologies I've had the chance to work with so far in my career.\n\nI am interested in pursing a master's mainly to continue learning more about tech, which I've truly enjoyed. It really isn't a financially motivated decision as I know this is not really the most efficient way to go about increasing my salary. The potential to possibly do more interesting/involved work is also a motivation, and while it doesn't matter too much anymore, the credential doesn't hurt.\n\nThe challenge is considering the trade-offs involved if I want to do research while pursuing the degree. All else equal, I want to do research. I think it would be a rewarding experience, might unlock interesting industry positions, and most notably, would keep the door open to do a PHD in the future. I wouldn't want to do this immediately given the fact that one I wouldn't even be ready for it and two I cannot ignore the financial consequences of choosing to do this early on, but after being more financially established, knowledgeable in CS, and with research experience, I think this is a pursuit I may be interested in.\n\nIf I just want to learn, it seems Georgia Tech's online program is the way to go. I can do it for free with the company tuition reimbursement, I can take it at my own pace, and because it is online, I have the flexibility to do it from anywhere, I am not tied down to a physical location which allows me to move around if other career/life opportunities should arise. But if I went this route I should expect to not be able to do a thesis or any form of research.\n\nIf I want to do a thesis, I will have to spend a non-trivial amount of money attending one of the colleges near my employer and forgo the freedom of Georgia Tech's program.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and how did you handle it? Are there other options I can consider?",
