  "title:": "Do you guys have a person (collaborator/PI/supervisor/committee member) whose emails send you into a panic before even reading them, or is it just me?",
  "text": "We've been trying to push a paper through, and I've been collaborating with this retired researcher, who is incredibly meticulous, which is always a good thing, but can sometimes be incredibly draining. Every time I get an email from him, my mind just goes blank and then starts running circles around me in a panic that I didn't do something correctly, that I am no good and that everything is wrong. The funny thing is is that once I sit down and go through the email, I have a clear sense of where he is coming from and whether there are actual mistakes to fix, and every time I talk to this collaborator, I come out of the meeting with an attack plan, and feel good that I have direction. But just seeing his name pop up in my email gives me such highe levels of anxiety that I can't reasonably explain them after the fact.   \n\n\nAnyone else go through something similar?  \n(I was mostly wanting to get the feelings and reason my way through them. Rant over, thanks for reading)\n\nTL;DR: Despite being a positive presence and influence, anxiety is always present when receiving an email from collaborator. Is it just me?",

      "text": "Yep, this can happen, you get used to seeing certain types of emails from someone so just their name triggers a response in you. I've definitely had bosses I hate seeing emails from.\n\nTake a few deep breaths when it happens, and reflect on what you said, that once you read, you understand.\n\nUnderlying this, it seems like you are wanting something. Maybe you're wanting to just be done with the paper. Or maybe you're seeking validation of self-worth in your work, so you see criticism as a threat to that. It sounds more like the latter if I had to guess. What do you think it is?",

Additionally, I think I just want to make sure that I prove that I was deserving of the PhD I defended a few months ago now and the post doc that I am about to start on, specially since this collaborator wrote me a reference letter. I don't want him to think he made a huge mistake.",

You must be talented to be where you are at - the key is to drive your talents from an inspired place and letting the fears subside. Internal validation can help - being kind to yourself, knowing you're worthy even if you make mistakes, and loving yourself.  \n\n\nI wrote an article about my own experience with similar challenges.
