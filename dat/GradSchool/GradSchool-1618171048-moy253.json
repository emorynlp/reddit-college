A nap followed by some water with crushed chia and lemon are great boosters/refreshers during the day.\n\nAdmittedly I do need absolute silence to get in the groove of reading and working, and if that's not available, I need some kind of stimulant to get me in the zone where coffee is my the back up option if I'm out of meds.",

I felt sick and achey. The past couple of days have been better, I fell less tired overall throughout the day than I did when I was having even a small amount of caffeine, and the 3pm slump isnt hitting as hard. I also fall asleep way easier, but Ive only been off it a little under two weeks so we will see if these symptoms persist.",

Unless I'm having it very early in the morning there's a good chance I won't be able to sleep until 2am even with just a 10g/5oz cup. It doesn't really make me more productive either and just makes me anxious. The average cup of coffee from a cafe is 12 oz and probably contains 23g of coffee so buying coffee would probably wreck me.\n\nI only really drink 1-2 cups of coffee a week, and just for the taste rather than to wake up.\n\nI do enjoy tea though.

              "text": "Well, it's hard to give advice because it depends on your personal situation, but in general a lot of it is that sleep hygiene thing. Your body habituates into a routine whether you want it to or not. Every time you take a big hit of caffeine, you know you're choosing to create a future craving for it too, and likewise every time you stay up late at night you're also choosing to have trouble falling asleep the next night. That's why with a practiced napping routine I can sense the urge in the early afternoon and go to my designated spot and zonk out instantly and wake up refreshed after exactly 15 minutes without even using an alarm, but I still have trouble getting a good night's sleep before work on Sunday night if I was up late Saturday. The bad news is it's hard to change your habit in a day, but the good news is the first day is the hardest and every day after that it's easier to maintain. It's basically the same thing as jet lag; we all know it seems impossible to change your habit at first but after a week of forcing yourself into a new routine it becomes effortless.\n\nYou can combine napping with caffeine usage too, if you time it right - obviously you can't fall asleep while the caffeine is working. One trick is the \"coffee nap\", where you rush to naptime immediately after you finish your cuppa joe, so you're waking up from the nap right at the same time the buzz starts to hit.",
