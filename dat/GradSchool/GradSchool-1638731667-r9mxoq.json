  "text": "I\u2019m a humanities MA student who has to read and write quite extensively. I prefer writing by hand but I do not have the patience or time to go back and manually transcribe everything I\u2019ve written to text. I\u2019ve seen various handwriting-to-text tech options (iPad apps, other tablets specifically for this purpose, notebooks that do this) but was wondering if anyone has experience with a specific one they can vouch for. I\u2019m willing to spend a fair amount of money if it\u2019ll actually be functional. I had a Rocket notebook but all it did was scan your written pages and upload them whole, and I\u2019m looking specifically for something that will turn my handwriting into text I can edit and search in. Thanks!",

      "text": "The rocket book now does transcribing. It is fairly decent but if your letters could look like other letters (like in cursive) it can be a bit of an issue. I'm like you. I have the rocketbook and so glad they have the transcribe feature now.\n\nEta: if you go in the app menu to destinations and click on the destination you want. In the destination, there is an ocr transcription button to turn it on.",
