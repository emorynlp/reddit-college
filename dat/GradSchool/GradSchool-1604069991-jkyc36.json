  "title:": "I am absolutely loving grad school, compared to undergrad.",
  "text": "I was told to expect the worst when I committed to grad school. Long nights, no work/life balance, profs that don\u2019t care. But I couldn\u2019t have had a more different experience. \n\nMy profs go out of their way to make online learning easier, they provide such detailed feedback on all assignments, and they make themselves so readily available for questions and concerns.\n\nAlso, I just love my courses. I was worried that my program would end up not being what I expected, but this is exactly what I wanted when I signed up. Everyone in my classes genuinely cares and works really hard in group projects, much unlike undergrad. I feel like I\u2019m finally taking courses that will be applicable to real life. No required bullshit electives for the hell of it. \n\nAs far as my schedule goes, I exercise every morning before work, I work my hours, and then I study the rest of the night. All with time to cook three meals and relax in the evening. I did not expect to have a more convenient schedule than I did in undergrad. And it\u2019s nice to be making decent money for once. My school is very good at giving graduate assistantships, so I was also able to avoid debt. \n\nI\u2019m just happy with where I am and I wanted to share. And hopefully this lets other applicants know not to worry so much. As long as you do the work and take care of yourself, you\u2019ll be fine.  Cheers",

However, there was definitely a difference between my current classmates and former classmates. As an undergrad, I did a history honours program during my last two years and my cohort was super toxic. Almost all of them were really competitive and one guy was particularly bad. He was always dismissive of my ideas in class and wrote some very scathing comments on my undergrad thesis. It sucked because my cohort made me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough for the program. My cohort now is really chill and nobody is trying to compete with each other.",

While I enjoyed the gen ed classes in college, with grad school I was able to take all the courses in the subject I was passionate about, in addition to a course that I thought would count as one of my electives but ended up counting as a core course! \n\nMy classmates were so respectful and chilled out. I come from a lower socioeconomic background and my college was mostly rich kids who didn\u2019t go to class. In grad school I was now surrounded by people who wanted to be there, had their own jobs and were middle class and dedicated students. They had partners, kids, jobs and still chose to take on this debt and time. If you didn\u2019t want to party, you weren\u2019t judged. People listened to your topic and you learned new things. I had a 4.0 GPA in grad school (college was a 3.63 GPA). I received a full scholarship for a travel seminar I did in Ireland. I felt valued and appreciated. And unlike college, since I wasn\u2019t living on campus anymore, no worrying about having to go back to my dad\u2019s for the holidays, no drinking restrictions (I was also 28 when I started grad school, haha), not worrying about a bad RA, etc. Grad school was also cheaper than undergrad ever was.",
