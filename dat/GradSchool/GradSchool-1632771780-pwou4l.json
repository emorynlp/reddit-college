  "text": "What is the statute of limitation on references? I am very concerned one of my references may be expiring as we speak. My old friend and co worker/manager used to offer to write me a reference for AU almost every other year. But I didn't want to go to AU, but now, I actually live right near the school, and I am freaking out because I think it might be too late to ask him to write one. I don't want to just spend my life..not doing what I'm trying to do in life. ",

I just started my program and out of my three references I have:\n\n- Former manager that I haven't worked for in 3 years\n\n- A professor that I had for three quarters in like 2015-2016\n\nIf you have stayed in contact it should be cake, and if you haven't I would try to catch up and let them know what you've been up to and that you were looking to apply.",

              "text": "It is difficult, because at least in STEM it is usually taboo to have a copy of your LOR. At least in my experiences. This means you seem to constantly need to keep touch with old references and/or make new ones (which can be less often as one changes jobs less). Especially if you want to have multiple options for letter writers (what if your current employer won't give a good-quality reference or doesn't want to lose you?)",
