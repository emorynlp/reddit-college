  "title:": "Reviewer asked me to cite unrelated papers which I suspect are his own",
  "text": "A reviewer has asked me to consider and cite several papers. After reading the suggested papers, they seem pretty much unrelated to my manuscript. Imagine you are submitting a paper about a clinical study involving functional MRI, and a reviewer has asked you to reference a few papers on brain surgery. Sure, they are both loosely related by the brain, but otherwise they aren't really comparable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterestingly, the papers he asked me to cite were recently published and have the same set of authors on all of them. I suspect my reviewer is one of these authors. This is definitely a first for me as I've never run into a reviewer asking me to cite (I suspect they are his own) papers before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I am paranoid, but I am worried about retaliation if I escalate the issue further with the editor. For example, what if this reviewer has connections with the editor, or perhaps other journal that I may submit to? Has anyone had a situation like this before? If so, what did you do?",
