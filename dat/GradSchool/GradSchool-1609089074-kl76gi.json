                  "text": "I went to the department of one of the authors of this book, so I had to read it a couple of times and then continue talking about it with people below me who were also made to read it.\n\nI recommend reading it with the caveat that it's a non-reflexive book. It's two tenured professors who got their jobs in an era when they were giving them away like participation badges for completing a PhD telling a bunch of graduate students in 2015 (when it was published) and beyond, \"here's the dance you need to do if you want the *privilege* of doing well and getting an academic job.\" To boot, they're both sociology professors, so the hypocrisy stings a little more when you think of how we're supposed to be institutionally aware and not put all the discursive burden on the student. Does this invalidate what they're saying? No, not necessarily. But it's a book that is extremely non-critical of an institution that's basically impossible to get into. They frame it as a matter of *you* needing to get *your* shit together to belong *here* in academia, rather than pointing out some of the toxic bullshit that circulates within this sector. Much of which they unknowingly reproduce.\n\nThe book has good advice, and again, I'd recommend reading it to a new PhD student (not really for MA students, which is really the new BA) with the understanding that academia is, presently, fucking bullshit and fucks students six ways to Sunday. Additionally, much of their advice is outdated, like being able to get a TT job with 3 peer-review publications. Maybe if it's a targeted hire on the basis of race or gender. But you'll need a hell of a lot more than three if you fall outside of that ambit.",

              "text": "Not the OP but here\u2019s some basics. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the US and not super rich prior to starting your PhD/Masters \n\n-\tGet health insurance. Your school\u2019s offered insurance is probably not good. Assuming you earn less than $30,000/year, you can earn pretty good subsidies through ACA in your state. I\u2019m in NJ paying less than $100 each month for Tier 2 insurance (BCBS/omnia) which is usually ~$350 without subsidy. My school\u2019s insurance is Tier 4 (Cigna) and is $275/month. \n-\tRetirement. Open a Roth IRA! It\u2019s a modified IRA. Standard IRA puts in pretax income and you pay taxes when you withdraw. Roth IRA puts in post-tax income and withdraws without taxes. Presumably, you\u2019re in a super low tax bracket right now, so putting is post-tax money is effectively the same as pre-tax but when you retire, you\u2019ll have an advantage of earning (hopefully) some pension, social security, and/or a 401k payment(s) which will put you in a higher tax bracket. This also has the added benefit of having money in the markets for a few more years overall which is super great! I opened an account tied with my standard bank account that takes $35 twice a month. You can deposit up to $6000/year but I\u2019m not able to afford quite that much! I recommend putting everything into mutual funds and ETFs rather than individual stocks. \n-\tProfessionalism is a tricky one as it varies office to office and field to field. I recommend spending the first few weeks or months being more quiet and observing the office. Obviously, I\u2019m not saying be quiet/do not speak; I\u2019m saying observe the delicacy and nuance of how you supervisor interacts with their supervisor, or other coworkers. Also - never talk shit on someone. It either does nothing (at best) or can nuke a professional connection (at worst) which can come back to hurt you. \n-\tThis piece of advice is my favorite - connect with people on LinkedIn as soon as you meet them! LinkedIn is the opposite of facebook/Instagram where you have to time how fast you follow someone with social norms. Screw that - LinkedIn is all about memory and after 24 hours, the person might not remember you. Build your network and while it seems cheesy, LinkedIn is super powerful if you leverage it! The algorithms work really well if you can take advantage of them! Use it to connect with people across the country who went to your school, do jobs you are considering, whatever - people like to talk about themselves! \n\n\nOk- this wound up being longer than expected but hopefully someone gains something useful here. Good luck out there y\u2019all! I know you\u2019ll all do great things!",

          "text": "Yes, I think this is very, very, very good advice, OP. Especially if you've been pretty deeply involved in your academic work for awhile now, there can be many aspects of your background that you won't recognize as potentially traumatic until later into your 30s when you maybe start to have a tiny bit of breathing room, especially if you start a family. Just getting therapy started would be a very healthy and proactive step to take. I'm certainly not trying to say your background was bad. It's just that sometimes you don't realize how your early coping mechanisms are no longer serving you until they are very very problematic.",

I learned about journals, conferences, expectations, etc. \n\nThe hardest part for me, besides having only one friend who had gone through the PhD process, was that I came from a different disciplinary background.

You are paid a small stipend usually around $30k to $35k depending on the school. Most schools the quality of your PhD education in the hard sciences will be roughly the same regardless of the rankings. So instead focus on the opportunities for technical research, since your PhD will largely depend on that. My last piece of advice is that the academic path is not the most commonly taken, it\u2019s also the least lucrative, and arguably the least technically rewarding in terms of capabilities at your disposal. In my field, I do not think there is not an academic lab in the country that even comes close to what many industry labs, or government labs can do.",
