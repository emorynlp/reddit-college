  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am in the process of finishing my Master's this coming spring, I loved working with my advisor, and we became good coworkers and even friends during my thesis. I am getting ready to apply to Ph.D. programs and it turns out he offered to bring me back for a doctorate with him.\n\nI would get to basically build my own project, I'd get paid...an okay amount, and of course I'd know the working environment.\n\nHowever, I am torn...\n\nI've been wanting to leave the US for a while now, and I think going to grad school would be the easiest way to get an excuse. However, it seems that grad school overseas can be insanely competitive and of course packing up and moving overseas with everything can be stressful, especially with my fiance, pets, and life.\n\nIs it worth going overseas as a grad student? Or do you think it would be better to wait, complete a degree here, then go for a post-doc overseas? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the advice!",

      "text": "Well, from an academic perspective, I\u2019d say certainly it would look good - at least from a European\u2019s perspective. I\u2019ve not done any of my degrees at the same university (BA in Sweden, MSc in the UK and PhD in Norway) and have been explicitly told that this has previously given me an edge in project opportunities. \nFrom a personal perspective, it can be difficult and, while extremely rewarding in my experience, it can result in some tough situations. I think it rather depends on whether you plan to continue in academia - while overseas experience is always valuable, I\u2019m not sure if it provides as big of an edge in non-academic environments.",

              "text": "That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, though. However, to get some diversity - not only for show but also for the personal experience of other universities and their way of teaching - I\u2019d probably opt for a different uni for my PhD if I were you. Now, I don\u2019t know if it makes that much of a difference in the States, but it certainly gives you a bit of an edge in Europe to have experience of various systems and approaches to education.",

      "text": "I moved to Canada for grad school, and it was fine for me to adjust. But that\u2019s just me. \n\nIt\u2019s much much cheaper, so I love it. I had gotten into schools in Scandinavia, and I really wanted to go there. \n\nThe only downside for me was that it was difficult to get a student loan for schools in Europe. There\u2019s a tiny list of schools that you can get a loan for, and those are all big names. Outside of those, it\u2019s basically impossible to get a loan. The list created by the government, and most private banks follow the same list.",

      "text": "It depends where you want to go and in what field you want to do your phd. Care to share more details?\n\nIn my case, I stayed within the same university for my PhD but a different department. I moved abroad for my postdocs and that was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I learned how to live in a different country, I met many people from different backgrounds and cultures. This was and is still is the best experience of my life. I am not planning to get back to my country of origin any time soon, perhaps when I will retire. I regret to have not done that before for my PhD.\n\nIf you want to pursue an academic career, experience abroad is a big plus (if not a requirement) on your CV.\n\nSo, I cannot recommend you enough to do it. In the worst case, you will not like it and you can still go back to your country of origin. Some people adapt well, some do not. This is the way it is. Just give it a try.\n\nAs I said, it would help to have more details. Depending on where you would like to go and what you want to do, some people will be able to give more specific details.",
