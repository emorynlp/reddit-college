  "text": "I just started writing my thesis as a requirement to acquire master's degree in conflict resolution and peacebuilding (political science graduate), I am also from the Middle East.\n\nLooking for someone who has done master's or doing so currently, in similar fields of course.\n\nI don't have someone who has done or is doing masters to chat with, maybe motivate each other or exchange sources, and having a discussion, so that's the purpose behind my post.\n\nBest regards,",
