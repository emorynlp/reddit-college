  "text": "I know reneging is super frowned upon but I have a weird situation that I need advice on...\n\n**I signed a postdoc offer** from a reputable national lab which would require me to move out of state. I was excited for it!\n\n**Then I got diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks later.**\n\nI'm currently a patient at one of the top cancer centers, which is in my current city. My family is also here, and they've been an amazing support network. So **I want to stay in my current city** until the cancer is treated and surveillance is less frequent (doctors estimate 1-2 years).\n\nI told my postdoc manager, and he said **the postdoc is not a work from home position**, but he'll contact higher ups to see if that's a possibility.\n\nSo I started looking for other opportunities and **I got an industry scientist offer in my current city**.\n\nThe industry job pays significantly more than the postdoc and the research is still aligned with my goals.\n\n**Then my postdoc manager came back and said work from home would be fine.**\n\nI don't know how I feel about working from home, however, because I really value face-to-face contact and teamwork.\n\n**I would be the only person at the national lab working from home. I would feel like that \"missing sick guy\" who no one actually gets to know.**\n\nI'm therefore thinking about reneging my signed postdoc offer to go for the industry job...\n\nI know it's frowned upon, but I need more money (I've learned insurance doesn't always cover everything) and I don't feel comfortable being the only person at the national lab who is working from home.\n\n**I want to tell my postdoc manager that long-term I want to be at the national lab (which is definitely true), but right now I want to work in my city with colleagues face-to-face.**\n\nI don't know how this will be handled... **Will I ruin my image at this national lab? Will my reputation be tainted?**\n\nI feel so bad about even thinking about this... But at the same time I know it's the best decision for me.\n\n**TL;DR:** Accepted postdoc position at a national lab, got cancer, they offered to make it work from home, but then I got an industry offer in my current city and I want to take it.",

Tell them how much you really want to work for them *in* their lab. But due to the cancer, you're going to have to apply again at a later point in your life when you're able to physically move there.\n\nAfter all, it sounds like they like you. And the vast majority of people would be understanding in this kind of situation.",

You are grateful for the opportunity and were so excited to join the lab, but right now your cancer treatment takes precedence. My god, if that burns a bridge\u2026 that\u2019s not on you. I know it sucks to think about, but you are clearly professional, courteous, and a great candidate for this research. The lab should wish you well. \n\nCongratulations on two pretty cool job offers! Now go kick cancer\u2019s butt \u2013 I hope your treatment goes well.",

It's a hard one. \n\nCancer prognosis is looking good so far, but I definitely need to stay in my current city for the next 2 years for surveillance.\n\nThe national lab is open to me working from home during that time, but I'm unsure of whether that will affect career development there; my goal is to come on as a staff member afterwards, and this lab is known for hiring postdocs as staff members.\n\nI have some meetings scheduled with other staff members to discuss that concern.\n\nIf working from home will affect my career development there, then I'd rather wait a couple years for when I'm able to come in person.\n\nLong-term, I definitely want to be at the national lab. Always been a dream of mine.",
