The only time I had work over holiday break was while writing my dissertation. My advisor had me write a *very* rough draft of a thesis proposal. I had almost the whole month and a half to only work on that.",

I've gotten a few weeks behind due to my health (both mental and physical) so I've had to use my days off for recovery and self care over actual work on the dissertation.
