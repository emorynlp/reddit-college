  "title:": "How to approach University/Supervisor with a transfer request.",
  "text": " Due to a compelling personal situation (two-body), I am planning to transfer schools. I am waiting for the offer letter from the university and plan to transfer from next semester. My problem is that I have graduate assistantship contracts for Fall and Spring semesters with this university. Can I terminate them early if I show my reason for transfer to the school or will there be problems?\n\nAlso, my Supervisor is a nice person and is very competent. But I am worried that if I tell him early he will pull my funding (which I need right now to pay my rent and etc.) for the rest of the semester. I also envision a scenario where the school will ask me to pay the tuition which my funding had covered. This would obviously be a very unwanted turn of events. Understandably, a few friends have suggested to not reveal my transfer until the end of the semester to either the school or my supervisor. But I am very torn on this because if I don't give prior indications to my supervisor, he won't have enough time to recruit someone else to continue on with the project. But I also don't want to risk my funding for the rest of the semester (or pay the tuition). Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "text": "My take: If he couldn't recruit your replacement immediately, and would rely on your continued work through the end of the semester, it doesn't make sense for him to suddenly pull your funding now. That would just leave him with no work done this semester AND at least one bridge burned, because PhD students are your future colleagues and some of his current colleagues might also think poorly of him for doing that.\n\nSo he would really only do that if he gets very angry and acts totally irrationally. I don't know many people myself that would react like that, but you know him better than me.",

          "text": "Am I just being paranoid about the funding? Surely my professor would understand that it's not because of him or the university that I'm transferring and that it's due to a personal situation, right? I just hope he doesn't resent me.",

              "text": "It's possible you're being paranoid, but I truly don't have enough info to say. No one I know would take it at all personally if a student had your situation -- it is very clearly not the prof's fault! But my field is pretty non-competitive (and non-confrontational) compared to others I know.\n\nLike, even if he took it personally at first, there's a spectrum of anger. Even the unreasonable profs I know would probably just say \"oh ok, sorry to hear that\" and be cold and awkward for the next month or so, not telling you directly that they're upset. They'd get over it later by complaining about the situation over beers with friends for the next couple years. This is the compromise approach if you're a hot-headed person but also trying to play the long game, as profs should.",
