  "title:": "Still Waiting for my Thesis Grade After 6 Months, What Should I do?",
  "text": "So I submitted my MA thesis at the end of March and the receipt I got said it could take \"up to six months\" to return it to me with a grade.\nThe MA thesis regulations say I must receive my grade within the specified time frame, so I guess they've violated those as I am still waiting.\n\nMy supervisor (who is really great btw) got in touch with me a month ago to apologise for the delay and say it has something to do with the postgrad office and isn't to do with my thesis specifically, but he said I should expect the grade \"very soon.\" As I said, this was a month ago.\n\nI feel bad complaining as the delay might have to do with COVID but this grade will sort of decide my future (I am trying to do a PhD) and I am getting really antsy and frustrated by this point. Much longer and I might not be able to graduate this year either.\n\nSo at this point I really don't know what to do or whether I should being do anything and was interested in other people's perspectives on the situation. I've felt trapprd in limbo waiting for this grade, not knowing whether I can pursue academia or whether I should get a more permanent job here. Do let me know if I am overreacting! Six months just seems like such a ridiculous amount of time to wait, but let me know what you think.",

      "text": "I agree with contacting the post-grad office, as the other poster suggested.\n\nBut I would also see if you have a dean of graduate studies in your college. If so, contact them. If not contact the college office. Tell them you're looking into PhD programs, but it's a real problem when you don't know what your grade was. That might get the ball rolling.",
