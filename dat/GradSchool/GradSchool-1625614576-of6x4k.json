  "text": "Went home for the weekend and my family kept commenting on how skinny I am. I repeatedly told them to stop and that they were being extra. I haven't noticed a difference. In any case, I weighed myself and didn't believe the result. Went to my dad's place and weighed myself on a different scale... same result (-10 lbs from 123 lbs to 113 in 2 months!!!). This was definitely a wake-up call.\n\nGrad school isn't worth sacrificing your physical and mental health.. I clearly need to take my own advice.. but idk I just wanted to share\n\nedit: typo ",

I\u2019ll go a whole day without eating and wonder why the heck my brain won\u2019t think and why I\u2019m so irritable\u2026 I have to be very mindful of eating properly in those times\u2013 setting a schedule for meals helps, as does planning out what you\u2019ll eat ahead of time.",

If you\u2019re open to advice, I can tell you that meal prep has saved me numerous times. If you have some down time on a given day of the week, cook up and freeze some meals that you can quickly reheat for yourself. It\u2019ll still be quick in the moment (like, \u201coh shit, I have to finish this paper by tomorrow and I don\u2019t have time to do anything but scarf down food at my desk\u201d) even though it requires some effort ahead of time! It also helps to eliminate indecision and ensures that you\u2019re eating half decent stuff. If you\u2019re into soup, my favorite is batch freezing as much soup as I can stand to eat.\n\n\nEdit: if you were thinking of ramen because of the price, you can make soup for dirt cheap!",
