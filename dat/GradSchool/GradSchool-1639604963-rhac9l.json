  "text": "I made the mistake of updating from mendeley desktop to mendeley reference manager. It's terrible. If you have a choice hold off or at least dont do it in the middle of writing multiple major projects.         Does anyone know how I can roll back or be able to download the desktop version again. I need the full functionality of the desktop version.   Thank you!",

Even before that, I always had to manually input issue and volume numbers and it was terrible at grabbing information from PDFs. \n\nI recently switched to zotero and haven\u2019t looked back.  It\u2019s so easy to use and their chrome extension rocks.",

I confirmed with mendeley customer service about two years back that some functionality was removed in importing volume and issue numbers no matter which route. So there was a level of manual work I had to do. I ended up writing out my own citations for a few publications after that and just recently switched to zotero after picking up mendeley again and realizing it still sucks.",
