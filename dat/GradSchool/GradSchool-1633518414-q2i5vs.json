  "text": "I\u2019m in my final year of undergrad, and will graduate with a BS in Biology in May 2022. I want to go to grad school doing a project involving genetics, evolutionary biology, and bioinformatics. However, I don\u2019t know anymore details beyond that I want to work in those areas. Should I apply for a Master\u2019s in that area so I can do more coursework in that area and then do a PhD? Or is that a waste of time if I\u2019ll take the coursework in a PhD? Funding is a big factor for me in my decision as well. Thank you for any advice!",

And it was encouraged to do all 3 rotations even if you loved your first rotation. Personally, I was originally interested in biomaterials / syn bio. I found out I liked syn bio better but by the second rotation I realized I wanted more computational work so I rotated in a lab that did syn bio with heavy computational part. And now I'm am doing mostly computational work (ML) when I originally thought I would be wet lab. My scenario is fairly common for students at my uni. But I know this varies uni to uni.",

      "text": "If you have research experience during your undergrad and have advisors that can write you great LORs and you can express your research interest on paper really well, then I say apply to PhD programs. \n\nLike someone have commented, there are rotation programs during your first two years (I think) as a PhD candidate where you\u2019re exploring different labs every 3-4 months while taking classes. Phd programs are paid for and they give you a stipend. \nYou can also master out after your 2nd or 3rd year of PhD program if that is that you don\u2019t want to continue with Phd anymore. This is when you get your masters. Of course, that\u2019s all up to you! \n\nOr apply to masters programs. There\u2019s some that are paid for or where you can work as a TA teaching undergraduate courses and get paid that way. \n\nFrom experience, it\u2019s been difficult finding entry level positions for Research assistants. I have my BS in biochem and have 2-3 years of research internships under my belt. This is not to say that this is going to be your path as well\u2026reality just hit me harshly after undergrad with job applications. Since you\u2019re still an undergrad, you can either apply to graduate programs now and if you get in and choose this route, you\u2019ll be increasing your chances of getting employed after you get your graduate degree (in my opinion) or you can delay your grad applications and try to land a job as a research assistant/lab tech where you can get more experience and solidify your interests. \n\nI say apply to grad programs though so you have more options after undergrad!",

It\u2019s crazy, everyday it changes. Yesterday I was set on PhDs and the day before I was like Master\u2019s is the way to go.

Spending a year in a wet lab made me realize that the tasks just ain\u2019t for me! \ud83d\ude2c \n\nI was devastated at first because I thought I had it all figured out. Luckily, I was taking CS courses during my last year of undergrad and sort of developed interest in it, so I decided to explore bioinformatics. Best of both worlds! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe so now, after getting my programming skills up to par, I\u2019m now set to applying to Bioinformatics program. It took a couple of years to get to this mentality and feeling like I\u2019m ready to tackle on graduate school. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m fully ready tbh to go to a masters program, but at the same time I meet all the requirements for it so I\u2019m also thinking this is imposter syndrome getting to me. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude06At this point, I try not to overthink because doing so can for sure impede your plans for yourself. \n\nApply yourself to whatever you want for yourself and take a chance. If you get admitted, then wonderful! More opportunities. \n\nIf you don\u2019t get admitted, then do what you can to get closer to that goal. And apply again until you get there.\n\nBest of luck, my friend!",

Some people may tell you differently, but my opinion is that fit is the single most important factor to consider when selecting a research group. With a good group culture and a supportive mentor, you can learn to love whatever you end up doing, to a point. But if your group isn\u2019t a good fit, I **promise** that you will hate whatever you\u2019re doing by the end of your degree. I know this because I\u2019ve been through it myself.",
