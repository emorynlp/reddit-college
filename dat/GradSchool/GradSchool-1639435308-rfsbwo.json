  "title:": "Should I try to publish my work from this summer?",
  "text": "Hello, 2nd-year computer science PhD here. Over this summer I did some work on an applied problem. I did a majority of the work but I don't like how the paper turned out. My old advisor still wants me to try to publish it though. We were trying to publish a paper by that summer but stalled out when the semester started. Now I am working with a new advisor in an area I am excited about.\n\nLast month my old advisor emailed me asking when we would push and publish the paper. They asked me to tidy up the paper and find journals to submit to. I asked my current professor. They said I didn't have any obligation to finish the old work because I was no longer funded by it. But also that it's courteous to finish things up if possible.\n\nDo you think it would be beneficial to try to publish this work? Will it help in getting my PhD?",
