  "title:": "Master's Degree Options - Data Science or Operations Research?",
  "text": "Hi all--\n\nI have my bachelor's degree, and, in about 1.5 years, I'm considering going back to school to get my masters. I would love to work with data, and feel like I'm not currently qualified for any of the roles I desire without that master's degree.\n\nWhere the dilemma for me is: I don't want to commit 1-2 years and thousands of dollars on the wrong degree. I would love to work in data science, but I'm worried a MS in DS would be too specific, as DS is very \"trendy\" right now. Who knows if the amount of job opportunities will continue to grow 5-10 years down the line. I am considering a MS in Operations Research instead. Many of the programs I looked into had DS specific tracks/courses, and (I believe) the degree would still qualify me to work in data science, but also allow for more variety should the field change or I decide to change roles. I also believe it would be easier to get into a OR master's program over a DS one based on my bachelor's degree.\n\nAny words of advice?",

      "text": "If you are restricted to a geographic area, then  I would just make a list of all the programs that fit your interest and research them specifically. It is tough comparing fields especially since the quality of the programs can be very different. If your goal is just to improve your job prospects then it might be better to go into a good operations research program rather than a bad data science program or vise versa.",
