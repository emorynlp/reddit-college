  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice. I'm on academic probation this term and I need two B+'s to not be removed from the program, however, I received a 76 in one class where I need a 80 for an A. There are a few points on the final exam I believe I could contest and maybe bring my grade up, but I don't want to seem like I'm just grovelling for points. Does anyone have experience with things like this? I am at a loss and really don't know what to do going forward. I don't want to be removed from the program just because of these four points. \n\nThanks so much.",

      "text": "How many points are available in the course and how many points do you think you can contest on the final grade? You\u2019re 4 percentage points away from the threshold you need, so in a 300 point class you\u2019d need 12 extra points from the final (which sounds pretty significant). \n\nI\u2019m now on the other side as a professor\u2026 I\u2019ve had students fight for 2 points on a final, I\u2019ll give it to them, and then they realize they still need like 30 points to pass because those 2 points represent only a fraction of a percentage point in their final grade. \n\nIf you\u2019re truly close after accounting for the entire course grade, then ask. But if the final exam points still leave you 3 percentage points away from passing, then there\u2019s no point. \n\nAnd to be clear, there\u2019s no magic way to not come off as groveling for points. That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and there\u2019s no way around that. You\u2019re just in a situation where you may need to do that anyway *if* there\u2019s a reasonable reason to add points. If you just want 4% added to your grade for no particular reason then that\u2019s unlikely to happen.",

The first problem I truly do believe was graded a bit harshly, and I think I could successfully argue that I deserve more than what's there. I appreciate your perspective, thanks",

Try to identify specific questions that you think you could receive points back on and why, and maybe try to identify like 6 points worth so if they deny some there may still be 4 points elsewhere. And do be ready to explain the probation thing, but also understand that it\u2019s not their class that would be kicking you out (it\u2019s your past performance). The second you make it about \u201cI\u2019m going to get kicked out because of your class!\u201d you put them in a defensive position and annoy them. Be honest, be accountable for your own actions, and ask for grace. Be ready to ask for extra work to gain back those 4 points.\n\nAnd finally, understand if they say no. It sucks, but it\u2019s ultimately their discretion and you are asking for an unfair advantage.",

In my case it was 3 points out of a 500 points class. So she had me write a 4 page paper on a topic of my choice and I got a point per page if she considered it good quality. Not saying that will work but you can suggest it as an idea if they feel it is unfair to give you points when they don't give the rest of the class points. After you've explained the situation this may help you get some leniency.",

Whether the class is out of 100, 300, or 10,000 points, it's the same. I've never considered 4% anywhere close to the range I'd consider adjusting someone's grade. If it's 1% maybe I'll think about it.\n\nShit, this class is already handing out an A down to 80%. 76% is a C in any other class.",
