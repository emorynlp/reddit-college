  "text": "Just ranting...I have three classes and got volun-told to be a TA for a class that includes a lab section, and the professor put **two** three hour section in a day from noon to 7 PM, and everytime I TA, I just stand there and do nothing because my professor helps (a) student(s) without me intervening, so it feels like a total waste o time.\n\nEDIT: you guys are reading into this whole thing way too much. There is nothing to help if the students are doing just fine without my help. I believe letting the students figure out on their own wihtin 10 minutes. \n\nEdit2: wow, some of you guys are fucking moral high horse dickweeds. half of this sub's posts are complaints about piss poor stipends, bad research progress, mental struggle and all I did was to make some small complaint, and yall tell me to \"grow up\"? Eat my ass.",

      "text": "It sounds like a waste of time, worse is that it sounds like there aren't many options out, is that right? Is there a way to make the time valuable? \n\nIs there a way to express to the professor that it's a waste for you? Perhaps frame it as \"I'm not sure what to do, can you help me find something useful to do in the lab?\"\n\nIf you've explored these options, and it really is just a waste of time and you really can only stand there, there is one more thing I recommend...\n\n...one thing I do when I have these downtimes is just try to build more positive emotions in myself. It sounds kinda funny, but it's better than standing there being annoying. I generate a sense of caring for the people in the room, for example. Sometimes we are just in that place and time and don't have much choice.\n\nBest of luck to you! I'm sorry to hear the comments have been unsupportive for you.",

Indeed at the begging he\u2019d be around most of the sessions helping students out as I just watched, confused, but as the semester went by I was more and more confident to step up myself. He doesn\u2019t hang around much the labs anymore, just pops by for a quick update.\n\nIt\u2019s all about that \u201cstepping up\u201d to it and I assume his early involvement was both an encouragement and a statement by example.",

The professor more than likely is noting how you handle this assignment. I suggest stepping in the next time a student needs help and telling the professor:\n\nOP mentioned that they were *voluntold* to do this TA assignment, taking initiative is only going to encourage the professor. Unless the prof for this lab is involved in your committee, do the bare minimum for TAing and spend your precious attention and mental capital on your own classes / your own research. Your next job and career are not going to depend on academic teaching",
