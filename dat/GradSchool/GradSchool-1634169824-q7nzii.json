  "title:": "Transition from engineering to applied math and engineering sciences?",
  "text": "I studied mechanical and biomedical engineering as an undergrad and am interested in entering an applied math/engineering science PhD program, particularly to solve biological/biomedical problems. However, the extent of my math is multivariate, diff eq, numerical methods (programming class where we solved a bunch of odes and pdes using Matlab), and a few stats courses. Should I get a masters first before applying to PhD programs or do I have a shot at applying to PhD programs?",

      "text": "I also did my undergrad in biomedical engineering and went on to get a masters in math, but I had taken a year-long real analysis sequence and some other math electives. It's going to be really tough to get admitted to a program without experience in writing rigorous proofs and theorems relevant to those applied problems. I'd suggest studying for the math subject GRE to demonstrate your competence, but honestly that's boring as hell. Maybe reach out to the math dept at your undergrad institution to see if they have guidance on this and they might be more willing to work with you since you've got some credibility there to leverage. There are some programs I've seen that only require the courses you've mentioned (Cincinnati comes to mind), but on the other hand those programs aren't very selective.",
