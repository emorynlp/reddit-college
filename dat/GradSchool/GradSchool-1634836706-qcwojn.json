  "text": "So this might end up being a philosophical one.\n\nWhenever I complain about not wanting to work on a given day, my family often tells me to \"take a day off\". While it's true that I can choose how much I work (or if I work at all) on any given day (teaching excluded), the truth is that *it doesn't change anything*.\n\nEven though I don't know the actual amount and have no good way to measure it, the reality is that there is a *precise,* finite amount of work that I have to do in order to graduate.  I also have a specific amount of time to do it. *Taking a day off doesn't change the total amount of work that I have to do.* The work also can't be measured by the amount of days (or hours) worked.\n\nBecause the only person who can do the work is me, a \"day off\" is not really a day off, but it's always a *tradeoff*. Not working on a given day will always mean working more (or at least more efficiently) on a future day. Contrarily to many jobs, I also can't trade time (or work) for money and simply be paid less to work less. Graduation is a binary goal, I can't have a greater or smaller amount of my degree if I do more or less work.\n\nSo that's about it. Grad school is a specific (but unknown) amount of work to be done in a specific amount of time, and under normal circumstances there's nothing that can be traded to change these quantities. Thus, *taking a day off* doesn't simply mean \"not getting paid for a day\", but rather *reorganizing a schedule*. While I'm not much worried about being able to finish the work in time by taking an occasional unplanned day \"off\", I feel that's an important distinction that can be hard to understand for people in other types of jobs.",

      "text": "You are right and I think about this sometimes, but you might be underestimating how similar this is for other jobs. If a person has a job that does not have a clear substitute, taking time off may just mean \"waiting to do that work until later\". For example, my departments business manager took a vacation, and when she returned she simply had her normal amount of work, plus the 2 weeks of emails and things that she missed while being gone.\n\nIt does suck to have this trade off, and it makes it harder to take a day off. Still, you're living your life and you should try to do things to keep yourself healthy and make life enjoyable. Constantly working probably does neither of those things.",

          "text": "Maybe that's different for management roles, but as I said below (or above?) most people around me are either public servants, work retail-style jobs, or have other occupations where extra time off usually results in less total work performed (and sometimes less money).\n\nI think it's the combination of having a fixed amount of work in a fixed amount of time (i.e., \"I have to do enough work to graduate in 4  years\"  vs \"I'll do whatever amount of work is required of me during the time I work here \\[whether that's measured in hours or otherwise\\]\")  along with not having the \"money\" variable to play with that can make it challenging.\n\nOf course, I do quite enjoy the freedom that, when planned right, I can take pretty much any given day \"off\" without asking or notifying anyone. Interestingly, this extra freedom sometimes adds to the stress of needing to stay somewhat accountable about the amount of work done, which is often hard to measure and has been extra challenging in the pandemic.",

But then again I suck at saying no to more projects if it benefits me career wise; it's a tough balance between progressing your career/opening opportunities v burning out and/or driving yourself to lunacy.\n\n*Adding that by taking time off to recharge, you can be more efficient when you come back, making the same amount of 'work' taking less effort/time.",

          "text": ">Sure, it doesn't change the amount of work you have to do, but that's true of most white-collar jobs as well.\n\nI guess that depends on the job. Maybe I should specify that I live in an area where the biggest employer is the government. Most people around me with white-collar jobs are processing streams of \"files\" with neither an end or hard deadlines, just a set number of hours for a set number of days for a set number of years. In that sense, extra days off (e.g., sick days or leave without pay) end up reducing the total amount of work (sometimes at the expense of making less money).\n\n> I think you're not seeing that there is value in reorganizing a   \nschedule. The point of a day off isn't to need to do less work, it's to   \ngive yourself a break (which may even result in you being more   \nproductive when you come back).\n\nOh, I see it. In fact, I wouldn't have it any other way because it gives me the freedom of doing whatever I want with most of my schedule without having to ask or notify anyone most of the time. I was mainly reflecting on the fact that the tradeoff for taking a day off is different in grad school than in many other jobs",

It also means you will be well-rested the next day, able to more efficiently and quickly carry out the tasks you need to do. Overworking yourself past your limits isn't smart if you're constantly dealing with challenging problems. And about the comparison to other jobs, others have mentioned already that grad school isn't unique in this way. Yes, there are jobs where you have it easier, but maybe you won't be as fulfilled by your work.",
