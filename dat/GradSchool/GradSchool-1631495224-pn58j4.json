  "text": "TLDR: would it look bad on a CV if I transferred institutions to finish my PhD?\n\nI am a queer woman STEM PhD candidate at a school in the south, so not great on the mental health. There is so much wrong with this department that it has been sucking all of my emotional labor and not giving me the respect that I ask for or deserve. I am about 1.5 years away from graduating, but I honestly don\u2019t know how much more I can take. I want to stay in academia and become a professor in the future, but I\u2019m worried. Would it look bad to transfer to another university at this point? My thesis research is also 100% remote and so it would be easily transferable. Any advice would help!!",

      "text": "Whether it would be worth it is up to you, but if you decided to transfer, I would make extra, extra, sure that all of your credits are able to be transferred. Since, I'm assuming, it would be a lateral move (same degree program, different school) it may not be an issue, but this is not something you'd want to be surprised by. Sometimes departments are really picky about courses, and even if the courses offer equivalent content, a transfer credit could be refused because it was not taught *there*.\n\nGiven that you are a PhD candidate, I would maybe try to think about finding as much support as you can and minimizing the contact you have with the toxicity in the department given that you are so close to graduating. I personally don't know anyone, or know of anyone, who transferred as a candidate, but that's not to say it's impossible or doesn't happen. I've just never heard of it.",

      "text": "I was in an MA/PhD program, hated it there, and left after the MA to a different PhD program. I've known people to transfer from one MA/PhD program to another during the MA portion. I don't know of people doing it during the PhD portion but it's possible I suppose. All the people in thinking about have jobs, some in academia, others not (by choice).\n\nIf you're already a PhD candidate, it may be also be worth weighing which will be better for you: dumping a bunch of money to apply places that you might get into, that might set you back further (since programs have different course requirements), and that might make you move; getting all non-essential stuff off your plate so you can buckle down and GTFO of there; or not finishing the PhD. I don't know that anyone here will be able to answer which of those options will be the best for you, unfortunately. As far as switching schools, I'm not sure anyone will seriously care as long as whatever is important in your field (usually publication record) is strong and the school is not a trash fire.\n\nBest of luck regardless! This shit can be soulsucking in the best of times. Having to do a bunch of emotional labor for others on top of all of that sucks.",
