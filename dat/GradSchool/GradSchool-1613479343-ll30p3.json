  "text": "Maybe it\u2019s about your undergrad or your masters student. Maybe it\u2019s about your PI. Maybe it\u2019s about you! But we all have stories about knucklehead moves in the lab from people who go on to become doctors. My story is about Jerry.\n\nJerry wanted to make 10X PBS. I pointed him, for the third time, towards our binder of lab recipes. I reminded him that we were low on NaCl, of all things, because he hadn\u2019t ordered it after dropping the container weeks ago. I suggested making half of the recipe. Half a liter, instead of a liter.\n\n*Half a liter?*\n\nHe always repeated my instructions in question form.\n\nI nodded. He didn\u2019t move. I gave him time to think.\n\n*What size beaker should I use?* \n\nHe wasn\u2019t the most independent student.\n\n*One that fits half a liter, at least.*\n\nHe nodded and mulled things over in front of the glassware cabinet, eventually settling on a 2L beaker. \n\nI watched to make sure he used the right tap before turning back to my dissection.\n\n*What do I add next?*\n\nI kept my eyes on the microscope. \n\n*It\u2019s in the recipe book.*\n\nI heard him flipping through the pages and then I heard him mutter. \n\n*80 grams.*\n\nI looked up. \n\n*Jerry.* \n\nHe looked at me.\n\n*Half a liter, instead of a liter.*\n\nHe looked at the beaker.\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nHe looked at the beaker.\n\n*But I already put the water in.*\n\nI turned back to my dissection.\n\n*It\u2019s just water, Jerry.*\n\nHe didn\u2019t move. \n\n*It\u2019s just water, Jerry. Pour half of it out, pour it all out and start over, whatever you want.*\n\nHe didn\u2019t move. I waited for him to repeat my instructions in question form.\n\n*Pour it out?*\n\nI looked up from my dissection and nodded. \n\nHE POURED IT OUT RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR, GUYS.\n\nTo give credit where credit isn\u2019t really due, he did realize something was wrong the moment the first drop hit the ground. He looked at me and made the face that I can only assume inspired the \ud83d\ude2c emoji.\n\n*I... I guess I should do that in the sink?*\n\nJerry is a doctor now.",

Every time I get frustrated with my undergrads for doing dumb things, I remind myself of my first experience shadowing at a veterinary hospital.\n\nVery nice vet came over, handed me vaccine vials, and said, here, you can get some practice drawing these up.\n\nI asked the vet how much of the vaccine to draw up.\n\nHe said, all of it.\n\nAnd I could literally feel my brain splutter. Those words had no meaning to me in that moment.\n\nBut...How much do I draw up?\n\nVet patiently says ...All of it.\n\nI swear this exchange happened twice more before he just took the vials from me, said \"We'll try again another time\", and never asked me to do anything again for the duration of my time there. \n\nI was very successful as a veterinary assistant a few years later, I swear.",

      "text": "I work in a microfabrication research lab and my Jerry is a junior PhD student. Let\u2019s call her Irene. \n\nI was helping Irene with a simple aluminum deposition onto a silicon wafer to make back contacts for her device. After the deposition is done, I check her wafer and everything is a-ok. I leave her to finish the rest of her device and measure it, and go on my way.\n\nA few days later, the postdoc in charge of Irene\u2019s project messages me. \u201cAre you sure Irene\u2019s wafer had metal on it?\u201d I said I was sure. Apparently, all the metal had disappeared off of Irene\u2019s wafer overnight. And oh yeah, Irene only thought to mention this fact to the postdoc after she had already finished fabricating and measuring the device (which had no back contacts and was basically missing a major component to make it functional).\n\nWe grilled Irene: \u201care you sure you cleaned the wafer properly? Did you store it properly?\u201d Etc. Irene is adamant she did everything correctly, and the metal just fell off and disappeared overnight.\n\nI mention this issue to a senior research associate in my lab. Research associate tells me, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Either the deposition never happened, or she has the wrong wafer.\u201d \n\nI tell Irene to check her samples again. It turns out, Irene had 2 silicon wafers stored in similar-looking sample holders, one that she deposited the metal on, and one that she didn\u2019t. Guess which one she grabbed by accident and ended up using for her (non-functional) device? Without a word, Irene repeated the entire fabrication process onto the correct sample. \n\nI would say that the Mystery of the Disappearing Aluminum easily ranks in the top 5 stupidest mysteries I have ever had to solve in my life.",

      "text": "Had a summer student join the lab next to mine. He lied on his CV and said he knew how to do stuff that he didn\u2019t know how to do, so the PI, who had clinical duties, relied on us to teach him.\n\nFirst off, the first thing that annoyed everyone was that he was a follower of the pickup artist/redpill crew that rely on \u201cnegging\u201d women in order to gain their attention (this was like 10 years ago). So that was happening. \n\nHe was doing his first ever western blot, and whoever showed him how to use the developer thought it was okay to leave him in there alone. He comes back with an empty film.\n\n \u201cIt didn\u2019t work\u201d.  He says as he returns to our area.\n\nWe start inspecting the blot, and it was completely blank. \n\n\u201cAlright, I guess we need to do a longer exposure. Pull your blots out and we\u2019ll redo the detection reagent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe machine took them\u201d he states.\n\n...\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean the machine took them?!\u201d\n\nHe then opens the cassette, showing us that he indeed no longer had the blots or even the white insert that sits in the cassette as well.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen 2 techs and a grad student sprint so fast to the dark room. We enter, to find the machine beeping and alarming and the blots are nowhere to be found.\n\nWe ended up needing to call someone to repair the machine, as he had apparently fed not only the blots, the cardboard, but also NINE films that never came out the other end. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. After proving utter incompetence in the lab, this guy is relegated to outlining a review for the PI. Halfway through the summer, he decides he\u2019s done doing that and decides that he\u2019s just going to spend the summer going clubbing and studying for his MCAT. So he would come in at 11 every morning, hungover, and study from noon until 3, and then leave. His PI stopped interacting with him once it became clear he was no longer doing any relevant work.\n\nOn his last week, he marches into the PI\u2019s office with an outline not of the review, but of a letter of recommendation that he would like her to write. She said to him that on no uncertain terms would she be writing a letter of recommendation for him. Not only did he lie on his resume, but he did absolutely zero lab work during the months of July and August. He stormed out muttering something about \u201ca waste of a summer with no letter\u201d and the PI thought that was the last she would hear of him.\n\nNope.\n\nThe following week she received an email, basically saying now that she\u2019s had time to \u201ccool off\u201d would she consider doing the right thing and wrote the letter. The PI reaffirmed her firm position, and he proceeded to threaten her with violence. He knew where she lived, as she had had a lab dinner at the start of the summer, and she also lived alone. So she was rightfully terrified and reported him to the police. He was banned from campus for life.\n\nHe\u2019s also a doctor now is my understanding",

He thought we didn\u2019t know, but he seemed to forget that we were all once in college too. He was extremely intelligent, but coming in high was pretty unacceptable. He would often sneak in and start working with his headphones in so no one would to talk to him, so there were times when he\u2019d go 45 minutes before we realized he was high as hell.\n\nHe would do repetitive tasks like grind up tissue for us. One day, he was grinding mouse aortas with a mechanical homogenizer, it looked kind of like a tiny immersion blender. Well, after he was done and handed off the \u201cground\u201d tissue, I took a look at the homogenizer to realize there were like 3 or 4 WHOLE aortas tangled up in the teeth. \n\nI point this out to him. It was the first time I talked to him all day, and I realize he\u2019s high as hell on a Friday afternoon. \n\nSooo.... I sent him on a wild goose chase. I told him we needed a special piece of equipment called a \u201ctissue magnet\u201d to get all the aorta out of the teeth. I sent him to the tech in the next lab over, then to the grad students across the hall, then to the post doc in our lab, and finally to the lab manager, all of whom were in on it and all of whom knew exactly what was up and proceeded to give him the runaround for the better part of an hour. \n\nFinally, I asked him to think about whether a tissue magnet could even exist. \u201cOh, you mean like I need to invent one in order to clean this thing?\u201d No dumbass, stop coming to lab high. Get out. \n\n...he\u2019s got an md/PhD now.",

Best part was it wasn't even for lab stuff it was a personal project. He was gonna use it to make some treatment for his garden. Anyway everyone in there had to fill out OSHA forms after that and get checked out by a doctor because of the **9 molar acid ambiently boiling away for days.** He was asked to leave the lab after that.\n\nAnother time that was kinda funny: one of the masters students in our lab was working with Androgen receptor KO mice for a sex difference experiment. For maybe 5 months she was only getting female mice. Every litter. 100% female mice. She couldn't figure it out, my PI even was baffled. They were checking the temperature in the facility, scratching their head. And then they remembered that Androgen receptor KO male mice do not mature sexually and present as females. The entire scope of their experiment was sex differences and they just forgot about that. She genotyped her mice from there on out.",

Andy required weekly in-depth discussions on why he could not replace my De-ionized water with water from the regular tap (I even sourced KahnAcademy videos   for him.) This is not about Andy\u2019s refusal to understand not all water is equal.\n\nAndy was working on an experiment that required measuring out 5mg of a caustic powder. I had throughly lectured Andy the prior two weeks on how to use the fume hood, PPE, and he quite irritably told me he could handle it  and yes he knew what he was doing (fine, I likely was being overbearing after once again making him get the correct type of water.) I turned to my own computer writing work.\n\nOne of my (precious, precocious) undergrads came into the lab a few minutes later, wandered over to Andy to observe, and loudly exclaimed \u201cDude, are you supposed to be doing that?!\u201d\n\nI rush over to find that, in trying to measure out 5mg of a powder, Andy upended over half the bottle directly onto the lab bench. He was the  scooping the top of the pile directly onto my poor microbalance. Additionally, all of this was done outside of the fume hood and he had no gloves, mask, or PPE other than his precious short white coat (does that even count?) Andy was not allowed to be unsupervised for his remaining 2 months in the lab but got his MD in less time than I got my PhD. \n\nBonus: Much, Much too long after he left my (poor, naive, non-chemistry knowledgeable) advisor asked me if \u201cAndy used up all of that chemical he ordered?\u201d  \u2018Chemical?\u2019 I thought, \u2018what chemical?\u2019 After doing an exhaustive inventory search, I found 3gal of Picric Acid with maybe 100mL removed, and crystals most definitely forming on the screw lid.\nFor those unaware, picric acid left too long can very, very easily go Big Boom in such conditions.

So at 19ish I just thought if you had strep, you didn't get over it until you had antibiotics. I thought it was just an eternity of low level sick. (I thought we treated it not because its really bad, but just because we couldn't fight it off in general) I didn't have insurance so I just waited to see if I stayed sick forever or started getting worse, (swine flu was a thing then and the treatment for flu is so useless). Well I got worse, so must be swine flu. But also I got worse than that.\n\nI just got sicker and sicker and sicker. This was finals week, had a fever so I high i couldn't see to drive myself home. Haha. Ha. Then one day I regained consciousness. Texted my roommate to get me a Gatorade. Drank it, got out of bed and took myself to a walkin clinic where the office staff only spoke one language and it wasn't mine, in a neighborhood with bars on the windows.\n\nIm not a doctor now, but I guess that would be my dumb story. Im mad into virology(was on the PARAMEDIC program and already had my emt-b) was back then too, and my mom was a dr.(how I got antibiotics so fast every other time) so how I just thought strep was easy peasy ill never know.  \n\nAND ANOTHER THING! My hs bf when I was 14 had it go into his heart when he was a kid and they operated to repair his heart valves... so I magically forgot that too! Ill just blame the fever, Im Not an idiot, I swear.",

I did miserably in anatomy & physiology because I *still* don't really know how to memorize things, only cram for exams. low key I think those B-s were pity passing me but whatever...

It bucked, came off the back of the skiff, and fell into the water right beside the dock.  Maybe 4-5 ft of water, nowhere over his head.   Instead of going in and getting the motor, he went back to the lab and reported that the outboard was now at the bottom of the ocean and irretrievable.   One of the maintenance guys drove back to the boat launch and got the motor.  The wonder boy changed jobs in less than a year, taking a teaching position at a small college in the Midwest where he can talk about marine biology rather than...you know...having to get in the water.",

I think that was the worst, they had some study on cancer and they'd just let the tumors take over, push out through the skin, get infected, chewed on by roommates, etc. The PI thought they were allowed to just let the mice die on their own and would get mad when the in house veterinarian euthanized them. \n\nSo more of a \"those people are doctors??\"",

When I worked at a zoo for a summer, I had so many grown adults confuse wallaby testicles for his pouch. Or those times his penis came out and people thought he was giving birth, pointed it out to their kids, and sometimes quickly escorted the kids away without explanation.\n\nOr that time an older woman scolded a wallaby for having her \"peepee\" out and I had to explain it's a baby foot. Fun times!",

A postdoc was showing both of them how to pour agar plates...how to heat up the agar, when to add the antibiotics, etc. \n\n\nWhere the mess happened was when the postdoc instructed them to pour the agar into the petri dishes, after having laid them all out on the bench. I guess he forgot to mention he should take the lids off to pour, because they started pouring with all the lids on and it turned into a huge, jello-ey mess all over his bench. The postdoc just pinched the bridge of his nose is disbelief and told them to clean it up as he was walking away. Both of those grad students were able to get good papers out and graduate, so I suppose they learned their lesson!\n\n\nI have a lot of stories about another guy who was a grad student when I was an undergrad in a different lab. He made a ton of rather silly/borderline angering mistakes, but the oddest thing was that if I was doing tissue culture in well-plates or dishes, he would always marvel that it is a wonder that the cells could stay sterile in that environment. Making the comment once is okay I guess, but it was almost like he was newly marveled by the fact every. single. time. he saw me with a stack of plates.",
