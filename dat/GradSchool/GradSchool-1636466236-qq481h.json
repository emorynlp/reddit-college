And as you said, pursuing a dedicated masters in HCI is definitely confusing and rather a risky take! \n\nThats the reason I'm planning to pursue programs like Masters in Information Science or Masters in Information Systems with a concentration in HCI. This way, I can keep myself open to both Analytics & UX jobs.",

              "text": "Sure! The generic description is that we learn how human capabilities and limitations (in terms of things like workload, situation awareness, attention, working memory, etc.) influence interactions with different interfaces, products, processes, and more. For example, when considering whether to automate an aspect of a particular system we may consider the potential impact of that automation on decision making ability, skill degradation (which is often critical in cases of automation failure), situation awareness and one's mental model of the system, etc. Then we would consider different design decisions that can decrease any potential negative impacts of automation and increase the benefits of this new automation within an existing system. We also learn about UX/UI on its own in terms of the design process. So considering user abilities, knowledge, and skills as well as what tasks users want to accomplish to determine which type of design is best. We learn a variety of methods for designing, iterating, and testing products/interfaces/systems to ensure they are usable. This can include things like storyboarding, prototyping, cognitive walkthroughs, usability tests and more. But the HF background is really nice for supplementing UX in terms of really understanding user capabilities and of course limits, and then designing around them! Many schools have gully funded PhD programs for this, and you can master out if that's all you want! I highly recommend just looking into some programs and reading about the field if this sounds interesting to you!",

What are the job prospects and what type of companies hire us and for what job designations?\n\nI'd love to apply to this program. I'm starting to realise that Human Factors & Ergonomics might be a better choice for me than HCI. As of now, I don't have any plans to pursue a PhD in HF as I am new to this field (I come from a Bachelors in Electronics & Telecommunications background). So, I'd like to join the work force after the completion of MS-HF.",
