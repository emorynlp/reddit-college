  "text": "Hey y'all. This might be dumb but I'm applying to schools and they often ask me to upload a score report in the application itself. I don't understand how I personally am supposed to acquire this; the official ETS site only lists options for sending score reports to institutions directly.\n\nAm I missing something obvious here? How am I supposed to be able to upload a score report if the only option ETS offers is to send it themselves?",

      "text": "Hi! So you'll need to go into your ETS account, click on \"view scores and score recipients,\" and then there should be a blue button on the top right that says \"Download PDF Report.\" You should be able to download this and upload it to your application portal. Do you see that button? If not, you could try to bring up the print screen and select \"Save as PDF\" under destination (where you normally select a printer). Hope this helps!",
