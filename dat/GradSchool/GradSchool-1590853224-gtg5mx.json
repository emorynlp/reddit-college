I am sure the current pandemic situation is not helping with your sanity in undertaking something like writing a dissertation. \n\nIt's easy to look in hindsight and critique your own decisions. Now is the time to reflect and see if you can start over in something else. Would your PhD program allow you to master out? I know doing that could feel as though you have 'failed', but I think that's less important. Rather you should be focusing on your current skills and see if you could market them if in case you do decide to leave academia.",

Corona viruses were believed to be unable to cause serious disease in humans. People devoted their lives to them because they thought they were interesting. Then we realized that these viruses do infect humans. Now those researchers are on national tv. \n\nChin up! You may have dumped out your pot of water, but someday someone might come back to sort through the pieces of the pot! \n\nPS \nI heard about the corona virus research history on the HelloPhD podcast. One of the hosts knew a guy who studied the viruses pre-SARS because they were 'just so cool'\n\nPPS\nNot sure if there's an episode about dumping your thesis in the trash, but there are some nice episodes on dealing with that sort of frustration with a program, I'd recommend checking it out!",
