It\u2019s a stretch and there are weeks I feel like I\u2019ll never get all my work done but it\u2019s worth it for the tuition benefits. If it wasn\u2019t paying for my entire degree I may not have done it.\n\nOn the other side, I used to be a teacher before I moved into industry so I enjoy working with undergrads and it\u2019s a great opportunity to work/network with professors.",

      "text": "I haven\u2019t TA\u2019d yet myself but I\u2019ve heard from peers that the workload and stress is very much dependent on the class and the professor you\u2019re working with. If you can, try to connect with someone whose been a TA for that professor before and ask what the experience was like. That said, lots of PhD programs require students to TA starting their first semester and they are essentially doing a master\u2019s at that point, so it\u2019s definitely doable! It can also be a great way to strengthen a relationship with a faculty member if you\u2019re hoping for a letter of recommendation down the road.",

I TA for additional money (not mandatory as I have a scholarship).\n\nSome instructors demand more from you compared to other instructors and this can increase your workload by a LOT more than what is written in your contract.",

      "text": "I TAed this past year. Your experience can be dependent on a few things like how many labs or classes you'll teach, how familiar you are with the subject, and what the instructor expects from you. \n\nIn my experience I was required to teach 8 labs a week (we had to add more classes while reducing class sizes since we were back to being in-person) while conducting 20 hours of research, and being a full-time student (or I'd lose my scholarship). I had a pretty rough experience and from talking to other people who have TAed I seem to have one of the worst experiences. I was pretty familiar with the subject but my instructor was horrible at planning and giving me any info before hand. He would give me the information to teach 2 days before I had to teach it and I would have to go through and fix his mistakes a good chunk of the time. I also wanted to have make up labs available to students (when possible) to reduce the chances of students coming in sick so I really ran 9 labs a semester. My biggest issue was the students for the most part. I taught the nursing courses and I found some of the students to be a bit rude (maybe it's because I started my master pretty young or that I'm an ecologist idk). Ex: I decided to make my students a comprehensive study guide for their midterm (which was open book). I literally got an email after the midterm from a student calling me a bitch and saying it was my fault they failed because it took so long to find answers in the study guide and that there were questions on the study guide that weren't on the test. I (F) also had the unfortunate experience of having a student (F) ask if I wanted sexual favors in exchange for a passing grade (thankfully over email so I had proof). This one really hurt me because I actually knew the student from the LGBTQ club on campus and she was one of the few people that new I'm bi. I then had to report this to my dean and was basically forced to out myself to my entire department at a small southern college. Plus during this entire time I maintained my 4.0 and did research so I basically had no free time and was constantly stressed. \n\nThat being said, I would still TA if possible (and I'll probably TA for my PhD). I learned a lot from my experience and it can definitely look good on a resume that you have teaching experience.",
