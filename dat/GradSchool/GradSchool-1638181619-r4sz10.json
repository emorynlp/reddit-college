  "text": "First, I just want to preemptively say I appreciate all help and suggestions, so thank you for taking the time to read and reply to this. \n\nTLDR; I am not sure whether I should quit the masters that I hate. I\u2019m also currently employed full time in my ideal career. \n\nI graduated with a psychology bachelors and battled with the uncertainty of what to do next. I\u2019m not a strong researcher so becoming a psychologist was out of the question for me as I knew it would need a ton more school.\n\nI ended up working for several years (event management, temp work) and then did my HR certification. I had an idea that to be an HR executive I would need a masters so without taking a break and knowing research isn\u2019t my strength I enrolled in a Masters of Management Science that was fully paid for and at a fairly average-nothing-to-brag-about school. \n\nWhile there, I ended up meeting my current boss and getting a great, yet demanding full time job. It\u2019s in AI but I\u2019m in the people management part of my firm and got promoted fairly quickly during my 2 years there. \n\nI\u2019ve finished my courses and now all that\u2019s left is my thesis. I work 10-12 hour days at my job and then when I have time (weekend or evenings) I work on my thesis.\n\nProblem is that I\u2019m dragging it on - I hate my thesis topic, I\u2019m struggling to fully grasp the concepts, and this program feels like it\u2019s killing me. My mental health has taken a huge nose dive and I wake up everyday not understanding why I\u2019m in this program.\n\nI feel like the only reason I\u2019m staying is because of outside judgment and expectations. My job doesn\u2019t rely on me getting this masters. I know I won\u2019t finish my thesis this semester and in January I\u2019d have to fork over 3K to keep going as my grants have run out. \n\nI guess I\u2019m on here looking for guidance, has anyone been in my shoes and quit? How did that turn out for you? \n\nAll advice is very welcome as I\u2019m very lost right now.",

      "text": "Seeing as you're only left with your thesis, then I'd say just keep going. If you've made peace with the fact that you won't be finishing this semester, then you can take things slower and reduce the mental strain on yourself. When people say they hate their topic, the root cause is usually the stress and anxiety caused by a perceived lack of progress relative to some looming deadline. So take a deep breath. Calm down. See that when you finish is not that big of a deal in the grand scheme. Realistically determine how much you have left to do on the thesis, then just start. You'd be surprised at how much you can get done with even 30 mins of reading and shit writing a day.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not sure about the other comment. The thesis is the hardest part. What is also extremely troubling is the fact you hate your topic. I loved my topic, it was my brainchild and i\u2019m passionate about it, and I still struggled immensely because writing clearly using academic concepts is a fucking pain. Imo, I would take you dream job and drop the masters if you feel like it\u2019s a mental drain. I had nothing but my thesis, so I kept on. You seem like you\u2019re better off in that regard.",

Then once May and June hit if you're feeling better, then think about whether or not you want to work on your thesis in the fall. \n\nIn other words, no sense in making a final decision now if you don't have to. Could be a six or seven month break is all you need.",

      "text": "I worked full time while I wrote my thesis (I had completed the research, but had not written one word) after a monstrous grad school experience. I moved for the job and hated where I lived, the culture where I lived, my thesis topic, and the fact that I was still tied to a toxic graduate experience. I can imagine your situation very well and I sympathize with you totally. If your degree will open more doors than are open to you now, and if there\u2019s even a chance those doors might open to somewhere you want to go, I think it is worth it to find that $3,000 and get the piece of paper (degree). That piece of paper, although the pursuit of it is enslaving, could be the key to your professional freedom and mobility for the rest of your life. I drug my miserable carcass through the semester of thesis writing to get to that finish line because I couldn\u2019t stand to invest so much of my time, energy, and lifeblood into an effort just to see it diminish into a meaningless gray cloud buried in my memory. My degree is a symbol of my perseverance in the face of financial hardship, emotional hardship, physical hardship, and duress under the tyranny of a warped and broken academic ego manufacturing plant. It can be the same for you. $3,000 is a lot of money, but how much are all those doors the degree might open worth to you?",
