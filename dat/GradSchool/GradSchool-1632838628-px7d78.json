  "text": "I've been advised by many people to reach out to prospective faculty I'd want to work with in grad school. How should I approach this conversation? What should I say in my email?\n\n\\*For some context, I am applying to a humanities PhD but any insight would be very helpful!!!",

I didn\u2019t reach out to anyone before applying (and was accepted to several good programs), nor did anyone else I know in my field.",

      "text": "Before you email, a lot of PhD websites will have a part that says whether or not you should contact faculty before/during applying. Sometimes it will also say this in the application.\n\nSome departments are tired of getting those sorts of \"spray and pray\" emails from potential grad students, so their websites will say something like \"Please do not contact faculty during the application process. Simply indicate on your personal statement who you are potentially interested in working with\". Other schools will directly say \"please reach out to faculty to see if they are willing to take on graduate students\". If you can't find this on their website, kindly email the department chair to see if it's appropriate to reach out to faculty during the process. \n\nNow you're at the point where the website or department chair says you can reach out. Here's what I've done with great success:\n\nGoogle the faculty persons name with \"Google scholar\" after their name. They should have a Google scholar page if they're serious about their work. Once in their page, click the \"Year\" icon to sort it by newest research first, and then look through some of their most recent papers. If you want to read more (Scholar will usually only show the abstract), you'll probably have to Google the article name and hope you get lucky with a full free version somewhere. Remember, PhD is a research degree, not a \"take some classes and be called Dr\" degree. If you don't like their recent research, don't bother contacting because you'll be doing that sort of research for your dissertation. Make sure they publish frequently! Don't get someone who last published in like 2019 and/or hardly has any publications.\n\nWhen contacting them, make it short and sweet. Not a long generic \"I want to be your student at your prestigious university\". I'll give an example of a good email.\n\n\"Greeting Professor Bob. My name is John Doe, and I am a potential PhD student in black hole physics. I looked through your recent research papers and saw that you have a strong leaning towards research in black hole physics, and I was definitely caught up in the hypotheses you made regarding black hole creations in your papers of (insert paper name) and (insert paper name).\n\nAs a potential PhD student, finding research that aligns with my interests is paramount, and seeing that your research aligns with the topic(s) that I desire to work on, I was wondering if we could have a conversation sometime to see if I could potentially be a good fit with you as a PhD student...\"\n\nSomething like that. Not a novel-length \"plz accept me\" email. PhD is a research degree, so you have to have research interests that align with a faculty member. They don't care how you got into the field or your GPA. Research interests must align!\n\nLast piece. I highly recommend a PhD from an R1 institution, espeically for humanities. R1 means they have very high research activity and lots of funding. Here is a list of R1 institutions. Best of luck!\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States",
