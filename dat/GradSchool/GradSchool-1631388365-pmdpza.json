  "text": "I\u2019m starting to think about possibly applying for PhD programs for Fall 2023, I\u2019m currently a Masters student in a social science program where getting a PhD isn\u2019t an option for me at this school. I have looked at the faculty at the schools I want to apply to, but none really share my research interests. Should I reach out to faculty members and attempt to start a dialogue (not right now, but eventually)?",

Some of the best advice that I ever recieved was not to focus too much on what I *thought* I wanted to do, and instead to choose a topic that I merely didn't hate and trust that I would grow to love it.\n\nI had never even *heard* of the topic I did my Ph.D. in before I started my program, but I sure do love it now!",

              "text": "Oh that makes a lot of sense! I would imagine it would be hard to do a PhD in a project you don't connect with, but sometimes PIs have more side projects in the works. Maybe if you read some of their papers and are interested in a particular angle that they could explore further? A lot of students find that once they get into a lab, they connect with projects they didn't necessarily expect to.\n\nI would say it might be helpful to talk to a PI and ask more about their work to maybe develop a stronger interest, but don't say outright that everything is boring to you, since nobody wants to mentor someone who doesn't care at all.",
