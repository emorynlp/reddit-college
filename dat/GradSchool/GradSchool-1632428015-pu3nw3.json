  "text": "I am trying to come up with a research topic for my cloud computing class by today, but the papers I end up reading are either too advanced or not relevant to what I am looking for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would normally default to privacy issues with cloud technologies, but those kinds of papers have alot of algorithm or math theory stuff that as a software engineer I probably won't properly understand.  \n\n\nAny other topic I have some interest in has that same issue. I don't know what to fucking write about. I don't know how everyone else does it, but I have already emailed my professor that I need more time. It's already embarassing enough that I am taking the same subject twice due to issues with my research project from the last time. I'll never figure out grad school.",

Skip methods/results entirely, focus on the abstract and (if you need more depth) the introduction/discussion sections.\n\n(And make sure it\u2019s in a decent journal so you can trust that it has been peer-reviewed by someone who did have the background to understand it in depth.)\n\nNobody is reading 30-40 papers in-depth and fully understanding them every time they write a paper for a class. (Well, almost nobody. A few people who haven\u2019t figured this out yet may be running themselves into the ground trying to do it.) And when your PI writes a grant, s/he is not reading and understanding every single cite in-depth either.\n\nLearning how to get what you need out of a paper and then quickly move on to the next one is part of that mysterious \u201cfiguring out grad school\u201d.",
