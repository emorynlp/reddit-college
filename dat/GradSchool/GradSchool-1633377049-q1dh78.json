  "text": "Has anyone had any luck/history applying to grad programs without relevant experience outside of the classroom? I recently completed my undergrad with a 3.7, but all the research I\u2019ve done has been for class. I\u2019m currently struggling finding a relevant internship but would still like to apply for Fall 2022, given that many schools aren\u2019t requiring the GRE. I\u2019m just curious what my chances would be of getting in at the moment.",
