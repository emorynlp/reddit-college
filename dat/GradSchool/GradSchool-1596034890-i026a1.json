  "title:": "My wife's professor is destroying her and I don't know what to do.",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy wife is several years into her PhD, and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible, but I just don't know what to do anymore.\n\nSince beginning her PhD education a few years ago, she has changed her thesis topic, successfully presented her proposal to her committee, learned a great deal, did a great amount of outreach in her subject, and lately has been working tirelessly on her project (which requires a lot of data analysis in R Studio on her ancient computer), and I couldn't be more proud of her.\n\nBut her professor is the most condescending POS I've ever encountered and only ever complains about how behind she is, how lazy she must be to have done so little so far, and any time she shares some of the things she's done that week he doesn't acknowledge it and gets mad at her for not doing more. He's also been sued by a past grad student for emotional abuse, to give you an indication of his behavior.\n\nAs a result of his constant put-downs and claims that he's not sure she has what it takes to graduate, her self-esteem has plummeted a great deal. She is regularly down, calls herself a loser and a failure regularly despite my protests, and nothing I do or say seems to help her out of this funk. She attends therapy virtually every other week, but when I ask if she should attend more often she says that she doesn't think therapy really helps her anyway so what is the point.\n\nI'm just so sad that this is what she's been reduced to thanks to the crappy attitude of a 4-times divorced jerk who sees her as a waste, and I've regularly fantasized about giving him a piece of my mind (and fist) because I just don't know how to help her. I know her dream is to get her PhD, I see how happy the work can make her when he's not insulting her intelligence, and suggesting that she look into changing professors doesn't seem to help her either. Her parents have asked her if she just wants to quit, but the idea of quitting on her dream seems to only make her more miserable.\n\nThis may not be the best place to ask for help, but I'm desperate. Please help me help my wife.\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for all of your suggestions. I\u2019ve talked to her about some of the options for reporting him, but she still really doesn\u2019t want to, so I\u2019ll just continue doing my best to support her and offer any help I can with whatever she chooses to do. Neither of us know what an ombudsman(?) is, but I\u2019ll be looking into it and what our options are as well. I think we\u2019re not in a one party consent state unfortunately, so recording conversations is out, but we do have emails at least (though he seems to be good at not outright calling her things, just overall being a dick in her words). Again, it means so much to me to hear all of your thoughts and kind words.",

      "text": "Going down legal paths, ombudsman, reporting, etc. is a path that you can't turn back from. It will irrevocably change the relationship between the student and faculty member, and it may make it so that your partner can no longer work with the faculty member. The process of pursuing these paths, as well as the subsequent effort to find a new faculty member who hasn't heard false rumours, etc., about your work ethic will require a huge amount of effort. I would only go down that path if it is last resort. Ideally, a student repairs the relationship/situation with the faculty member to something workable, perhaps with informal assistance or input from a friendly third part (e.g. more senior faculty member known to the student). It sucks, but after going through and also advocating on behalf of students in similar situations, my experience is that you have to accept that the jerk-ish behaviour won't fundamentally change.\n\nEdit: And of course, this is only pointing out a \"solution\" or option for continuing with the current research. I personally think it is actually better to cut your loses in these situations, try to master out, and find a new program/PI. Or maybe even just switch PI within the institution and suffer the unfair reputational damage within your institution (although that may happen if you master out, too).",

      "text": "I don't know if this works for every department, but generally speaking, if a student and an advisor are not working well together, the higher ups in the department will take notice and try to work out a solution. \n\nMy own experience was kind of bumpy, I did not work too well with my first advisor and made very little progress in my first four years of grad school (it took me four years to defend my masters). Just as I was getting desperate, the head of the department sat down to talk to me and told me a professor who I had little contact with in the past wanted to take me on. I was stunned at the time, because my research experience by that point did not even match well with that professor's area. I had little faith in myself at the time, but I switched to the new professor and worked hard to catch up. Things turned out fine because he is just much better at advising students, and despite my lack of experience, I made progress very quickly and got my Ph.D in less than 2 years.\n\nThe reason I am sharing my experience is this: grad school generally do not want students to fail, so your wife's problem really isn't just her own problem. Someone in the department may be watching out for her and trying to figure out a solution. And she might find help in unexpected ways. Talk to the department, be honest about feeling desperate, be open about the fears of failure. See what they have to say and suggest. I feel very sympathetic to your situation and wish the best for you and your wife!",

      "text": "You've gotten a lot of good responses here already, but I just wanted to suggest for your wife to do some perspective adjustment. The more she continues to believe what her PI is telling her, the more she will become demoralized and demotivated which might further affect her quality of work. She needs to realize she is dealing with an abusive supervisor, and that's on him, not her, and then stop internalizing everything he says. If therapy isn't working out for her, she might want to look into different therapists. It's helpful for grad students to lean towards an internal locus of control rather than external (Google for more context). She needs to steel herself to get through this without much further harm done, and you both can move on with your life. A done PhD is a successful one.",

      "text": "Chiming in to say that if she were to talk to other students, they might be able to show her the light more than you can. As an 'outsider' in this situation, she may not value your advice as much as that of a peer because  you just don't 'get' that this is what you have to do to get your PhD. (which is bullshit, and I'm sorry.)\n\nSome other strategies to consider: \n\n1. Asking her point-blank, \"Do you want my advice, or do you just need to vent?\" It might be that she just wants to vent to you, and isn't looking for solutions (and thus gets frustrated when you try to suggest them).\n2. Encourage her to step away from her work. Sometimes, all it takes is some distance to see just how far into the shit you've sunk. And even if it doesn't lead to revelations, it'll still make her happier to be doing things she loves with people she loves. Try to have some special time every week where it's just you two, no work allowed. Go do the things you loved doing together before this swallowed her life. \n   1. She may resist at first. People in abusive relationships tend to feel the need to 'earn' the abuser's clemency by going above and beyond on every little thing, investing an unhealthy amount of their self worth into how well they've pleased that person (\"If I stop working, that proves I really AM a lazy dumb piece of shit!!!\"). Be prepared for that.\n3. Get your own therapist. Supporting someone can be just as hard as going through a tough time yourself, because you don't have control. \n4. Try not to let this become the focus of every conversation. It might lead to her feeling overwhelmed and start avoiding conversations with you because it always turns into a 'here's all the reasons why you're handling this wrong and what you need to do better' session. \n\nGood luck, friend!! I'm going to be (hopefully) entering a master's next fall, and I'll likely be going it alone since my partner will be joining the Army and we don't know where he'll be stationed. I'm kinda scared to think about spending long nights at school and then coming home to an empty house...No goofy smile, hugs, or the random cups of tea he makes for me when he knows I need it. I'm sure just you being there is already a big help for her, though it's hard to feel like that sometimes. Keep on keeping on!",

(I did pursue some of the avenues mentioned elsewhere in this thread such as meeting with an ombudsman but unfortunately they didn\u2019t help.)\n\nMy partner really helped me by listening to me and supporting me when I considered leaving.  Honestly the best thing he did for me was tell me that my publication count was not a reflection of my worth as a person.  My parents are academics, so I grew up believing academic success was the most important thing in life, therefore academic failure = failure at life.  Then I had my advisor telling me that my brain doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019m a waste of space (direct quotes).  So just hearing that I was a good person and that it was okay to pursue other options was really important for me.",

      "text": "If you live in a one party state, start having her record these interactions.  It did wonders for me when I was facing a harassing professor who wanted to cause trouble for me.  This professor I was TAing for was causing me endless grief just because she could, and was on the verge of having my funding revoked saying that I wasn't grading things correctly.  I had gone though the dean of students and the university ombudsman and no one wanted to lift a finger to help, it was hell.  I got maybe 6-10 \"official\" letters stating everything I was supposedly doing wrong.  At that point I started recording all interaction with this person using an app I downloaded on my phone.  In my final \"assessment\" meeting with the department chair I strongly implied, though didn't say directly, that I had been doing so ( I think I said something like \"I can provide incredibly accurate transcripts of every meeting I have had with \\[shitty professor\\] in the past month\").  The guy went white as a sheet and practically ran to that professors office as soon as he could get me out the door.  I know from the meeting notes from the following faculty meeting that a few professors wanted to add that students shouldn't be allowed to record meetings due to \"privacy concerns\", but were informed there was nothing they could legally do to stop anyone from doing so.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways that was over a year ago, and I never heard anything about it again after that.  I'm not sure how well that would work for your situation, but if you live in a one party state it might not be a bad idea to have some recordings as an insurance policy.",

      "text": "This sucks. I'm so sorry that your wife is going through this and it shouldn't be okay. First, if therapy isn't working talk to her again about going more or switching to a different therapist. Hopefully she can find someone that can help because she can definitely switch if she feels like she's not getting the help she needs. Second, 4 years in isn't a great time to try to switch advisors. As much as that sucks it will be really hard and will probably push her back several years from graduating. And sadly in my field the students are labeled as the problem for switching not the professor even if it's clear it's not the students fault. Third, others have said to keep a record of what's happening. DO THIS. Check your state laws and see if she can record conversations without him knowing. Keep a record of all emails, like back them up to another email, and write down all verbal conversations. Lastly, people have said that she should have a mediator, like the grad school advisor. This could go well or it could go horrible. At my school we also have a bully PI and when people stood up to him he made their lives worse. If she gets someone involved before she graduates he could try to make sure she doesn't, not that he will be successful but he might try or he could make things worse for her. I'm not saying don't do anything but please take that into consideration. If she does talk to someone make sure she documents things first, that way it will not be her word against his. People have also said talk to him yourself. If you do this I'm sure he will definitely make things worse for her. Keep being supportive of her. Stress reducing activities are great and see if she can find something that works for her, for me it's running every morning, for a friend of mine it's doing boxing classes and another it's painting and reading. Be there by her side, you're doing everything right even though this sucks.",

Try to switch advisors, there is a possibility that if you ask them, they will allow you to just continue without any major changes.\n\nIf you are absolutely stuck with him, then you have to do some mental work. Firstly, go in with realistic expectations, expect insults and ignore, ignore, ignore them. Only take in the suggested improvements relevant to the work that you have done. Don't go into meetings expecting praise and get disappointed repeatedly.\n\nSomething else you can address in therapy is to reduce deference to authority figures. This is difficult, because grad school doesn't work that way. If your advisor says that you don't have what it takes, instead of internalizing it and believing it, aim to recognize for what it is - an opinion of one (known abusive) professor out of millions. So having proper boundaries and knowing not to take things personally will help.",

      "text": "I've found that sometimes, it's not actually about deciding what the right course of action would be. Sometimes, it's actually a matter of [running out of spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) and \u2013 ironically, perhaps \u2013 not having enough spoons to properly explain all that when a shorter, vaguer \"It won't make a difference if I try\" will at least end the current well-intentioned but draining situation. It's a vicious cycle because non-optimal courses of action lead to having even fewer spoons in the long run.\n\nAt the same time, each person's agency needs to be respected. We can be quite confident that they know what's right, but it isn't the same as *knowing* and we aren't psychic. People need to be respected enough to make their own choices.\n\nSo, what are we to do?\n\nAnswer: Make it as absolutely easy as possible for them to do what they need to do for themselves. We're raised with this idea that it's important that we do all the work for ourselves, and this bleeds into how we think about all kinds of situations. But what actually matters? Does it matter if the person types the email themself? No, not really. What matters is that they decide to click send. They can change some of the wording if they want, of course, what I'm saying is that all they *really* need to do is click send to get the ball rolling, and that leaves you with plenty of things you can mercifully handle for them.\n\nSo, who exactly do you think she should contact? Open an email and address it to that person. What do you think she should say when she reaches out? Type a short, polite message that checks those boxes. Pick a suitable subject line. Then, bring it to your wife, tell her you love her,  and implore her to click send (or change the wording *and then* click send; if you think it'll help, you can say how much you'd like to let her dictate the edits to you).\n\nIn short, don't just focus on persuasion. Focus on minimizing the amount of spoons she'll need to spend.\n\nGood luck.",

She could realistically have to spend another two to three years with this adviser on her current track. That's something I would be trying to avoid.\n\nAnother option is to get the Dean's office involved, since this borders on abuse. I've heard about scenarios where interactions between the abusive adviser and the student are limited and documented. This could help limit the things he says to her. Note this is only an option to help her make it to the end. This basically removes the adviser as a source of recommendations and referrals for future jobs, and it might not be that effective depending on the university.",

                          "text": "Um it really depends. In my department there a few labs that are similar so if you switch to one of them you could have an easier time I'm sure, but if it's something completely different it might be hard to have both depending on how things end. And if you're switching because your PI is toxic and no longer want to work with them I would think it would be hard to continue the project from a different lab because all the supplies and materials are in the lab you are leaving. You might still have to have them on your committe too if you try to wrap it up. If you're new pi doesn't do that kind of work they may or may not have the funding to buy the materials you need to finish the project. And sometimes the labs can't function with different types of work depending on how they are set up. If you leave on bad terms the old PI may not allow you to continue that work so it would be an incomplete part of your dissertation and maybe best not to include. I think it would really depend on if you can leave the lab on good terms and convince your pi you're not leaving because of them but because of interest or something. I think someone choosing to leave a lab in what others will see as a pursuit of other things is different then their PI died and they need to wrap up their work so they can finish it and someone else will just check off. I hope that answers your question! If it doesn't I'll definitely try to clarify some more",

They removed me from the situation, I took a 6 month leave of absence and then they helped me find a new lab to finish up in. It was a completely new project, but with a semi-related focus. Finishing up sometime in the next ~3 months and while the dissertation intro is a long mess of subjects it's a field that I was interested in transitioning to anyways for a postdoc.",

When I was in the same position my partner supported me by standing by whatever decisions I made (sometime wrong- mostly wrong if you talk to her) She also helped out by doing a lot more of the chores around the house ie dishes, cooking (she works full time) so that I could focus on just getting through the project deadlines .  It's crazy how much importance grad students put into impressing or making their profs happy.  It's like some kind of Stockholm syndrome were we just need their approval for own self worth.  I sometimes get a feeling some Profs do this on purpose to squeeze out everything they can from a student before getting a new one.   Anyway, It seems like your wife has an amazing support system behind her and I have no doubt the both of you will get through it. Good luck!",

              "text": "No problem! I am glad if my comments can help anyone :) Some things that I learned only now that I am on the path of finishing... \n1) have a life outside the lab-  so many grad students get caught up with thinking they need to live in the lab/office.  They think if everyone sees them there all the time they will think they are working even though their output isn\u2019t that high and sometimes they are deflecting  \n2)Establishing a proper work life balance is really important.  I made my own rule No writing past 6 pm. Some experiments take all day and you can break the rule but if I am writing i have a hard 6 pm cutoff.  I know it sounds crazy but I have been more productive since implementing this rule.  I think having a hard time cut off forces me to spend less time procrastinating on reddit lol.\n3) Have a hobby (Or multiple) on the side.  This one seems counterproductive but as grad students especially in PhD our projects are huge. So there are very few days when we actually accomplish something monumental. For example, I worked night and day for a couple monthS to finish all my statistics and data analysis but  when I was done it didn\u2019t seem to be a big deal when compared to what is left in the PhD and I didn\u2019t feel it that rush of dopamine/accomplishment.  Also at the end of day it\u2019s just a virtual file and  it didn\u2019t seem like a real accomplishment as I couldn\u2019t physically hold it.  On the other hand I LOVE to bake bread on the weekends.  It takes about a full day of work but at the end of the day you get an actual physical reward that you get  be proud of and  share.  So Hobbies I think actually  help supplement that feeling of accomplishment that you rarely get as a PhD and you try to get from the approval of your prof.  Also a lot of other grad students I talk trend to dream about giving up and doing a trade job and I think it has to do with the need to actually make something physical with our hands to feel that sense of accomplishment that is always missing . \n3)  make sure you don\u2019t use your Research to define yourself.  You are more then your project.  I saw this in myself and other scientist and it\u2019s ok when your research is doing great.  You feel awesome and wanna head to the lab all the time but when the research results stop (and it will) your life  could suddenly collapse .  This is really hard to comeback from as you can become scared even to do more experiments as they can fail. Even if  doing more experiments is exactly what will get you out of your \nfunk.  At my worst period I delayed doing an experiment for almost a year because I was soo afraid of it failing. My reptilian brain reasoning was that no results was better then a negative results which is obviously wrong.\n4)Have a General outline of your thesis so that you have an idea of  experiments needed to finish your thesis. This way if your prof asks to do a side  experiment you can point out that this isn\u2019t in your scope or you can adjust your thesis to include this side project.  A lot of profs will use grad students as a fishing expenditure   to find some shiny new data to  their never ending grant applications.  Lots of the time these fishing expenditures end in nothing and just cause you months in experimental setup/analysis.  Phd is supposed to be an apprenticeship, you are supposed to guided and taught how to lead a research project not just be dropped in the lab with a half baked  idea to complete for the prof.  Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for support from your prof and if he/she doesn\u2019t provide get it from another prof.  Academia is kinda fucked in that the people who succeed in the current system are usually the ones that  end up being bad supervisors completing the circle.  I don\u2019t know if this helps or answers your questions. I wish you the best of luck in your PhD.  Cheers.",

Your reply literally elevated my mood, thank you! \nI will summarize your points to internalize them better haha Thank you again for all these insights\n\nSo I understand those points (all of which make a real sense to me):\n-Don't be involved in the lab/research work all the time (This was one of my fears... But I guess I will already be doing a lot outside, since I'll be moving to a new country and establish everything from the scratch)\n-Set firm rules for 'no-work' (which will probably will be a great help for me, as I tend to ruin my day procrastinating and I start working past 11 pm and I end up ruining my night as well...)\n-Have hobbies - 'Baking day' sounds very good, I have just realized that soon after I had started playing an instrument I have also started to avoid being involved in multiple research projects. (I hope I find some space to play amateur volleyball with people, and do mealprep Sundays)\n-Don't identify much with your research (it has been a big issue for me in the past, \"the insignificant results\", and I learned (hopefully I did) that it is fine and it doesn't invalidate the amount of work I put in the study. Also, reading about Open Science practices made it more and more possible for me to enjoy insignificant results)\n-Plan beforehand regarding your thesis and projects \n\nAgain, thank you very much and I hope you finish your studies with no issues and problems",

Inevitably, Prof. Would come in fuming in a week or two, mad she didn\u2019t do x,y, or z... she\u2019d flip through her diary and explain that she indeed do as she was asked, placed it back on the in-pile on Prof\u2019s desk, and that it was now the Prof\u2019s responsibility to edit and resend the document to the agency in question.  Every time the Prof. was forced to shut their mouths in awe of the information she had at her fingertips.  Document everything if at all possible... it\u2019s part of your arsenal if it\u2019s needed in the future, and it shows you care about every step of the process and are doing everything you can to meet the requests as made by the Prof.  (And verbal abuse etc., is perfect to be documented... it would look pretty silly if he was in a meeting and was asked if he agrees with the following statements made on xxx date, at yyy time... \u201cYou\u2019re useless, you are no good at what you do, and you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d...

Maybe even in rare cases (like once in my life have I seen this) there is a hardware bug, so literally the electronics are bad. It feels like you did everything right but it's not working. Computers are like that because they're complicated machines, and it sucks.\n\nBut a fault in the computer, or software, is at the end the responsibility of the researcher. A homebuilder can't blame the bulldozer they rented even if the bulldozer has some hardware issue due to the manufacturer's fault. It's still the homebuilder's fault in the house isn't up in time. Computers are tools, and follow the instructions of the hardware and software, and the researcher is responsible for selecting and diagnosing issues with it. And if there is some issue, then the researcher is responsible for communicating exactly what's going on in the computer in a way that the professor can understand it (which may be more difficult in a non-computing field).",

Yes she is an adult, but she is also in an abusive relationship and many, many, adults in abusive relationships don't realize it or are afraid to leave them. This, just be supportive while your wife is being abused and remind her this abuse will be over soon that cold_shoulder1 says below is not healthy and a part of this whole toxic grad school mentality of you must suffer in order to be accepted as a true grad student.\n\nI would ask your wife how she would respond if you treated her like her professor is. Because her professor is the second most important person in her life right now beyond you and that relationship should be healthy and supportive, not condescending and abusive. Her professor's job is to push her, absolutely, but not belittle her.\n\nIf you don't want to be confrontational I like someone else's suggestion of just documenting everything that's happening between them for potential conversation with a representative from the school.\n\nI'm sure you know this, but continue your support for her and make your home a safe and happy place to the best of your ability. But also, don't lose sight of your mental health in supporting your wife, if her professors treatment of her begins to affect your mental health, therapy or something more drastic like a conversation about how her professor is affecting your life may be needed.",
