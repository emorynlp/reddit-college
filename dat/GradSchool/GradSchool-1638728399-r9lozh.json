  "title:": "Who do you talk to about dropping out of a PhD program?",
  "text": "I'm in my second year, and this semester has been particularly stressful, and everyday I feel like I'm failing. I'm the only one failing in this one course, and I don't know where to take my project next. I don't even understand the project that is supposedly my own. I know this is a common theme in \"imposter\" syndrome, but that's not it.\n\nWho do I talk to, and what do I say? I haven't decided 100% that I want to drop out, I want to talk to someone about it, without seeming attention or reassurance-seeking. I want a concrete discussion as to what to do next, whether I stay in the program or not.\n\nI thought about asking my advisor about this, but I don't want to come off as flake-y so early in the program. I just joined the lab a few months ago. And she would be supportive of me to stay in the program, because she's kind and that's just who she is, with everyone.\n\nI've noticed a trend, that most PI's are generally supportive of their students. Just because I said \"I want to pursue a PhD in this field\", my previous PI literally held my hand to grad school. I'm very, very grateful.\n\nBut now that I'm here, my advisor still holds my hand. I know I'm not doing well. \n\nWho do I talk to? Thanks in advance. Sorry if this comes off as an annoying post. I'm actually not doing very well, and any advice is appreciated.",

      "text": "Not sure who specifically you should talk to- but fwiw, \"hand holding\" is kinda how it works in this stage of the process. You're new to the lab and don't really understand the project yet, so you're getting additional support. In a year or two you'll be holding a newer students hand and helping them along. And if you become a PI someday, you'll hold the hand of employees and students who need help.\n\nYou're new, this is your time to receive mentorship and assistance. Accept what is given and prepare for when you will be the giver.",

Is it the same in your program? \n\nThe DGS knows a lot about expectations, general and specific. They know signs of trouble and how to correct. They can just talk through the situation, which in itself is often helpful without a specific followup action. \n\nLearning to become an independent rearcher is really hard. That is the goal of most PhD students and some accomplish it by the time they graduate. You have to be pretty intentional about it, so the nature of the hand-holding should be changing as you learn.",
