  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have been thinking about getting a PhD in science education and I am just wondering if it would be a dead end degree. Right now I am currently getting a masters in science and a life of research and writing grants just doesn\u2019t seem like the life for me. My ultimate goal is to teach at a university, but strictly teaching. I know this is accomplishable with a masters, but I feel like a PhD would increase my chances to teach at the university level. What do you think? Is there anyone here with a PhD in science education? \n\n\nThanks",

You would likely make more money teaching in high school over your career.\n\nA PhD allows you to be tenure track. But at most institutions, that will also require that you do research, not just teaching.",

There are university teaching jobs, usually called Adjunct Professor or Instructor, that don't involve much research and just focus on teaching. But those aren't real professor jobs, they pay extremely little, have no job security, and very often don't come with any benefits. To be a professor at a university you have to be a very accomplished, full-time researcher, and teaching is often considered secondary by the university (sad to say).\n\nIf you want to focus mainly on just teaching, look into teaching high school or community college. You'll still need a PhD and a solid-ish research record to get a job at a community college, but once employed there you'll usually be able to focus on teaching.",

A lot of universities aren\u2019t used to seeing PhD in science education and might be hesitant to hire you EVEN THOUGH you would be more qualified not less qualified to teach with one.",
