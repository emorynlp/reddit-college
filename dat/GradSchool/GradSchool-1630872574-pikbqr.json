  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019m working full time and starting grad school applications for entering in fall of 2022. I\u2019m trying hard to stay organized and on top of things, but man, how do you guys keep from just feeling overwhelmed? I feel like crying half the time. \n\nMy job already leaves me exhausted and doing these application essays and reaching out to people and taking risks - it\u2019s all very scary. And with the pandemic, I feel even less certain, but I\u2019ve already postponed grad school by two years because of the pandemic and I can\u2019t wait any longer, even tho I\u2019m still uncertain about what to expect.  \n\nAdvice? :(",

      "text": "Honestly I was in your place a few months ago. I initially made a list of schools I wanted to attend and broke it down by \u201cDream, Doable, and Acceptable\u201d. But once I began having to do all the research and writing multiple essays/intent letters\u2026..I ended up just picking one school and focusing all my time towards applying for that one and making sure my application was solid. \nI got accepted and started school last week. It has been crazy overwhelming. I work full-time, have spent 5 hours studying (quick dinner) and go straight to bed. I\u2019ve managed to sneak a few chores in some days but also spent 10 hours Saturday and Sunday studying. Forgot to eat cause I was feeling so overwhelmed. But as soon as I was done I put on my sneakers and just walked as fast and as far as I could. \nSo long story short, here\u2019s some things I learned/suggest:\n- If you have someone to count on (family, partner, etc) definitely do. You won\u2019t be able to do it all, nor should you try\n- I agree with what someone else said, find something to watch that helps you de-stress. Personally, I give myself an episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy once every other two weeks and I just cry as much as I possibly can. Totally helps. \n- Keep detailed lists (could even organize them by days), prioritize tasks, AND acknowledge that you\u2019re proud of yourself when you get them done. \nGood luck \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd",

      "text": "In terms of the practical part of applying, I agree with what's been said. See exactly what you need to do, every task, and when. Break that down into the smallest possible chunks, look at the time you have, and spread things out enough so that you don't have to scramble for anything. In my case, it helped to start with \"easy\" tasks (emailing programs, editing writing sample) to build momentum into stuff like the SoP that I knew would kick my ass. You may be the opposite, in which case, adjust the process for how your brain works best! Regularly re-assess and make adjustments when necessary.\n\n\nBeyond that, I think I just accepted that there is a passive stress level inherent to anything grad school related. Being first gen from my background intensified those feelings. Once I accepted that this was a normal thing to experience, and not something indicative of my readiness, those feelings of stress and overwhelm became less of something I needed to *control* and more of something that I could accept, validate, and work around when necessary. Easier said than done I suppose, but where grad school is concerned, I don't believe you can truly eliminate stress from the process. Or if you do, you can become a millionaire for it haha.",

Then narrow it down a bit i.e. step 1 requires a, b, and c. Then even narrower: step 1a requires i, ii, and iii. And then I focus on step 1ai, refusing to acknowledge the existence of any other part of the process, trusting in my overall plan. After every couple of sub-sub-steps, dedicate some time to reevaluating the big plan without necessarily worrying about making actual progress. This isn't necessarily the fastest way to get things done but it's kept me sane",

When I went through the application process, I made a spreadsheet of how many letters of recommendation I needed, if there were secondary prompts I needed to address, when the app was due, and professors whose lab I wanted to work in so I could 1) look into their previous research and see if we had common interests, and 2) reach out to them via email to see if they had space, funding, or other faculty recommendations that might be a better fit. Take little chunks at a time with your apps, too. Good luck!",
