  "title:": "Is it frowned upon to not take a class taught by your advisor when the opportunity arises?",
  "text": "I was paired with my current advisor because of the research interests I wrote about in my SoP back when I was applying to grad school. My research interests have changed since then (I've discussed this with my advisor), and, while I don't anticipate switching advisors (as my advisor has broad expertise that more or less covers my current interests), I don't feel strongly inclined to take their class next semester. I could take it, but it wouldn't do much in terms of building knowledge/theoretical understanding toward my current research interest. Would it be weird if I didn't take their class? Keep in mind that if I don't take their class next semester, I'll finish my program without having taken a class from them. I'd appreciate any advice! Thank you!",

      "text": "Advisors in grad school, to me at least, want students to enroll in courses that will help them the most in terms of getting into their specific area of interest. I think deep down advisors appreciate their advisees taking courses with them, but if their classes are not going to provide the students with as much information, knowledge, skill building as another course, then the advisor probably takes that to heart and would want the best for the student. Granted, some advisors are certainly nicer than others. If you feel that you've made a good relationship with your advisor, then if another course will prepare you more, take that course instead of the one taught by your advisor.",

      "text": "Your particular department or faculty may have specific (or idiosyncratic) rules, written or unwritten.\n\nThat said, no--it's not compulsory to take your advisor's course(s) if it wouldn't be a good and sensible use of your time. As a graduate student - especially one nearing completion - you're expected to be at least semi-independent, and able to exert at least some influence over your path. Your choices aren't expected to be *perfect*, but you should make sure they're *defensible*.\n\nIf there's another course that's a better fit for your specific needs - or you have enough credit hours and would just be better off writing - then that's what you should do.",

      "text": "My supervisor makes all her students take \"reading courses\" to string more work out of us. If we aren't obligated to be in a class it's more time she can make us work on random other things, then just ask for a rough draft of a paper right before the semester ends and give us an A. \n\nSo it's frowned upon only if you have a bad supervisor. If there's something you can better spend your time on that you'll get more out of. Then any good supervisor will prioritize you learning and being more able to complete your thesis over their own ego. It's up to you to know if your supervisor is good or not.",
