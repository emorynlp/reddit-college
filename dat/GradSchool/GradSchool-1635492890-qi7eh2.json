  "text": "hi y'all I'm not sure if this is appropriate to ask here but I am getting desperate. I am an American studying my master's in Denmark (which has free education for EU and Danish citizens) but since I am non-EU, I have to pay tuition. I am desperately trying to find any kind of funding but I am at a loss. Every loan, grant, and scholarship I find is only for schools in the US or Canada and Denmark only has 1 governmental scholarship which I didn't receive. I am a woman in a STEM field, so usually there are good funding options but still everything I have found is for US-based schools. if this is the wrong place to post, I'll remove it. I'm just at a total loss and am trying to think outside the box. I'd appreciate any thoughts/suggestions but will also accept commiseration and pity lol",

      "text": "Is there an office for scholarships/student matter in your institution? If so maybe you are better off bringing it up with a person who knows the system better. There are usually lot's of European programs for women in STEM specifically but there are also funding opportunities for US citizens studying in the EU.  Anyway your best first option would be to discuss this with the administration there probably.",

I understand the culture is different because people don\u2019t need funds the same way, but I\u2019ve basically been told \u201cthat\u2019s not our problem\u201d. Maybe I\u2019ll look at it from an Americans in the EU perspective and find something that way, thanks",

Denmark works really well but only if you\u2019re on the inside.\nTry asking in expat in Denmark  groups on Facebook or the Americans in Denmark group - they have a great community. Depending on your field there might also be research positions that would include options for covering tuitions.",
