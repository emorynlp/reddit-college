  "text": "Hi everyone, it\u2019s my first semester in a 2 year STEM MS program. I am in a completely different state than undergrad, so I am also being influenced by a lot of adjustment stress and feelings of loneliness since I am in a new city.\n\nAnyways,\nI have a class that is two parts, this semester and the next semester. This (lab) class is like a whole new beast that I\u2019ve never fought before, and the faculty that are teaching it are not the warmest whatsoever. The main professor is really, just, an ass \u2014 to put it plainly. He\u2019s old school hardcore and has no problem speaking condescendingly to his students and demoralizing them. Out of all the TA\u2019s, there are two helpful ones, of whom always aren\u2019t around. The other TA\u2019s seem really rigid and satisfied with letting their students fend for themselves in this lab.\n\nIn this lab, we have verbal quizzes with the professor that we have to tend to before starting the lab. Makes sense. But this professor is such an asshat that I have SO much fear coming to complete these quizzes. If you don\u2019t understand something, he will pick on it more and more and leave you feeling completely stupid and unworthy of being in the program. The other day, I didn\u2019t do so well on my recent verbal quiz and he offered me a redo with a slightly lower grade (thank god) or to begin the lab with a seriously low quiz grade. Obviously I chose the first and left. That night I sobbed for an hour over how disheartened and stupid I felt. \nThis feeling, in combination with my general hatred for the subject at hand, bleeds into my daily life and leaves me frozen in anxiety most of the time, unable to study and just wanting to do things that distract me from the feeling. Even if I do need help with the material \u2014 and I do \u2014 I do not feel comfortable enough to approach him with questions due to his dismissive and disrespectful nature. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I am getting behind in my work and really becoming so disinterested which is causing me to even contemplate dropping out (but then, I worked so hard to get here and I\u2019m just going to rid myself of this grad school opportunity?) \n\nI\u2019m curious to know if anyone had a similar experience or any advice you all may have. I feel like I am at my wits end and I am not enjoying anything academic anymore. :(",

      "text": "When it comes to dropping out, personally I think that should only be a decision made by you, for your own personal reasons and not influenced by other people. If this man is an asshole, you dropping out isn't going to make him less of an asshole. Only consider dropping out if it's a decision that you personally feel comfortable with and you do not feel that you will come to regret. \n\nHow critical is this class to your degree program? In grad school, your grades don't matter as much as your research/publication record so I would consider doing enough to get the minimum grade you need to remain in good academic standing, finish the class, and see if there's a way for you to take the second part of the class with someone else. \n\nYou could also consider talking to your adviser about your troubles in the class and ask for their advice on how they would go about handling it. It shouldn't be a \"omg this professor is so mean\" conversation, but rather \"I am having a lot of trouble in Professor McPoopface's class and I am not used to his more aggressive style. Do you have any advice on how I might be able to work with this so I can be successful in the course?\". If Professor McPoopface is as much of an ass as you claim, other students probably also feel the same way, so a group of you could see about forming a study group together.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a totally different program but can fully relate. One of my profs can be brutal with the feedback and has clear favorites. For example, after our first rounds of clinical rotations, which was nerve wracking  as all hell, i got sternly told i did poorly and my anxiety made me rude. One of my classmates, however, got a personal phone call saying \u201ci know you were anxious but I\u2019m here for you\u201d \n\nThis same professor told me i was doing the worst in my class and i get confused about things no one else does so that\u2019s my fault.  Instead of being empathetic I\u2019m getting made to feel even worse than i already am about this semester and being offered zero support. \n\nI\u2019ve started to doubt my career choice and looking into alternatives and if any of my credits could transfer\u2026",

      "text": "I got called out by my professor (stochastic processes or something) in the middle of a lecture for being late in an aggressive way. \n\nMy Response: I cried the rest of the class but tried to hide it and then went to my universities counseling center and cried more. There were only 3 people in the class so I couldn\u2019t just sit a bit further back. I apologized after class about a week later. I don\u2019t know whether or not she hated me, but I kept going to class. \n\nHow I handled it: I kinda dissociated in order to cope which isn\u2019t great but I also tell myself I just have to be present in a specific location for 90 minutes and then it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Usually TAs grade homework so that might make it less stressful.",
