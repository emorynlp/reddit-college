  "text": "That's right, I actually enjoy grad school.  I like my advisor, he is helpful and nice and has high expectations, but nothing that is physically impossible to do.  I work 50+ hours a week, but you know what, because I enjoy the projects that I work on, and think that the science matters, it's not that big of a deal.  \n\nI live on my grad student stipend.  No, I don't have money coming out of my ears, but I have a decent apartment in a decent part of town, walking distance from school, and live with a roommate.  I'm not broke, I'm not taking out any loans, I don't eat a diet consisting of ramen noodles.  My fiance and I put almost a thousand dollars into savings each month to prepare for our wedding.  I have a social life, hang out with other grad students on a weekly basis, have fun and drink and watch football and whatnot.  \n\nI take a few days of vacation a year, nothing extravagant, but around the holidays I take a few days off and go see my family.  \n\nResearch is research, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes whole weeks are wasted in one experiment.  But I knew how research was getting in, and I deal with it.  My thesis committee is a helpful group of individuals who want me to succeed.  My advisor is well connected I have good job projects upon the completion of my degree.  My TAing takes up time, but overall I enjoy it, because I like teaching.  Most of my students aren't idiot grade-grubbers, and I even like some of them. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is not to belittle or make fun of the other opinions on this subreddit.  I just see so much negativity and depression on this subreddit, and people that come here that are not yet in grad school see it all the time.  There are people out there that enjoy, or for who it is at the very least, not a completely negative experience.  \n\ntl;dr  Grad school can be enjoyable if you know what you're getting into and have the desire to do it.

Screw the students education... take their money whilst getting more monies from the NSF!!!\n\nI don't even know why I wrote this.  I paid nothing for my undergradate degree (actually made money).  And now, I make a stipend going to graduate school.  But I still feel like its all BS.  They teach virtually no application in classes anymore... and then we use nothing learned from classes to do work in the lab.  The educational system needs to be reformatted.  I would say its broken.\n\nThat being said, I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE AT GRAD SCHOOL!!!!! Good luck, and maybe the grad school gods grant you a speedy PhD.",

My advisor once told me a PhD is 70% research and 30% leadership, so it is definitely important to strive for balance when in grad school. But the sad fact is that it can be brutal, things can go wrong horribly, and there are no general solutions to them all. I'd love to see more positive posts like this, it can be helpful for all of us. \n",

All that toil came to something and I now have a pretty unique qualification. ",

I had an overall good grad school experience with supportive mentors and no financial problems but I know other students who didn't/don't have these things through no fault of their own.  If your supervisor turns out to be horrible and your advisory committee turns out to not care your only option is to put up with being miserable or quit.  I also imagine that having a fiancee helps financially since I know almost no grad students who could afford to save $1000 a month on their own.  So I would change it to:\n\n>Grad school can be enjoyable if you know what you're getting into and have the desire to do it, and you have good support from those around you.\n\nUnfortunately that last part is largely out of your control.",

But you can't get to know someone by meeting them a few times like you can get to know them by working for them for a year or two.  First (second, and third) impressions are rarely someone's true self.

If you've got any reason to hesitate, take a step back and make sure you've got a compelling motivation for committing yourself to grad school.\n\nBy enrolling, you're dedicating a not-insignificant chunk of your mid-to-late 20s to rigorous studies within your field.  If you're not serious about those studies, waking up to work on them almost every day for years on end will leave you with no end of problems and misery.\n\nOn the other hand, grad school might be a good fit for you.  The decision whether to continue your studies or transition into a career is a very personal one.  Don't let yourself be pressured to go into grad school or avoid it entirely; do what's best for you.  Be sure you take the time to choose wisely because, if you don't, you risk filling a few years of your life with regrets.",
