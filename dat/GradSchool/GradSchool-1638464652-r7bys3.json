      "text": "idk about android but I used to print papers off with two pages to one sheet of paper, landscape style. This makes the text smaller but leaves a big margin in the middle of the page. You could also just scale down the text on the page. If you want to work digitally Instead of on paper, I think when you download a paper and go to the print options, you should be able to adjust the scale for the second option &/or choose 2 pages per sheet, and instead of printing there should be an option to save that formatting to a pdf.",
