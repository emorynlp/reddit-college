  "text": "I'm thinking about what I want to do post-grad school (I'm only in my 3rd year of my ~5 year PhD so I have time). I don't really like the idea of working at a university because I'm tired of being on a school campus all the time. I'm not too keen on the beaurocracy in academia, I don\u2019t mind the idea of doing research with students but I don't know if I'm down to be a thesis advisor just yet and not sure how I feel about being paid only through grants or soft money. \n\nThere are jobs in government agencies for the work I do, so that's my primary goal, but through my TAships, I've learned that I really do love teaching. I don't know of many researchers who are also teachers so I am interested in learning about the possibility of this. \n\nWould it be feasible to teach part time at a community college while being a full time researcher? I feel like that's my ideal job but I'm not interested in overworking myself.",

I'm actually a grad student in a Pathways Internship, so mentoring students while working as a government researcher is very much a thing.",
