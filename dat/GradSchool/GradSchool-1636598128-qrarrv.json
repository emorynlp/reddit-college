Even moved to finish remotely so I physically couldn't be pressured into doing more work in the lab. Your dissertation is now your A goal and your only goal, no matter what your PI says. You don't have to dedicate time to anything else (unless you have a TA position or such for your funding obviously)",

              "text": "Same thing happened to me. I ended up being the only one left when COVID started and suddenly I was in charge of 16 projects. I worked on those while I collected my dissertation, but put my foot down that I'd be done with lab work once I had my dissertation data. \n\nMy program has always had a policy that you can't have funding (TA or AI) if you don't live here. You have to be available in person. COVID changed that and suddenly it was acceptable. This fall they tried to go back on what they said and take my funding away, but I fought it with copies of written responses from them and a contract guaranteeing my funding. I'm turning down the possibility of funding for the spring because I should defend in January/February and I know if I have funding they'll drag it out til May.\n\nEdit: I read your other comments, and yes it is exploitative. It is 100% free labor for them. And they put you in a horrible position of not wanting to be abused but also not wanting to piss off the one person who decides you can graduate. I sympathize greatly - that was the majority of my PhD experience and I didn't know better until it was too late",

In some places it's an exam where you get grilled, in others your advisor only lets you defend if they think you're sufficiently ready and then it's just a formality.",
