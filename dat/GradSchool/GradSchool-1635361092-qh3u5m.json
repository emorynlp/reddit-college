  "text": "I'm nearly 30 and I am not sure if it's worth going back and starting medical school and doing that whole thing, just after I got my MPA. I'm excited about some of the prospects the MPA has given me but I also love science and helping people so I think I would like medicine as well. But it's a ton of fucking work and I just don't know what decision to make or if I would even get into medical school (applying now).",
