It\u2019s no wonder plagiarism is so rampant in academia. I\u2019ve never seen an undergraduate face penalties for plagiarism (in my department they\u2019re usually warned and allowed to rewrite, in some cases multiple times (repeat offenses) without penalty) and the grad student I know that plagiarized got promoted to being a journal manager since plagiarizing. \n\nIt\u2019s disheartening but I\u2019d say do your best to maintain the integrity and ethics of your own work and do so to the best of your ability in collaborative efforts. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can expect others to not plagiarize or learn anything from the experience of stealing others\u2019 work.",
