  "text": "Hello everyone, I'm looking forward to applying for the MA/MS in Economics program in Fall 22. I have created the first draft of my SOP. However, it's a bit long and I wish to make it concise. If anyone wants to take a look at it and suggest me how can I make it concise and improve it even further, I'd highly appreciate it. Thank you.",
