R's strength is its ability to handle matrices and data frames; if you do a lot of batch processing of multivariate data, R is probably better. But if it's more about basic scripting, Python is leagues ahead as far as general flow control goes. Honestly that goes back to what I said I did above: I used R for a matrix analysis, then had Python control the data input, output, and looping.\n\nAnother consideration is output. As others have mentioned here, ggplot2 is the gold standard for visualizing data output. Python has packages like matplotlib and apparently its own [ggplot](https://github.com/yhat/ggpy) (I just looked that up but have never used it; I actually might try it out sometime to see if it's any good), but I don't think they're quite as superb as ggplot2.

              "text": "You'll get a lot of differing opinions, but here's my two cents:\n\nSPSS is more of a 'point and click' software, which is fine if the researcher knows what analysis is being run, its assumptions, how missing data is handled, etc. But it is easy to be a few clicks away from violating a lot of statistical assumptions.\n\nR is open source, which is neat if you're a researcher who wants to implement their findings into a package and distribute it amongst other academics. The plotting software (ggplot) blows anything SPSS has out of the water. Many of the newer, cutting edge models are available in R rather than SPSS, one such example is Bayesian methods using the package Rstan. With SPSS one has to wait for them to release the newest update, and even then it can be suspect. \n\nAnother aspect R wins on is writing up results. Rmarkdown and its integration with LaTeX allows users to 'knit' documents into a pdf, completely bypassing Word. It's really helpful if you are writing formulas constantly. \n\nThere are other things when comparing the two softwares, but those are my thoughts. The learning curve is steeper with R, but with good reason. The possibilities for analysis are pretty much limitless, the flexibility is just worlds ahead of SPSS. ",
