If you set a time limit and consider it a mental health priority on your schedule, you won't feel as guilty about the time spent not writing. Plus, I had some of my best \"ah-ha!\" moments during those breaks because instead of trying to force my conscious mind to figure things out and never getting a break from my research, my subconscious figured things out while I got my much needed break. I've never been able to \"push through\" writer's block, but going out for a happy hour drink and appetizers with friends always made the words come a bit easier when I went back to writing after my break.",
