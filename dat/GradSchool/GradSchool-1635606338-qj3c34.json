  "text": "I'm applying for grad school and when I get to the gender portion...I freeze. I have been struggling a lot with my gender identity but I know it feels wrong putting \"female.\" What's even worse is most times all they have is \"other.\" My experiences have been that of a woman in stem but I don't identify that way (maybe nonbinary or agender). Should I still put \"female\" for more diversity/scholarship reasons? It only makes sense because they never ask for what the other is and I sure as hell don't want to be lumped in with \"male\" or a weird short straw of \"other.\"\n\nedit: I used to have x>1 upvotes and it is currently 0 - still fluctuating. This is why we are scared to make our gender identities public.The transphobia is really showing on this sub. Thanks for proving my concern. But to everyone commenting: I appreciate every one of your positive responses. It has been really helpful. <3",

      "text": "\"Other\" is awkward but it will definitely not be lumped in with \"male\". If they're envisioning their \"other\" category as outside the man/woman binary, then they're more likely to assume you're assigned female at birth, just because there are more famous AFAB non-binary people than AMAB. \n\nMarking F might feel icky if it's not your identity, but you're right that if there are gender-focused scholarships then your experience as a perceived-woman in STEM would make F most appropriate. Maybe your decision will be easier if you have more information about whether those opportunities exist, hence whether you actually need to indicate that experience. Can you get in touch with the grad director or someone on admissions committee?\n\nFinally, remember that demographics answers are rarely shared with the admissions committees in any hiring contexts, including grad school admissions. University HR is strongly motivated to enforce this restriction because it keeps their asses well covered against discrimination lawsuits. So even if you get admitted, your new department probably still won't know if you marked M or F, and you'll be free to assert your identity however feels true at that time.  You won't have to say \"on my application I marked F but now I'm NB\", because they won't know about the application gender. (unless you win some scholarship clearly \"for women\", I guess)",

The word \u201ctransgender\u201d is an umbrella term describing anyone who falls outside gender norms. This is a pretty weird criticism. Do you honestly believe that nonbinary and agender people are not subjected to the same bigotry as binary trans people? I don\u2019t know whether people downvoted this post because of transphobia or something else, but based on some of the comments here, it\u2019s not that unreasonable an assumption.\n\nAlso, OP not wanting to be lumped in with males most likely has nothing to do with \u201cdisdain\u201d for men. Would you want to be lumped in with a gender that you are not? Particularly when your actual gender identity is constantly belittled and called into question?\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think criticising OP for \u201ccheating\u201d by selecting female as their gender is warranted. The way I read this post, it\u2019s likely that OP is assigned female at birth and leaning towards identifying as nonbinary or agender, since they say \u201cMy experiences have been that of a woman in stem.\u201d It\u2019s about selecting the option (of the extremely limited options OP has to choose from) that best describes both their actual gender identity as of now and their lived experiences and hardships.\n\nI know to most cis people OP\u2019s question probably seems ridiculous, but I was in a pretty similar place a year ago, though for slightly different reasons: I\u2019d very recently realized I was a trans woman, but wasn\u2019t ready to out myself, so I had to select \u201cmale\u201d on all my applications. Both options felt like I was lying in some way. Again, I know it seems trivial, but try to be sympathetic to how uncertain, and probably frightening, a time this is for OP. I\u2019m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume your response isn\u2019t just thinly veiled reactionary transphobic bullshit. If it is then I guess I\u2019m wasting my time, but if not, I\u2019d urge you to think a little more critically about your initial reaction.",
