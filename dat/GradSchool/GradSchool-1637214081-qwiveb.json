  "text": "I emailed one of my letter writer a few days ago reminding them about the December 1st deadline and they haven\u2019t responded or started any of the letter submissions. With thanksgiving next week I am getting very anxious about their ability to submit my letter. \n\nIs this something I should be worried about? I\u2019ve spent too much time and money on this process for a professor with cold feet to ghost me and ruin my chances.",

That avoids this sort of situation. Alternative is to check in again early next week before holiday break starts or even try to swing by their office in person.",

Some cobble it together the day of.\n\nProfessors are no different. A gentle reminder a week before it's due is fine, but there is no need to stress about it until the due date.\n\nGood luck, OP! My fingers are crossed for you!",
