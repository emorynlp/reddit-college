      "text": "If you have 5 publications (in reputable journals), that will weigh much more than your GPA. Ensure you have good letters of rec from relevant supervisors/advisors. GRE is good but it is not as highly regarded in a grad application than your publications, research, and letters. These things directly explain your research ability, which is what a PhD is all about. If you're an excellent researcher, and you've demonstrated that, you will have a decent chance even with a subpar GPA.",
