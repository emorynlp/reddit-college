  "text": "My MLIS program is offered only in an accelerated online format. Courses last 7 weeks... Mind you, the regular semester is 14 weeks. All that material crammed into 7 weeks. I feel like I haven't learned shit, I'm more worried about completing the assignments and meeting deadlines than actually learning anything. I can barely absorb the information... Only reason I'm doing it is because it's free. \n\nNot to speak in hyperbole but I am losing my mind a bit... Just had to rant.",
