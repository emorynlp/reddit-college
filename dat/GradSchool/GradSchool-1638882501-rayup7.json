  "text": "dear comrades, i need some guidance.\n\ni want to conduct an online survey for my (hopefully) future PhD but i\u2019ve never done that before. right now i\u2019m writing the proposal and struggling with planning the survey on the very early stages. for example, planning the timeline, or how to distribute/promote the google doc to get as many responses as possible, etc.\n\ni guess i\u2019ll get a better understanding when i start but for now i want to have at least a vague idea of how to conduct a survey on your own.\n\nany advice, examples, recommendations?\n\nthanks!",
