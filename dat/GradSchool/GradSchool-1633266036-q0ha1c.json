  "text": "I just got accepted Friday to Carleton University for a MS program beginning the winter semester (January 22). I still have to hear from two other universities before I make my decision. \n\nHowever, I didn\u2019t receive any funding in my admissions offer. I then emailed the department admissions and they confirmed that I didn\u2019t receive any. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that some students (not at this school) didn\u2019t receive funding initially but emailed the department and was able to get it. Is this what I should do?",

Is there a Graduate Assistant group or union or anything?  \n\n\nOtherwise you have to decide if you want are willing to accept and enroll in a program that doesn't fund you.  This isn't unheard of for an MS, not that it's right of course.",
