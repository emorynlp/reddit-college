  "title:": "How to request a change in supervisor?",
  "text": "So I was wondering if anyone has ever went through the process of requesting a change in supervisor? I haven't had a good relationship with my supervisor and actually requested support from other university services back in April 2020, one month after I started, because my supervisor was often not turning up to meetings, scheduling them then forgetting, leaving me waiting an hour for a meeting then rescheduling it for me to turn up to the rescheduled one which he was then 30 minutes late to.\n\nAll of this stuff is easily overcame to be honest and seemed a bit redundant but without going on too much we dont have a good working relationship and to be honest if the decision came down to leaving and working elsewhere or continuing to work with him for the next 3 years its a relatively easy decision.\n\nHe can be hypercritical on everything - granted he is very intelligent and well respected and I don't mind the criticism on my work but there has never been a single positive, except from 2 weeks where he was off and I worked with another supervisor where he was impressed by the quality/quantity of work that I had completed while he was off.\n\nI swear ill finish my rant in a second - but criticizing work is one thing, it really gets to me when he criticizes things like writing my notes in a notepad, what time I go to sleep, I was criticized for wearing a shirt (no tie) to my interview with him because it was too formal - there are tons of other things like going on rants about world wars during meetings.\n\nBut yeah, to the point of my post - has anyone ever had a supervisor they just cannot get along with and needed to request a change?",

      "text": "I want to make this abundantly clear because people so often assume I am lying or don't know the truth: There is nothing wrong with changing advisors half-way through grad school. If you have a toxic advising relationship (you do), then do you think they are just going to change their tune when it comes time for them to write you a letter for a fellowship/job later? If you are working better with other advisors anyway, what's keeping you there? The low-quality and quantity of work you are outputting because you don't have support, or the demeaning and cruel criticisms?",
