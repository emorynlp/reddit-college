  "title:": "Need letters of recommendation but taking a long break before grad school: how does it work?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior at UCLA studying history. Eventually, I want to get a graduate degree in history and a lot of the programs I\u2019ve looked at require multiple letters of recommendation. I haven\u2019t made too many close connections with faculty (I\u2019m a transfer student so this is technically my first year on campus since remote learning took up my junior year) but I\u2019ve been trying hard in my last year. \n\nWhere my confusion lies is that I\u2019m not planning to apply to grad school for another two, maybe three, years. How should I go about asking for letters of recommendation? Would they even remember me after so much time? I know I have to ask while I\u2019m in undergrad but how do I reconnect to receive the letters when I need them?",

      "text": "If you do have a connection with a prof, ask them to write it and store it, digital space is cheap. \n\nAnd like the other poster has said, letters of rec from your manager or mentor from industry are valuable too, as long as they're related to the field... maybe one from your manager if it's not in the field (stating your work ethic) is ok, but multiple in an unrelated space wouldn't be good.",

          "text": "To add onto this: if you do decide to ask a professor later, when you reach out, remind them who you are and what you did with them (class you took, if you went to office hours regularly, etc). Be ready to provide supplementary materials such as your CV, personal statement, summary of what you did in their class/how you did.\n\nI am applying this cycle and graduated 2 years ago. I gave my undergrad PI and professor a heads up that I\u2019d ask them to write letters on my behalf before I graduated.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t have to necessarily get them from people from your school, what looks good are letters from people in the field. I took a few years off after undergrad and went to grad school for a completely different field, I got rec letters from my coworkers and a supervisor. Since you\u2019re taking time off, letters from high ranking coworkers/ superiors says a lot about your growth. \nI\u2019m in grad school for architecture and I got rec letters from two engineers at my job and my architect boss. It did the trick.",

      "text": "When I was in undergrad, my university had a service thru the career center that stored professors\u2019 letters of rec. It kept them confidential so sending them in the future wouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nI\u2019m in grad school after a 16 year break from academia, and did not use the service. But I had one professor I\u2019d kept in touch with over the years who still wrote a rec for me.",

      "text": "I took a 3-year break between undergrad and grad, but I stayed in contact with my profs and asked for letters when I needed them. My situation is different though - I was on campus all 4 years of undergrad at a much smaller school than UCLA so it was easy to make strong connections with faculty.\n\nAs another commenter mentioned, it's also okay if only 1 or 2 letters come from profs - on my apps, at least 1, maybe 2 of my recommenders were supervisors from the workforce.",
