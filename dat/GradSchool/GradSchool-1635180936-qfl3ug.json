  "title:": "My group is meeting too much to discuss and plan assignments and I feel that it is negatively affecting my ability to get work done.",
  "text": "I am in a professional graduate program where our cohort is put into the same groups across all classes for the duration of the semester. I work part time outside of class to pay the bills and want to prioritize networking and professional development as much as possible.\n\nI feel that my group is meeting much too often. We meet 3-4 times a week for meetings that tend to go over and hour and a half. We have a huge assignment coming up next week, and my group wants to meet Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. Nothing gets done during these meetings, with repeated information and a lot of socializing.\n\nI simply do not have time for this, but the rest of the team is adament about meeting this much. I'm afraid that if I bring this up with them they'll say that I'm not taking class or grades seriously, which I absolutely am. I just don't want to sacrifice grades in other classes or networking opportunities. \n\nIs it normal to spend this much time in group meeting in grad school?",

      "text": "Have you taught them meeting planning and how to work from an agenda at meetings? And how to keep each other updated on progress through email or some other communication platform? Have you taught them to make decisions on a consensus model, rather than feeling they have to argue vemanently, and extensively, based on ideals? \n\nHave you considered asking to be the group facilitator to help make this happen? You might not be the only one who feels like too much time is being spent meeting together.\n\nQuite often, when groups seem to meet too much, it's because they don't know how to productively work together. A lot of grad students have no professional outside experience. \n\nSo it's still the same kind of haphazard group work they did often through K through 12 and undergrad. And how to work together productively in groups is almost never taught in school, not even as an undergrad.",

              "text": "Unfortunately, academia encourages people to fight and argue for what they believe in. It doesn't do a lot to encourage the kind of compromise necessary to be productive in collaboration.\n\nWhat I like to explain is that consensus involves arriving at a decision based upon one that \"everyone can live with\" in order to make progress and move forward on the project. In other words, it doesn't have to be everyone's favorite solution. It often just has to be \"good enough.\"\n\nI also think this is where having an agenda for meetings makes a *huge* difference. An agenda with time allocated for various aspects. But you need someone to run the meeting to do that, to stop discussion before time runs out on an item and say we have to choose.\n\nAnd tell people that you have to stick to the time allocated for the meeting because you have other commitments.\n\nTo make a case for doing these things, you might need to point out how a lot of time was spent arguing and debating little decisions. And that time is not an unlimited resource, and that you're sure that everyone would like to be more efficient in their group work.",

      "text": "It depends on the scope and context of the project.\n\nJust going off of your brief description, the meetings sound excessive and wasteful. I never met with my groups more than twice a week with each meeting taking less than a couple of hours - even with the more challenging and strenuous group assessments.\n\nIf you're not making significant progress towards completing the assessments and your time is being wasted with chit-chat, then I'd recommend bringing this up to your group so you can work on a solution to be more efficient. You're the only person who can advocate for your time.",
