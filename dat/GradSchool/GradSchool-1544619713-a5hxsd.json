  "text": "The first semester of grad school is as good a time as any for health problems to crop up, right?\n\nLast night I was given an emergency appointment with a neurologist for this morning and have reason to believe that even after the appointment I will have quite a lot on my mind.\n\nThankfully I only have one final left but I\u2019m not too worried about that. I do, however, have a final paper for my mandatory research ethics course due that is worth 35% of my grade.\n\nI\u2019m prideful to a fault so it took a lot to e-mail my professors explaining some about my appointment today and that I might not be able to finish the final page or two and polish it all off by the due date. I sent them my paper in its current form, which is six out of eight pages...\n\nAnd they went above and beyond by granting me until January 31st. I don\u2019t even want to spend that long on it and hope to have it done by next week but it truly feels like such a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.\n\nOne of the hardest things for me in grad school is going to be learning to ask for help so I am very proud of myself for reaching out and extremely grateful that they responded so kindly.",

              "text": "It seems unusual that they would dismiss the positive seizure activity. I would tell you to get another opinion but it seems that you did so good job on that front. I have a negative EEG and have epilepsy, which is why I think it's freezing to dismiss a positive one. The only time an EEG is positive for me is when I'm actually having a seizure. That's how crazy it is and how normal things can look on paper.\n\nFour things by way of advice:\n\n1. You can get a graduate degree even if you have epilepsy. Do NOT let this start you. A diagnosis doesn't discount your intelligence.\n\n2. If a doctor tries to prescribe you a benzodine like clonazepam/Klonopin, or others in that group, tell them you'd prefer that as the nuclear option. They are highly addictive and hell to come off of. It's not worth it, especially because you might need to experiment with a few drugs in the beginning. You don't want withdrawal symptoms confusing whether the next med works. Also benzos are sedatives so it sucks with school. There are a lot of options that aren't benzos though, so don't let this scare you or anything. It's avoidable but a handful of doctors have prescribed them like candy so those of us dealing with that feel the need to warn. Some good drugs that people tend to try first are Keppra, Lamictal, and Vimpat among many others. If/when you get meds, never stop taking them suddenly. Do your best to set a timer or something to remember them.\n\n3. Try your best to regulate your sleep and drink a ton of water throughout the day. Exercise too if you can. This is the best thing you can do for yourself and it can reduce your risk of seizure. I graduated top of my grad class because I was able to manage my seizures and stay healthy.\n\n4. Write down your questions so you remember what to ask when you go to the doctor. Reading answers online can help and r/epilepsy is great but it's always best to ask a doctor when you can. Take notes for anything you might forget.\n\n\nIf I think of anything else I'll add it but feel free to PM any specific questions. Good luck with monitoring. It's never fun and I can totally relate. Bring a book if they let you!",

Called the nurse line and they told me to go to the emergency room. Not wanting to wait, I decided to go to the student health center on the following weekday. It turned into a full-blown ulcer. If untreated apparently they can cause blindness.\n\n6 weeks, $500 worth of co-pays, meds, and many types of eyedrops later, my eye is back to normal. **So yeah, moral of the story is to prioritize your health.

I told them that I know the material but it doesn't come out well on tests, and that during undergrad I had decided not to go to grad school just because I did so horribly on exams. But then I realized that wanting to learn something, and actually learning it, was worth more than the awfulness that is anything testing related. Both basically ended up saying they wished they didn't have to give tests, and that in the real world if you're an economist and can't figure out an econ problem you'd just ask your colleague down the hall.\n\nI guess I emphasized that I was trying and I was actually learning. I don't remember my exact words, but I did say things along the lines of \"tend to freeze up during tests\" and \"can't reproduce all the knowledge I have in a testing environment\". I do think profs in general realize that tests aren't real world environments, and that you can certainly be good at a subject but not do well on an exam.",
