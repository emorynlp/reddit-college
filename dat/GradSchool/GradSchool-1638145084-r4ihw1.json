  "text": "If you all need some simple stats here's a go-to. Hope it helps.\n\nThis was presented to graduate students in the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Toronto.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrEwz8r8Xc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrEwz8r8Xc)\n\nFirst, a general introduction to probability, assumptions of inference, and hypothesis testing. The second requirement is to perform the analyses, including managing the data using some statistical software.\n\nAt the vanguard of such software is the R statistical software [https://www.r-project.org/;](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWVHOVNHcG95V1ZFcWF5SDdsdXVFUFgwVk9YZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttYUZYVmQzQ1E4MkRaNTFqN2NjNXE4TXNqMW5UZ1BuZGhmZUk3SjUwQ3RFT24tLW5IZkdpczJ6T0t5dWdlU1FaOFJDVngxVUlrYWRnOVREZVhXaHNQaXk0VWN1dHVXWTRRWFBxS1ZKY0RvNTRyTjRlWQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.r-project.org%2F%3B)\u200b and its integrative environment Rstudio [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazB0NjQtTlZvRlp4cDZudWM0dzJfOTQyaEViQXxBQ3Jtc0tsY201bG5pbGltSWhWOVl2YUlvQlNQbk9Delg2bWVHRlluOGNQNUFqUlhqeEVBUEtwcHFNMDRjR2ZsZGV4YzVac0pzV050TzVGbElPdEN3MThyTGFLODFiRlJMOWdESkc5R0NOdW53SGZuMDAtRHBwaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rstudio.com%2F)\u200b.
