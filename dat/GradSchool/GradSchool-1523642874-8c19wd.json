He gave them a list of 20 questions or so, that didn't ask the kids to read the paper, persay, but helped them learn to identify useful information (how many people, significance of results, type of data, main question etc.) that should learn to glean from research.\n\nNeedless to say, I was really impressed! The kids in that class got a taste of academic research, but really got to see how experimental research is often just \"setting up a perfect world where you tamper with a/ variable/s and see what happens, and they also got to understand a bit how statistics and methods matter when accessing information. I think more education on critical thinking, and understanding that methods determine whether results are valid or questionable is what we need in education to help people avoid these sorts of silly conflations of facts and, personally, as such I think access to papers will help marginally teachers have resources to help teach students (especially secondary source type materials as well!)",

The most industrious ones just start their own blog or website and keep it on the down low.\n\nWorking in university press publishing, this was the most frustrating thing I came across. Sure you could buy a really interesting treatment on the history of air conditioning in the West for twenty five bucks - but most people didn't. You have popular sites like I Fucking Love Science which has some decent content, but could be so much better if academics were more involved with it.",

Academics are often reluctant to work with entrepreneurs or industry to commercialize their findings, or with policy professionals - if only to ensure that they get funding in the coming years. Somebody needs to do a better job of explaining all this STEM stuff to the suits in government who are funding it! (I know that's hard). fwiw, I think American academics do a better job of this than the rest of the world - which says more about the rest of the world than it does about American academics....",
