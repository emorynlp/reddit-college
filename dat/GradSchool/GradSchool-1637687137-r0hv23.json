      "text": "I recommend that you talk with your undergrad advisor and see which schools they recommend, or if that have colleagues that work at other universities that they can tell you to look at in more detail. A lot of it is doing research on your own and just going through many, many websites to see if your research interests are in alignment with a group at any particular university.",

      "text": "Yep, read articles and books, see where the authors teach. Read their footnotes to and repeat with the articles and books referenced there.\n\nLike the other commenter said, talk to your undergraduate advisor and professors to see if they have suggestions. \n\nI also had some luck with cold-emailing scholars whose work interested me. For the most part they said \"I don't have funding to bring on a grad student,\" or \"don't come to my school, it's not very good,\" and followed up with suggestions for other scholars whose work might interest me.",
