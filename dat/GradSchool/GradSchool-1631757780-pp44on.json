It's excellent training when the criticism is fair, and it sounds like yours is just doing his/her job. It will take a while, but try to learn to be open to the criticism instead of taking it personally.",

      "text": "Man if I had a nickel everytime my PI said something like that I wouldn't have needed the PhD in the first place. \nI couldn't make it through the title of a presentation before I got the \"wait why on Earth are you saying this\". And the \"it's like you're not even thinking.\" And let's not mention when I was writing my dissertation and I was told it was like I couldn't write anymore. It was awful and disheartening for years. And I consider my PI a good one, believe it or not! \nBut it was worth it when I had a beer with my PI and was commended for the work I had done and progress I made. And at the end of it all when my PI got up there and introduced me at my defense as the best student writer he'd ever had. This feedback is normal, for better or for worse, and so is feeling like a failure or an imposter. \nIt's horribly difficult, and it took everything for me to get through the worst of times, but at the end of it all, I'm glad for it. It made me a better scientist, academic, thinker, problem solver, and person. I became more confident in myself (ironic how that works) so that I was ready to take on anything, and grew a skin so thick I don't know that anything will ever phase me professionally again. It made me who I am, brought me to where I am (NOT academia lol), and I'm glad for it. \nJust try to hang in there, learn from it, and believe that things can get better. Best of luck :)",

              "text": "Don't be nervous! I was coddled too prior to grad school and I truly think that I needed that kind of experience to be successful and end up where I am now. Just take everything as a learning experience, really listen and learn from your feed back, and try not to take it personally - that last part was the most difficult for me. Once I sort of separate the personal from the professional, that's when I really started to grow. And also go in with an open mind - I was definitely overconfident based on my previous experience and that was part of my adjustment. Every PI is different too, so  every experience is different and this may not be your experience at all! But if it is, at least for me, it was absolutely worth it. Best of luck! :)",
