  "text": "This is my first ever grad school interview and I cannot express how nervous I am. It\u2019s for a marriage and family therapy doctorate program and it\u2019s being done over zoom. According to the the person I\u2019ve been talking to in admissions, it\u2019s an hour long group interview and two half hour 1 on 1 interviews with faculty. \n\nAHHH! What should I expect, if anyone has gone through this recently? I have some questions I\u2019ve prepared and I have some notes about why I want to go into the field and the research some professors are doing.",
