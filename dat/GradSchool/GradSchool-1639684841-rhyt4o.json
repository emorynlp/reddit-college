  "title:": "When to start looking for a postdoc?",
  "text": "I'm a 4th year PhD student, anticipated graduation Spring 2023. I've been advised by a postdoc and some professors that it's \"never too early\" to start reaching out to potential postdoc PIs and offer to collaborate on a grant where you write your salary in, etc.\n\nI feel like 18mo in advance is way too soon to reach out. I'm hoping to write an NSF Postdoc Fellowship next year, which are due around December so I was thinking of reaching out after next semester. Am I crazy? When did you start to seriously look for a postdoc?",

Few follow up/interviews later and I\u2019m submitting for fellowships in Jan 2021 with those people. I had an academic/uni center postdoc interview in between all that in the fall that I got 2nd and no offer from. \n\nAlso consult with your PI. If you\u2019re trying to work with people they know, hopefully they can provide a more ideal timeline. If not they will have some general guidance I would hope",

      "text": "This is a good time if you want to write a grant proposal with the new PI to support your postdoc. A postdoc mentor that may be ideal for you probably doesn't have the money sitting around.  But they could be amenable to being PI on a grant proposal that you write together now. Or they might incude your funding in a proposal they are working on. You may not get funded, but you will learn a lot from that experience as well.",
