  "text": "I had a horrendous week where I couldn't get out of bed. I'm not sure if I clear the bar for clinical depression or if I'm simply lazy (or both). \n\nLuckily, I managed to pick myself back up but I realize that this state may not last forever. And so I decided to invest in myself to help me manage the days where I can't find the motivation to get any work done (both in my lab life, and my private life). I will eventually see a professional but there's a lot of stigma concerning mental health \n\nTell me, r/GradSchool, how do you manage these depressive episodes?",

      "text": "I'm not a mental health professional, have been through something similar myself, and have helped a few members of my cohort through similar circumstances.\n\nSpeak to a professional as soon as able, get a diagnosis, speak to your PI or graduate co-ordinator.  Be open about it to them, take a break if you have to, or a leave of absence if needed. You are absolutely not alone in this, there is nothing to feel ashamed or 'weak' about. Treatment is usually some combination of therapy and/or medication. \n\nGet plenty of sleep, eat and drink properly. Try and get some structure in your life with small goals, making yourself  breakfast, taking a shower and shaving, going to the gym for a little while, or at the very least go for a walk. Exercise and sunshine help keep depressive symptoms at bay, so you're going to have to force yourself to do a little exercise each day, and go outside, even if you dont feel like it. Write down your thoughts and feelings in a little notebook, it will help you keep track of patterns, and may help you avoid triggers. You could also try [grounding techniques](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques) and [square breathing (also called box breathing)](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing).\n\nHope you feel better soon.",

For her, it's usually best to take the day off and stay at home - removes the pressure to get anything done and often she'll end up doing some reading/writing in the late afternoon anyways.",

Something cool I recently read is Tom Geue's *Author Unknown* (2019) - it's a very playful book and not all his interpretations are equally plausible, but there's some fresh ideas in there.\n\nWith pronunciations that don't observe vowel length you make reading verse needlessly difficult for yourself - but imho you should ultimately use whatever pronunciation you feel the most comfortable with while maintaining an intellectual awareness of the pronunciation commonly used at the time/place where the text you're reading originated (otherwise, you'll miss out on soundplay).",

      "text": "This is a tough one!! A prof for one of my classes suggested making a mental wellness plan for the semester. So I started with making a schedule that incorporates my feel-good activities. But I don\u2019t always stick to it because of my depressive episodes, so I made some activities non-negotiable to ensure I do them each week no matter what I\u2019m feeling. I also have a checklist that I go through when I\u2019m distracted or feel like I\u2019m slipping into my depressive episode (it\u2019s based on what my red flags are). I also made a plan for when things are really bad - which is to just take the day off and do activities that help me, or I do nothing and make sure to be self-compassionate, and accept that it is what it is. I found that when I try to work, and I am not able to, it makes me feel worse and I\u2019d have my episode for longer. When I accept it\u2019s happening, and I  steer into it without being hard on myself, I find that to be much more helpful. Sometimes I remind my self that something is better than nothing, so even 5,10, or 20 min of work is better than 0, but regardless of what I get done or don\u2019t get done, it\u2019s okay, because there\u2019s always tomorrow. \n\nI try to do more work when I\u2019m feeling better so that when I have my episodes I don\u2019t fall to far behind. I also agree with other commenters that counselling is a good idea. I would also suggest talking to your doctor about medication if you aren\u2019t already on it, and are open to it. I think one thing I\u2019ve come to accept is that there are some of us whose brain chemistry is just fundamentally different, thus we struggle with these bouts of depression. It\u2019s also something we can learn to work with.",

I've seen three different ones over the pandemic. Enough sleep and drinking enough water (2-3L) seem trivial but they are super important! I was having brain fog from dehydration. Schedule times of uninterrupted, planned work sessions with goals, with your favourite music that gets you hyped. Be kind to yourself and accept there will be bad days.

I find that making small, incremental changes to my routine can help. To start with, just go for a walk every morning. Any length. Get up, get dressed, put on your shoes, and walk to the end of the block. If you're feeling like shit, then head home and give yourself credit for making a first step. If you're feeling good, walk for a little while longer.\n\nSame with your diet. Start small. Just eat your normal breakfast, but have a piece of fruit with it. Do the same for dinner - whatever you'd normally have, with some veggies on the side. Even just some raw carrot or bell pepper or something.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to stick to this stuff, no only when things get tough but also when you're feeling good. Sometimes I find it hard to make the time to exercise because I'm actually being productive and getting shit done, but then I end up just not exercising for a couple of weeks and - BAM - depression is back.\n\nObviously there is more to it than that, and medication and therapy can be great tools for a lot of people, but they also involve a lot of trial and error and often a significant expense, so I always recommend that people start with diet and exercise.",

      "text": "I'm so sorry this is happening for you, and I can empathize. Of the six years I spent on my PhD, five of them were spent oscillating between crippling depression and then uncontrollable anxiety. I saw a therapist, weekly, and tried multiple medication combinations until we found what worked for me. The sooner you seek professional help, the sooner you can get back on the road you need to be on. It might be talk therapy, it might be meds, it might be both. But no one has to know except you and your therapist. \n\nI was so ashamed of my depression and anxiety that I did everything I could to hide it, until I had a rotation student I was training come to me in tears about how hard of a time she was having. As a later stage graduate student, I realized I had a responsibility to be honest with myself and those around me. It's okay to need help. I volunteered on multiple mental health panels to educate younger cohorts on how to get through tough periods like this, and how to navigate our university's mental health resources. Grad school is difficult. Grad school during a pandemic, well that seems nearly impossible. There's probably people in your own program who are struggling. I know 3 out of 5 total in my year and program had to seek out help.\n\nI actually adopted a dog while in school. I spent a long time thinking about it before making such a big decision, but it really did help get me through to the end of my program. He helped keep me grounded in reality, and I was forced to get fresh air and light exercise everyday with him. \n\nWhen my anxiety and depression began to manifest in physical symptoms and drastically affecting my work, I made the decision to tell my PI about it as well as my specific plans for managing the situation. Only you can decide if or when you would want to disclose that information. It was the right call for me, though.",
