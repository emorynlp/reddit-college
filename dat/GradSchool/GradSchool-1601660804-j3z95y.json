Even just scales. I remember how happy it used to make me to play, and it still does. \n3. Blue light glasses came in a few days ago. I wear them a lot and it's been helping me feel less fatigued when I'm online all day.",

Unfortunately my boss doesn't really take lunch breaks, so by default...our lab doesn't really do food breaks on collection days :(. Folks, don't let missing meals be a normal thing. It's a really bad habit to get into. Obviously yes, intermittent fasting works to loose weight, and when you plan it right is very helpful.

Nothing like burying your face between their ears on a stressful day, either. \n\nI take the dogs on a walk with a podcast when I'm working at home and need the break. At school/in the lab, I try to take a walk outside. Moving my legs really helps reset me.

It helps that my PI has kids and my postdoc has a dog, so when I say \"I'm gonna run home during this incubation to let the dogs out\" it's a total non-issue which keeps it from being very stressful. My parents are also close-ish and dog people, so weekends away or big days (i.e. the 22 hour straight day I spent in the mouse room) are possible because they're happy to occasionally dog-sit (though I have 4 people literally dying to get the chance to pet sit, so I doubt it'd be hard to find friends to help out for most people). \n\nI haven't found caring for them, vet issues or anything like that adds much stress for me.  At the very least, it feels like 'real' stress, I guess? Gives me something very tangible to direct my energy towards. Granted, I've always owned pets and been through the ringer with them, so I'm financially and mentally prepped for most situations. \n\nFWIW, I have found the added \"stresses\" of a dog totally outweighed by the benefits they bring me both literally (exercise, time management) and in the reminders to slow down and take care of myself. Couldn't picture my life without them. Totally recommend getting *something* like plants, fish, etc. to give you something to take care of and focus on.",
