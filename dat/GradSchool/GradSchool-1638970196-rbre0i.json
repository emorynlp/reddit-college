  "title:": "How to stay focused and productive when working from home?",
  "text": "Hello, first year PhD student here. I am in a bit of a conundrum: My office is kind of annoying to get to, and I would like to WFH for covid reasons. However, I find I am less productive when it comes to non-deadline things when working from home. \n\nI previously worked in industry, and when my job became WFH, I had no dropoff in productivity. However, I had fairly constant deadlines so that was a key difference. \n\n**Given that a lot of research is inherently open-ended -- and hence unlikely to be pressing deadlines for the things that need doing -- what are some tips for minimizing distraction and maximizing productivity while working from home?**",

      "text": "Reduce the ambiguity in your tasks. Take a half hour in the morning to write down a detailed list of what you need to get done and how you will get it done. Take another half hour in the evening to write down what you did. If writing this takes too long then you can record yourself while on a walk or while waiting for coffee to brew. This process reduces the open-ended nature of research and provides some deadlines. It also gives you notes to look back on!\n\nAlso don't be too hard on yourself. I feel most people don't expect to work a full 8 hours straight at work but somehow they put that standard on themselves when working from home. Take water breaks, call up a friend midday, or spend 15 minutes reading a book. Those small breaks are necessary and not really lost time.",

          "text": "I looked into Forest. I ended up going with an app called Flow. And to make sure I would feel dumb\\* if I did not use it, I actually paid (!) $20 for lifetime license to the pro version. \n\nIt is essentially a Pomodoro app on steroids. In addition to the Pomodoro aspect, during the time you are working, you can configure it to block websites and apps (also works on iPhone). There are some other features too. But I realized that this combination -- Pomodoro + Blocking -- is incredibly effective for me. Today and yesterday I was very productive.   \n\n\n\\*To any econs out there, I recognize this is a sunk cost fallacy; whether I use it or not, I already paid. But what can I say? It worked as a commitment device.",

      "text": "I second all the previous comments, and also suggest trying the pomodoro technique for time management. Basically you work in 25 minutes intervals with a 5 min break between, and periodically take a longer 15 minute break. https://pomofocus.io/ is a nice online timer for this.\n\nLast year when I worked from home full time, I found this really useful for forcing myself to work sometimes. It was easier to focus for 25 minutes at a time knowing I\u2019d get a little break at the end. It\u2019s great for enforcing both focus and work breaks.",

      "text": "Oh my gosh I feel this one so hard.\n\nI think the best advice I can give... as someone still trying to figure this out after years of it... is to have other goals that need to be met at home that take priority as well. Whether it be fitness goals, chores, side projects, skill building, socializing, self-care, or whatever, having other explicitly articulated goals that DON'T get sidelined for your thesis. Short-term deviations are okay, but in terms of a lifestyle, research can be all-consuming.\n\nThe logic for me is that if you have other obligations to meet, and you successfully meet them, it actually builds momentum and reinforces your focus to achieve other goals. If you are focused on a single goal, not only are you constantly feeling drained because it takes so much work and time to achieve, but when you do actually achieve it, you feel like you have wasted your time in doing so. But if you are getting several things done, suddenly your life feels uber productive and you can actually enjoy the benefits of not having a commute or having access to your kitchen at any time. \n\nPut some effort into making a workspace you love (or can tolerate) and give yourself a few daily goals that ensure you're have some momentum when the drudge-work hits.",

      "text": "As much as we would not like it, it is impossible to work at home as productively as in the office. The advice that you may hear is very commonplace: this is a comfortable workplace, eat on schedule, leave all household chores to a more suitable place. However, you yourself said that you did not experience a drop in productivity while you had constant deadlines. Well, you should think about the system of self-government, try on the role of a boss, and you command yourself :) of course, everything is not so simple, and research does not have clear deadlines, but you need to set yourself very clear goals for very realistic terms if you want to be productive. Try small and gradually demand more of yourself.\n\nI have a subreddit where you can find out more or ask your question. please join \u0433 / grademiners\\_essay\\_",
