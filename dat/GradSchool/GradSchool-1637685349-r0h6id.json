  "title:": "Is it too late to get out of this hole?",
  "text": "I'm mid-way through my Ph.D., after multiple delays (either personal issues coming up or my supervisor encouraging me to take more time), I am going to be taking my candidacy exam almost 1.5 years later than I should have (it's in 2 months). I feel so intensely stupid all the time, I've been struggling to write, struggling to keep up with the literature, struggling to bounce back after small mistakes and research setbacks, constantly prioritizing the wrong things and getting stuck on stupid details, and then forgetting what I should be doing. I'm in therapy, which has helped, but the futility I feel after every single meeting with my supervisor makes me wonder whether I should even be here. And he's a pretty good boss, so it's not a toxic work environment issue. It's too late to fix certain mistakes (being mentally checked out, not learning certain skills earlier, etc) but now I'm facing this big milestone and I'm not even sure I'll be able to pull it off. Has anyone been in my position? Is it possible to turn things around? Or have I messed up beyond repair?",

      "text": "All I can say to you is that I\u2019ve been in a very similar position. I wrote my exams much later than most of my cohort for a number of reasons. I\u2019m just starting my research proposal while others are on their dissertations already. I\u2019m probably not in the best position in that case to give you advice, but personally I\u2019m maintaining the belief that I can pull it together. People get tripped up at different points along the PhD timeline (especially when it comes to writing the diss) so it\u2019s unlucky for us that we lost that momentum early on, but it doesn\u2019t have to determine the rest of our degrees. I know some people who are now profs in my department who defended their diss much much later (far beyond the 6 year mark). I guess the key is not to compare ourselves to where others are, can\u2019t say I\u2019ve mastered it myself though. If you ever want to chat you can DM me!",

      "text": "My qualification is in three weeks. I feel exactly the same as you. I kid you not, I felt like someone was describing me. I have never felt depressed in my life and with the pandemic and the Ph.D., I feel stupid, and that I do not belong in academia. Not only that, but I can't see the importance of my work, I feel like everything has to be so difficult and laborious. I wish us luck, I am in therapy as well, my blood pressure shot up, and now I am on antidepressants and beta-blockers. Fun fun. I am too young to have high blood pressure.",

      "text": "You can definitely turn things around! Grad school is a unique journey for everyone and there is no set path imho.  I just switched labs Monday to a new place (I am 2 years in) and I already feel so much better about life. Even though I have to restart a new project I know I will be way more interested in it and it's better for my PhD. Just because it is a non-traditional path doesn't make it negative, don't beat yourself up and focus on the positive is really the only way to get out of mental troughs, and therapy of course. (Which you said you are already doing)",
