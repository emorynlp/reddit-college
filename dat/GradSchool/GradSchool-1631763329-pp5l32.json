  "text": "I graduate undergrad in the fall and start grad in the winter. I registered to retake a class to increase my gpa a bit to be a better prospect for grad school. Should I drop that class since I\u2019ve already been accepted into the program that I wanted? I would also be less than full time if I do. \n\nThanks for any responses.",

      "text": "There are three reasons that I can think of for keeping the class:\n\n-you need to be full time for financial aid reasons\n\n-you\u2019ll drop below the minimum gpa requirement for your grad program if you don\u2019t retake the class\n\n-you\u2019re planning to get a PhD and your undergrad gpa will be too low without retaking the class\n\nIf none of those apply, go ahead and drop it.",
