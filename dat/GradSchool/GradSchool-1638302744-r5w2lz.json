  "text": "I graduated from undergrad with a degree in Aerospace engineering, not doing great GPA-wise (2.5ish) up until my final year, where I got around a 4.0. Last semester I was thinking about doing research work which usually needs at least a masters degree. After talking to some graduate program directors, I was told to go through the nondegree program and show I can do well in masters-level courses and then reapply, which should be a sure-fire way to get admitted into the masters program. However, after trying out courses, I\u2019m not sure if grad school is for me, so I\u2019m thinking to apply for a job. I definitely think I\u2019ll get a 3.0+ this semester in these grad-level classes regardless. \n\nSo my question is, when I\u2019m applying to entry level engineering jobs, what GPA/course info should I disclose on my resume? Should I mention my final undergrad year GPA? Should I mention my nondegree courses and the GPA I get from them? Or should I keep any GPA info under wraps?",

      "text": "Aerospace-specific advice:\n\nTypically if you don't put your undergrad GPA then companies auto-deny you. They basically assume the worst.\n\nI think it's a positive to have started grad school classes and done ok, so personally I would keep both gpas on there but you probably can leave off all your grad stuff if you wanted. They will probably find out when you send them your transcript or they ask \"so what did you do after graduating?\" though.\n\nAnd if you do decide to mention grad classes, also put your grad GPA (i.e. in addition to your undergrad GPA). If you mention your grad stuff you must also put your grad gpa or they will again assume the worst",

          "text": "Hmm okay that makes sense. So put down my ~2.75 GPA from undergrad and ~3 GPA from grad classes. How would I be able to show my improvement in the final year of undergrad? And would only completing one semester of grad classes look bad to employers?",
