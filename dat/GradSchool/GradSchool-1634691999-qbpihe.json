  "title:": "I have 7 hours to learn what a Lit Review is, how to write a Lit Review, and then write a Lit Review (plus finding/reading 6 articles that will be included in the Lit Review). Any tips or things to keep in mind to do this as efficiently as possible?",
  "text": "All potential responses will be neither selfishly expected from internet strangers nor will any helpful responses be taken for granted, and I will personally bless anyone that offers advice from their experiences with positive karma (the universal kind, not the reddit kind -- well, maybe the reddit kind, too). Unless your advice is to tell me to start my assignments sooner, in which case I will neutrally ignore you -- and you will receive no universal positive karma from me (although I will refrain from directing negative karma for pointing out the obvious).\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor transparency's sake, I want you all to know that I did in fact NOT manage to finish and submit my literature review by my deadline, partly because after a certain point I decided I would rather submit a fully polished paper than one that would be rushed and probably miss key elements that my professor is looking for. Please don't worry about me, though -- the penalty for a late submission is rather minor and might be waived if I'm lucky.\n\nWho knew that learning and dissecting the entire body of research in a field and finding exactly what is directly pertinent to my niche research topic would be so time consuming?\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to this, you all definitely helped a ton, even if I did fail to bring home the glory to r/GradSchool with the buzzer-beating, game-winning shot. But I'm pretty confident that in the end my review will be top-tier in the class thanks to you all!",

Sorry, hopefully someone else can better explain it.\n\nIf I were writing one within a short period of time I would: \n\n1) Create a working outline for the topic you have chosen (the outline can change the further into the literature you get); \n\n2) Go through any literature you have already compiled or start grabbing papers online (I use web of science) and organize your references within your outline under each section that you have chosen;\n\n3) When organizing, focus on abstracts, you can get deeper into discussion/conclusions later;\n\n4) Revise your outline as needed and start summarizing the findings of each paper within each section. Watch out for using direct quotes as placeholders. If you're in a rush you might leave it in on accident;\n\n5) As you go through the papers more in depth you'll notice citations for other papers that may also be related to your topic, track those down and add in as needed.\n\nOkay, that's my best advice. Disregard it if anyone posts better advice. But you can at least use it as a rough guide if nothing else.",

          "text": "I really like this, but one thing I would add to this is that the best lit reviews will often revisit previously reported results in light of new information. Academic papers often present phenomena without satisfactorily explaining them, which can occur because a) the authors did not provide a credible reason, b) the technology required to further test the research question was unavailable or inaccessible, or c) further clarification fell outside the scope of their project and/or funding. From time to time, other members of the field unwittingly resolve these tensions without understanding the problem well enough to discuss the implications of their results. Not surprisingly, it often takes expertise, cultivated over years or decades, to appreciate the partially interconnected nature of the research that has accumulated over the years and determine that results in paper X published last year shed light on result Y published Z years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all to say that influential reviews should do everything you say they should do, but whenever possible they should also identify and discuss instances where data initially presented as supporting one thing can also be used to answer other questions of interest.",

Once you are done, you can automatically export the citations formatted to a variety of different formats and just paste that into your references page. \n\nWeb of Science is also good for seeing which articles cite each other. I use it frequently. Zotero, iirc, also has a plugin/extension that lets you see how many papers cite, support, or contradict the one you have. That can be helpful if you are trying to compare or contrast. \n\nI also strongly recommend starting with an outline. The more comprehensive the better.

      "text": "Find a few relevant papers on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu). Download and print them. Highlight the important parts and write notes on the side. Once you read all (you can skim the abstract and results as others said, to see if they are actually relevant before committing to reading), grab a piece of paper and write 3-4 sentences about every paper. See if you have a full picture.\n\nNow read the bibliography/references section of all your papers and see which papers cited seem very relevant or very important. Try to find those papers or books online (libgen and SciHub will get you free versions), and do the same process with them. Sometimes I even put cross-postits (different colours help) and stick them on papers that refer to each other or are somehow connected.\n\nNow you know a bunch of papers. Add them all to Zotero/Mendely as someone suggested.\n\nTry to put the papers read and taken notes of in a sensible order. What makes more sense? A sort of chronological order? Going from a wide topic to a super narrow topic? \n\nGoing based on main finding and arguments and their counter arguments? Only you know this part.\n\nDo all papers have a similar general outcome?\n\nHow well each paper relates to your narrow field of study?\n\nYour lit review should look like a funnel. Talk about the findings in the bigger, more general area, talk about theories people used to research this topic. Talk about early successes. Talk about how their research questions evolved, perhaps. Now start narrowing down your topic. By the end of the lit review you will hopefully reach a very very narrow topic and a gap in the literature. Is there something no one has dealt with? Is there something the opinions and findings are extremely contradicting? Guide the reader to see that your research is relevant and point it out where is its place in the literature.\n\nThe golden rule should be that you can stop researching the literature when you reached thematic saturation, that is, papers don't and can't tell you anything new anymore but they become repetitive. Of course this is hard to know since theoretically you can never know when you find something contradicting in your next paper... Luckily, the internet helps a lot in this. Or keeping up with the best journals in your field.\n\nI hope this helps \u2665",

They do a broad lit review of a topic, the current trends, and future directions. They are a gold mine of sources. I also really like survey papers because a decently written one will be organized by sub-topic, which usually helps me clarify what\u2019s important to cover. I sometimes even use their organization as inspiration for my own lit review. \n\nFrom a survey paper, I\u2019ll highlight the relevant / interesting papers. I\u2019ll then do the tree search from there. Pull papers they cited and papers that cited them. The latter is really easy to find from Google scholar.",

But you may check if your school gives you the paid version as part of your tuition. Mine does, and it allows you to have more space as well as sharing folders with others.
