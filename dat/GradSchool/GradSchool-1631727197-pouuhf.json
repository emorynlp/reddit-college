  "title:": "Second Week and I Feel Like I'm Drowning",
  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm on my second week of being in an MA program now, three classes and I'm a TA as well (I don't teach, but I grade a lot). This is my first semester, and I just feel so behind. All the time. My readings are heavy, my assignments are long, and I somehow have to fit my TA responsibilities in there, too. I have a family as well, and I feel awful that I can't spend nearly as much time with them as I used to. On top of that, we have a very sick dog that I have to help care for, which takes time as well. I know people say it gets better, but with this much on your plate, how do you just suck it up and keep going?",

      "text": "The first semester tends to be incredibly rough no matter what program you are in. There's always more work for classes, for TAing, for research, and just for keeping your head above water than you've ever had before.\n\nWhat I did, and what saved me early, was get organized and seriously chop down my responsibilities at home. I accepted some help in the form of babysitting too.\n\nWe would pick a weekend and make a bunch of one pot meals to prep and freeze which took care of a lot of dinners. We also had the slow cooker working at least once, if not twice a week. The kiddos were assigned chores and now everyone does their own laundry and dishes are on a rotation.\n\nI used a citation manager to keep track of my readings and notes. I have dedicated notebooks for each class and obsessively organized computer files. It was not easy and I could not do all the fun social things, including many of the dept functions, but I did finish.\n\nIt will get better. Lean a little on family and friends, you deserve to lean a little too.",

      "text": "Sounds like grad school. You aren't there to spend time with your family you are there to earn a degree that will enable you to spend time with your family.\n\nYou learn to sleep faster....\n\nYou get used to it. Have you had 12 hour days yet? That's the norm. 16 hour days too....sleep faster.. (by that I mean you learn to manage your time better..... well, shit, and less sleep too.)",

      "text": "I\u2019ve only been in science programs, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for an MA program, but for me it is all about prioritizing and deciding which things deserve my best, and which don\u2019t. Research is the bread and butter of what I do, so I do my best at that whenever possible. Classes are mildly important, but as long as I learn what I need and get a passing grade, it isn\u2019t meaningful for me to put extra effort into assignments to go above and beyond. So, I don\u2019t. I am finding that in order to strike a good balance in grad school, you need to figure out what to care more about and what to care less about, then spend your time accordingly.\n\nI think family deserves to be pretty high up that list, by the way :)",

          "text": "Thanks for responding! I agree about family; it's been a rough start with our dog getting ill this year, too. I'm not very good at skimming yet either, and that's something I really have to work on. As for the MA program, it's sociology, so lots of fun things in terms of research methodology and design right now, with some theory. Probably standard for most research based degrees, I suppose.",

      "text": "It's true though, it will get better. Beginnings are always tough. You don't need to read everything, you can skim (learning to do that takes some practice though). TA responsibilities will get easier as you find the rhythm for doing everything. I'm sorry about your doggy :( I hope he gets better. Everyone starting grad school struggles with finding time and then it gets easier and easier, really, don't give up.",
