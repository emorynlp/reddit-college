  "text": "Can somebody give me the rundown of a full time MSW program? I understand that it\u2019s 60 units for the degree. I\u2019ve also looked at a lot of programs to kind of get an idea but I would like to hear it from different people. \n\nAre the programs usually 4-5 classes a semester? \n\nAre they homework heavy for all programs or does it depend? I ask this question because as a student in a BA program right now. I may have classes that are not homework heavy but discussions, class engagement and reading the text are a must! \n\nWhen internships start, will there still be a class schedule of 4-5 classes? \n\nWith full time programs how is the school-life balance? \n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest struggle people experienced in a MSW program?",

      "text": "Mine is 4 classes a semester. In the fall and spring semesters, one class is field seminar... we just all talk about our practicums, homework includes time sheets, learning plans, and a case presentation. We typically have one class that resembles undergrad (lots of reading, weekly quizzes, exams, and a couple papers). The other classes are laid back (be ready to read and write but no exams). We do policy analysis, needs assessments, grant writing, and other course specific work. The work is hard BUT if you are serious about the degree, I find it easier than undergrad in the sense that we are learning about concepts we are passionate about. Not every program is the same though so do your research on what you want from a program (online vs face to face, full vs part time, etc) and on the region you wish to be in. Good luck!",

          "text": "School life balance is doable for my progam too. I will say, most of my class quit their regular employment between first and second year. I have a paid internship so it helps. The professors are good about encouraging self-care, I think the past couple of years has really highlighted this area. I have 4 kids and have managed a 3.83 gpa thus far.",

Working full time isn\u2019t really doable for 2 year full time students but people in something called the OYR program do their internship hours at their full time job.",
