  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD student in a biological sciences program. I\u2019ve gotten through my quals and have been in my lab for a few years now. During my first two years in lab, I never participated much in lab meetings, mainly because I didn\u2019t feel I had much to contribute and I\u2019m quite shy. \n\nI\u2019ve started pushing myself to participate (make suggestions and ask questions) but I\u2019ve been feeling really dismissed. Others will make suggestions and then I will, and my commentary is met with complete silence. Like no acknowledgment whatsoever. This has happened several times. Or they immediately dismiss it, only to come to a similar conclusion 15 minutes later. To top it off, one of my advisors (I have two) was visibly nodding off during one of my most recent presentations. \n\nAs someone who has struggled their whole life to speak up, this has really been eating away at me recently. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I never want to speak in a meeting again because I feel like my voice isn\u2019t valued and I always walk away upset.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way/have suggestions to try to improve?",

      "text": "Absolutely, I've often had this experience when first joining a lab/program/group. People will often passing preliminary judgment of you based on your gender, race/ethnicity, or quiet demeanor. They will only come to respect and appreciate you over time once they get to know you more. \n\nWhat helps for me is realizing that their acceptance and opinions of you do not matter. You work on your science and build your own skills, which is what you came to grad school for. Presumably you spoke up to pass along helpful tips to the speaker. If it's dismissed, then it's not your loss it's theirs.",
