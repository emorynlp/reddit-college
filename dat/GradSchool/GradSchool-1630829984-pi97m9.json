  "text": "So yeah. I\u2019m a complete fish out of water.\n\nI\u2019m about 10 years older then the average student, military background and I\u2019m male. I probably sound like a pompous asshole when I say this but it\u2019s obvious from the conversations I\u2019ve had with my fellow students that they all come from a lot of money and a pretty nice background. In general the entire field I entered tends to skew that way. I find myself getting hung up about the consistent talk about how we need diversity in the field and to be inclusive to everyone but the student body is almost exclusively 24-27 year old white upper class females. None of them have any sort of work experience at all, internships and volunteering at places since the bachelors ended. \n\nI was not poor by any means growing up but I definitely didn\u2019t have a beach house or vacation to Greece for a month in the summer. Some even had maids. I joined the military because I didn\u2019t have that many options left. I just come from a completely different world. \n\nI have not in any way shape or form experienced any sort of discrimination or anything. No one has really made it a thing at all. I honestly don\u2019t think anyone either cares which is fine or they don\u2019t know what to do either, because they\u2019ve never actually met someone with my background before. Like I haven\u2019t met someone with a maid before. As a white male this is something that\u2019s pretty foreign to me.\n\nI just keep thinking in my head \u201cI\u2019m really just not a part of this club\u201d and I don\u2019t know how to shake it. It\u2019s not an imposter syndrome sort of thing. I can handle the course work and all that. It\u2019s a deeper just\u2026.I don\u2019t really belong here. \n\nDoes anyone else ever feel that way? How do you deal? I\u2019ve read a lot that ex military have difficulty adjusting to college life is this what I\u2019m experiencing? Am I overthinking this?",

I'm a third-worlder who took my master's abroad and I'm not white, but went to a predominantly white university. While everyone was nice on the surface, much of their openminded-ness was more performative if anything. No one was intentionally racist toward me, but let's just say, hearing rich white people talk about how to help people in Africa... Yeesh, their suggestions made me wince, and of course they would talk over the few actual Africans in the class. There were definitely a number of times I thought \"If you'd experienced life from my point of view, you wouldn't be spouting that shit\".",

It's worthwhile to be distinctive in interesting ways to also show the diversity in the group. Finally, it is worthwhile to have some distinctive things that remain private. This way all the students belong, and all the students bring something new to the education.",

I enjoy being older and having a wider perspective. I think the things I learned in my time between undergrad and grad school make me a better scientist, and I like to think I help bring that perspective to the department.\n\nAlso I make friends with postdocs!",

I moved out when I was 17.  I had to learn to take care of myself. Shit was hard all along. No encouragement. I finally found an opportunity in a lab doing computational fluid dynamics modeling. At one point I was working 3 jobs - working in a hospital cafeteria, working at the aforementioned lab job, then grading papers. \n\nJust like you, I have this feeling of not being to relate to most of my peers. Its clear that most of them are coming from a situation of privilege. It's doesn't matter what they look like, what race they are. The baseline commonality is that socioeconomic privilege - and access to social resources I never had. By social resources I mean the way they are able to float from opportunity to opportunity, without having to do much to grab onto the next opportunity. When they talk, most of them seem so disconnected from the hard reality. Like life is a game. No consequences.\n\nWhile a lot of the above is also true - such as they have mastered maximising getting a lot with little input. The obverse side to that coin is a lot of them are just masters of keeping up appearances. Things are not all good as they seem. \n\nAnyway, a lot of times I feel like I don't belong - despite having deeper working knowledge, and quicker skills, then these people. They have a way of.. displacing you, of making you feel like an outsider. It doesn't matter if you are 500% better. To them, this means that, again you don't belong by virtue of making them uncomfortable. \n\nKeep going. Have that larger goal. You will find some people like you. Though it takes some time. They are there. Just not the vocal majority.",

I have an unusual background - both of my parents are not well off and have been in and out of rehab/jail, but I have multiple wealthy extended family members. Since my extended family is well off and my parents were not always stable enough to care for me, I moved between houses and families a lot and have always been an outsider amongst my peers. Due to extended family I have always had a safety blanket/support system and acknowledge that that\u2019s better than most, but I was exposed to a lot at a young age and what I\u2019ve seen continues to consume my thoughts in my free time. I find it taxing to engage in small talk with my class as the things they complain or enjoy are in no way similar to what goes on in my head - sometimes I engage and say things that I think would bond us even though my words and thoughts are worlds apart\u2026 I often wonder if others are like me and have deeper things going on or if I truly am an outsider.",

My peers don't really discriminate me, but I find it's our backgrounds that make it subtly hard to communicate and bond with them. For example, they find almost all my interests weird (e.g. Kpop, video games, tech, food). Also, I've noticed that there is a cultural difference in general social communication. Sometimes, even when people don't actively discriminate you, you can still get socially outcasted from subtle things like this.\n\nThe feeling of being disconnected and essentially an outcast of my cohort drove me to isolation and poor mental health and a hiatus. When I came back, I ended up making connections in a lab from a different department that had more people similar to me. Now, I just prefer to socialize and hang out with them rather than my home department.",

The original version of my comment had no mention about my POC status, and I wanted to emphasize the social outcast part. I wanted to let you know that I really relate to the feeling of being out of place, and rather than say it was an \"asset\" like others, I wanted to give a more affirming response. It really sucks to be out of place, no matter what the group or reason is. And yeah, you're right, it might not even be a world you want to go into for the long term. The inability to bond and connect with your colleagues from small subtle subcultural differences is heartbreaking, and not many people get it because it's not obvious as discrimination.\n\nHope you'll be able to figure it out, but I just wanted to say you're not along in that feeling.",

      "text": "First, be careful with referencing your own problems fitting in when the topic of diversity comes up. Diversity a topic where people tend to have strong reactions, and trying to voice your concerns from the perspective of a lower socioeconomic status white male risks someone taking it the wrong way like you\u2019re a racist who\u2019s trying to steal sympathy meant for racial/ethnic minorities. Unfortunately similar tactics sometimes are used by people with bad intentions to try to derail discussions about diversity, and your grad school peers (and faculty!) are likely too inexperienced with diversity to differentiate between someone doing that and you sharing genuine concerns/experiences.\n\nIf you feel the need to say something, it\u2019s safer to voice your concerns in the context of how socioeconomic factors might affect a hypothetical minority student or a single mother.\n\nThat said, your experiences are very real and valid. Socioeconomic background diversity is VERY overlooked in a grad school environment. If you dare to do anything non-wealthy \u2014 not have the right clothes for a conference, work on the weekend to supplement your ridiculously low stipend or save towards retirement \u2014 many people this will be taken to mean you\u2019re not taking grad school seriously enough. I say this from experience as someone who had mostly-secret weekend job\u2026\n\nAs for staying sane in grad school when you don\u2019t fit in \u2014 what saved me was non-gradschool friends from a background more similar to my own. They could laugh at my descriptions of the ridiculousness that happens in grad school, and keep me grounded in the reality outside of grad school. Find the people who make sense to you, and make sure they remain a big part of your life during grad school.\n\nFor you this might be regular phone calls with old friends, a social group or support group for ex-military (either university-affiliated or not), or you might benefit just from regular contact with a group of non-gradschool adults your own age. But whatever it is, look for it until you find it, it is what will get you through grad school with your sanity intact.",

It's a show, just talk and no action. Or any male period for that matter. \n\nI don't meant to take away from the experiences of anyone else or anything like that.

Many of them probably don\u2019t have anyone from a minority racial/ethnic background in their phone contacts (unless the person works for them).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like wanting to save the dolphins, but not actually knowing about dolphin habitats, food, etc. And then without consulting any dolphins or dolphin experts to find out, the dolphin-saving committee decides to put up a mural in the third floor hallway of your building to tell dolphins that they are welcome there. It\u2019s nice that they care, but they lack the knowledge/experience/guidance necessary to direct that caring into any kind of useful action.\n\nYou have more life experience, and probably a lot more experience working alongside people from minority backgrounds, so you can see that a room full of privileged white people sitting around talking to each-other about diversity doesn\u2019t actually accomplish much. That doesn\u2019t make you an evil racist white man, it just means you have experience that your classmates don\u2019t.

I'm older than my classmates by about 10-18 years and one of the very few white males in my department. It's ok to feel different (because that's reality). Everyone feels different at some point or another and having that experience will help you get along with others. The goal is to focus on the degree/experience you want because school is a transition phase. I belong to the program! I don't really fit in with the current group of students. So I'll get along well enough with my classmates and get my social needs met elsewhere.\n\nI had a roommate in undergrad who had a tricky time adjusting to college life so I know you're not alone in that. I bet there are other resources out there for that.\n\nJust to add something that I haven't really seen others comment on - the diversity and inclusivity topics. (Granted, white male here, so I'm coming from that bias, etc.) I think all the emphasis and talk about diversity/inclusivity in academia as highlighting values and goals and aspirations. If there was a simple solution/training/education that would make people actually open to all forms of diversity/difference and behave accordingly, then it would have happened already. They're aspirational because we're all biased and limited in our worldviews. Being more inclusive of diversity is something that we all should continue to work on and will be a very individual journey. So, the talking about diversity sounds kinda fake because they're trying to emphasize a value, not actually find a solution (or be aware of the direct examples in front of them that don't quite fit the stereotypes).\n\nPart of your job is to expand the club to include yourself. You're in the program and therefore you belong. The other part of your job is to set yourself up for the career you want and get out of grad school. You got this!",

I had ten years of life experience and of reading books on them. I had combat deployments; I had one baby and gone through the loss of a failed pregnancy; I had lived overseas for five years -  I'd seen and experienced a lot of life. \n\nBut all that was my problem. None of that was relevant to the task at hand unless I could use that perspect to write a more interesting paper (which I like to think I sometimes did).\n\nEvery one of those other students had experienced life and hardship in their own way, and I could learn from them. Some people had way harder lives than I did.\n\nI tried to be polite and respectful to everyone - and to be humble. So what if my classmates have rich parents and they vacation in Greece in the summer. Good for them. I don't know what that's like - if I have a drink with that student after hours I'll ask about it. \n\nI ended up making some good friends in school- my best friends were other vets, but I had good civilian friends too. Those friendships were pretty much all born out of study groups, and I really appreciated what they brought to the table.\n\nA little humility goes a long way.",

There are more of us who came to this as a second career, but most were in education or childcare so coming from being a clinical massage therapist for a decade and being a military family just throws people. \n\nI'm used to being the different one( just got evaluated for ADHD in my 30s), so as long as I get along and find my groove I worry less about it then.\n\nYou being different is an asset. I've already come up with ideas for my research project and pointed stuff out that no one else saw because of having a different set of life experiences. That's useful. \n\nYou're used to making sure things function, are practical, and efficient while dealing with a giant bureaucracy. Those are extremely useful things in a graduate school program. I've seen other friends who left the military describe what you are, and it probably does feel weird because unconsciously this is supposed to be your new tribe, but you have very little in common with them.\n\n Find the commonalities, embrace the differences, and if you need a tribe make your own community whether it's with people in your program or on or off-campus.",

      "text": "*TLDR*: We're all only human--- we want to feel \"safe\" and that happens when we feel like we \"belong\"/\"are part of the group\" (look up Simon Sinek, himself a veteran). You're placed in a situation where you have to interact with a group of folks, and they with you, where you've had absolutely *no* scaffold/previous experience to inform your present self on how to interact with them. Yes, unsettling. I recommend reflecting on the simple idea: \"I'm here to work/get my degree/experience. I'm here to be professional and polite. I'm not here to make friends, and because of the disparity of our backgrounds, I don't even think that possible on a practical level (wth would we talk about?!). But what I *can* be mindful of is to represent *my* background to continue to garner respect\\*--- because I'm *also* building a preprofessional/professional network during my time in graduate school. So, yeah: I'm here to 1) professional/rep well and 2) meet my goals.\"\n\n*Comment*: \\* = You're a veteran? You have all the respect from all the people in the first place!!!\n\n*Comment 2*: Does your university have a veterans affairs office? If you need a support system among folks of your previous life experience/background--- go to them and see if there's a weekly group meeting or something!!! *You're going to be in community reintegration/grad school--- it's tough to be alone.* You'll only likely benefit from a support network of your bros and sis from military life. No one else will ever understand it apart from them and how to problem-solve out in the community--- precisely because of your shared experiences!!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI came from a similar situation. I get it. And, I think, here in the States (obviously, I came from abroad), especially in the Midwest I have found (I assume that's where you are? I spent time on both US coasts--- your situation wouldn't even be an issue in what I consider my home base the PNW.) \"people who don't share similar backgrounds don't usually mingle/interact\"--- like in what if any situation would you have ever had to interact with these kids in both your lives previously?--- so now that you're thrown into a situation where you seemingly *must* interact, there's no previous scaffold of social-pragmatic rules to work with. \n\nI get it. Even I threw my Midwestern professors/instructors (they were competent and had good hearts--- and I really respect that they did their absolute best to figure out how to communicate with me on a socio-pragmatic level) in for a loop because *I asked tough, though appropriate, questions in master's class* (whereas my spoon-fed-their-whole-lives peers would only ask teach-to-the-exam-A+-questions) as a slightly older student who has seen some tough shiznit ---compared to my 20-26 white upper class female (note: RICH), innocent-of-all-the-hardship-of-earth cohort peers whose probably only other eye-opening experience was some mission trip to set up a school or a water pump abroad LOLS. Nothing against any of them, since I saw evidence they had *good* hearts and just wanted to use our degrees/training to help people. It's just I stand by my observation that they know NOTHING of hardship, and NOTHING outside of their uber comfortable worlds. So I LOL.\n\nSome things to think about and reflect on:\n\n* \"I'm not here to make friends on purpose. I'm here to study/train, be professional, build a pre-professional/professional network (with professors, industry people who segue into the program time-to-time d/t classes/seminar/conference/interviews) for *after* I finish my program, and get my freaking degree/credentials/experience for my future goals.\"\n* \"If my peers ask for assistance or if we are placed in group projects, I'm not going to be a jerk about things. But I am going to be professional. We're all equal here. I will contribute the best to my ability. This isn't camp counseling. This isn't an office. This isn't church group. This is (grad) school. Because I'm slightly older and I am male, it will be organic for me to possibly be the \"voice up\" and take the \"leader role\"--- among the young female peers--- the only thing I can do is treat them as equal human beings. We don't quite know what everyone is going through--- but the common denominator we all have is we want to get through this course/lab/class/degree program and get out of here. And I'm going to hinge on that while keeping distance socially--- because I'm here to get work done, I'm not here to socialize.\"",

I prefer action to the eeennndlesss discussion so common in academia, and I am incredibly efficient because I have a life outside of the lab - I want to do what I need to do and get on with my day. I find that PIs appreciate my directness and the fact that I get to the point and don't need babysitting. A couple of the more with-it students do as well. \n\nI suspect much of this is true for you as well (I'll bet a veteran has a more get-shit-done attitude anf capability than someone fresh out of mommy and daddy's house who had staff to do everything for them). So don't change or hide yourself to be just like them. Stand out and be proud of it. By showing the strengths your background has given you, you'll throw their lack of those strengths into sharp relief. That said, keep an eye out for things you can learn from them as well.

We, at one time, had a military guy in our CNF program, and he was one of my favorites.\n\nWhen I first arrived (I know this bc people have since told me as much) people were intrigued by me because I disrupted their expectations of who/ what a literature scholar is. But they were also a bit intimidated (goofy to me, but I\u2019ll accept it as a compliment). Also, my cohort all came in married with babies or have had babies since we\u2019ve been here and I was going through a devastating break up of a long term relationship. \n\nOur lit scholars are super conservative which I didn\u2019t know when I came in bc my optimistic ass thought PROGRESSIVE LEFTISTS! lol. Not true. So I\u2019m totally fine with my ability to confuse and challenge people. \n\nDespite our wide ranging beliefs, values, and upbringings, I have found that underneath it all we are united in our fundamental interests in stories and culture. I suggest you try to connect through the subject matter which is what has ultimately led to your crossing paths. \n\nAs much as I share your sentiments regarding this particular social class\u2014one thing that kept me going was when my stepdad told me that *maybe I\u2019m there to teach them as much as I\u2019m there to learn.* Then there\u2019s the old cliche about not fitting in bc you\u2019re supposed to stand out. \n\nAll of this is to say, from one person who disrupts just from simply being true to themself to another, just be you, but cultivate curiosity. Godspeed!",

She never treated me different afterwards, but caught me off guard because like, duh we hunted and set traps and ate em.",

It must be challenging for other to have expectations of being successful like their parents and not getting such a huge sense of accomplishment \n\nI'm also 10 years older than other Grad students. It does feel strange but I don't view it as disadvantage...Well, only to my dating prospects",

Not what we\u2019re actually learning but those additional skills like resume building, job interview stuff, networking etc isn\u2019t pushed as much as it could be because the students either don\u2019t care or don\u2019t realize how important it really is as they\u2019ve never had to apply for a job before.

I don\u2019t know anything about adjusting from the military, but I definitely got experience coming from a lower tax bracket than my cohort. I\u2019m gonna be honest, it\u2019s been hard to relate to my cohort and make friends- they were more of the \u2018wine night and opera (ugh)\u2019 kind of crowd where I\u2019m more of \u2018JD, weed and Slayer\u2019 guy. I was also very mentally unstable my first year, so take that with a grain of salt. Its hard to relate to friends that somehow take trips to other countries on the stipend that gets you by paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s a different situation when you\u2019re goal in grad school is to get a job where you can pay off your loans vs someone who goes just cuz they love it. \n\nI fit in better when I joined a group in a different department (chemist in a ChemE group). A lot more of the engineers had worked in industry before and were more grounded than the chemists. It was a change in mentality from viewing grad school as school vs as a job, which I benefited from. I\u2019ve also had more success making friends with my neighbors and non-students I\u2019ve met in the gym, so try that too.\n\nYou gotta remember that you\u2019re experiences are unique, and that is a fuckin ADVANTAGE. You are gonna approach problems different from the rest of your cohort, and that is valuable. And they great thing is they will too. You guys can learn from each other and make everyone better.",
