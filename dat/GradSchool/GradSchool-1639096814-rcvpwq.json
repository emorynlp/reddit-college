  "title:": "Graduation on Saturday",
  "text": "I started college right after high school in 2004. My mom got sick and died (beep cancer), and I drank for way too long and wasted so much time. I woke up in 2015 and said enough is enough and never drank again.  I finished undergrad with my B.S in 2019. On Saturday, I finish my M.S. I have never walked in graduation, but I am this time. No one knows any of this except a few co-workers who knew I was in grad school, let alone how deep or special this is to me or those personal details. I am going to miss school and the routine. Well, everything there is to love and hate about higher ed.\n\nI apologize as I have wasted everyone\u2019s time. I just wanted to say it once, and I thought, hey, be that attention-seeking litter box and go to Reddit, haha. I joke! Nevertheless, for anyone else graduating, I am proud of you, you worked hard, and you deserve this. For those still trucking, I hope you get this feeling soon. Cheers",

My father died in the beginning of my college years from cancer and I fucked up my first 2 years worth of college. By 2018 I was ready to finish and get though it at the main campus. I\u2019ve been consistent and have gotten my GPA up by almost a full grade point. It\u2019s taken me 8 years, but I\u2019m finally getting my bachelors on Saturday and have applied to several PhD programs as I\u2019ve had 2 years of lab experience now in undergrad!! I hope I get in, lord knows half my transcripts are a complete trainwreck. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a scientist, I just don\u2019t have the perfect trajectory like most scholars.",

It felt underwhelming, like, \"Well, I suppose you finished.\"\n\nThis semester (or the next for sure -- waiting for confirmation on a difficult deciding class project, though I'm optimistic) I'll graduate with two concurrent M.S. degrees. \n\nThe joke I make with friends and family that know my history is that I went on to complete one masters degree for every time I failed out of undergrad. Two full withdrawals, which did a lot to preserve my GPA, but not much to preserve my confidence. \n\nIt's hard to express how far that personal pride goes. I know it shouldn't really work like this, as the core motivations for going to grad school were different, but being able to say to myself, definitively, \"I didn't fuck it up this time,\" feels good in a permanent and enduring way, like proof that I've fixed something.",
