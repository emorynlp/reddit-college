  "text": "Hello.\n\nI am currently doing my graduate studies and I am seeking to do my thesis abroad. I am mainly targeting North America.\nMy question is: do they commonly fund visiting students or are they expected to cover their living expenses independently?\nI wonder if that's something I can comfortably ask about or if it's rude or if it would reduce my chances of getting accepted drastically.",

      "text": "If I am getting this right, your thesis will be done under the same university, but you are planning to perhaps do get some data/mentorship abroad?\n\nIn my field, I have seen this happen, but the student typically got a fellowship or stipend from their home country or institution. Most universities I've seen don't have funding for a visiting student, and at most would help you with the visa if you came in with your own documented funding. There could be fellowships/programs I am unaware of that do this though!",

It's true that it would be easier to get funding from my university in Italy but I am asking if it is possible to get the funding from the US.\nI'm not intending to be greedy here but my university is public and the costs of living in Italy are way cheaper than the US (from what I've understood, searching online) and so it's not that enough to be truly financially comfortable - that's why I'm asking.",

It's not about greed, I just don't think there is a lot of money out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking to get into a whole program, well many do fund students if they get in, it's just extremely competitive. Students are also struggling with visas right now due to COVID.",
