  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nThere have been similar posts in the REU subreddits that really helped in determining when to expect decisions, so you know if decisions have already been sent out and you haven't heard, you aren't a first round offer and this might help in deciding which school to accept since they are time sensitive. Also to chance yourself based on other people's admissions details. I included my list below with details. If you can copy and paste it into your comment and change the details to reflect your information, that would be great!
