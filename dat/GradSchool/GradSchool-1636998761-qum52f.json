  "text": "I'm about to graduate next month with my master's, but I'm likely to score a D in one of my classes, delaying my official graduation by another semester as I'd need to retake it.\n\nI've had it, though. The class average for that course this semester is a high D as well, and the attrition rate is about 60%. The same professor will be teaching it next semester, and it's very unlikely he'll change any policies. The only way for me to officially get out is if I score an 85 or higher on the final, an improbable feat given that my highest score this semester was a 70.\n\nIf things don't work out for me, I'll probably just walk the stage and drop out of grad school afterwards. I can't take being in school for so long, only to be denied completion by just 1 factor.",

      "text": "Maybe you can talk to your program advisor and see if they\u2019re willing to let you graduate with a D. Explain the situation and show them that the average is a high D. Also, if it\u2019s a graduate class and the average is that low he might even curve it. I honestly don\u2019t think you should let one class hinder your masters degree. If there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way!",
