  "title:": "It's always a big forking emergency when I owe the university money, but when the university owes me money it's all 'admin is always slow, why didn't you plan/budget better?'",
  "text": "My university owes me money for:  \n(1) health benefits (because they screwed up and didn't enroll my partner on my plan, which I paid them to do two months ago; they did the same thing last year, it's been a super fun pandemic on the health insurance front!)  \n(2) a departmental bursary (applications due months ago, was supposed to be paid out three weeks ago)  \n(3) a fancy grant that I won from an external body but the funds are being administered internally so of course it got mucked up (been working on this since the summer, found out I got it last month, admin didn't get it on payroll in time to pay me).\n\nAnd my tuition remission from them was late, so extra fees/shenanigans on that. I actually do budget assuming that admin will screw some things up, because they always do, I just didn't expect \\*all\\* of these to go wrong. I just needed one of these to pay out on time to, well not be thriving, but at least be sort of in the black. Instead I'm living in overdraft and on credit cards until they see fit to sort it out. Every admin I talk to acts like I'm being a brat for trying to get paid. But I'm getting weekly reminders to bring my damn library books back now that the buildings have re-opened post-covid.\n\nI'm so sick of being this precarious and pretending like I'm not one more admin delay away from serious trouble. This is not 'bonus' money for me on top of like, a salary - I'm not a prof. I need all this to pay my bills; my landlord is not receptive to 'oh that's just university admin for you, lol, I'll pay ya when I can kay?'. It's very hard to focus on answering student emails and writing the diss and doing the grant research with this weighing on my mind. The only people in my cohort who have finished are the ones who are independently wealthy and/or are kids of professors, I'm starting to see why.\n\nThanks for the space to rant.",

Nothing happened, and the issue repeated the following month. I contacted them again. \n\nNow, this was October and November of last year, so you can imagine their scramble to frantically reach me during winter break (Christmas week) so their accounts were corrected by January 1st. And, man, did they HOUND me for it. \n\nThe representative contacted me at like 10:30 am, noon, and 1 o\u2019clock all on the same day\u2026 then her SUPERVISOR called me from what appeared to be a personal number. \n\nI was like \u201cI\u2019m with my family. I will correct it, but you need to give me more than a few hours, people!\u201d\n\nOh, I should add that at my previous University, they neglected to pay me for 3 pay cycles (6 weeks in total). I couldn\u2019t pay for gas to get to work or campus. It was a hassle trying to get it corrected, and they just kind of dragged their feet to get it done. So frustrating.",

I was late in finishing up my verification (my fault, I could have done it a few months earlier) but did so well before the end of Fall semester. In order to enroll in Spring, I needed FAFSA to pay out so that I could pay-off what I owed for Fall.\n\nAfter I finish verification I wait a month. The semester is now over and my FAFSA is still in limbo. I call the financial aid office. They tell me that they are waiting for the department of education to accept my verification and that based on the delay, something was wrong that was out of their hands.\n\nI call back a week later to check on it again and I here the same story. It is now getting close to the final registration deadline for Spring. If I don't get my FAFSA money in the next week, I will not be able to enroll this semester. Two days before the deadline I've become completely extremely desperate and take the step of going to their office in person (this is mid-pandemic).\n\nThe person at the desk tells me the same thing about my verification still being pending but I insist on talking to someone more senior. Within five minutes of sitting down with that more senior person, she has fixed the issue: my verification was completed months ago but nobody in the office bothered to spend five minutes actually doing the final step to release my loans.\n\nI was furious when I realized that I had spent the last month becoming increasingly anxious because some low level financial aid employees were either: 1) outright lying to me, or 2) simply didn't bother to check and assumed the error must be on my end. Had I not insisted on speaking to a more senior administrator in person, my graduation would have been delayed by a semester and I would have struggled to pay my bills without the FAFSA money.\n\nThe lesson I learned was that administrators are absolutely not looking out for students and you should not take their word for anything. I previously was anxious about being rude to them and insisting I be allowed to speak to more senior people. I have now learned that excessive deference to them will get me nothing but stress.",

If you're unionized, you can figure out if there's a union steward in your department - they'll give you the real talk.

Everything else is department-level and more the product of a culture of non-urgency when it comes to paying grad students than like, a violation of the rules.\n\nThe tuition thing is a good example. I \\*had\\* to pay tuition by x date, otherwise I wouldn't be registered (which would, among other things, make me ineligible for that bursary I applied for). X date arrived and my department hadn't issued the remission yet, so I paid out of pocket. Then the department issued the remission; so now it's sitting as a 'credit' on my account until it's applied to any outstanding winter session fees and then paid out (so, January-ish). The department never gave me a date by which they would pay the remission, they just usually do so before tuition is due (because that makes sense!). This year they didn't, but they still issued it to me, so obligation fulfilled. In their minds, that's not a screw-up, and I should have budgeted better.\n\nIt's the discrepancy in urgency that gets to me. I am obligated to pay by a certain date, and they are obligated to pay me whenever they feel like it.",

I'm so sorry it's happening to you but know that you're not alone.\n\nI played a graduation ceremony for December graduates and didn't get my measly check until FUCKING APRIL. All because the person who was supposed to file the paperwork didn't do it for 3 months...And of course we only get paid at the end of the month...And it's apparently impossible to cut a $200 check to a student before then...And of course \"student employees\" are not under the same category as \"graduate students\" so there's two extra forms to fill out that no one ever uses...total bullshit.\n\nThat kind of situation has happened to me too many times to count. I'm not sure what you can do as far as the **university you attend**, but I've done other music jobs for other universities who have tried to not pay or take forever and I've sent collection letters to the department and the University Accounts Payable department using official channels and that type of thing usually gets the ball rolling pretty quick. Here's a template that I think *reeeeally* lays the guilt on thick:\n\n\n>> This is a formal reminder that I am owed $XXX for my **JOB** on **DATE**. This payment was promised on **DATE** and is now **TIME** overdue. I request that this payment be sent immediately via Certified Mail to the following address: **ADDRESS**\n\n>> **ADD ANYTHING HERE AS TO WHY THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM AND SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT**\n\n>>I was expected to **THING A, THING B, THING C,** abide by pandemic-related university protocols, and represent your university to the highest standard. My only expectation is to be compensated appropriately and in a timely manner. I met the expectations required, and my compensation has not yet been honored. If there are any questions, you may contact me at **XXX@XXX.COM**. If I do not receive a response by **DATE** at the close of business, I will pursue further actions.\n\nThe only advice I can give is to not let up, but also don't burn any bridges amongst the people you spend time around, and try to level with the people trying to help.

      "text": "Wow, so similar to my experience AND something I loudly complain about often because this completely shuts out low income students (I'm not low income but if I were I might have quit before finishing my first MSc). \n\nFirst MSc: I get a scholarship and think great! This will cover most of my tuition! Tuition payment time comes and I find out, I won't get my scholarship until the second semester where I've shown I can stay in the program based on my first semester marks. So I almost am dropped from the program because I haven't paid tuition and didn't have the cash on hand. Thankfully, my family helped and I was able to reimburse them once I got the scholarship. Fucking ridiculous and could have led to me just not doing the program. And of course this was all super urgent and had to be sorted in a matter of days \n\nNow ending my PhD: I've started my 4th year and noticed my late in the summer that direct deposits from my institution have stopped coming (I get paid a monthly stipend from my scholarship). So I inquire about it and it becomes this big investigation because they're like \"what IS going on?\" Well, it turns out I didn't get paid anything from my scholarship my first year and they've been screwing up all of my stipend payments so I'm owed tens of thousands of dollars. I just assumed the institute was garnishing my wages for some other fee I didn't know about but nope, just plain old not getting paid my scholarship. This is like years old though so I'm like, shouldn't they pay me interest on all that I wasn't paid? Also! I still haven't seen that money and it's been months. So I'm back getting my monthly stipend as of last week (3 months after noticing the issue) but still haven't received the backed pay. \n\nAnyway, had to add my rant and TL;DR I couldn't agree more with you OP and I think a lot about how fucking privileged I am and how it's made it possible for me to get past these financial hurtles but how is this shaping who gets graduate degrees, who becomes professors, and who are authorities of knowledge in our society.",
