  "text": "I'm (25F) currently an engineer, and I plan to go to grad school next year for a PhD. I'm very excited to pursue my dream but not so excited about the dramatic income difference. I also pay for half of my mom's mortgage as she is very poor (only about $500 but is still substantial for a $25-30k stipend). I currently have a good chunk of savings and will have about $75k saved up by the time I start school. I'm wondering what you do for extra income. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome ideas I was thinking:\n\n\\- Buy a home and rent out the rooms\n\n\\- Donate plasma weekly\n\n\\- Create an app for something\n\n\\- Donate my eggs",

      "text": "Awesome that you're planning ahead :)\n\nI'm chiming in because I'd be concerned about what I see as major risks for two of those options.\n\n1. Buying a house and renting rooms in it isn't a sure thing. You'll have to interview candidates, which takes time. Even if they pay for their own background checks, you'll have the added burden of being a landlord. \n\nI'm guessing that you may even be living with them, while working on your PhD? \n\nTo me, having strangers/housemates walking around, inviting over significant others, talking on the phone, watching t.v., cooking, and doing what people do would be super distracting. \n\nWhen roommates move out, you'll need someone else to fill in the spot. You may need to schedule showings, deal with movers, handle complaints, and find yourself in a parental role (if they don't pay on time).\n\nOnce you buy a home on the condition that you'll be renting out the rooms out of financial need, you're putting yourself at risk of making decisions that may compromise your limited time and energy.\n\n2. Donating eggs means taking preparation hormones for a certain number of months. I'd be concerned about potential side effects, even if they are relatively \"minor,\" such as fatigue. \n\n...\n\nI like the side hustle ideas where you'll have boundaries, and a way out if need be. It's way easier to quit a job or reduce hours, than reverse course on a house or once you've bought a house or committed to egg donation (and even if you can back out of that, you may feel pressured for not going through with the donation).\n\n[The egg donation point is typed as, \"2\", on my end. Guess Reddit's auto formatting took charge here..oh well.]",

      "text": "Just to offer a different path, but it's ok to be in the red as far as income goes for a few years with that kind of savings. I came into grad school with about 7k savings and even just having a cushion for months where I go slightly over budget or need to make a purchase all at once has helped tremendously. Let me frame it a different way, you're worried about short term income while you work on your PhD right? Do you expect that house to make you 75k over 5 years? Probably not, and you would be trading your savings for a less stable position because rooms aren't always full and houses require upkeep. That $500 a month comes out to 6k a year, and 8% annual gains on 75k invested in the stock market gives you that amount. Not saying you should invest it all, just want to make the point that while yes, putting income on pause for 5 years sucks, you aren't in a position where you need to consider medical sales or put yourself under pressure to manage a side gig. Grad school is plenty stressful as is, using that money to let you focus on school completely is a good investment. You should figure out how much money a year you think you need to get by at the quality of life you want to live at, and work backwards. The school location is going to be the biggest factor, if you're in a major city and especially places like NYC or SF you may want the extra income just for necessities like rent. But if it's somewhere in the middle of nowhere, do your expenses even warrant additional income? You might also consider crossposting this to r/personalfinance.",

It\u2019s a huge time sink and I only do it because I genuinely enjoy doing it, but if you have some sort of skill like that it might be a bit easier than selling your eggs or plasma lol\n\nIt does sound like you\u2019re a bit nervous about taking the huge pay cut from engineering industry, which is totally understandable. If you have $75k in savings by the time you start your PhD and it takes you 5 years to finish, you\u2019d end up with about $15k a year from savings to live off of in addition to your stipend. That\u2019s nothing to balk at, and is definitely doable on its own as long as you\u2019re smart about managing your budget. I\u2019d recommend talking to a financial advisor to possibly put that savings into a short term investment account or high yield savings account so you can earn a little extra money from it existing. I\u2019d also recommend making sure you have reliable versions of costly items like your car, laptop, phone, etc to minimize surprise expenses like that during your PhD.",
