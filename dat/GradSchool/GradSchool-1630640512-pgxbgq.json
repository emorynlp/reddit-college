  "text": "So I know this year has been hard on all of us with coronavirus and just current events in general. To add to this my mom passed away this summer. I'm doing a masters at a top national university in Japan and was able to come back and spend time with her during the winter for about 4 months, due to everything being online. I went back for the service in June and since coming back I'm just exhausted and burnt out. I don't really care to work here after graduation anymore, and just keep telling myself to push through until I graduate in March. Through most of my grad school she was sick and I have regrets about not quitting and moving back. I feel like I'll have wasted my time here as I don't think this degree will hold weight back in the states, but I can't bring myself to live and work here. I just want to be back in my own country closer to family. Really feels like a shitshow. Anyone have experience getting a grad degree abroad and finding work in the states? Sorry for the rant but I needed to vent. And yes I'm seeing a therapist.",

      "text": "Hey. Just wanted to tell you to be gentle with yourself. I'm in grad school and love in Europe. I lost my dad unexpectedly in January of this year, and  still struggling. My therapist said losing a parent is hard, particularly the first 2-2.5 years. When I explained to him how hard I am still finding everything and how overwhelmed and burned out I feel, he said that 7 months after the loss of a parent is nothing and of course I feel this way. The loss of your mom is even more recent, so of course you are burned out. \n\nDon't beat yourself up over only being there 4 months. I'm sure your mom understood and she was so proud of you and your accomplishments. So be gentle and forgiving of yourself. You'll be okay, but it'll take awhile.",
