Grad school is known to be hard. I don\u2019t know how your advisor reacted, but a good one GETS IT! Everyone cries in grad school. The system is built to break us down, sadly. \n\nDon\u2019t feel embarrassed. It\u2019s okay. Sending you love and well wishes. Take it easy on yourself. We\u2019re all human.",

You should 100% consider other options, sit with them, and choose what is best for YOU! \n\nRemember we are in such a hard time. Everyone is struggling right now. This pandemic has really shaken everyone. \n\nWhatever you chose, it will be okay. I found that after I broke down and planned a life if I did drop out, I was able to refocus myself. To see that I could have a Plan B that wasn\u2019t me quitting or failing so I didn\u2019t feel so \u201cstuck.\u201d \n\nHappy to chat anytime. Grad school is rough.

A piece of advice I found helpful was to avoid making big life decisions when grief is fresh - your decision-making skills are hampered, and it will become a bit easier with time. So if you can, I would look into more temporary options like going on leave before deciding whether to quit. Another thing you can do is ask yourself whether the work gave you energy before the other circumstances? If it did, maybe it will come back when the grief is more manageable. But if it didn't, maybe your position is making things worse and is not a good fit for you. But you don't have to make a decision right now. Wishing you the best!",
