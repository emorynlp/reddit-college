  "text": "-This is a rant (cry for help?)-\n\n3rd term MS student here. Virtually almost done, yet virtually have nothing to show for (being a bit dramatic, no lie). \n\nPlease tell me I'm not the only one who's been working 12+hour days for the last 2+ weeks just barely hanging on (somehow doing it, idk how). \n\nFortunately this busy period will end soon, but I've definitely been suffering. I haven't slept well (without a sleep aid) in literally months. Haven't worked out in ~2 weeks (I normally work out religiously). My gf is so damn supportive, but I have not been present with her. Bags under my eyes have become so much more noticeable in the last couple weeks. Definitely been hitting the ADHD meds harder than usual (I'm Rx'd, diagnosed).\n\nHave an important committee meeting coming up, two presies this week (one done, one tomorrow). One at the meeting next week. Been essentially learning stat methods I've not learned before by applying them to my incredibly giant and messy data set (which takes so much time to work with every time I do anything new with it). Have to be able to defend these ideas next week that I'm not even completely certain about. How do people do it? \n\nI know I'm smart and capable, but there's nothing that has pushed me to this point in my life thus far (and I've faced life/death scenarios numerous times). \n\nI do this thing where I get so hyper obsessed (ADHD) over all of the details and getting shit absolutely right, but only to a point where I'm not lying about what I know. It's this delicate balance of being smart and practical, but these hyper-obsessive episodes are really eating up my time. I literally can hardly take care of myself. \n\nI promise my academic writing is better worded than this rant.\n\nIs this normal? I've had so much balance this semester. How could it come to such a culmination of awfulness?\n\nAnyways, please tell me I'm not alone. I know I can do this, but man, this shit is not good for me.",

Such difficulties do not last forever, they come to us for a short time and you need to show patience to make it end. If you are smart and capable as you wrote it then you will succeed. It is worth thinking about help if it gets more difficult. I have a subreddit where you can ask a question or share your story, I will be glad to see you)",

      "text": "That's my life before finals every time. Just completed my 5th semester. Part time student with kids, so not full-time, but the overall load is intense.\nI am an exercise addict too. The last month before finals everything intensifies and all I do is work, attend to my kids, study, run a bit. The last couple of weeks of finals all I do is work and study. Luckily I get some days off work leading up to the deadline. But yeah, 12 hour days at least are normal. No exercise. No tv. No friends. My kids hate me by then. \nIt is incredibly hard work and I'm glad to soon be over with this part of my life. I don't even feel like I do more than the bare minimum. No time for anything but the required reading.\n\nI came down with a cold, so even if I'm done with the term now, I haven't run in 10 days, which feels like am eternity.",
