  "text": "I\u2019m a first-year bioinformatics masters student, and I came up with what I think is a pretty good idea for a research project and potential thesis. I\u2019m pretty embarrassed to ask, but I don\u2019t really know what explicitly to do next on the project. I spoke to my advisor and he likes the idea, and he suggested to start finding existing work. \n\nI have a few papers that I\u2019ve found of similar work that I want to read, but how do I go about writing down what I find in the papers (I already use Mendeley, but don\u2019t have a system in place to keep my notes for specific projects)? How do I draft up my idea and keep track of my progress? Should I reach to other professors to talk through my idea and get some feedback?\n\nI\u2019m thinking of using a grant application template as a way to keep track of and synthesize my ideas, but I was wondering what you all do when you first come up with an idea for a research direction.",
