Just the overall hopelessness of the current pandemic and lockdown got the best of me. I started my workout but it did not go well, I started to read some literature and had to read the same sentence over and over again. I started crying and eating to find some comfort, resulting in some more crying out of shame and guilt. Eventually I wrote down how I felt in my diary and after some reflecting I was able to do everything I wanted to get done that day. But in the evening there was more crying and sadness.\n\nToday started better, I feel more optimistic and try to remember it all will get better and we are all in this together",
