      "text": "I hear you OP -- one of my long-time lingering concerns is that I'll wash out and struggle to find the sort of customer service / manual labor part time gigs I held throughout my childhood and teens, unfulfilling drudgery that pays little and stimulates less. I like to think I've built up enough career capital (with a well-tuned mix of hard and soft skills, credentials, etc.) that I can find gainful, well-compensated employment once my current position runs its course, but who knows what the future ultimately holds. Ideally I'd find myself some anti-fragile sinecure where I can fall upwards forever but I doubt that's gonna happen :D",

But I also recognize his skill for being personable, which can be oh so exhausting. \n\nPlanning to try the job market for my field 2-3 years. Fall back plan become a high school teacher and at least I'll have the same schedule as my partner.",

      "text": "Yeah in the same boat tbh. I graduated with an MA in Public History (yeah, I know, bad decision, obviously) 5 months ago. I started applying to jobs 1-2 months before I graduated. And I\u2019m still essentially unemployed (currently working a part time temp job that ends soon) and homeless (couch surfing). I\u2019ve applied to soooooo many jobs in the last 6 months. I can\u2019t even keep track of everything I\u2019ve applied to. I\u2019ve had one interview, and it was for a job I knew wouldn\u2019t even pay the bills, and certainly not what someone who went through grad school should be paid. I couldn\u2019t even land that. I\u2019m wildly discouraged and feel like I wasted 3.5 years of my life because everything I did in grad school (courses, internships, research, projects, etc) was apparently useless because the current job market is not interested in any of it. And if I wanted to go back to retail, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d deem me as overqualified now. So\u2026I feel like I\u2019m royally fucked.",
