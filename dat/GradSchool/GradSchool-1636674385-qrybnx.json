We met Monday through Friday, which was exhausting for me to teach. \n\nBecause of the time crunch, I assigned basically 1 full chapter of the textbook (nearly) every day. The textbook was \"mandatory\" but also expensive (especially for a 1-month class), so I informed students that the lectures would contain all necessary info for the exams and the \"required\" textbook readings would contain deeper details for additional learning.\n\nAfter about a week or so, one student emails me and complains that the lectures feel like \"a summary\" and they don't go deep enough into any of the issues (because I had to cram a full chapter into ~1hr every day). He asked if I could make it more interesting for him and explore the content more. I asked if he had the required textbook, which did exactly what he was asking, and he said \"No I don't learn well from textbooks.\"",

Not only was I no longer teaching that class, but this student had access to their own grade the entire time. It was posted to their transcript a few days after grades were submitted. If they can't be bothered to double check their own work during the semester they're actually taking a class, I can't imagine what made them think it was reasonable to ask me to do it 6 months later. I'm happy to correct mistakes I made, but I'm not going to re-grade a semester's worth of work just because a student feels \"pretty sure\".\n\nIn a similar vein, I had a student basically tell me I miscalculated their grade and they should have gotten an A (also received an A-). Luckily, this person was kind enough to point out a couple assignments he thought I graded in error. I confirmed via email that he would like me to review his grade. Unfortunately for him, I had to tell him I did make an error: I gave him credit for an assignment he did not submit, and his grade was now a B+.\n\nThe benefit of having everything submitted electronically is that there is a clear record of what was submitted when. I've also caught students submitting assignments long after the assignment closed and claiming that I forgot to grade it. Syllabus policy is -10 points per day late, and one student would have had like -200 points. I usually just reply to those emails with a screenshot of the submission date and a reminder to double check the syllabus, the website, and the assignment instructions, where all due dates are posted.",
