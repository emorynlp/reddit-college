  "text": "Hello, everyone! I'm doing BBA in Marketing at a private university in Bangladesh, and I'm currently in my final semester. I was thinking of switching my field to Psychology and hence I want to pursue a master's degree in psychology, preferably in Canada or the USA. However, a lot of unis require the applicants to have a bachelor's degree in psychology, which I do not have. What can I do in this situation?",

      "text": "From what I have seen, for the most part, anyway, a social science masters will start you from research scratch.  A class on basic theoretical frameworks relevant to your field of interest, will do a world of good for knowing where to start on projects and papers. Don't be intimidated. Probably say on your apps you are willing to take whatever courses they suggest to prepare you - you might end up with a conditional acceptance, where they will want you to take something specific before enrolling.  Best of luck!",
