  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m currently a Masters student living in NY but my school is in CT. The commute is about 1.5-2 hours. I\u2019d only be going two days a week. This commute would only be for the Spring semester as I plan on making the move to CT for the fall so it would only be for four months that I\u2019d make the commute. Would it be too much or should I just push through this one semester until I am able to make the move?",

I think doing this commute 2 a week for a semester is totally doable, but it sort depends on what else you have going on in your life.",

They\u2019ll learn a lot still I\u2019m sure, but a lot of the value of graduate school seems to come from the network of people you create.",
