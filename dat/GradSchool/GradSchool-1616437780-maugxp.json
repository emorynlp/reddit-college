A fellowship for medical doctors is how they specialize in specific ares, e.g. residency in neurology and did a fellowship to specialize in neuromuscular disorders. I feel like a post-doc is a step in specializing in academics, learning how to run a lab and get a better glimpse at the balance between teaching and research.",

Everything is either academia or with the feds, so I've never really had to look into this. I know for a fact you can do it at government labs because I've interned with several during undergrad and early grad school and have actually *met* postdocs doing their postdocs at those govt. labs, but...\n\nAlso as an aside government lab postdocs at least in my field can pay pretty well. Some of the stipends I saw for postdocs there were like $75-$81k a year.",
