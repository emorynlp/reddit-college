  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in my undergraduate. I\u2019ve been looking at some masters programs since I plan on going right after my undergrad and the school I currently go to has a great program. It\u2019s very cheap and I have some pretty good connections to be able to get an assistantship. However I may be able to get into some of the top schools in my state for my masters if I play my cards right but it will cost me double or even triple of what my current school would cost. Are there any drawbacks to staying at the same school as your undergrad? Any advice would be great.",

      "text": "I've been told that it *can* look better to have different schools for each degree as it shows a potentially wider breadth of education. But in the end it's your research that will really take you places. So if you find a supervisor that you really work well with and will be producing great work because of it, stay with them.",
