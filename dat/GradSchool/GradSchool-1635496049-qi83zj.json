  "title:": "Grew up in the time when saying \"like\" all the time was/is popular. How do I get out if this habit? Especially for in class discussions.",
  "text": "Most of my cohort is older than me and almost all of them speak more professionally during class. I don't even try to say \"like\" or \"and like\" a lot but sometimes it unconsciously slips out when I'm talking because I'm so used to it from middle and high school. I'm embarrassed about it and want to try any tips to speak more elegantly. Thanks!",
