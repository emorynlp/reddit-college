  "text": "Hi, I earned my MS in Clinical Psychology years ago, and at this time am licensed in my state (passed EPPP first time!) and have a busy private practice. It is my own fault that I did not realize when I matriculated in my master's program that I would need to re-do my master's if I enrolled in a doctoral program. In my state, I can practice without a doctorate. But there seem to be so many opportunities, such as Board Certification, that are only there for doctoral level psychologists.\n\nI'm posting here under a \"throw it away\" username to ask about any programs around that might let me complete a PsyD or PhD (PsyD preferred) without repeating my master's level work and preferably without requiring me to put my busy practice on hold for a year to have another internship.\n\nThank you in advance for any helpful or insightful words.",
