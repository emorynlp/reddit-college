I am thinking that maybe it is that way because most people still have stuff left to do in their thesis lab whether it is finishing up a publicatiion or formatting a thesis. I have hope that finishing the final thing or maybe the actual graduation ceremony will be more of a proud moment.\n\nEdit: Oh and Congrats!",
