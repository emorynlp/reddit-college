Private loans also have aggregate loan limits because they are, uh, quite concerned with wanting you to pay them back. \n\nAlthough the book is about for-profit schools, Lower Ed by Tressie Cottom has a number of anecdotes about what it looks like when students max out the amount of loans available to them.",
