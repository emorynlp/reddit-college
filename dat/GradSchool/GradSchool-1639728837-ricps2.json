  "title:": "Question about LOR",
  "text": "I know questions like this have been asked multiple times so apologies in advance\u2026 \nI\u2019m a philosophy undergrad, and I\u2019m applying to a summer program for female undergrads interested in grad school in philosophy. The application requires 1-2 LOR. One of my professors agreed to write me a letter, and I\u2019m asking the other LOR from my TA because the TA knows me and my academic performance really well. \n\nI know that for grad school application I should have all LOR from professors, but for this kind of summer program can I use a LOR from a TA?\nThank you very much in advance!",
