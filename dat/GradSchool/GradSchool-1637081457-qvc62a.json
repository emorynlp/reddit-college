For research articles have you tried finding them through your university? (Either searching directly in the library database or being on the university VPN or something equivalent?) One of my favorite aspects of grad school is how I have access to 99% of the articles I want through the university. I'm sure this varies based on what school you're at though and what field you're in.",
