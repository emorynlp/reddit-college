Wore a little make up too. \n\nSo far the 60 year old office manager very obvious checked me out and told me he likes how hot I look. The 28 year old research associate told me I \"look like a proper woman should look like, fragile like I might cry any minute\". Then mimicked crying motions. \n\nNo he has never seen me cry.\n\nIt\u2019s only 11 am. \n\nLord help me\n\nEdit for clarity",

Even if that creeps comments couldn\u2019t explicitly on paper be determined to be sexual, that was harassment on the basis of your sex and it\u2019s obvious that it is contributing to a hostile, unsafe work environment. \n\nYou should definitely report both of these men. If you have heard these things others certainly have, and you mentioned that he has called you honey, also worthy of reporting. Lots of comments are saying that he needs to be told off or a talking to or that you should have a good come back. What this RA needs is to be reported to HR and your and his superiors, and subsequently removed from the field and disgraced for their sexist behavior. \n\nReporting someone for sexual harassment can feel harsh and heavy because it people\u2019s careers and reputations can be ruined as a result of this. However it is important to keep in mind that it is not the accuser or the report of sexual assault/harassment that stops someone\u2019s career. It is their behavior, their repeated harassment that ruins their career. This jackass has set themself up for failure, and remaining silent is just protecting him at the cost of your and your female colleagues\u2019s comfort, productivity, career advancement, and respect. \n\nPlease report him. A major role model for me in my field is Kathleen Treseder. Please look her up and read about her experience with sexual harassment. No woman is unaffected, and no one should be free from appropriate retribution. I hope you feel like reporting this behavior is something that you can do safely.",

Don't wear a weird ass dress then wonder why you get comments on the dress.  It might seem like you're trying to get attention and they are giving you that attn they think you want.  It's a lab:  you wear closed toe shoes and pants and a shirt that usually are under a white coat.  That's the general lab garb so anything outside of that will get comments.  If you'er not seeking comments on your appearance than wear what everyone else wears when they are working as a scientist.\n\nMaybe wear a disney princess dress to the next poster conference and check back with how that goes for you.",
