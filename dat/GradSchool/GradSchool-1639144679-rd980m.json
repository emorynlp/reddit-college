  "text": "So I'm 30 and about to graduate with my masters in supply chain management. I started a new job 6 months ago doing supply chain analytics and have been working and studying both full time since. I am lucky because I feel my boss has been patient with me but feel massive imposter syndrome. So much of university was theory based and doing stuff with clean data sets. I did well in undergrad and grad school and i understand the theory, but school didn't seem to actually teach most of the tools I need. I guess Dunning Kruger is also hitting hard right now?  Now that I am working and about to not have the excuse of also studying, I'm worried I will fall behind at work and my boss with think im a fraud. \n\nI got this job because of my education credentials more than experience as I have a lot of varied experience (mostly from my time in the military directly after high school), but the role and industry im currently in are both new to me. I already feel so burnt out from going from barely a high-school grad to masters grad in 4.5 years thanks to accelerated course work. Now I am working this job and terrified I have another few years of 12 hour plus days to learn the skill sets after my work day that I will actually need to be successful. \n\nHas this happened to any one else here? How did you deal with it? I can't really just ask others on my team for advice or do what was done before because the position is also new to this company, not just new to me. My team at work is super small with very outsized responsibility and while I can ask for help on what has been done before, they hired me to innovate and no one else in my department has my skillets or the ones needed to mentor me in the hard technical skills of my role in practice. I do a lot of self learning and I figure that will likely have to be the way forward given my financial situation and other life commitments like supporting my family, but it is super daunting. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you",
