  "title:": "Choosing biochemistry vs organic chemistry",
  "text": "I'm a first year PhD student in chemistry. With chemistry at my school, you choose a specialty between biochemistry, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry and some other ones.\n\nMy lab is can be best described as a chemical biology lab. I think my professor wants me to chose organic, but the issue is that my thesis projects are all more on the biochemistry end of things. I don't do any organic synthesis or anything like that- its all cell work, and many of my projects are joint projects with some biology labs. I am worried that if I do organic and have organic as my degree,  when I go to get a job potential employers will be confused when they read my thesis to see that it is largely biochem related.\n\nSo I was thinking maybe I could do both (lots overlap in coursework) and take both written exams for organic and biochem- a sort of DIY chemical biology specialty.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of this being done before at their school?",
