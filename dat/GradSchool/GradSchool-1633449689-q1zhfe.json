  "text": "So I\u2019m in my first year of Grad school, and I'm taking a required research methods course to help prep for my thesis I want to write.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to write an experimental design on whether On Base Percentage in the MLB, is still a relevant statistic that helps teams win games.\n\nMy initial research question when i wrote it and had it reviewed, came out as a more of a correlational design.\n\nAnybody here have any ideas on what I can do with the topic to make an experimental design?",
