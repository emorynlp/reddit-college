  "text": "Idk about y\u2019all- but we\u2019re online this semester. Professors keep pushing the word hybrid but I\u2019ve been in my building only twice briefly in the past 7 weeks.\n\nI live 30 min from school. I\u2019m in a metropolitan area where nothing is really a convenient drive away. \n\nIf I don\u2019t have access to the hands on resources that I did when everything was normal then expectations for my outcomes should not be the same. If I\u2019m having to make due with low quality equipment in a small apartment then I shouldn\u2019t be expected to create works that typically was being produced on equipment that cost the school a quarter of a million dollars. \n\nToday I told my professor that I don\u2019t have the resources and I can\u2019t easily gain access to them and she wouldn\u2019t accept the fact that what we\u2019re living in is not normal and so my product will not be the same.\n\nProfessors keep trying to force the normal work load, requirements, and expectations that required an entire building dedicated to just that area of study. But no...my apartment should do just fine.\n\nNow there\u2019s talk of next semester being the same and I\u2019m all for crushing this virus BUT THATS NOT WHAT THE COUNTRY IS DOING. If this is new normal, expectations need to be altered and agreed upon by the entire school. Everyone is doing their own thing and I\u2019m EXTREMELY frustrated that next year in May, I will have earned over half of my doctoral degree online.",

      "text": "It sucks but, from my current experiences as a PhD student there are other labs and groups working near full capacity, and have been, for months now. \n\nOur building closed in March. I first stepped foot back this month, 6 months later. During that time I wrote 2 paper draft templates, designed all the experiments, and did a lot of literature review so that when the labs opened I could just walk in, collect data, and go home. \n\nAbout 2 months ago when the labs first opened my boss was in there researching, writing grants, and pulling students into the labs. \n\nIf you can go, go in the lab. You will always be more productive in the lab. That's just how it is. \n\n---\n\nI'm with you on how different things are right now. My daily routine I wake up 930, relax until 11, do some computer work or go into lab around lunch and work till 430. \n\nI come home, relax, then work a few more hours into the night. It's not the norm but I had to make it work because I have to graduate at the end of the timeline and they won't make exceptions for a semester gone for COVID.  \n\nI know how you feel man. It sucks but it's a really exercise on how to find ways to be resilient and productive when it's chaos around you.",

Started a PhD program this fall and while one of my professors is super understanding and great about recognizing complicated math is difficult to do online, the others are just plowing forward like all is normal. Compared to the other schools I attended the workload/expectations feel basically the same, despite us being asked to learn high level statistics and calculus all through slides.\n\nI imagine this is something grad students around the world are struggling with. My cohort of 15 students met together via zoom in like the second week, and everyone except one said how they felt like we're all going to fail out for sure. It's great /s",

I have professors that expect us to schedule 4-6 hours of practice sessions (going for counseling) EVERY WEEK outside of class. On top of the 9 hours I spend in class every week and the ~6 hours I put in for studying/doing assignments. \n\nI genuinely cannot keep up with this pace. I am struggling. By 9 pm every night I\u2019m having panic attacks because I didn\u2019t get to finish everything I wanted to accomplish in the day. Maybe it will get better as time goes on, but right now I\u2019m weighing the pros and cons of dropping the class and pushing my practicum start date further out. \n\nIt just sucks. I\u2019m tired.

      "text": "Yeah. I think it's like professors are getting used to it in a sense and just don't recognize how mentally, emotionally, and physically taxing this entire situation still is. Maybe it's because they're older and they have their own spouses/families, whereas many grad students, for example, live alone and have so little normal interaction with people anymore. I already struggled with motivation but now I'm lucky if I feed myself a proper amount of food in a day because I can't be bothered to do it. Much less having the capacity to focus on research and classes. \n\nThis attitude in zoom classes is also bothering me as well. When things first went virtual last semester, there was a lot of leniency-- turn your cameras off in class if you need to, take a break, let people know of you need extensions, etc... And just generally also lowering workload and expectations. Now this semester it's like they expect everyone to suddenly be adjusted. All of my classes don't want you to ever turn your camera off. And I don't care. I need a break from the screen. I need a break from looking at myself. This isn't normal. This semester I'm also taking a required course that is well known in our department to easily be double the work it should be, and we're just continuing to let it be that way, despite zoom making the nature of the class itself even more difficult (it's a course on language documentation, and we actually work with a consultant and document the language...  So it's several hours a week over zoom of listening to and transcribing sounds. It's God awful).\n\nIdk what else to say except I hear you. I'm sorry that your professor wasn't receptive to your comments about your capacity to work right now. I hope things improve for you in some way, and even if you can't make your advisors understand, you can find some solidarity in other students' experiences. You aren't alone, so many people feel this way.",

          "text": "I\u2019m totally there with you in the lack of social interaction. The pandemic has by far been the hardest on those who live alone. I\u2019m realizing how much I get my motivation to work and do other things by watching other people. Seeing other people working makes me want to work. Seeing them eat reminds me I\u2019m hungry too. Seeing them break to go for a walk reminds me breaks and exercise are important and maybe I should join them. Now I\u2019ve gone months on end with *none* of those visual cues? I\u2019ve had to reach in deep to find \u2018inner\u2019 motivators. Tbh sometimes they\u2019re just not there. \n\nI don\u2019t mind having video on for zoom classes. I usually adjust my view so it only shows the professor and their screen. When I\u2019ve given lectures and presentations a few times, I wanted to see people\u2019s faces and not just a bunch of black squares, so that I could see if they laughed at my joke or just know that I wasn\u2019t only speaking out into the ether. The only time I don\u2019t like to have my video on is if I\u2019m eating (I have an evening class) and then I will turn it off while I eat then turn it back on. There are other pros and cons. I save about an hour of my life for each class by not driving to school and walking to campus, so I\u2019m able to have more productive hours of the day. I do miss visiting and bonding with my classmates. And I definitely get your point that it\u2019s hard to be on a computer for so many hours a week. But I was already working in a research job so I think I\u2019m more used to that.",

But I have some issues with body image and I can't help but stare at my face the whole time and get anxious about how I look for the entire class. I've tried turning off self view but my anxiety about how I look just leads me to turn it back on again. Also, sometimes I just want to chill on my couch, or otherwise just kind of sit in a way that doesn't look like I'm paying attention necessarily (even though I still am!), as opposed to sitting up straight at my desk, looking into the camera for several hours a day.\n\nYeah missing classmates is definitely the hardest part. We're trying to implement a virtual like... Lunch or coffee hour to mimic even a little bit those small interactions we had throughout the day.",

Thank you for sharing that with me because I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone personally who is struggling with it. But apparently it\u2019s super common for both men and women, and can be very distressing to some people, especially if part of their coping is to avoid looking in the mirror, which can be a trigger for someone with body image issues to examine their flaws. I can\u2019t imagine dealing with that then suddenly having to look at my face for hours every day on my computer screen. Most of the advice given (other than therapy) says to turn on speaker view and scroll down the participant squares so you cant see your little square. But I know that doesn\u2019t help you if you\u2019re then anxious about not knowing what others are seeing.\n\nI\u2019ll keep your comment in mind in the future - there are a few people that I have regular zoom meetings with who are always very hesitant to turn on their video, and honestly it bothered me. Because if I\u2019m not wearing makeup and have my hair in a messy ponytail, why do you think I\u2019d care how you look? But I never considered that they could be suffering from poor body image. In that case I would never ask them to share video with me. Thanks again for sharing.",

If you're interested in learning more, I recommend reading up on \"checking\" behavior relating to body dysmorphia!

I'm thankful that my professors have mostly managed their expectations and I deliberately kept a low workload this semester because I knew I was going to be significantly challenged to meet even the basic requirements of grad school. I just want to say you're not alone. I also live in a tiny, messy apartment with no where to go to (no more campus or Starbucks study sessions that I've relied on my whole career) feeling totally unmotivated and challenged by world events every single day. It's exhausting. Getting even the minimalist of minimal tasks done is exhausting when before all of this it would have been so easy. I really hope that your professors and mentors begin realizing that we are in such an unprecedented time and everyone is facing difficult and unique challenges, and put simply, the same standard cannot be met by most people right now. They'll either have to figure it out over time or when their students stop being able to meet their expectations.\n\nLike, god, I sit on my balcony hoping to get a change of scenery and get bitten by so many bugs that I'm itching for a week.
