  "text": "Results just came out, y'all, and I got 74 on an exam with a median score of 39 (the class scores were so low that the board of examiners were called in and everything was rescaled, so my transcript will show an 83!) \n\nBest of all, I haven't thought of a convenient way to explain away this win. It wasn't material I've covered before, or an evaluation format I'm especially confident with... I guess it's a part time program and I'm not currently working, and that could give me an edge? Sure, if I REALLY want to pass it off as a fluke. But I'm inclined to own this.\n\nReally needed this after a couple borderline final course marks, and going into a highly uncertain assignment. I hope everyone comes out of midterm season with feeling like this.",

I wish STEM profs would just test us on things we know.",

Either that or people ended up fighting the professor tooth and nail over pointless shit because that's just what they thought talking to a professor is like.",

This school seems to be more regimented. They can't change the pass mark (there are no letter grades) and apparently they can't rescale the grades without intervention by a board of examiners. \n\nI've taken 2 mixed classes before. One just had longer and harder homework and exams for the graduate students. The other had the same work for all but I think higher grade cutoffs for grads.",
