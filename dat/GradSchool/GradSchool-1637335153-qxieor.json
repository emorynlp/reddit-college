  "text": "I'm sure y'all have heard this before, but I'm up for a promotion and the last barrier is being enrolled/having completed a master's program. Unfortunately I didn't think I'd do post grad so didn't care about my GPA, ended up with a 2.5 in an interdisciplinary field (biology/sociology, I have social work experience but don't want to be a social worker). I also have a very small amount of bioinformatics/data science experience and have self taught myself to code but seriously nothing impressive.\n\nSo yeah, what is the easiest program to get into? I want a really school and a challenge, but my GPA and lack of a specialized degree leaves me with no clue where to apply. Feels like I don't qualify anywhere. I'd prefer something in CS or public health but in a pinch anything is good\n\nWhen I searched every question was asking about easiest program to complete, and it feels insulting to go to a degree mill. I don't want to spend that kind of money on a piece of paper lol. Which is why I made my own post \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "For the difficulty of my masters i would say it's been very much what I make it. Its been easier to get better grades (which makes sense as to stay in the program I pretty much need to only make As or Bs and otherwise I'd get kicked out.) But the content hasn't been easier although some has been more practical. I have a lot more flexibility to choose between a variety of relevant courses. Once I finish it, I'll be much prouder of completing my masters than my bachelors even if I found getting good grades to be easier for my masters.\n\nI don't have a specific University recommendation, but I would look for a physical accredited universities that doesn't only have online degrees. State universities may be an option? If you're in between getting a thesis or non-thesis masters I'd say thesis will create an additional challenge. I know a lot of schools have a strict cut-off at 3.0 but there are schools that don't. I'd reach out to some potential advisors before applying and see if they'd want you as a student (if you're going the thesis route).  If you're applying for Fall 2022, do this asap as at least in my area app deadlines vary from Nov 1st - Feb 1st.",

If you convince them you're going to be able to do the job then you'll get in cause they'll tell their PI they want you. (Never underestimate the pain of having to interview people.)",
