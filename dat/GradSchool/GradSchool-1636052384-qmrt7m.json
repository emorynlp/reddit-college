  "text": "Ok so my primary mentor came to me today and said after talking with my committee, they want a draft of the literature review for my dissertation completed by December 15. I recently had to change my dissertation topic, so I am not an expert in this area yet and while I'm good with a time crunch, I don't know how to crank this out! Has anyone does this before?? Any advice or suggestions?? A schedule for how to get it done??",

      "text": "Put together a general search strategy, and modify it as needed to give you a sense of what's out there for your topic/question. Helps to try to find a few primary papers that you can base your review/argument around and come back to to guide your thinking and understand the state of the evidence. Looking through references of papers you find is also helpful! As long as you don't have to do a systematic/scoping review, a literature review is much more relaxed in process. There's no way you will ever find/know everything. Just do the best you can, make notes on what you find, outline your writing as you go (just get something on paper!) and just try to pull it together as you start to understand it better! Good luck!",
