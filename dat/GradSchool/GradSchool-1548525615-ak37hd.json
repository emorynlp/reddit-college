They are great people and they had a lot of projects that I could help out with and get authorship on. However, there was a huge language barrier, especially because they did not speak in English unless they were trying to explain something. Even after applying the principle of charity they were still hard to understand. Great, hardworking, and smart students (both undergrad and prospective grad) that were native English speakers were turned off and went elsewhere because of the persistent use of Chinese. PI's want what is best for their lab, and I have seen it first hand how my PI has gotten burned by great prospective students choosing elsewhere because of the barrier. Some PI's just don't want to take that kind of risk. You can call it judgmental and discriminatory, but they do have the right to choose who they want in their lab. Just choose not to be in their lab if you don't like how they treat those kinds of people.",

Literally everyone else is native Chinese doing either their PhD/post doc/a year abroad at my university. \n\nI have no issues with them conversing with each other in their mother tongue. After a year of it, it\u2019s sort of become background noise to me, and I\u2019ve become very good at ignoring it. However, my PI (who is also Chinese) is **adamant** that all the students (try to) speak English while on campus. He\u2019s even put me to \u201cpolice\u201d the group, and tell him whenever they aren\u2019t speaking English (obviously I don\u2019t do that, I would never). \n\nHowever, one particular point he made was for them to not speak Chinese while in the (public) lounge area where many of them have lunch (and where there are often others doing work/eating, too). He says it\u2019s rude and unfair to the other people there who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying. \n\nPersonally, I agree with him. I can see why he says that. You\u2019re coming to school in the US for a reason. If you\u2019re here, *while you\u2019re at work*, you should speak in English when you\u2019re around *strangers*. If you\u2019re around someone who has made it clear they are not affected by what you\u2019re doing (as I have with my lab mates), then do as you wish.  But not everyone is comfortable with that, and I think it makes some people resentful. \n\nJust my two cents. \n\nEdit: I do think her \u201cwarning\u201d of professors being less likely to take on international students is uncalled for.

Don't think I've spoken to him too much in my mother tongue actually. I fully support this as the student can think about their research in english and become a better communicator.\n\nOutside research, however, when it comes to talking and socializing, who cares? Some people might be truly excited to speak in their mother tongue with other people, this is seriously a bad move.\n\n&#x200B;",

I have personally benefitted tremendously, beyond all my expectations, from peer networking. \n\nSpeaking a language that is not shared by everyone present creates a barrier to peer networking that may lead to missing out on opportunities, simply because the person with the relevant knowledge (of a fellowship or research opportunity) did not know that your interests aligned with the opportunity. If they have a friend in grad school who mentioned needing someone to assist with, let's just say research on Parkinson, and they overheard you chatting with a friend about your interest in Parkinson research, it would have jogged their memory to say, \"Hey, my friend is looking for someone to help with their Parkinson project, I can give them your email address if you're interested!\"\n\nThis happens with considerable frequency in my field. Word of mouth and peer networking about your research interests is a potent means of finding opportunities. So, using a shared language in shared spaces increases the probability of learning about opportunities that fit your interests.\n",

I'm Romanian, having studied at an American university placed in Germany and scored almost perfect for TOEFL and they made me come anyway, despite me pointing out the rules that I am well above the threshold score where I would need additional proof of English.

When you're tired, your words sometimes just leave you and you're stuck trying to say things in the simplest terms. There are times when what you need is to fall back on your native tongue because your second language is failing you at that specific moment. \n\nThere is enough difficulty in grad school that this sort of ridiculous policing of how students manage their personal time is just simply inexcusable.",

In European countries, it means the national language or English. \n\nWhy? Because English is the lingua franca of science, international business, and international finance. \n\nFor a related story, I was working in Switzerland, where colleagues often spoke German, French and sometimes Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese in addition to English. And the same way that those colleagues would switch to English if someone didn\u2019t understand those languages, **I** would slow down my English and speak without vernacular expressions even when I was speaking to another American so I could be understood by everyone party to the conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s not polite to speak your own language loudly where no one else can understand you, especially if you\u2019re being exclusionary and always forming cliques where you speak that language. It\u2019s good to mix with your colleagues, and that means muddling through the best you can in whatever language is mutually spoken. \n\nIn scientific circles, the common denominator language is almost always English. \n\n\nTo be clear\u2014this email is in tremendously bad taste. But the impetus is not wrong\u2014if students from particular linguistic communities are forming isolated social circles and aren\u2019t integrating into the department, that probably will limit their professional opportunities. \n\nHowever\u2014that isn\u2019t what the email said, which implies that loud Chinese in the break room is the problem, which is just fucked up.

Functional ability in English does not translate to ease of interpersonal interaction in English (or any language). \n\n3. Some people are just shitty writers. The worst writers I've edited for we're native English speakers.\n\n4. Editing for someone who is not native tongue can be complicated not because their English is bad per se, but because their language has a different cadence and awkward construction. If you're not familiar with their first language, it can be hard to hear what they're trying to say and sort out how the cadence or structure of their mother tongue might be working it's way into their English. That doesn't mean they're a bad writer per se. It means that you don't have experience editing writing from someone of their background. As someone who does a lot of editing for a non-native speaker, it is also an acquired skill.\n\n5. Communication with someone who is speaking their second (or third or fourth) language requires effort on both the side of the speaker and patience/effort on the side of the listener. It requires learning their accent, cadence, and mannerisms, and using that to understand what they're saying. Many monolingual Americans are not used to doing this work and assume the communication difficulty is only on the side of the speaker, when that's not true.",

But why should they be obliged to switch to English whenever they socialize in your presence? I became close with my German and Taiwanese colleagues by chatting with them in German and Mandarin, or at the very least demonstrating some effort to do so on my part. You're entitled to their companionship and inconvenience during their free time because you \"felt lonely and frustrated\" about a lack of \"camaraderie\"? Idk dude, that sounds like your problem not theirs. Maybe they just didn't want to be friends with you - camaraderie isn't something you're entitled to, especially not from a group of people who you expect compromise from without any intention of reciprocation.

Many international students come here to do science with little english speaking skills. They are the ones mostly isolated who is starting from scratch. It\u2019s a huge struggle to go from somewhere you belong to you don\u2019t culturally, and sometimes just talking in your native tongue in the break room is a great relief and fun. Not everything has to be so serious.\n\nI am sorry that your cohort acted that way and I feel like these are sort of different scenarios. They just sound plain mean. From my personal experience my international peers have been fun to learn from. Yeah, they\u2019ll talk in their native tongue amongst each other but it makes me happy that I am at a place where diversity is tolerated. That the international students can still be themselves while also learning english and interact with others.",
