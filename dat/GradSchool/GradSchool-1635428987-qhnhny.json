  "text": "The very first paper I wrote got rejected, first paper rejection \ud83e\udd72, real blow to my ego. The paper was definitely not of the level of the journal, reviewers made it really clear after 4 months of review.\nHow do you people get the motivation to improve the paper and submit it somewhere else, I don't even want to look at it anymore let alone work on it",

      "text": "Is the critique helpful?\n\nOne thing about rejections is that if the deem the paper irredeemable the review report will simply be \"I do not recommend this paper for publication\" but if you got a couple of pages of feedback with suggestions on how to improve they saw something in the paper.\n\nTake the feedback as reviewers believing in your work, work on the paper and resubmit.\n\n\nRejection is a huge part of this career and gets easier with time.",

I'm currently in the process of making changes based on all their suggestions, it's really frustrating to see people just didn't get what you were saying all along the paper \ud83e\udd72. I think I got some good ideas while updating the paper and will add them as well, so at least that's good.",

      "text": "I feel the same way, even after nearly 20 publications. And I anticipate it will be the same forever. \n\nIt\u2019s hard not to take criticism personally especially when it\u2019s something you worked hard on. My first gut reaction to critiques always feels like self-defense (\u201cthey\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m right\u201d) and I struggle to separate the objectivity from my personal feelings. \n\nBut what works for me is to first read the reviews ONCE. Then give myself a day or two to distance myself from feeling personally attacked. Then after a couple days my head is usually in a much more logical place and more open to feedback. \n\nAfter you\u2019re able to accept the feedback, begin to work on each comment one by one, starting with the easiest first (minor things usually). Once you get momentum then you\u2019ll feel like it will be no problem to finish the rest. \n\nOnce you complete the revisions and resubmit, you\u2019ll look back and think \u201cwow this version is so much better than my original one!\u201d \n\nYou got this!",

The best thing to do right now, after reading the feedback, is just put it away and don\u2019t look at it for at least a week. Work on something else to focus your mind on other things. Then when you go back to this paper, it won\u2019t sting as much, and you\u2019ll be able to see more clearly what you need to do to improve it and it won\u2019t seem so daunting.",

      "text": "Not sure what your lab situation is like bit I know some labs have \"rejection parties\".\n\nIt's a huge accomplishment to submit a paper PERIOD so no matter the outcome so you should celebrate, and instead of celebrating the submission you celebrate getting back reviews. And if you make it so getting rejected gets a party and accepted does not, it acknowledges that the accomplishment of getting back up and pushing yourself to continue after a rejection is much more impressive than getting lucky on the first round of reviews after submission. \n\nIdk I think it's nice and helps with getting over it and persevering to the submission.",

      "text": "It is unfortunately quite common. Journals sometimes do this to pad their impact factor. Perhaps you could take a break, it is a humbling experience, and motivation to improve. \n\nMany times the rejection is due to reviewers being unable to understand, rather than the actual substance of the paper. If you are convinced that the paper's innovation is of importance, spend some time organizing your thoughts better. Graduate school is filled with creative people who think step A-step C-step E-step-I, but when writing the paper, it is important to write it as A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I.\n\nAlso, it is important to understand that peer review means that the paper may go to researchers who are not in your field and know nothing of what you are doing.",
