  "text": "So I finished my masters in English last year. For my thesis, I wrote about 65 pages pretty much reinventing the whole creative writing undergraduate course catalogue and I want to publish it. I\u2019m just not sure where to publish it since the work is so long. Anyone have any advice? \nI have thought about KDP.",

Is there a way to do that which makes good sense for how it is currently arranged?\n\nOne could be an argument for why you think the creative writing program needs revised. One could be what that curriculum revision entails.",

              "text": "Yes. For academic publishing 65 pages isn\u2019t a book, the general expectation is that an MA thesis (or PhD dissertation) will be significantly revised for publication. Most academic articles (in my discipline, literary studies) are 20-30 pages. (6,000-8,000) words. And wherever it goes is going to depend on what your research focus is. If it\u2019s reworking creative writing curriculum, then Education or Pedagogy journals would be a decent place to start. Look at what they\u2019re looking for. \n\nThis is just coming from someone who has been adamant that they want to write their dissertation as close to a book manuscript as possible, and has experienced first hand how disruptive that is to the system, and therefore learned a lot about the mechanisms of the system. \n\nSomeone else may be able to advise you better regarding where you might publish it as-is, but my general understanding (I didn\u2019t do a thesis in my MA, we did a culminating project) is that you can *ideally* get an article or two out of your thesis after revising toward that goal. \n\nIt may not go into a journal that is exactly what your specialization is/was, but you should think along disciplinary lines so that you can meet the expectations of certain journals. \n\nHere is a list compiled by Brandeis:\n\nhttps://www.brandeis.edu/writing-program/resources/research-pedagogy/journals.html\n\nAnd another list: https://www.criticalcreativewriting.org/journals.html\n\nArts and Humanities in Higher Education Journal might be good, too.",
