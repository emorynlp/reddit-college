One could be what that curriculum revision entails.",

              "text": "Yes. For academic publishing 65 pages isn\u2019t a book, the general expectation is that an MA thesis (or PhD dissertation) will be significantly revised for publication. Most academic articles (in my discipline, literary studies) are 20-30 pages. (6,000-8,000) words. And wherever it goes is going to depend on what your research focus is. If it\u2019s reworking creative writing curriculum, then Education or Pedagogy journals would be a decent place to start. Look at what they\u2019re looking for. \n\nThis is just coming from someone who has been adamant that they want to write their dissertation as close to a book manuscript as possible, and has experienced first hand how disruptive that is to the system, and therefore learned a lot about the mechanisms of the system. \n\nSomeone else may be able to advise you better regarding where you might publish it as-is, but my general understanding (I didn\u2019t do a thesis in my MA, we did a culminating project) is that you can *ideally* get an article or two out of your thesis after revising toward that goal. \n\nIt may not go into a journal that is exactly what your specialization is/was, but you should think along disciplinary lines so that you can meet the expectations of certain journals. \n\nHere is a list compiled by Brandeis:\n\nhttps://www.brandeis.edu/writing-program/resources/research-pedagogy/journals.html\n\nAnd another list: https://www.criticalcreativewriting.org/journals.html\n\nArts and Humanities in Higher Education Journal might be good, too.",

That's not a book. That's a little bit too long academic journal article.\n\nMoreover, you are likely to have to rework it a lot for an academic journal article. The exigence and audiences are different for a thesis versus an academic article.\n\nWhat does that mean that you reinvented the creative writing course catalog? Do you mean at your institution? Or did you research a significant sample of creative writing programs in the US, and what you're doing is significantly different?\n\nFinally, a better first step might be to submit for AWP next year. Get some feedback on your ideas from creative writing teachers. And then develop your journal article.",

I would recommend first deciding on which journal you are going to submit, then rewriting to match the structure and standards of the magazine.",

      "text": "Some recommendations, from a PhD in Creative Writing:\n\n* First, think about the reason *why* you want to publish. If you just want to get your work out in front of an audience, then sure, KDP works just fine! But if you want this to be the beginning of a career in creative writing studies scholarship/future PhD work/a tenure track job, then you'll want to head the peer-reviewed route for publication.\n* Second, publishers can be tricky about thesis work (if it's published via your institution's library, publishers sometimes consider it already published), so check on access and embargo details from your library. Again, if you go KDP, this wouldn't be a concern.\n* Check out the [Journal of Creative Writing Studies](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/jcws/), if you haven't already. I know people have given you some recs for reworking your thesis into articles, and that's the journal that came to my mind first. Even just as a reference for future writing projects/publication, it's a good place to start with pedagogy-oriented creative writing research.\n* I'm sure you had to do a ton of reading/research for the thesis, so you're probably well aware of recent trends/changes in CW studies pedagogy: anti-racist, inclusive, dismantling Iowa workshop model, genre writing, game writing, digital writing, etc. Consider how you fit\u2014what's the gap you're trying to fill, and how does your work do so. How does it compare with other recent texts? If you're planning to pitch a book to a press, you're going to have to demonstrate why this stands out alongside other stellar CW studies research.",
