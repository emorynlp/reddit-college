  "text": "Prof or PI didn't explain something well? Ask them to clarify. Didn't understand a paper? Make it known. You have a procedure that you would like to try that another student or post doc knows like the back of their hand? Ask them to check your protocol. Don't feel the need to apologize for not knowing things, especially if you're new to them. \n\nI don't mean to get preachy, but this is a lesson that I have learned (and keep learning tbh) many times over the course of my grad school career because I thought I always needed to figure everything out myself and it would look bad to ask for help.\n\nSeriously, don't forget that you are in grad school to learn. If you knew everything, you would have a PhD (or a masters) already. It takes a village to raise a grad student. Ask all the questions!",

However, if I can save time just by asking that one stupid question then I am gonna ask that stupid question.\n\nI\u2019d rather ask a dumb question, get clarification and do well on a protocol then to try to figure it out myself and waste a whole week just because I didn\u2019t do something properly. It\u2019s good to learn through mistakes, but science is collaborative. If you can learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes, that\u2019s also just as valuable and much more time saving.",

Yes, and so do most of my colleagues. Ask questions\u2026.. if a professor seems to be keen on being rude and you feel you\u2019re being graded very unfairly, contact the administration ASAP.

      "text": "This advice is so so so important. I had a very hard time transitioning from undergrad honours (which I throughly enjoyed) to PhD life because I felt extremely isolated and alone. It was a new project and a new field (for both myself and my PI), with no directly relevant expertise in the lab - so my PI straight up said I will have to do a lot of the groundwork to get this project off the ground bc we were all \u2018none the wiser\u2019 and I had to do a LOT of learning as i went along. \n\nBut I think besides the inherent challenges of acclimatising to grad school, a lot of my anxiety was also due to self-imposed pressure. I think as grad students we have the innate drive to be curious / independent problem-solvers and I had to learn that it is ok to ask for help because talking it out & brainstorming always supersedes being stuck on an issue on a spiralling, endless loop trying to solve it alone. \n\nConversations and discourse helps you realize that hey, maybe this issue can be solved in a different way (bc someone else may have had prior experiences and can advise you on better ways to troubleshoot and you can learn a new technique in the process); or simply that this problem you\u2019re facing is equally confounding for others - but that discourse is necessary and helps me feel less helpless and alone in my scientific journey!\n\nI have a piece of paper filled with positive affirmations that I\u2019ve stuck on my bench to look at everyday the past 2 years & some that really helped me was \u2018if you never ask, the answer will always be no\u2019 (wrt asking for help) ; and \u2018trust the process, your progress will look different everyday and that is ok - just keep showing up and do the work & everything will fall into place\u2019 - a lot of grad school is pure grit & pacing yourself as you go along but an essential part of it is also learning how to ask for help, and learning that it is perfectly OK to not have the answers. being independent doesn\u2019t mean doing it all on your own or knowing it all, it means taking charge to find the people / resources that can facilitate you in your learning process & to get the help you need!",

Googled, didn\u2019t get anywhere. Asked my supervisor, he didn\u2019t know. Asked others in the department who use the same code, they didn\u2019t know.\n\nAfter about 2-3 weeks of this I decided to take the plunge and open a ticket on the code\u2019s official GitHub repository. The developers (who I\u2019ve never met) found the problem in about an hour. And now I know what the error was, it definitely *wasn\u2019t* something that I was ever going to find on my own.\n\n2-3 might sound like a long time to be struggling, but I think when it comes to bothering the developers it\u2019s a good idea to leave it as a last resort. Opening a ticket usually means \u201cthere\u2019s a bug in your code\u201d, so it was a last *last* resort! But glad I did it still",

Here's a few extra cents:\n\nThe above advice goes for everything!\n\n- if you haven't written a paper before, and are unsure of your supervisors expectations ask them! If they tell you they want a first draft in 2 weeks, you will write one in two weeks (instead of 2 months, or even longer!)\n- ask them how long it should take to do something - if it's taking longer - ask for help\n- people get sick of helping you, or say they're too busy, ask someone else - it's *your supervisors job to help you*\n\nEspecially do this in your first year! The more help you get in your first year, the less help you'll need in your second and third and beyond!\n\nHave regular meetings specifically designed for you to ask any questions you have, at that exact moment, no matter how mundane. Challenge yourself to answer as many questions, or solve as many problems, as you can before the meeting, but if you haven't done so by then - ask about it in the meeting.",
