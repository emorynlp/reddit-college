  "title:": "Accounting error, UCLA is saying they undercharged me",
  "text": "Hiya, I\u2019m not really sure where to ask this\u2026 and I understand that it may incorporate legal advice so to be clear Im not looking for that,\n\nBut I\u2019m in my last quarter at UCLA and have been running on student grad loans. I was charged normally at the beginning  of this quarter but now, only a few weeks from my graduation, I received a notice from my grad department that an accounting error caused them to under charge me by about 3 grand and I am responsible for it.\n\nThis is difficult for me, because I assumed that the reimbursement I got was correct and the funds have already been allocated elsewhere. \n\nHas anyone seen this situation before? Do I have any options besides find the money?\n\nThanks",

      "text": "I have not been in this position, but I would ask for an itemized receipt along with a history of the alleged accounting error, and an explanation of why nobody \"discovered\" this until now. \n\nI do not pay anything without seeing what I am paying for, period. \n\nWhen I worked for my local government, I spoke with an employee in another department who was given a raise, which they were excited about, but then received an email saying that the hourly increase was in error and they need to pay it back. So you may end up being on the hook for it regardless. Unfortunately, this seems most likely to me. \n\nIn those situations, I really think either the company, or the employee responsible for the error, should be the one who pays.",

My director was going to consider it a wash on their books but then the dean freaked out I guess.\n\nI really sucks because it only affects those of us with loans\u2026 the ones who are most strapped for cash.",
