  "text": "I asked this professor if he was willing to write me a letter of rec for grad school in the beginning of the summer. Deadline application was Dec 15th. He told me to sent him my personal statement. Due to some family issues I was late in sending that to him and only sent it December 1st and asked him if he was STILL willing to write me a letter of rec and it was understandable if not since he only had a bit over 2 weeks to write it. He replied and said he was happy to write it despite being short notice. I submitted his name Dec 9th and today is Dec 16th and he still hasn\u2019t submitted anything. It was due yesterday. I have sent him two emails to remind him one before the deadline and one on the day of. Plus the email that the grad school sent him. What am i supposed to do now? Grad school does accept letters of rec late since the rest of my application is submitted. \nKeep in mind i have taken three classes with this prof and 4.0 all three of them. He is known to be a strict professor so not many students take this many classes with him and try to avoid him. He recognizes me in classes and calls me by my nickname so he def knows me as a student.",

      "text": "Even though the application portal is locked for you, the link that got sent out to your professor most likely will remain active for a bit. These systems are designed keeping in mind the end-of-term-right-before-christmas nature of grad school applications. \nAlso, as someone who served on the graduate admission committee, I can guarantee you that people don't start looking at these applications before Late December/Early January.",

      "text": "Try to breathe.  I know you're under a lot of pressure and you want everything to just be in.  It will get there.  I would seriously give him until Monday, though. I am a new professor and you have to step back and consider that, for many of us, it's finals week and it is absolute BEDLAM right now in our respective worlds and stuff like this can fall to the wayside very, very easily.  Yes, even though he gave you two weeks' notice, as there are many fires to put out, so to speak, around this time of the semester.  Like, I am pulling all nighters just to get grades in at the moment.  I would most likely be late in this situation, too.\n\nIt's only the next day and this literally happens ALL the time (i.e., professors sometimes submit application materials late).  In fact, if I remember correctly, this situation actually did end up happening to me but I still got in.  It will get sorted out and if you have a long-standing relationship, I'm sure the professor is slammed right now and is not doing this out of malice.\n\nHang in there and good luck with your applications.",

      "text": "This happened to me while applying to programs. I needed 4 recommendations and one of my professors just didn\u2019t submit it. I sent countless reminders and still nothing. I ended up missing out on applying to that particular school because of it. Just try to remain calm the link the school sent to him should still work. If he is serious about doing the letter he is most likely still able to submit it.",
