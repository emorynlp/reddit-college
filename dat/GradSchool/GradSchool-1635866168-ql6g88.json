  "text": "Hello everyone I\u2019m finishing up my graduate program applications for a PhD in biochemistry and all of the applications state either \u201c3 letters of recommendation\u201d or some specify \u201cat least 3 letters of recommendation\u201d. I was wondering if submitting more than 3 to the ones that did not specify at least 3 would hurt my chances of getting in or if the ones that come in after the third will not be counted. Thank you for advice in advanced and good luck to everyone else applying in this current cycle.",

      "text": "If they specifically say 3, submitting more than 3 looks worse, not better. It either comes across like you're trying to gain an extra advantage or that you didn't specifically read the directions for that school. \n\nIf they say at least 3, you'd still probably want to submit 3 but extra's aren't a bad thing.",

      "text": "If they say \"only 3\", don't submit more.\n\nIf they say \"at least 3\", more than 3 is fine as long as it isn't crazy. Four would be fine. Five is really pushing it. Six is straight up weird (and not committee wants to read all that). If you have room for an extra, make it strategic! If 3 professors can speak to your research experience, make your 4th talk about your great value as a TA. This is a good place to include recommenders who might not have as much \"prestige\" as your main three but can speak to different talents.",

      "text": "Just supporting what others said. If they said only three, don't do more than 3. If they said at least 3 you're safe to do more than 3.\n\nHonestly you could email the program director for wherever you're applying to and ask what they'd prefer if you're extra worried. They'll probably appreciate you being unafraid to talk to faculty.",
