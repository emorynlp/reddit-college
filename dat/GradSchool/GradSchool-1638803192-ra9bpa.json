  "text": "Hey, Guys.\nI am looking forward to studying MS in Business Analytics and have been through all potential schools offering Business Analytics Masters. I am stuck between the need to give the entrance exam and the want to not give it. I recently got diagnosed with migraine, which is making it quite painful for me to stick my eyes onto the screen and focus on the exam, given I have only 13 days left to prepare and give the whole exam. I talked to the ESCP school authority regarding their msba admission requirements and they said they don't want any score. Warwick and Imperial Business Schools implies the same but I don't know whether it will be feasible to not submit a score. Now, I want you guys to suggest, whether I should give an exam or take a risk and submit an application to the ESCP business analytics program? My main target school is ESCP and I wanted to keep Warwick as the backup. Any advice? Thanks in advance",
