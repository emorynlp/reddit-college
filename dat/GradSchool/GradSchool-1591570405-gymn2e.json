  "text": "Today marked the end of a 5 year journey, three degrees and more sleepless nights than I can count. The amount of obstacles, overcome are only overshadowed by my student debt \ud83e\udd23. \n\nThere were many days and nights I considered stopping, that certainly there was no way to press on, but I did. \u201cWhen walking through hell, the only thing you can do is to take another step\u201d \n\nI say this all because damn it I\u2019m proud, of myself, my family, my cohort. I\u2019m proud that I didn\u2019t give up, and that I\u2019m better for it. \n\nHonestly just wanted to reflect, as a virtual graduation leaves one a little wanting. Congratulations to all who graduated in 2020, and those who come after! We can do it!",
