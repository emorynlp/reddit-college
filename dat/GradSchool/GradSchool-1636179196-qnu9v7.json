  "text": "Hi. I'm in my final semester for my master's and am planning on applying for a PhD. I'm studying CS.\n\nI've always wanted to cook and work in a kitchen. I'm 29 now and am wondering whether this whole academia thing was because of external pressures like my parents or friends.\n\nHas anybody here ever made such a drastic career change? Do you regret it?",

Low pay, long, unpredictable hours, lots of night/overnights, high stress, being a sweaty stinky mess, having to work with people of ill repute, difficult path for career advancement...\n\nIf you like cooking and like food, you can definitely do that kind of thing without it being your career. I experiment in the kitchen all the time, and read cookbooks like normal people read novels. I may even sign up for a cooking class at my local community college if my schedule will allow it. If you decide graduate school is not for you, that's fine, but I would strongly suggest thinking about an alternate career that provides you the ratio of stability, income, and work-life balance you value.",

Before I started my PhD program, I worked in retail and in local government collecting taxes. To say I was rusty was an understatement lol You may have some extra catching up to do, but if you were totally unqualified and had no potential to succeed, you would not have been admitted. The admissions committee obviously saw something special, so if you haven't already, maybe try reaching out to your adviser to see what resources may be available to you.",

Then, I finally get into a reputable program in a university with many resources, but during the worst possible time (pandemic restrictions, divorce, illness, plus everything that comes with a first year of grad school in a new place). I'm in my second year (and last), and I'm just going with the flow right now. The only thing I enjoy is TAing (despite having an absolute micromanaging maniac as my boss). I love my students, and I love teaching, so I know at least I need a Masters even for other jobs that I see myself doing. However, every class I take seems absolutely pointless, I will never use anything I'm studying at the moment, and working on any research feels like torture. I keep telling myself to just finish it, but just thinking about having a whole thesis due next April causes my brain to shut down. I'm at a crossroads.",

Do something with it. This does not mean CS has to take the majority of your free time. You can do freelance work/work part time. If you don't have software engineer experience, it's best you get some before you venture out of the field, since you are still in gradschool, look for a summer internship. 3 month commitment but it adds something to your CS work history. \n\n\n\nIdea: COVID has been hard on the restaurant industry amd there are probably some mom&pop restaurants that haven't linked there restaurant to a modern-full-stack website. Offer to create a website for pay, or in exchange for some cooking lessons/time in the kitchen to see what working in a kitchen would be like. \n\n\nYou can also get a part-time kitchen job for funsies. Once you gain a better understanding into what you want to pursue you can decide what you do full time and what you do part time. \n\n\nDo not live your life to meet the expectations of someone else. Do what fulfills you.",

I do regret leaving, as I would have probably gotten a full time position teaching by now, but maybe not. \n\nI wish I could say I learned some valuable lessons in all this, but I can not.",

It's not one to choose just because you \"want\" it. You better love it and be consumed by it. \n\nYou'll need to go to culinary school. And then you'll need to train for several years by working underneath accomplished chefs. Where the hours can be worse than being a graduate research assistant. \n\nAnd then good chefs who run their own kitchens often work 70 to 80 hours a week or more throughout their career.\n\nAt least I'm assuming you don't mean just being a line cook in a restaurant making a few dollars more than minimum wage. If that's what you want to do, just take a year off after the Masters and try it.",

Yeah, I agree that working in kitchens sucks, but it's not like you're trapped if you decide to try it. Why not take a year off before applying to your PhD and go see what it's like?

      "text": "I left my my masters program last year. For most of my undergrad I was encouraged by a few profs to pursue the program at the uni I was attending. Eventually I figured it was the right move, and was getting very, very excited by it. I got accepted the year I applied and even won scholarships to cover most of my tuition. I thought I hit the jackpot. My first day, I knew it wasn't actually for me. But I held out because I was told I'd be a great fit and it would be go far with it, but I was absolutely miserable, trying to convince myself it was right.\n\nThing is, I hate being isolated, don't like the politics, disinterested in the content and the career options seemed abundant, but was just not where I wanted to be. After my 1st semester, I dropped half my course load, and after my first year, I dropped out completely.\n\nI landed a job related to my program/undergrad ( ironic and lucky, I know) and took it to see if I'd feel right in this career path and thought it'd help me understand if I made the right decision to leave. Well, it did.\n\nI don't fit well into the work culture, I still don't like being isolated all day and I can't work from a desk, not moving around and interacting. I finish my contract next month and have began transitioning to a totally new field that I'm actually excited for and has me working in a way I am good at working. So for me, leaving my masters saved my mental health, my bank account, my well being, and honestly, with everything else going on, my life. It can feel like a waste of time, quitting before you're done, but if you know it's not for you, then there's nothing you can do but move on. Life's too short to stay in misery and not explore your options.\n\nFor reference I'm 27 and was scared shitless thinking I'd never land another job, too late to switch careers, etc. But the funny thing is, with a little time and a little effort, it all changes.\n\nI hope this sheds a little light. If I had to make the choice again, I'd choose the same thing.",
