  "text": "Hi all, first time making a post here so apologies if I get something wrong. \n\nI\u2019m (24F) currently working as an SAP consultant. I\u2019ve got an overall work experience of 2.4 years, and am looking to go for a graduate course in 2023 (by which time I will have had almost 4 years of experience). \n\nI\u2019m conflicted on whether an MEM or an MBA is the right fit for me. Long-term career goals are to pivot to managerial positions, particularly Operations Manager or Project Manager. I feel that with my current experience of working for clients on creating an enhanced and sustainable business process, I\u2019ve got a pretty good grasp on the procurement flows, the operations, and logistics behind it. Due to this, I\u2019m under the impression that an MEM with a core elective in Operations Management would be better. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure of the career prospects of an MEM degree, as opposed to an MBA. \n\nAny advice is highly appreciated.",

      "text": "MBA for marketability.\n\nYou can (usually) specialize in/focus on just about anything B related in an MBA and the impression someone gets when glancing at your CV and seeing the MBA will be \"Oh, she knows how to run things/gets the big picture, too.\"\n\nEven having studied at two of the B-school biggies in the U.S. (currently researching organizations/dynamics at Penn/Wharton), I can't recall hearing of a MEM degree.\n\nThat may just be me, of course. These are my two cents (and may be worth less ;)).",
