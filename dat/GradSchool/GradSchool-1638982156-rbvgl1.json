  "title:": "Embarrassed and Frustrated after meeting with PI",
  "text": "So, I am working on a project with my PI and another grad student. I'm sick today (possibly with COVID) so asked for the meeting to be held over zoom.....it then proceeded to become a dumpster fire. \n\nFor the project we are working in GIS, a program that I'm familiar with but have never done anything as complex as we are currently doing in before. It is known for being fairly finicky and having a steep learning curve at times. On top of that, my PI has 20 years worth of files and no meta data explaining the difference between each one and what they contain. This has lead to a lot of confusion on my end. The other grad student (in their 7th year) is familiar with what these data sets are because they have worked with the data before. So rather than explain things to me, when I don't understand my PI just says things like \"Well X can do it, but they already have so much to do. You need to take the lead on this.\"\n\nI said that I wanted to understand the broad scope of the methods we are using. Have a meeting where we sit down and talk about the whole process and the end goal. She told me that I just need to watch some youtube tutorials (but didn't have suggestions for which ones.....just go find them).\n\nWhen I asked about creating the base layer for this project, she responded with \"well we talked about that last week\" and then just started at me. Because clearly if I am asking about it now I understood it last week /s.\n\nI want to do a good job. I want to learn the skills that we need for this project. But I feel like I'm being given no support to actually learn them and am being made to feel bad and incompetent for taking time to learn. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm sick and exhausted and it's the end of the semester and I know I could learn these things if someone would actually just take the time to even vaguely point me in a direction.",

Google and youtube has taught me more about GIS than my \"mentor\".",

I try to explain to him that I am myself learning how to accomplish the things he's asking me to do, so I don't feel like I can just delegate that to someone else if I don't know how to do it.\n\nAnd I can see on his face that he's perplexed as to why I do not know how to do these things, and it's like, dude, you NEVER showed me how to do these things and I'm pretty sure it's because you are not that proficient in them. I've been learning all my shit by reading technical documentation and watching youtube videos.\n\nBut then I guess that's why he delegates things to me to delegate to someone else. And hopefully the master's student can just solve all our problems.",

      "text": "So I'm good with GIS too and here's my two cents:\n\n- layers without Metadata is poor management skills, that's not on you. \n\n- if your advisor isn't willing to share where they're getting their basemap, i can see why their other student is in their 7th year\n\n- Even after 2 solid courses in GIS (that targeted my field and weren't general GIS courses), it still took me a lot of start-up time to get things sorted out. That's the nature of this kind of system where everything changes for the project\n\n- your ally will be that other student, and you will be an ally for that other student (see if you can help them graduate because what you learn from them while you're helping may be invaluable)\n\n- see if you can take a course where your secret mission is that the professor helps you \"fix\" the data you have from your advisor. Don't tell them, but usually I use research data in class projects to help myself with research\n\n- when all else fails, forum users from ESRI (or QGIS or whatever) will be your new friend group for a while",

          "text": "Thank you, this made me feel a lot better. I've taken one GIS class that was just a general course, the rest has been me and the other grad student working together or looking up tutorials. Unfortunately, the professor that normally teaches a Landscape Ecology class (which would cover the type of analysis I want to do) has stopped teaching the class. So this will be an uphill battle, but at least I know it's not just me.",

      "text": "Wow, it definitely looks like your PI wants independent students that figure it out somehow. Then, it is not surprising why the other grad is doing 7 years there. Honestly, I do not support that because PIs are paid for supervision! It is considered in their hours that they have to spend time and explain the research at least first year. Later, of course, they can rely on your own thinking and etc, BUT it is not good what your PI is doing. What I would do is to talk to PI in the way that I need her assistance - just to explain the topic and the methods, recommend papers (not youtube videos) where people are using those methods and techniques. And if your PI is super busy, well there should be a postdoc or senior scientist who can explain (also not another PhD student as they are super stressed and probably will be annoyed). It is your right to ask and request her supervision. If that will not work, I would contact grad school.",
