  "text": "The people I'm working for told me they just need to check a box to give me a position, and I need a masters degree.\n\nI need to get a \"masters degree\" as quickly as possible, and it doesn't matter in what. I don't care if it's in a masters in the fine art of chicken-pot-pie manufacturing from the online university of Zimbabwe. I just need a masters degree with some sort of transcript I can send. I will never broadcast that I have this degree to anyone ever, except in this one specific situation where as explained to me, it doesn't matter at all where or how I obtain said degree.\n\nAny international diploma mills I can pay my way through as quickly as possible? Or an online school with pass fail classes I can click through quickly?\n\nThank you",
