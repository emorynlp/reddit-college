If you've done everything according to the proper procedure and your orders are still denied, then start cc'ing your PI on all emails when the research associate, especially ones asking for clarification on why your orders were cancelled.",

My coworkers have had absolutely no problems so it's very clear he's upset with me. I've tried to talk to the research associate privately but he usually walks away from me and tells me he doesn't understand me.",
