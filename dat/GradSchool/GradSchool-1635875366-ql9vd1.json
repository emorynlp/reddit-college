  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am new to the schooling system in USA. I got a 4.0 GPA in my first semester (9 credits) and this semester I am taking 12 credits in total out of which I am failing 8 credits. The 8 credits account for 2 classes. I will have a 3.5-4.0 GPA next semester. What will be my cumulative GPA at the end of next semester?",

You also might want to talk to your advisor- your university should have a way to calculate/estimate GPA.
