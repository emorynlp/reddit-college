  "title:": "Advice for choosing preferred TA assignments?",
  "text": "I am a first-year PhD student and I start working as a TA in the spring. I received the following email my department's Associate Chair of Administration today:\n\n>Do you have a preference for a particular type of assignment? Most TAs will work in the introductory labs or as graders for more advanced classes, and most will participate in grading exams for the larger intro courses. There may also be 1-2 positions as a recitation or help session instructor.\n\nI was wondering if y'all have any advice on which assignments to choose. What are the pros and cons? What factors should I consider?",

      "text": "I think it's worth trying to talk to students further along in your program about this, since they may have more specific advice!\n\nIn my program, every term I get to rank my choices for which classes I want to be a TA for. Some things I consider:\n\n\\- Is it a professor I know and enjoy working with?\n\n\\- Is it a professor I want to get to know better and build a relationship with?\n\n\\- Is it course material I'm strong in or want to get stronger in?\n\n\\- Is it something I want to be able to teach in the future, either because I love the subject or because it's an intro class that will be more in demand?\n\nIt sounds like the \"menu of options\" you have here might be a bit different, more about different kinds of work than different kinds of courses.\n\nYou probably need to think more about which of these tasks sounds easier to you, more enjoyable to you, like better professional development for what you want to do in the future.",

      "text": "I've been running recitations for the past 3 semesters and I've been finding it very rewarding. You learn a lot by being in the classroom with students (what they find interesting, what kinds of questions work to get discussions going, what level to pitch explanations at, etc.). I'm confident that I could easily design and teach my own course on the material that I've been covering as a TA and I'm sure this will help me later on.",

      "text": "I just finished a semester as a recitation TA. It was a big learning curve for me but I felt like I learned a lot. I was in a position where I had to come up with practice problems to lead a sophomore class through once a week. Overall it was less time consuming than my TA grading semester (which was \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80). I also learned a lot from grading too, but wasn't prepared for how time consuming it can be and it was just a much different experience. Honestly there are pros and cons to both, but I did more enjoy getting to interact with students and get a sort of teaching experience!",
