  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo for a little bit of context:\n\nI am currently a Junior at Boston University studying Computer Science (6 semesters left translates to a 5th year senior).\n\nI was previously studying Mathematics at Binghamton University (SUNY) (3 Semesters left), however changed due to not being accepted into their CS program.\n\nBoth schools cost virtually the same for me (Need-Based).\n\nI recently received word from them that they would allow me to do a CS minor, and take the necessary classes for grad school transition, if I required those classes, as long as I transferred back. I was also part of a program at Binghamton University that would provide me with partial tuition assistance at any SUNY graduate program if chose to study there, which I plan on doing so at Stonybrook University if I choose to go back and of course if I am accepted to Stonybrook's MSCS program.\n\nI guess my question is in the case that I chose to apply to graduate programs outside of NYS (SUNY), would grad-schools care whether I got my undergrad degree from Boston University or Binghamton University? Specifically, schools like UIUC, UCLA, UCB, etc. \n\nAnd also is a program such as GOP rare, as in do Grad Schools offer need-based aid for Masters programs?\n\nThank you so much everyone!",
