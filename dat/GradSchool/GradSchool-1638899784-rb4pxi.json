  "text": "I'm going to the UK (to Oxford or LSE) for an LLB. Could I go to a uni in the US or Canada (for the relative ease of immigration haha, I'm an Indian national) afterward for a non-law degree in STEM, or is an LLB not a sufficient undergrad degree?\n\nI'm having some major regrets with my chosen major and love STEM!",

I would look into scholarships and whatnot as well since you'd be paying international student tuition / housing, etc. Everything varies from province to province but some scholarships/loans are not available to international students, etc.",
