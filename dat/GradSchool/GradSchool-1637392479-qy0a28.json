Question is, will my chances be better to get accepted later on when I have experience and other stuff? Or is it the same if I apply now with only my grades as the main source of the application?",

                      "text": "you never really go to school for 'behavioral economics' as a whole. Thats what a BS is for. Graduate programs are incredibly niche and directed into specific aspects of their field. For example, my field is Geophysics. Within geophysics there are broad field descriptions like 'Electromagnetic methods' 'Seismology' 'remote sensing' and such.\n\nLets say you want to do seismology. Ok. what part of seismology? Earthquake monitoring and hazards? Passive or active source imaging? teleseisms and lower core imaging? machine learning methods for detecting earthquakes? Earthquake rupture dynamics?  \n\nNo university has every one of these specialities, and a surprising amount of mid-tier universities have professors that are the top person in their sub fields.\n\nApplying for grad school doesn't require you to have these in mind, but you stand your absolute best chance of getting in and using your degree if you know what specific research topic you want to specialize in. Although its kind of a chicken and the egg problem, My advice is to know this beforehand, then look for professors that study the same problem you do.",

      "text": "It depends on your course of study and what you decide to do in your time away from school. For example, if you wanted to get a physics PhD but took a year or two off, and in that time did research or worked in your field as a teacher or related industry work, then your application would be enhanced. So if you have a similar situation or plan for your time off before you apply for your masters, then you may have a better chance. However, do keep in contact with the professors/other people that you want letters of recommendation from, because as more time passes, they might not be able to write as strong of a letter for you. It\u2019s difficult to say for certain what time away from academia will do because it\u2019s so different for each person, and even then you never know what will be with admissions. Hope this answered your question though!",

Your odds will likely improve.\n\nBut keep in mind that the top grad schools for any discipline get the best applicants who are often superlative at everything they've done. And the programs get to pick and choose among them.\n\nSo given that your grades are not that great, you might also want to apply to some backup programs where you stand a better chance of getting in.",

I realize you\u2019re using it as short hand for \u201ctop-tier academic programs,\u201d but I just bring it up so you don\u2019t limit yourself. Harvard, Princeton, and Yale are pretty much top-10 at everything, but there\u2019s lots of schools not in the Ivy League that are higher ranked in specific programs. I probably say that because that\u2019s my school, not an Ivy but definitely wishes it was lol, the administration here definitely has Ivy League envy.\n\nSecond, yes, all things being equal, solid work experience will help your admissions chances. Not just any work though make sure it\u2019s something relative to your field. So if you\u2019re wanting to study econ, maybe look for think-tank jobs, government jobs that will be somewhat econ related, or any research jobs.",
