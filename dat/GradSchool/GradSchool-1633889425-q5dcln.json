  "title:": "Anxiety Induced Insomnia and Generally Not Having a Good Time",
  "text": "1st year PhD student who just graduated from undergrad in June. I was so burnt out from taking classes during the pandemic and doing remote research when I finished undergrad, but I figured that the research I\u2019d be doing in my PhD program would reinvigorate me to keep going (I also had some teaching experience in undergrad that I really enjoyed, so I wanted to pursue that as a career path).\n\nHowever, taking 3 classes and 3 seminars is slowly eating away at my soul. One class in particular is causing my anxiety induced insomnia. This typically used to happen to me in undergrad when I was nervous about an exam and would only last a max of three days. But now that I\u2019m in grad school and a B- is considered a failing grade, every day is extremely anxiety inducing. I\u2019ve gone up to five days without sleeping.\n\nBecause of my anxiety (I haven\u2019t officially been diagnosed, but I need to start using my university\u2019s mental health resources) and the lack of sleep I\u2019ve been experiencing, I\u2019ve been completely and utterly useless over the past month. I can\u2019t focus on my research because of this course. I just took an midterm exam in the said course causing the anxiety, and I absolutely bombed it (however upon looking over it, the TA left so really snarky comments on my midterm and was super harsh. regrades open up tomorrow and I will try and get some points back/escalate the issue with the professor).\n\nI wanted to do a PhD to do research on the stuff I\u2019m interested in, not lose sleep over these courses and go through another round of academic hazing. In the past, I\u2019ve spoken to older students who have said they\u2019ve gotten a C+ and B- and been okay. But the 2nd years that were in the same course that I am got a B- and we\u2019re forced to retake the course. I personally do not think I am strong enough to stay in this program if I have to retake the course. They say that our research should be the focus and not the coursework, but this obviously is not the case.\n\nIt\u2019s to the point where I think about dropping out frequently because every day is miserable. I just want a good nights sleep and I\u2019m so so tired. I start every day shaking like a Chihuahua because I\u2019m so anxious. Any advice is appreciated on what I should do \u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "Can you go see a doctor? I was experiencing insomnia earlier this year, it was starting to get pretty rough. I\u2019m not exactly sure why it happened, I was a little anxious about some things related to grad school at the time but nothing too terrible. Anyway, I went and saw a doctor and they prescribed me some medication to help me sleep. Something like that may not help with your anxiety much but at least you\u2019d be getting more sleep which could help you out a lot",

      "text": "Sustained release Melatonin is over the counter in the vitamin section. It may help a little or a lot for the insomnia depending on the person while you work on other things. Unlike most sleeping pills it is not addictive. Other people find Benadryl helpful. If it is legal, indica strain THC with a sublingual oil for longer action (around 8 hours).\n\nFor daytime anxiety CBD oil may help while waiting on therapy or other treatments.",
