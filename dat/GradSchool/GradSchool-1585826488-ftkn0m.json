  "text": "After being rejected from the national ones I applied to, I finally received notification that I won my university's dissertation completion fellowship. I'm in the humanities in a metropolitan area heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This fellowship will provide so much freedom for me and my family. And, let's face it, will provide me with much needed time and head space to re-imagine my  career options and retool if necessary, as there is likely to be no academic job market next year (perhaps even for several years).",

          "text": "In the humanities postdocs are becoming more common but still not as ubiquitous as in STEM fields. Even then, a lot of schools are starting to implement blanket hiring freezes, and I don't see why that wouldn't extend for the whole next fiscal year, as they will have to make up for budget shortfalls happening now over the next several years. There may be more postdoc positions advertised than TT positions, but I would still expect to see a big decrease.",

I'd like to get a job at a teaching  college, but it looks like that's not going to happen now. Part of the terms of this fellowship is that I have to defend my dissertation; if I don't, I won't get any more funding from my university. I can't weather the storm in grad school for a few more years, and I'm not willing to spend years on the market stringing together short term appointments, for the sake of my family. So unless I throw a successful Hail Mary, I'm going to have to leave academia soon.",

So in a pre-coronavirus would I would be anticipating lots of options besides traditional academic, research-focused tracks. All of that's up in the air now, but if things calm back down, at least, I'm hopeful that I'll have some way to find interesting work without having to scrape the bottom of the barrel.",
