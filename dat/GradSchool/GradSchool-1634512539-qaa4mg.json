  "title:": "What is a \"Grades 1-4 Referee\" in an academic job application?",
  "text": "This a question for anyone familiar with the UK educational system (or perhaps more broadly). I am an American grad student taking a shot at applying to an academic position in the UK, and part of the application has a section for uploading contact information for such referees. What is a Grades 1-4 Referee? I can only upload a max of two sets of information, so I have no idea what 1-4 means. Is this just a normal reference letter? I have no one in my immediate sphere familiar with the UK system to explain it to me simply, i.e. to put it into American-academic terms.\n\nFor what its worth, this is to apply to a Grade 7 Lecturership, if that is at all informative.",
