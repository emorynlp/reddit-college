  "title:": "How important is grammar for reference writers of the NSF-GRFP",
  "text": "One of my reference writers is an industry scientist (has a PhD from prestigious university, published many papers, etc.) I've done research with them in the past, and they're a genuinely great life mentor. However they are Russian and their English isn't super great. Should I offer to re-write their letter? Or does it not really matter, as the NSF will see past slight grammar mistakes.",
