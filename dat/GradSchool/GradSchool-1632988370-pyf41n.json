  "text": "I used to be a morning person, but since I entered grad school, I have basically turned into a night owl. I can't concentrate during the day--I get so distracted by noises and cars driving by and my upstairs neighbors at my busy apartment complex. I will have probably 2 \"squirrel!\" moments per minute.\n\nI've tried white noise apps, shutting all my blinds, noise-canceling headphones, you name it. I have now gotten to where I get the bulk of my heavy-duty reading and writing done between 10pm and 3am or later when it's completely silent and still. 5-hr Energy is keeping me going, but I don't know how long I can keep this up. Any advice?\n\n\\*Edit: it's unsustainable because I'll be the teacher of record for 8am classes next semester. ",

The key for myself is basically not to let it get out of control, ie don\u2019t let myself stay up later and later all the time, because then I get in a terrible cycle. I have responsibilities during regular working hours in my lab so I make sure I always get some sleep. But like others have said, I think it\u2019s fine to take advantage of when you feel most focused and productive. For me, that 3 hours at night is way more productive than 4-5 hours in my office during the day, so it\u2019s worth it!",

They are reusable soft silicon and they are comfortable enough to sleep in, unlike traditional earplugs that you have to insert into the ear canal. They don't stop all noise but muffles it enough that it doesn't break my concentration. I was having similar concentration problems in my apartment and these helped a lot, both with daytime noise (dogs barking outside, upstairs neighbor stomping around) and with sleep (aforementioned neighbor somehow also stomping all night). Good luck",

I'm the same way, personally -- any spiky noise in my surrounding environment utterly destroys my ability to hold onto a line of thought. Some possible solutions:\n\n1) earplugs *under* your ANC headphones. Let's you turn up the white noise more with a smaller risk of hearing damage. Also, I personally find brown noise to be a more effective filter than white, but ymmv.\n\n2) taking your setup on the road -- if you have a laptop, a cellphone that can be converted to a hotspot, a few high capacity portable batteries, and maybe a portable external monitor or two (can get them for ~$100 pretty easily), can you mosey on over to a quiet corner of a public park and work there?\n\n3) you can try supplementing with nicotine in addition to caffeine, which supposedly helps more with sensory gating stuff. I know people who don't have these issues who will cycle it as part of their nootropic stack, alternating nicotine & caffeine to prevent building too strong a tolerance to either",

Very crappy construction, no soundproofed windows, etc. Depending on the particular apartment and the neighborhood in general, this could be outright terrible. If every second car driving by is blasting music, there is no way you can concentrate. Same thing applies to hearing footsteps, TV or music from upstairs neighbors. Some aforementioned measures help, but it's not comfortable to wear headphones at all times, and you begin wondering why you should even tolerate this.\n\nIf that's the case, the only reliable measure is moving to a better place and, most importantly, to an apartment on the last floor, preferably somewhere in a corner building with as few adjacent apartments as possible. That's what I did, and it completely solved the noise issues. It's still not perfectly quite, but I don't mind hearing the birds chirping.",

I have similar issues with noises easily distracting me. As a musician, you're trained to listen for sounds and to distinguish one sound from another (e.g. be able to focus your attention on the first violins while the whole orchestra is playing). It's completely understandable that you have a hard time concentrating on tasks while your brain is especially 'wired' to listen for sounds! For me, I can't focus while I'm listening to any songs I've played in orchestra since my brain is trying to follow the music. \n\nMight be a longshot, but you could try asking other musicians if they have this same problem and how they deal with it.",

My only advice on that is to try to find the environments that work, like libraries :(\n\nAs for sleep/timing: I used to have the same issue. Never found an easy way to change it, and it eventually started getting sabotaged by other life obligations. I've somewhat fixed it now by realizing that if I can actually get out of bed, I'm also productive in the early mornings--it's just afternoons that were the worst. Getting out of bed is tough though; I can only do it because my partner goes to bed and wakes up super early, so now I do too.",

Lol)\n\nI have a few thoughts/suggestions:\n\n1. [These earmuffs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000I7NX5E/ref=ppx_yo_mob_b_inactive_ship_o0_img) are amazing!! I have ADHD and have used them for years when I need to drown out my surroundings. When I'm wearing them I can only hear really muffled sounds and I love it.\n\nI teach math and I have three pairs at school for anyone who wants to use them during a test. Everyone who uses them always comes early for subsequent tests, to make sure someone else doesn't get dibs first. They're THAT awesome!\n\n2. I have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome where my body just doesn't shut down until like 2 a.m. I teach at 9:00 three days a week and it sucks but I'm doing okay so far this semester. Those days I usually get around 6 hours of sleep before those days, which is not enough but I can at least get by.\n\nI will say that it is really nice to be up and around when the sun is out, so that's a plus, and thinking about that motivates me to try to get to bed earlier. Plus I teach all over campus this semester so I'm physically exhausted most of the time, which makes it easier to fall asleep.\n\n3. I would definitely ask your doctor about trying ADHD meds unless you've never had problems before. Some typical signs of ADHD are:\n\n* inability to concentrate when there are distractions\n* sometimes getting so caught up in something that people can talk to you and you're not aware of it until they get in your space\n* often waiting until the last minute to do homework and/or papers\n* having a hard time knowing where to start on large projects\n* interrupting people in conversations / blurting out\n* starting hobby projects but rarely finishing them\n* I had \"not working up to potential\" on every report card because I would only do my homework like half of the time. I wanted to do it, but I would sit there sometimes and just not do it.\n* etc.\n\n4. As a last resort, you could try shifting your schedule so your daytime responsibilities become the last thing in your \"day.\" I don't know if you'd be able to schedule all of your observations in the morning but if you could then you could be asleep by like 1 or 2 p.m. and then get up for the \"day\" at 10 or 11 p.m.\n\n5. I will suggest that whatever schedule you settle on that you stick with it. I do best when I go to bed and get up within a 90-minute window on either end. A few years ago I was doing great with going to sleep at 11 and getting up between 7 and 8 a.m., and then I stayed up later one night because we were at a party and I was never able to get the magic back again. :-(\n\nGood luck--I hope you can figure something out that works!!",
