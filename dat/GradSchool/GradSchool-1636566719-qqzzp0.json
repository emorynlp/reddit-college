  "text": "Hi everyone. I am a 3rd year undergrad at a Canadian university and my goal is to get into a top tier US Masters program in geography when I graduate. I want to know if anyone has advice on what I can do to increase my chances of getting accepted. I am doing alright in school (cGPA of 3.93) and I am currently in a placement at a GIS lab at my university where I will become a research assistant. But this is my first ever experience in research which I think might be a disadvantage compared to other more experienced applicants?",
